The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on the CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations' section. [Operator Instructions]. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Mr. DV Rao, Vice President and Treasurer, Financial Planning, Investor Relations ","Venkat Dhenuvakonda Rao","Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. With me are John Russell, President and Chief Executive Officer; Patti Poppe, Senior Vice President of Distribution Operations, Engineering and Transmission and Incoming CEO and Tom Webb, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer This presentation contains forward looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures.","Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and also posted in our website. Now let me turn the call over to John.","John Russell","Thanks DV. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us on our first quarter earnings call. I will begin the presentation with a review of our first quarter and operating performances before turning the call over to Patti to discuss our capital investment plan and cost reduction initiatives. Then, Tom will provide the financial results and outlook and we will close with Q&A.","First quarter earnings were $0.59 per share down $0.14 from a year ago. Weather was the primary factor. The mild weather that began last October continued through March resulting in the second warmest winter on record. On a weather normalized basis first quarter earnings were up $0.12 or 20% compared to last year and as you would expect we've already taken steps to mitigate the unfavorable weather impacts. That in time we will talk more about our plans later.","But today we are reaffirming our full-year earnings guidance of a $1.99 to $2.02 a share. Earlier this month we retired seven coal plants totaling 950MW bringing our capacity mix to less than 25% coal, our regular and routine rate case strategy remains on track. Last week the commission approved a gas rate case settlement for $40 million, using the previously approved return on equity when required.","We filed an electric rate case the 1st of March for $225 million and plan to self-implement later this year. We continue to operate with a constructive energy law, the framework allows for fair and timely regulatory treatment. If the law is updated we see this as being incrementally positive to our customers.","With the recent coal plant closures we are proud of the fact that we have reduced the most coal capacity of any investor owned utility. The gas-fired Jackson generating station and new wind farms have been added to our portfolio making our capacity mix more sustainable.","Additionally, we continue to offer energy efficiency programs which reduced demand 1% annually. This strategy puts us in a good position to meet future carbon reduction requirements and as I always enjoy saying the air is cleaner today in Michigan than it's ever been in my lifetime. Our regulatory track record is among the best in the nation. Over the last five years we have filed gas and electric cases to recover capital investments and pass along O&M savings to our customers. This has been the foundation of our sustainable business model for the past decade.","In some years ago our O&M reductions fully offset our capital investment needs and we were able to avoid three rate cases. During this time the ROE has remained unchanged at a competitive 10.3% for gas and electric. The latest gas rate case was the fourth consecutive one that we have settled dating back to 2011. The current energy law in Michigan is working well. It allows us to execute our business plan while making needed infrastructure investments and providing energy savings programs to our customers. However, the law still requires that 99.98% of our customers subsidize about 300 large customers. This is simply not fair. We believe that updates to the law would be beneficial to our customers by securing reliable capacity and reducing rates.","This is an opportunity for our legislatures and we will work with them on constructive updates. Whether or not the legislators decide to act we will continue our plan with the current law in place and move to 6% to 8% earnings growth for 2017 and beyond.","There are many external factors that can affect our operational and financial results but we work through everything and work with everyone. We remain focused on delivering the consistent and predictable results that you have come to expect. It has been an honor and a privilege for me to lead the team that has delivered these results over the past six years.","I believe the company is better today than it has ever been both financially and operationally with a very bright future.","Now, let me turn the call over to Patti who will lead the execution of our model.","Patti Poppe","Thank you, John and especially thank you for your leadership and your contribution to our company over your entire career. CMS Energy is definitely better than when you took the helm as CEO and President and if I do my math correctly we're talking about $8 billion better under your watch proof positive that you walk the talk and follow your motto to leave a better than you found it.","John Russell","Thank you.","Patti Poppe","One of the reasons that we are all optimistic that we will continue to get better is our capital investment in our gas and electric utility. As we said over the next 10 years we plan to invest $17 billion and that is a 60% increase over what we invested in the prior years. Each project is screened to ensure that will in fact add customer value. The customer value takes a form of customer service, reducing costs, enhancing our productivity, enabling cleaner energy, all of these improvements drive customer value and in fact many of the investments provide improvements in several of these categories.","For examples, our customers benefit with fewer and shorter outages when we make our investment in our electric infrastructure. That not only improves the customer experience but reduces costs. Our customers benefit when they can move into the college apartments hook up to consumers energy service online on their mobile phone and never speak to a customer service rep and because of our smart energy and smart meter investment we can remotely turn on their power. No truck role [ph] required .","This not only improves the customer experience end to end but fundamentally reduces the structural cost to do so. Our Smart Energy program is a great example of a major capital investment that has ongoing benefits to customers on both the service and the cost side of the equation. Other cost savings are driven by proactively investing in replacement of legacy gas service lines so that we can prevent an unscheduled maintenance expense and customer disruption.","Our gas compression upgrades and the use of field technology allow for a more productive workforce and less unplanned expense. And with our ongoing transition from coal to gas and our increasing renewable energy investments we demonstrate to our customers every day that CMS Energy is in fact a great steward of our Great Lake state.","Now you all know this model has been working for a long time, it has delivered results for more than a decade and the approach continues now and into years to come with our extensive inventory of our self-funded organic capital investment projects and really importantly offset by an abundant cost reduction opportunities. In a diverse economy you can see why it works especially with the continued focus on our cost reductions which I will talk a little bit more about.","We have been a leader in this area and each year we come up with new and innovative ways to deliver those savings to our customers. For investors that means we are able to create CapEx headroom and at the same time fulfill our internal commitment to keep those base rate increases below inflation.","Cost reductions have been and continue to be an important part of our self-funded model that we don't cherry pick this when we put all the numbers together. We take the bad with the good, we don't adjust for inflation or things out of our control and in the past several years our focus has delivered an average of 3% savings and we have a plan, a well-articulated plan to execute another 6% in savings over the next two years. I'll give you a little more detail on that.","In fact I'm often asked if we can continue our performance and this is how I see it. When we look at our total O&M cost per customer we look great and in fact we\u2019re among the best of all utilities but when I dig deep and look into our distribution numbers we can see that we are still only in the third quartile. So for both electric and gas distribution there is more room. And in fact when they make up a third of our total O&M expense we know there's more opportunity there. For example when we go to a job site only 70% of the time do we build that job per plan. That means that the raw materials was probably ordered maybe too much, maybe too little. The right equipment may not be available and the right crew makeup may cause a delay.","We can eliminate that waste and reduce expense by proving our first time quality and standardization. More broadly we\u2019re embarking on a companywide improvement effort and each day real savings are materializing. This approach to our first time quality is a value creation mechanism that enables for us continued cost reductions and at the same time deliver our 6% to 8% EPS growth in 2017 and beyond and at the same time improve our customer experience and keep it affordable.","As I look around I see opportunities throughout the whole company. We have an established track record upon which we can build new and innovative ways to serve our customers at lower structural cost and I'm both realistic and enthusiastic about what the future holds for CMS.","Now let me turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Webb","Thanks, Patti. Thank you everybody for joining us today on this very busy day. This is my 54th quarterly CMS earnings call and as usual no surprises. Our first quarter earnings are down $0.14 reflecting the cold winter last year and mild weather this year. On a weather normalized basis 2016 earnings are up $0.12 or 20%. Weather normalized all operations the gas utility electric utility, enterprises interest and other were at or all favorable to plan in 2015. You can see the unfavorable comparison of 2016 to 2015 weather on this waterfall chart.","Our operations are performing well better than planned which offsets the weather in the first quarter of 2016. For the nine months ago if we experience just normal weather we will be $0.16 ahead of 2015 and that\u2019s when milder conditions existed.","Cost reductions already under way keep us right on track for 5% to 7% earnings-per-share growth. Here is how the earnings-per-share forecast curve looked last year. We were able to reinvest $38 million into the business for our customers because cost reductions were better than planned and the 2014-2015 winter was cold. Towards the end of year the warm winter of 2015-2016 began but we fully offset delivering our 13th year of consistent EPS growth at 7%.","This slide adds our forecast of EPS growth for 2016, as mentioned adverse weather in 2016 has been offset fully. The winter of 2015 to 2016 was the second warmest ever not even this however dense our ability to deliver 5% to 7% growth without any customer compromises.","For example, we were able to enhance cost reductions including normal changes that come with mild weather like lower uncollectible accounts because customer bills are actually lower. In late December with 2015 cash flow better than expected we made a pension contribution improving profit two pennies for 2016. While the improvement program similar to the capitalization of [indiscernible] harding work are $0.03 better than planned. We also adopted a new approach for applying the interest rates to determine the interest cost on pension and healthcare obligations. This was worth a nickel.","This new approach was permitted by a favorable SEC interpretation of a proposal by AT&T just last year. The use of this PBO weighted application of interest rates reduces volatility and it improved earnings in 2016. Each year of pension obligations is actually discounted by its yield curve rate as though it had its own pension plan.","Instead of the conventional approach of waiting all years by the same average interest rate as shown in orange on the slide, this new approach shown in green reduces the cost of interest in the near end year's partly offset by higher cost in far out years.","For a defined benefits program like ours one that we closed about 10 years ago the advantage has heightened and our volatile is reduced. We're big fans of lower volatility at CMS. This new approach produced and earnings improvement of a nickel a share in 2016 which helped to offset the abnormal weather. Here is a look at our EPS curve for the last couple years. You can see every year is different but we have always delivered 7% EPS growth by managing the business on behalf of customers and investors.","Over the last three years, we reinvested $238 million into customer improvements. Half from favorable weather and half from higher than planned cost savings. Yes, that\u2019s worth repeating. We reinvested in O&M $238 million for our customers and we delivered 7% earnings growth. Most of you are aware of the recent one-year MISO capacity auction for Zone 7. Capacity cost were $2.19 a kilowatt month which is about a quarter of the cost of building new capacity. This however had little direct impact on our business -- Tesla in the garage the Dearborn Industrial Generation facility.","Most of our 2017 contracts are bilateral and were in place before the auction. New contracts completed by March added $50 million to our profitability for 2017 increasing big profit to $35 million, a nice lift towards the 6% to 8% growth guidance for 2017. We still have outside opportunities including 25% of the big energy and 50% to 90% of capacity depending on the year still available for 2018 and beyond.","The MISO capacity auction results were close to being a $1 or more higher incentivizing bilateral customers to pay a bit more to reduce their risk. This could add $20 million to $40 million of profit in the future. As you can see on our sensitivity table that we provide each quarter risk are not large and mitigation to minimize our exposure continues to be robust.","Last month, Fitch upgraded the utility rating two notches and the parent rating a notch. Moody's put the utility and the parent on a positive outlook, it's nice to see the agencies recognizing our balance sheet and business model strength.","For the year, we are at or above all of our financial targets. From investments to cash flow to customer prices, the dividend and EPS growth we expect strong performance again this year. Our business model continues to work well, self-funding most of our capital investments for customers leaving rate increases at or below the level of inflation. This model is focused on decisions that benefit customers and investors.","This permits performance that is sustainable continuing our track record of consistent high end results for nearly 15 years. Patti and I look forward to continuing this track record together and John it's a pleasure to have done six years of these calls with the best CEO in the business.","John Russell","Thank you.","Tom Webb","Thank you for being a good friend.","John Russell","Thank you.","Tom Webb","So let's take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Paul Ridzon","I just had a quick question with the legislation having been introduced into the Senate, is there any read through that maybe some common ground has been found with the Chamber of Commerce and the schools?","John Russell","The fact that it's been introduced I think it's a positive. I think you know there's been discussion going on with the schools and the chamber about supporting this bill or the ones from the house. The bills that came out for everybody to know their bill is introduced. I just set the groundwork the bills were introduced, two of them substitute bills in the Senate, Energy Committee yesterday and they refocused on the things we talked about before. Senator [indiscernible] had to do with retail open access, 10% cap stays but the suppliers need to have firm forward capacity in Michigan and any further new ROA customer would have to pay a capacity charge. So we think that even though it would be nice to get to a fully regulated entity that seems to be reasonable. Part of that was integrated resource plan which is good for preapproved generation cost and regulatory there are some changes there which is good for I think everybody including us.","The chamber needs to decide what they want to do with these. At the end of the day as I said earlier it's an unfair system in Michigan that we had today were 300 customers of our 1.8 million customers benefit and our 99.98% of the customers pay 3% to 4% more on the cost to subsidize these other customers. So I think what [indiscernible] is doing is the right thing but let's get the senate bill out, get it through the senate and try to get as much support as we possibly can.","As far as the schools are concerned the same thing, few schools take choice, most of them don't. At the end of the day they pay more, at chamber few of their customers take choice, most of them don't, they pay more. So I hope both of those organizations will be on the right side of this.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates. Your line is open.","Paul Patterson","I also just wanted to sort of touch base on the legislation. When you have a bunch of people who are subsidized often they can be pretty effective in blocking things and the legislation hasn't been going as quickly as you might have expected earlier. And I'm just wondering any sense about that? I mean you did sort of address it with Paul Ridzon just now but I mean how do you guys feel about it's chances of passing I guess at this point?","John Russell","You raise a great point about those that haven't want to continue it and again if I was subsidized I would want to continue it to, so that has been the battle. The issue is that it's just not fair to our customers. And as we shut down seven coal plants and there was other plant closed in Michigan you see the results of the MISO auction that Tom talked about, it's beginning to show that we may have capacity tightening up and if we do that means that new supply along with energy efficiency needs to be combined and moved forward.","Well in the most capital intensive industry in the world with the most volatile product in the world it's hard to make investments unless you have uncertainty and that\u2019s what the law I think the law is trying to provide and I think that\u2019s what Senator [indiscernible] primary view is reliability and certainty going forward.","Can a handicap weather is going to get through it or not? I think it will get through the senate, I'm pretty confident about that. My opinion is it's get more of a challenge in the house and that\u2019s something that we have seen before. So I don\u2019t really want to handicap it right now, if we get it I think it would be an upside but I do want to emphasize that we\u2019re not counting on any law changes to our 10 plan, not our five year plan but our 10 year plan and as Patti has taken over, she is growing the business to 6% to 8%, her and Tom, I think that\u2019s great and none of is dependent on the law changes. So if the law does change it's good for our customers and there maybe some upside to us but that really is the intent that we are focused on is what's fair for our customers and I think some of the issues that many of you will be talking about in the next few minutes in Ohio is a good indication of what should not happen here in Michigan.","Paul Patterson","And then just on the pension, what's the full-year impact I mean just the impact going forward on this $0.05 and what have you? I'm sorry to be so slow on it but I wasn\u2019t particularly clear.","John Russell","So the $0.05 is the positive impact from the change in how we calculate the interest on pension and healthcare cost. So I don't want that to sound like it's just a first quarter paper thing, that\u2019s the full-year impact. You still have other impacts and things like remember the discount rate still moves up and down so that could change things next year, it could give you little good news, little bit of bad news. The $0.05 for that change is the full-year effect. In the future we will remeasure that each year in January but what we think we have done is taken volatility out of that particular calculation but you still could have -- I'm going to go to the big side of penny or maybe two up or down but less than what we\u2019ve looked at in the past.","Paul Patterson","And then just on sales growth, weather adjusted, leap year adjusted, what was it for the quarter?","John Russell","So our sales on the quarter were flat but here is what's interesting. When you look at the weather normalized sales, we actually are showing in our reports which you can look at attached to the release that residential and commercial are down about 2%. I will tell you I actually don\u2019t believe that, I don\u2019t think we have weather adjusted year-to-year correctly. Last year the first quarter was very cold and we said our residential and commercial sales were like 2% up. Now we are comparing to that where it was really mild and we\u2019re saying 2% down. What we saw in the second quarter last year was that sort of reversed, it just said oops, your weather calculations aren't too good.","I think we probably see that in this year. I hate to dismiss data but I just don't believe that follow-off in residential and commercial will continue but I do believe if you look forward think of those as kind of flat. We are not seeing great growth there. It's the industrial side that is interesting, our industrial side was up 5% and if you take one customer out we were actually up 9% in the first quarter. So there is a lot of good news in there. The food business was up about 4% and plastic sector up about 4%, transportation up about 7%, packaging up about 10% and here's something that I really like to see several of our companies in the building sector were up a lot. Cement side was about 17% so there is a lot going on where we can see the uplift through industrial, but keep in mind we are conservative beast, we\u2019re still telling you that for the year as we go out we're looking for about 1% growth overall but I will admit the bulk of that will be on the industrial side.","Operator","Your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS. Your line is now open. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So perhaps just a quick question on that [indiscernible] there, can you comment a little bit on what you are saying in the future? Obviously we have seen some improvement in that pricing and obviously it doesn't move the needle too much.","How do you think about layering in your expectation going forward whether that\u2019s status quo or backward ratio [ph] or what have you? And then also your existing contracts and ultimately the earnings profile of our multiyear period? I will leave it there.","John Russell","Let me take those in a couple of pieces. First of all we gave you a little bit of good showing that for 2017 the layering and that\u2019s a good way to think about how these capacity contracts are being put in, a little bit more good news layered in, a little bit more good news layered in with contracts. We are not trying to grab what we think is a peak or rush to anything. We will miss the peak and we will miss the trough but the layering strategy should give us some good news. So I would say the $35 million number is pretty good for 2017 for the chart we showed you, we still have about 25% of our energy and our capacity available so there is some more upticks that could come from that.","Now go to the future. As you look at further in time we have anywhere starting in 2018 out through time and near time 50% to 90% of capacity and still 25% of energy because we have got some nice long term contracts in place on energy. I don't want to predict how much of the $20 million to $40 million upside will happen except to say because we layer in, I don't think you should expect the full $40 million. That would be getting to the replacement cost. But on the other hand, I'm not so negative as to say it will only grow by another $20 million.","So I think what we're trying to do is give you the zone somewhere in between there that we honestly believe will be achieved depending on the prices and the bilateral demand and what we are able to do as a business.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And to be explicit about your going forward expectations on where these auction results go out, what do you think of these reforms in terms of impacts on pricing?","John Russell","Nice and complicated is what they are. So what we are going to see going forward as MISO is going to be changing the seasonal auctions, they are going to be and changing to multiyear auctions and I wouldn't even fathom a guess about what that will really mean but what we can look at is the data that just occurred. That $2.19 per kilowatt month if you laid the bids down right along the demand line and you all can see this it's all public record, you can see that it stays pretty close in there.","So with a modest change of what was happening in the market on the demand side that could had easily have been $3 plus. So what that does to people that are interested in reducing their volatility, they come to businesses like the Tesla, the Ferrari or dig [ph] whatever we want to call it, they will come there looking for ways to take out volatility and pay a little higher price than the auction, those the one-year auctions at least to protect themselves from an exposure.","So I do see a little upside from that based on that and the bigger picture is, it's telling you a little bit about what John talked to. That capacity situation for Zone 7 is just not all that solid. So as changes occur in demand or in the supply side I think that you see a market that could tighten up quite a bit and it is very hard to predict but a year from now I just suspect it will probably be a tighter market on capacity. Now that\u2019s just a personal opinion. So I will leave it at that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And actually that teases pretty well into the next question. I was curious as you think about your portfolio of PPAs including some of the higher-priced PPAs, is there any ability to potentially step in a little bit earlier to try to come to some resolution on bringing down those cost for consumers by extracting yourself from some of those obligations? Specifically Palisade [ph] is what I am thinking.","John Russell","I am shocked. So there is a lot of speculation going on that subject but all I can tell you that\u2019s the sort of thing that we just don't want to comment on. So I just like to leave that open to see what happens. It's very important that the owners control that and so we don't want to do any speculation. I hope you will appreciate that.","Operator","And I'm showing there are no further questions at this time.","John Russell","All right. Let me close it out. First of all thank you for joining us today. As Tom said I know it is a very busy reporting day and this will be a quick call. Also I want to thank all of you that are on the line right now for all of your help, support and I will miss all of you as my tenure and as CEO and Patti will head up and Tom will head up the next call without me. So my thanks to all of you. It has been a great run and the company is in great hands moving forward. So thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations.","Sri Maddipati","Good morning and Happy Valentine's Day, everyone. With me are Patti Poppe, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website.","Now I will turn the call over to Patti.","Patti Poppe","Thank you, Sri and thank you everyone for joining us today. Rejji and I are excited to share our 2017 results with you and our 2018 goals. I've scrubbed all of our stories of the month and have selected our wining story of the year, which I will unveil today. Rejji will provide the financial results and an update on Federal Tax Reform and as always we look forward to your questions.","We delivered a strong performance in 2017 adding another year to our consistent track record of 7% EPS growth without reset. Operationally we manage challenging weather and storms throughout the year and financially we were able to deliver the results you have come to expect. I'm pleased to report that our adjusted EPS was $2.17 a strong 7% above the prior year which excludes the one-time non-cash effects of Federal Tax Reform.","As Rejji will discuss in more detail tax reform will have a long-term positive impact on our business model. In the near term given the significant savings provided our customers will benefit from lower rates which leads to manageable operating cash flow reductions in longer term the lower builds will provide headroom for necessary capital investments. In 2017, we continued to grow our operating cash flow well surpassing our target and yielding an FFO to debt ratio of approximately 20%, which provides plenty of cushion for the potential cash flow impacts of tax reform.","For 2018, we are raising our guidance to a range of $2.30 to $2.34 which reflects 6% to 8% annual growth from our 2017 actual EPS. We are also increasing the dividend to $1.43 per share consistent with our expected earnings growth. Longer term we are reaffirming our growth rate of 6% to 8% and we continued to be confident in our ability to deliver another year of consistent industry-leading performance. As I stated in the past, we're highly confident in 7% annual growth has demonstrated in 2017, a year where we experience atypical weather and a record level of storms in our service territory, yet we still delivered.","As we think about our guidance range for 2018, we will focus on executing our capital plans and realizing cost savings to the CE Way. Admittedly given the strength of our plan for 2018 and the reinvestments we've made in 2017, we'd be pretty disappointed if we didn't finish the year toward the high end of the range. Our commitment to people, planet and profits are tripled bottom line continues to serve us well driving a year of record setting milestones in safety, service and customer satisfaction. In fact, our safety performance was our best ever and put us number one amongst our peers. Nothing is more important and it's a great demonstration of the quality of people here at CMS that are focused and safe every single day.","We were ranked and awarded a number of third party surveys including being named the Best place to work and the Best Employer for Diversity in Michigan by Forbes Magazine and the number US utility by Sustainalytics for the second-year in a year. It's no surprise that my co-workers and I love working for such a purpose driven company that continues to demonstrate the financial performance and sustainability go hand-in-hand. Yet we're dissatisfied and committed to continuously improving our performance every day. For example, we told a year ago that we only fulfilled our customer commitments on time 9% at the time. Our goal was to reach 50% by the end of 2017, dramatic improvements.","With the utilization of the CE Way, the team was able to deliver even better than planned. I'm happy to report that we finished the year at 60% commitments made on time and yet, we still have so much work to do. Each of these remaining missed appointments is a cost both to our customer and to our [audio gap] proved customer experience and cost savings that the CE Way unlocks. I applaud my co-workers and their relentless dedication to continuously improving our performance. You can count on us to leverage the CE Way to enable our triple bottom line of serving our customer and communities, protecting and improving the planet and delivering strong and predictable financial results.","Now as you know, I've a series of stories that I call my story of the month. There is nothing like an example to bring to life the power, the consumer's energy way and its impact on our continued performance. I reviewed all of our stories last year and have selected the best of the best for my story of the year. As we shared many times, our business model is fueled by needed infrastructure investments on our aging system partially funded by cost reduction to protect customers from prices they can't afford. Our core competence of cost reduction is enabled by capital investment which often reduce O&M. our process improvement to the CE Way and effective technology deployment.","My story of the year is an example of how the whole model works. Last year, we completed the installation of our smart meters which was a multi-year capital program designed with customer benefits in mind from day one. Our smart meters have enabled a dramatic improvement in meter read rate and thereby improved billing accuracy while significantly reducing costs. When we don't read the meter rate the first time, we rely on estimated bills which are inevitably error-prone and create waste for both customer and the company. Utilizing smart meter technology and significant process improvement we've been able to reduce invoice reversals by 90% since 2013, reduced calls to our call centers and reduced truck rolls investigating perceived billing errors. As a result this has saved well over $10 million for our customers and better yet, it freed up time to solve another problem.","Customer's struggling to keep up with their bills. The very same people who were spending time correcting bills were freed up and they designed and launched a new payment program called CARE. Which enables customers to pay on time and rewards them for doing so, by reducing their arrears adjust as they go creating a new pattern of payment and household stability? We've reduced shut-offs by 30%, while at the same time reducing our uncollected accounts by $34 million or over 50%.","We were able to protect our most vulnerable customer and lower cost for everyone. We awarded our billing team our first Annual Purpose Award this year for their demonstration of world-class performance delivering hometown service. We're creating a culture of performance and celebrating our success. And 99% meter-read rate, a 90% reduction in invoice reversals and a 50% reduction in uncollected accounts was definitely worthy of celebration. True waste elimination. By making smart investments, improving our processes enabled by the CE Way and deploying technology we've substantially reduced cost. Which we will return to our customers to fuel new investments which can add even more value for them. This model works and there is lot more steam in the boiler for the future. Stay tuned for more stories to come.","We're celebrating on the run and have kicked off 2018 with gusto. Safety is always our number one priority and we aim to make this year's safety performance even better than last year's record result. We have a strong regulatory model in Michigan that is time bound, transparent, allows us to have forward-looking visibility as well as utilization of our investment recovery mechanism in gas. And as a result of the 2016 Energy Law have added an IRP filing. In parallel the Commission had ordered a five-year electric distribution plan as well. These long-term regulatory filings allow us to plan for the future, which reduces risk and provides for more predictable regulatory outcome.","As always we plan to meet all of our financial objectives for the year and Rejji will take you through those along with tax details. We will continue to drive our triple bottom line delivering the consistent world-class results for our customers and you. Our model is simple, durable and continues to deliver. The self-fund a large portion of our earnings growth. We look at our cost structure. We look at everything. O&M, fuel, PPAs, interest expense and yes, taxes. Tax reform is good for our customers and our model.","We believe tax reform will fuel the economic momentum across the country and especially right here in Michigan and we plan to be a bit part of that growth. I attended our State of the State Address in mid-January and the optimism was palpable. The Governor even bragged a little bit which is pretty uncharacteristic of Michigan's famed nerd. Governor Snyder shared that Michigan is the number one Great Lake State for inbound college educated talent. Has the sixth highest income growth in the nation and has created the most manufacturing jobs in the country. The Governor reiterated his commitment to infrastructure in Michigan. All of this is good news for our customers and CMS Energy.","As we've mentioned. We have a very large and aging system because we have so much needed infrastructure investment. Our internal teams literally compete with one another for project approvals. We have a rigorous prioritization and approval process for work that significantly improves the safety of our system, the reliability of our systems and often reduces our cost, which is the trifecta for customers. We're the fourth largest gas utility in the nation in terms of miles of pipe and that system is going through a refresh overtime. With nearly 1,700 miles of large transmission pipe and 27,000 miles of distribution mains. It will take decades to replace all of it. We plan to continue to align with our regulators on the prioritization and sequence of these needed investments.","Our electric distribution system is older than our peers. Our current plan calls for focus on poles, wires and substation nothing fancy, but the basic building blocks of a resilient system. Finding mains and making every capital dollar count. We can deliver more value for customers and enable the long-term delivery of our financial objective. In the latter half of our five-year distribution plan, we began to add smarter grid technology and modernization which can better optimize and utilize our infrastructure. And we're proud of the way, we self-fund these necessary infrastructure investments through our commitment to cost reductions. When we look at the total cost structure we realized the bulk of our cost are not just to operate and maintain the system. Fuel and purchase power costs are larger than O&M and these are pass-throughs than our regulatory construct here in Michigan, but they're still real expenses for our customers and add no value for our investors.","We've reduced fuel prices by shifting from colder gas generation and that saves our customers money, but there is more work to be done. Our PPAs provide a significant opportunity in the very near future to reduce cost for our customers even more and fund necessary capital investments across our system at a lower cost. As we lower total cost, we can be more attractive to companies considering Michigan for their expansion or relocation because when Michigan wins, we win. When Michigan grows, so does our business. We are actively engaged in economic development and in fact we're awarded the Deal of the Year for our work with the locating of switch data center in Grand Rapids, the heart of our electric service territory. By providing energy ready sites we work closely with our communities and policy leaders to make it easier for new businesses to expand or move to Michigan.","Last year alone we attracted 69 additional megawatts of new load and there is more fish on the hook. In addition to growth, many of our new and expanding customers are looking for help to achieve their renewable energy goal. We're partnering with those companies for success with our recently announced Green Pricing package. Yet we still plan conservatively. We only add the load to our model and our sale forecast when it has actually materialized. The proof is in the pudding. We achieved almost 2% industrial load growth in 2017.","Our regulatory calendar is on pace this year, especially with the continued implementation of the 2016 Energy Law and the new Federal Tax policy. We are working with our regulators to pass the tax savings onto our customers. We made a filing on January 19 indicating our preference which as you'd expect, is to keep it simple and apply a credit on every bill and we are waiting the MPSC's order on [indiscernible] like this credit applied.","The new Energy Law requires us to file a long-term integrated resource plan. We anticipate filing that in June. Furthermore, to meet Michigan's new 15% renewable portfolio standard we have filed a plan to build over 500 megawatts of new renewables and expect the commission order on that plan later this year. Our IRP will provide insight to our future generation mix and enable the commission to go on the record with their view of our plan. Again the regulatory construct in Michigan is transparent, directed through statue, time bound and forward-looking. Therefore provides investment certainty ahead of our actual expenditures no big bets and no surprises.","Our rate cases remain on track to deliver cost savings and service improvements to our customers, we expect an order by the end of March on our electric rate case and we're still in the gas case, but expect a constructive outcome there as well. No matter the external factors, our business model has stood the test of time in changing environments. For us to deliver the consistent strong performance you come to expect. We work closely with everyone. Without counting on the weather or other recess [ph] to EPS. Over the last 12 years, we have continued to pay a competitive dividend that has grown along with earning. When we combine the two, our earnings and dividend growth, we yield a double-digit total shareholder return. Over the past 10 years in fact, we've delivered TSR that's three times the performance of the UTY and more than twice the performance of the S&P 500. 2018 will be the 16th year of track record you've come to know and enjoy and we intend to keep it that way for many years to come.","Now I will turn the call over to Rejji.","Rejji Hayes","Thank you Patti and good morning, everyone. As always we greatly appreciate your interest in our company. As we reported earlier this morning for 2017 we delivered adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.17 which is toward the high end of our guidance and reflects at another year of 7% annual growth. Our adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter excludes $0.52 non-cash, non-recurring charge associated with Federal Tax reform. This charge is largely attributable to the remeasurement of deferred tax asset, which now reflect a reduction of the corporate federal income tax rate to 21% and 35%.","We're quite pleased with our performance for the year particular in light of the $0.15 of negative variance associated with mild temperatures and storms realized over the course of the year, which more than offset by cost savings, rate increases, net investments and outperformance at dig among other factors. As always, we take the good with the bad and manage to work accordingly to meet our operational and financial objectives, the benefit of our customers and investors.","Slide 14 best illustrates the resilience of our business model, during periods of unfavorable weather. We rely on our ability to flex operational and financial levers to meet our objectives. 2017 was no different as we experienced mild temperatures and heavy storm activity throughout most of the year and our team responded with cost performance and sound financial planning to deliver the consistent and predictable results you expect.","Similar to our past practice, we continue to reinvest in the business during periods of favorable weather or upon realization of cost reductions in access of plan. These reinvestments entail pulling ahead work such as forestry, refinancing high coupon bonds and supporting our low income customers among other opportunities. In fact over the past five years we've reinvested almost $500 million in aggregate due to favorable weather and strong cost performance. These reinvestments support our long-term goals and provide more certainty around our operational and financial objectives in the next year and for years to come.","Rounding our 2017 Slide 15 lists all of our financial targets for the year and as noted, we met or exceeded every single one of them which adds another year to our long history of delivering transparent and consistent performance.","The highlight of couple of noteworthy items in addition to achieving 7% annual EPS growth, we grew our dividend commensurately and generated over $1.7 billion of operating cash flow. Our steady cash for generation over the years continuous to fortify our balance sheet as evidenced by our strong FFO to debt ratio which had approximately 20% at yearend exceeds both the 2017 target and our historical target range of 17% to 19%. Our conservative of the balance sheet provides sufficient headroom to manage unforeseen headwinds and support strong investment grade credit ratings which enable us to fund our capital plan cost efficiently to the benefit of customers and investors.","Lastly, in accordance with our self-funding model we kept annual price increases below 2% for both the gas and electric businesses which align with our target of keeping annual price increases at or below inflation. All well investing a record level capital investment of $1.9 billion at the utility. As you've grown accustomed, we usually take this time to adjust our EPS guidance based on actual results as such you'll note on Slide 16 that we're increasing both the bottom and top end of our 2018 adjusted EPS guidance to $2.30 to $2.34 which is a $0.01 above our initial guidance during our third quarter call and imply 6% to 8% annual growth off our 2017 actual results.","As for the path to our 2018 EPS guidance range as illustrated in our waterfall chart on Slide 17. We plan for normal weather, which in this case will contribute approximately $0.16 of positive year-over-year EPS variance given the substandard weather experience in 2017, however needless to say we believe we have sufficient risk mitigation in our plan in the event the weather does not corporate. Additionally, we anticipate about $0.06 of EPS pick up associated with our pending electric and gas rate cases, net investment cost and another $0.03 from cost savings which implies a 2% year-over-year reduction in costs which we believe is highly achievable given our track record.","For our estimates, these sources of positive variance will be partially offset by select non-operating savings realized in 2017 that will either be passed onto customers through our pending cases or one-time in nature. We also have embedded the usual conservatism in our utility sales and non-utility performance forecast. Moving onto Federal tax reform like most large companies the new tax law impacts our business in a variety of ways. And as Patti mentioned, we believe tax reform will ultimately be accretive to our long-term plan.","At the utility, we filed a recommendation on January 19 to the MPSC on how to reflect the new tax law in customer rates. As part of that filing we proposed an estimated $165 million rate reduction for customers in 2018 and a separate proceeding to determine the treatment of deferred taxes. We were working closely with the Commission on this matter and though the amount and the pace at which the tax savings will be provided to customers in 2018 have yet to be determined, we believe the rate reduction could be up to 4% which clearly facilitates our self-funding strategy by creating meaningful headroom for future capital investments.","As you know, we have significant investment requirements at the utility in the form of gas and electric infrastructure upgrades, PPA replacements and renewable investments. And the estimated cost savings associated with tax reform increase the likelihood of us incorporate more projects into our capital plan over the next five to 10 years to the benefit of customers and investors.","In fact every 1% reduction in customer rates equates to approximately $400 million of incremental capital investment capacity. On the non-utility side tax reform impacts CMS in three ways. First, the new tax law establishes potential limitation on parent interest expense deductibility however we're uniquely positioned in this regard because our parent interest expense will be largely offset by the interest income generated by EnerBank, our industrial bank subsidiary. Second, our non-utility businesses would realize some upside given the lower federal income tax rate although this will not have a material impact on our consolidated earnings since those businesses are relatively small. And third as we've discussed in the past, the sum of non-utility operations produces an overall pre-tax loss due to our parent interest expense. In the past the overall loss of our non-utility operations produced a larger tax benefit at 35% tax rate than it will going forward at 21% rate. This equates to about $0.02 of EPS drag in 2018 that is already baked into our guidance and fully mitigated.","Lastly the repeal of the alternative minimum tax provides us with the opportunity to monetize our substantial AMT credits over the next four years to the tune of approximately $125 million in the first year which partially offsets the likely near term operating cash flow reduction at the utility. In summary, the effects of tax reform manageable in the near term and create long-term opportunities which provide more certainty around our operational and financial objectives.","To elaborate on the magnitude of the potential long-term opportunity. As Patti highlighted we have a robust capital investment backlog at the utility due to our large and aging electric and gas systems which has historically been executed at a measured pace given customer affordability constraint. Given the substantial rate reduction opportunity presented by tax reform in addition to the other aspects of our self-funding strategy we're forecasting a five-year capital investment program of approximately $10 billion which extends our runway for growth without comprising our annual price increase target of at or below inflation.","The expected composition of this plan will be waited toward improving our gas infrastructure as well as upgrading our electric distribution system and investing in more renewable generation. This level of investment will increase our utility rate base from approximately $15 billion from 2017 to $21 billion in 2022 which implies a 7% compound annual growth rate. This extension of our five-year capital plan will further improve the safety and reliability of our electric and gas systems, the benefit of our customers, evolve our generation portfolio to the benefit of the planet and extend the runway for EPS growth to the benefit of investors.","Beyond the next five years our capital investment needs are significant likely in excess of $50 billion in the long run. As we discussed during our investor day in September and as evidenced in the circular chart on Slide 19. As you can imagine over the next 10 years our capital plan will be greater than our previously disclosed $18 billion plan out of the amount and composition of a revised 10-year plan. Will be dictated by the analyses being performed in our upcoming long-term electric distribution and integrated resource planned filings as well as the commission decisions as to how they intend to address the new tax law. As such our longer term estimates will evolve as our regulatory filings progress.","From a liquidity perspective while tax reform alleviates the customer affordability constraint, it does create manageable headwinds in regards to operating cash flow as I alluded to earlier. As a result of the potential reduction of customer rates due to tax reform we anticipate a flat year-over-year operating cash flow trend from 2018 to 2019 at $1.65 billion but expect to resume our trend of $100 million per year increases by 2020. In aggregate we're forecasted to generate approximately $9 billion of operating cash flow over the next five years which will play a key role in the financing strategy of our five-year capital plan.","In support of our liquidity planning, we also expect to continue to avoid paying substantial federal taxes until 2022. In sum, our forecasted OCF generation coupled with our tax yield portfolio enables us to continue to finance our capital investment program in a cost efficient manner. As result of our solid cash flow generation and conservative financing strategy which includes a modest ATM equity issuance program, our credit quality has improved significantly over the past 15 years as evidenced by our strong credit metrics and numerous ratings upgrades.","We've also opportunistically refinanced high coupon bonds such as the partial redemption of our eight and three quarter senior notes at the parent in the fourth quarter which has reduced cost and mitigated refinancing risk. As of December 31, our fixed to floating ratio was approximately 95% with a weighted average bond tenure of 13 years. Which largely insulates our income statements in the prospect of rising interest rates? This prudent balance sheet management has enabled us to absorb the effects of tax reform while extending our capital plan without issuing substantial amounts of equity.","As you can see on the right-hand side of Slide 21 our FFO to debt ratio is projected to be approximately 18% by year end which includes the effects of federal tax reform and assumes no change to the size of our ATM equity issuance program in 2018. On Slide 22, we have listed our financial targets for 2018 and beyond. In short we anticipate another great year with 6% to 8% EPS growth, no big bets and robust risk mitigation. This model has and will continue to serve our customers well they realize lower gas and electric prices from our self-funding strategy which is enhanced through tax reform as well as our investors who can continue to count on consistent industry leading financial performance.","Few companies are able to deliver top end earnings growth while improving value and service for customers year after, year after, year and we're pleased to have delivered another year consistent industry leading performance in 2017 and expect to continue on this path in 2018. On Slide 23, we've refreshed our sensitivities for your modeling assumptions. As you'll note with reasonable planning assumptions and robust risk mitigation the probability of large variances from our plan are minimized. There will always be sources of volatility in this business be it weather, fuel cost, regulatory outcomes or otherwise and every year we view it as our mandate to do the warning for you and mitigate the risk accordingly.","And with that I'll hand it back to Patti for some closing remarks before Q&A.","Patti Poppe","Thank you Rejji. With our unique self-funding model enhanced by tax reform, a constructive regulatory environment and a large and aging system in need of fundamental capital investments. We feel that our investment thesis is quite compelling. Now Rocco, please open the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much Patti. [Operator Instructions] our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So perhaps just first thing on the EPS growth you guys talk now about enterprises and tax planning. I know you talked broadly about it, but how do you reconcile against this 2% addition that you throw in there in terms of self-funding and then also, can you just be a little clear about the year-by-year equity contemplated in the current plan?","Rejji Hayes","Yes, so with respect to enterprises Julien as you know that has always been kind of one of several components of the self-funding strategy and so our self-funding strategy is largely predicated on the cost cuts as well as little bit of sales growth and then a combination of tax planning unregulated or non-utility contribution and other have allowed us to get to that sort of 75% of funding of the 6% to 8% growth which again minimizes the annual rate relief request. And so enterprise has always been part of that plan as EnerBank and their contribution is relatively modest but helpful. So that's effectively how we see that one.","With respect to your second question on the equity issuance, it's historically our at-the-market equity dribble or equity issuance program was around $60 million to $70 million on a run rate basis and that's what we've been doing for some time and so foresee based on the implications of tax reform we don't see that changing in 2018 but longer term we expect the modest increase of that, to call out the tune of about $20 million to $30 million and so we think, run rate it's probably around $110 million to $115 million but not much higher than that, so we still think we can comfortably fund that within the dribble program it's well south of about 1.5% of our market cap and we think again highly digestible. Is that helpful?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Absolutely. Thank you. Perhaps turning to the CapEx side of the equation, perhaps two-fold here first. If I have this right, you increased the overall pie to $50 billion number now and just curious if there is anything to read into that, just in terms of the updates, it give you that incremental confidence now. And then secondly more specifically, as we think about this upcoming filing on the distribution front and finalizing that here. Is there anything else from a regulatory perspective you all might be looking at to improve your ability to concurrently earn on that maybe thinking of trackers here on the distribution front, but you know curious?","Patti Poppe","So on the $50 billion, I think we were pretty clear at our Investor day and we continue to be consistent in our message that our system is large and aging and so the point of the $50 billion and you'll see that it's a - at least or approximately because the size of the opportunities is well more than our customers can afford and so this constraint of customer affordability and a healthy balance sheet and our credit ratings and credit metrics is an important combination that we're always trying to work, so the issue and what we're trying to reinforce is that there is no limit to how much work needs to be done, it's all about managing our cost and making sure that we can get more value for every single dollar that we invest all across the system and so that our customers can have a better experience at a lower price and so - capital is not the - availability of capital opportunities is not the constraint and that's the point of the $50 billion.","On the distribution front, we're excited about this filing for a couple of reasons. Number one, its paints a nice five-year picture of the investment potential and strategy and results and outcomes that can be delivered from those investments. It also creates the framework for discussion with the commission. There is nothing embedded in that filing that changes the regulatory construct or modifies our approvals or implies long-term tracking mechanisms but I do think that, by having the open visibility the opportunity to have a good rich discussion with both the staff and commission about the investment priorities. We can provide more certainty to our regulatory outcomes and de-risk the financial plan in the long run.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. Thank you all.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Ali Agha of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ali Agha","First question on the electric rate case, can you just remind us how to reconcile the ALJ proposed decision to your ask? I mean just the dollar amount there's a huge difference there. How are you looking at that in the context of how that fits into your financial plan?","Patti Poppe","The ALJ is just another step in the process. It's not a file Commission order just to be clear. The Commission speaks with their orders. There's a couple big discrepancy, number one is their ROE of 9.8. we look at the most recent gas order that the Commission issued and they reiterated that 9.8 is too low and 10.1 wasn't appropriate ROE at this time and so that was not that long ago and so we feel that's a difference as well as, they had two other what I would describe as distinct differences to traditional rate making that we've been doing specifically around forecasting sales, around our energy efficiency and including them or not including them. We've always included our forecasted energy efficiency sales reductions in forward-looking rate making and so the ALJ opted to eliminate that, that was about $18 million difference as well as discount rate calculation. So there was very specific things that the ALJ pointed to that were very different than what has been traditional. So our final order is expected near the end of March and our commission is very competent and capable and they'll weigh all of the inputs and we expect a favorable outcome.","Rejji Hayes","Ali this is Rejji. The only thing I would add to Patti's good points is that, as it pertains to ROE. If you look at the fac [ph] pattern now versus where we were in not too distant past, when the commission gave the decision for the gas case at the end of July. The tenure treasury was about 2.3% and well I think we all know what has taken place since then, we've had about 55 to 60 basis points of ascension and then you've had tax reform which has taken place, which is obviously leading to inflationary pressure as well as the prospect of rates rising beyond where they are today, you couple that with what is realistic credit quality deterioration across lot of utilities in the sector and so I think in light of how the fac [ph] pattern is changed to me again. I think ROEs and where they will ultimately end up. I think it's very difficult to make a case for something below 10% at this point, but ultimately as Patti highlighted the Commission will speak through their order, so we'll see.","Ali Agha","Right and then second question, the weather normalized electric sales for the year ended up 0.4% which was below your targeted range for the year. I'm just wondering if that changes your thinking going forward. I think you've been assuming like a 1% or similar kind of growth rate for sales going forward, just wondering how the 2017 outcome impacts your forward thinking there.","Rejji Hayes","Yes, so Ali I would actually beg to differ slightly with your position, yes we talked about electric sales forecast between call 0.5% to 1% beginning of the year and that's obviously weather normalize in net of energy efficiency, but as we've said throughout 2017 we've actually been tickled pink with the mix of sales that we've seen throughout the year, so it's interesting as you look at that and 40 basis points where we ended up and peeled the onion on that some residential was roughly flat, our forecast beginning the year assumed about 1.5% decline again net of energy efficiency and weather normalized and so flat performance there was really above expectation and so that is higher margin sales as you know and so that was upside relative to plan.","And then on the commercial side that's really where we saw a quite a bit of performance there and so we're just under 1% weather normalized net of energy efficiency and our plan beginning of the year was about 1% down and so and that implies where you saw a little bit underperformance was on the industrial side, but to end the year got it just under 2% weather normalized net of energy efficiency again below our plan, but still that's a very nice mix and really suggest that we have a pretty good economic environment and pretty diversified service territory which is not nearly as cyclical as other parts of the state and so we were quite impressed with that and going forward we do not expect to see a modest degradation of that performance from a sales perspective going forward, but generally we do plan conservatively so we'll see, but again not disappointed at all with where we ended up.","Ali Agha","I see and last question, just to clarify if I heard the remarks right. As you look about your CapEx plans and factored in the headroom from tax reform. Did I hear it right the next five-year CapEx plan we should not expect any changes in terms of the amounts to that but likely the 10-year plan amounts will likely go up? Did I hear that correctly?","Rejji Hayes","No, no so just to be clear. You have a couple of things that are moving in the five-year plan. So the prior five-year plan was 17 through 21 that was $9 billion plan which presuppose about $1.8 billion per year, we've moved one-year forward, so this is now 18 to 22 plan and so this plan five years in aggregate is about $10 billion, that implies about $2 billion of spend per year, so you've seen a step up there in terms of the aggregate spend and where we have decided to err in the side conservatism is we're not in a position at this point to provide more disclosure on the 10-year plan. Now the only thing we've highlighted on the slide is that, we fully expect it to be an excess of $18 billion given that the prior 10-year plan pre-tax reform was $18 billion and so if you assume with the likely significant customer rate reductions associate with tax reform, that gives us substantial headroom to increase the capital plan to the benefit of customers and investors. So hopefully that's clear now.","Ali Agha","Yes, thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Michael Weinstein of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Michael Weinstein","I heard you mentioned the IRP is kind of the next catalyst to talk more about - expansion of the five and 10-year plan, but is the five-year distribution plan which I think is coming up, the filing is coming up in March. Is that also another point where you might see more of that $50 billion talked about?","Patti Poppe","Yes. And this really - the timing of these in parallel is really productive to have the IRP and the electric distribution plans filed within a couple months of each other. The distribution plan does not result in an order per se, financial approval, but the IRP does and so I would say the IRP provides more financial certainty but the distribution plan in concert with it does show and will demonstrate than the mix of electric spend for sure as part of that five-year $10 billion plan.","Michael Weinstein","Great that makes sense. Maybe you could just highlight a little bit of the possible upside for dig as it results of the state and liability mechanism which just was recently set?","Rejji Hayes","Michael this is Rejji. So couple things to think about there, so the charge was established in late November by the MPSC and I think they assumed about just over $300 per megawatt day for the charge that would potentially be levied to AES, is our Alternative Electric Supplier who cannot demonstrate they have requisite capacity four years forward. That translates into about $9 per kilowatt month price in the capacity market and so we assume that anything above $3 per kilowatt month is upside dig and so while we don't think that will create opportunities in the near term certainly longer term particularly if there is a local clearing requirement that's established beyond 2021. We definitely think there could be some opportunities for dig to be competitive in that environment, but certainly we haven't baked in any of that into our plan because it's too premature for that.","Michael Weinstein","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Greg Gordon","Most of my questions have been answered, but I do have one with regard to the IRP at a very high level. 15-year plan. You still have a fairly significant amount of power generation coming from coal. You also have you know Palisades and MCV PPA is expiring in the mid 2020s. So should we expect to see sort of resource plan that talks about how we're going to replace those PPAs and sort of decarbonize the remaining fleet in the context of this IRP. How aggressive a tilt towards renewable might we see given how much more economic they're becoming especially as we move out into that timeframe?","Patti Poppe","Great question Greg. Thanks for asking. The IRP plan will definitely reflect our clean and lean generation strategy that will have retirements of coal and it's actually a 20-year time horizon that you'll see, you'll see through 2040 in that plan and our decarbonization of our generation fleet will be a big thing that you'll see, the economics of renewable continues to improve and we see that as an important part of our mix going forward in addition to energy waste, reduction through peak reduction through demand response as well as our energy efficiency programs in total. So we're excited to get that IRP out in public that will really show our commitment to being a key part in sustainable energy future. We're excited. I will just make one note Greg that we have retired seven of our 12 coal units. We've retired almost a gigawatt of coal and so we're actually down dramatically in our generation fleet, with coal. And so we feel great about where we are, we've reduced our carbon intensity by 38% since 2008 levels. We definitely are leaders that's why Sustainalytics I think continues to choose us as the number one utility and Newsweek Magazine selected us one of the greenest companies. Independent of industry and the nation top 10. We're flanked by Apple and J&J in that top 10 ranking. Our commitment to carbon reduction is both in our actions and our forecasts.","Greg Gordon","Thank you, Patti.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Arnold","When I look at Slide 15 while you give the target for 2018 financial targets and then I think the greenbox is the 2017, but can you just talk about what you've assumed on tax reform in terms of the pace of refund to customers in that plan. Does that assume what you mentioned so that would be relatively quick? So is that sort of some wiggle room around that, if it comes out slightly not so quick.","Rejji Hayes","Yes, so we assumed we erred on the side of conservatism I'll say and so Jonathan for 2018, we assumed an excess of about $165 million of operating cash flow reduction. Where there is a little bit of I'll say uncertainty is around how the commission might treat deferred tax liability. So in the filing that we submitted on January 19, we highlighted that there was about $1.5 billion of deferred tax liabilities as of September 30 and we have proposed that matter should be adjudicated through separate proceeding and so as you know through normalization that could be basically returned to customers, over the life of the assets at least with the property related deferred taxes, but for the non-property it's, the new tax law is quite opaque and ambiguous around that. so it remains to be seen exactly how the rest to be returned, but to answer your question we're assuming I think something around 165 to 200 of degradation on 2018, but I could [indiscernible] once there is a decision around deferred tax is going forward.","Jonathan Arnold","And as well as in that 18% FFO to debt.","Rejji Hayes","That's exactly right and so we also have assumed as I highlighted that there is a modest countermeasure in the form of the monetization of the alternative minimum tax credits and so we have assumed that we will monetize about half of that, maybe $270 million on the sidelines and so we're getting about half of that. There's a little bit of sequestration around 7% so that equates to about $125 million. So that's a partial countermeasure and we'll do what we can do with cost reductions to offset one of that. But that's what [indiscernible].","Jonathan Arnold","I understand rightly Rejji. There's no doubt that you've got that in the lower, is that or on the AMT?","Rejji Hayes","Yes - could not be more clear about that. The only risk is if there is a government shutdown or something that's very low probability, but you never know these days.","Jonathan Arnold","All right and don't you have $500 million of deferred tax assets as well as the $1.5 billion of liability or excess?","Rejji Hayes","That's correct, so we have it was subject to impairment of course as a result of the federal tax rate going from 35% to 21% and that's the lion share of that $0.52 non-recurring charge that we stomached in the fourth quarter, but still have a pretty large balance. And so at the end of 2017 it was just under $900 million now that's the gross value, it's not the cash benefit, but we still have a significant amount. By 2018, we expect that to step down to just over $500 million again on a gross basis and the cash benefit is less than that and so we still expect to utilize a lot of that NOL balance going forward. And at the utility there is about $500 million of deferred tax assets and again it's pretty ambiguous as to how quickly that might be returned or recovered by us and that's subject to separate proceeding that we proposed to the MPSC.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay, can you just? That was the bit I was asking about. What have you proposed in terms of timing on that part?","Rejji Hayes","We have basically said we - in our filing in 19 to the Commission that we would propose having that as part of the separate proceeding and so in our modeling we have not assumed that has resolved in any point soon, maybe a safe assumption is that, it aligns with the normalization of the property of deferred taxes but it all remains to be seen quite frankly.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay, thank you. And then just can I clarify one other thing. I think if I heard you right, you said at various point that you thought that the tax reform will ultimately be accretive to the long-term plan and I think you said that you have about 4%, you anticipate having about 4% headroom and that each percentage point would give you capacity for another $400 million of investment. So if I can do that math that's sort of $1.6 billion potential incremental rate base. I know you've touched around this but what sort of timeframe should we think about partly extending the runway or is it bringing things forward and when you say accretive, are we talking earnings as well as whatever else?","Patti Poppe","Jonathan what I would say, it's a tailwind to our model. It is consistent with our methodology of offsetting cost of capital by reducing cost for customers and enabling our long-term commitment to 6% to 8% EPS growth and so I would best at the highest level characterize it as extending the runway de-risking the plan further, making us to continue to sleep at night stock. It just enables us to continue to do what we do so well Jonathan. In fact you could probably sleep through the call if you want because there is no news, no surprises here.","Jonathan Arnold","So if it's a tailwind does it by extension become something that makes it more likely that you'll execute above the 7% number or not.","Patti Poppe","We've been very, very consistent. I appreciate the push Jonathan, but we're very confident around 7% and I know you're very happy with our 7.4% performance this year. We're shooting for that 6% to 8% range and certainly we'll be disappointed again as I mentioned in 2018, if we didn't hit near the top end of that guidance and we're just going to continue to work that direction and everything positive that helps, is exactly that. It's a tailwind.","Jonathan Arnold","Well tailwinds are good. All right. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Greg [indiscernible] of UBS. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","In the slide deck you had equity infusion to consumers of about $300 million in 2018, $450 million in 2017 just wanted to understand how you think about that and sort of going forward?","Rejji Hayes","So specifically Greg are speaking how we might fund that, is that the direction question?","Unidentified Analyst","Really do you expect should we be thinking about what level of annual contributions to consumers going forward, if there is a way to think about how to model that?","Rejji Hayes","Yes, so we can certainly spend some more time offline on that, but I'd say the quick answer is that we do expect obviously because of the elimination of bonus depreciation that you'll certainly get a bit more equitization from the parent down into the utility and so $300 million, I think it's a pretty good run rate from a financing perspective as to what you might expect going into the utility. And then we would also anticipate roughly a flat to maybe modestly declining equity ratio at the utility. But again we'd assume that 300 or so really of infusion is probably a pretty healthy and appropriate run rate of dollars that would go down into the [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Paul Ridzon","I've question relative to before tax reform. What is maybe looking five years out, what delta do you have in your rate base, absent any investment changes?","Rejji Hayes","So you're saying absent tax reform and what specifically is the elimination, bonus depreciation and what that might do for rate base? Is that what you're implying just to make sure?","Paul Ridzon","Yes.","Rejji Hayes","Yes, so it's interesting. We have a fairly different rate construct in other and some rate constructs across the country. You'll see basically the deferred tax liability served as a deduct from rate base and so when you take reform obviously that's skinny [ph] and so you get a net increase in your rate base. As you may know in our rate construct deferred tax liability is a component of the rate making capital structure. And so it doesn't necessarily lead to a direct increase in rate base, but at the same time the economic effect is comparable because as you skinny [ph] that deferred tax liability in your rate making capital structure you'll offset it presumably with debt in equity. And so you have the effect of potential equity thickness overtime which leads to comparable economics, but don't view the elimination of bonus depreciation again in the context our rate construct as a net increase in rate base. But obviously because of the headroom created by tax reform it's going to create more headroom for capital investments and so we're increasing our five-year plan by about $1 billion so that will lead to higher rate base growth and what we initially pre-supposed.","Paul Ridzon","Thank you and then switching to Slide 28, the dig slide. Just want to make sure I'm looking at this properly. It looks like there is a step down in 2018 is that just a hole to be filled. Is that the right way to look at that?","Rejji Hayes","No, I just - I think what you saw in 2017 because we had as we see it some non-recurring benefits at dig. So obviously we have the layering strategy there that has gone well for us in the past and so we had nice capacity prices as well. We've been contracted for the long run on the energy side for a good while. But what we also saw and this is what I think with somewhat atypical because we had pretty good off peak margins merchant sales and so we do not expect that to resume going forward. Now in interest of full transparency and the context of Palisades transaction we did have about just over 400 megawatts of capacity sold to the utility as part of that transaction on a near term basis and so that did impact our layering strategy a little bit and so we're little open. So [indiscernible] about 30% for calendar year 2018 so there's a little bit of softness there, but at the end of the day I think most of that outperformance that you saw in 2017 versus what we're expecting in 2018 is really attributable to off-peak merchant sales which we don't expect recur.","Paul Ridzon","In that 35 assumes a typical market price at that 30 [indiscernible].","Rejji Hayes","Well remember most of the portfolio is already sold, so we got 70% and we view as upside to plan as anything above $3 per kilowatt month and so you can assume that, good portion of the portfolio is already sold in excess of that and then we're assuming little bit softness on the amount, where we're open.","Paul Ridzon","Got it.","Patti Poppe","And as we look forward Paul, dig as always serves its role as the Tesla in the garage and as the state reliability mechanism and the local clearing requirement determinations are made by the commission that could be provide in the out years certainly dig as one of the few remaining sources of excess power available in the state, some real upside in the out years. So it has a lot of value to us, right where it sits.","Paul Ridzon","That car just keeps changing, doesn't it.","Patti Poppe","It's all electric baby, you can count on that.","Paul Ridzon","And then lastly I think you're trying to do some upgrades to dig, can you just refresh us where that process stands?","Rejji Hayes","So we had at one point contemplated some potential upgrades to dig and I would say, it wasn't in the near term it was more sort of beyond 2020, we've since reconsidered that and so we don't have any capital investments associated with that - baked into our plan and so you shouldn't assume that there is upside there.","Paul Ridzon","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Patti for any closing remarks.","Patti Poppe","Excellent and thanks for joining us everybody. Happy Valentine's Day. I hope you felt the love. We can't think of a better way to spend our time than with all of you. Rejji and I will be on the road in the coming weeks and month and I look forward to seeing you then.","Operator","Thank you.

This call is being recorded.","Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today, beginning at noon Eastern Time, running through February 6. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Glenn Barba, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. Please go ahead.","Glenn P. Barba","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. With me are John Russell, President Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Webb, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Our earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on our website.","This presentation is made as of today and contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements should be considered in the context of the risks and other factors detailed in CMS Energy's and Consumers' SEC filings. These factors could cause CMS Energy's and Consumers' result to differ materially from those anticipated in such statements.","This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures when describing CMS Energy's result of operation and financial performance. A reconciliation of each of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in the Appendix and posted in the Investor section of our website.","Now I would turn the call over to John.","John G. Russell","Thanks, Glenn. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our 2013 Year-end Earnings Call. I'll begin the presentation with a few comments about the quarter before I turn the call over to Tom to discuss the financial results and the outlook for 2014. Then, as usual, we'll close with Q&A.","2013 adjusted earnings per share were $1.66, which was the top end of guidance, and 7% over last year's actual results. Last October, we introduced 2014 earnings per share guidance of $1.73 to $1.78. Today, we are tightening our guidance to a range of $1.74 to $1.78 per share, up 5% to 7% over last year's actual results.","Last week, our board approved a 6% dividend increase, the eighth consecutive increase in as many years. The new dividend of $1.08 per share results in a payout ratio of 62%, which is in line with our peers. 2013 was another strong year for CMS Energy, and the 11th consecutive year of consistent and editable financial result.","On this slide, you can see how our recent performance continues to meet or exceed the guidance we have provided. Over the last 4 years, we have guided to 6% earnings per share growth, on average. However, our actual results have been 7%, each year growing off the prior year's results. With our large inventory of capital projects and our aggressive cost reductions, we expect to continue to grow earnings per share at 5% to 7% over the long term.","This winter's extreme weather has been affecting both our electric and gas businesses. Through windstorms, ice storms and snowstorms, our system and our employees have responded to the challenge. Our generation fleet performed very well in 2013, setting the best E4 rate in a decade. This demonstrates that the investments that we have made in our generating plants are providing reliable service for our customers and adding value for our shareholders, and our company's sustainability index is in the first quartile.","In December, Governor Snyder delivered his energy address, laying out his vision for \"No Regrets\" energy future by 2025. His goals call for an emphasis on eliminating energy waste and replacing coal with newer, cleaner technologies like natural gas and renewables. I believe that 2014 will be a year of discussion and debate on Michigan's energy future. And I expect 2015 will be the year for legislative changes for the 2008 energy law.","Last fall, we issued an RFP requesting bids to purchase in existing power plant in lieu of building the Thetford natural gas plant. Today, I am very pleased to announce that we have agreed to acquire a 540-megawatt gas plant in our hometown of Jackson and suspend the certificate of necessity process. I'll provide you more details of that in a minute.","I mentioned the winter weather we've been experiencing. Here's how our gas system responded. On January 7, the average temperature in our service territory was negative 6 degrees. On that day, we set 3 records, including peak hourly throughput and sendout. We delivered over 3 billion cubic feet of gas that day, nearly another record. During this time of extreme cold, the system performed very well with limited service interruptions and no safety incidents. Our underground gas storage system, one of the largest in the country, provided 70% of the gas delivered and set a 24-hour record. As you know, our gas system is the fourth largest in the United States, serving 1.7 million customers. It continues to deliver value to our customers and respond when needed the most. Over the next 10 years, we plan to invest $5 billion in our gas infrastructure and continue to meet the demands of our customers safely and reliably.","On the electric side. The weather took its toll on our electric system. In November, we experienced a catastrophic windstorm; and in December, we experienced a major ice storm, covering poles and wires with up to 1 inch of ice and 0.5 foot of snow. The December 21 ice storm impacted the most customers, brought down the most wires, required the most crews and cost the most of any winter storm in our company's 126-year history. Crews from 13 states and Washington, D.C. worked around the clock to restore power.","Let me take a moment to thank our customers for their patience while service was being restored. And let me also thank our dedicated employees, mutual assistance crews and contractors who worked around the clock to restore service in very difficult weather conditions and during the holiday week.","Last December, the governor set his goals for a \"No Regrets\" energy future by 2025. The governor said that Michigan needs an energy policy that insures adaptability, reliability and affordability while protecting the environment. He also believes we should have reasonable and achievable goals for 2025. The governor's goals are consistent with our strategic initiatives and investment plans. Our balanced energy approach promotes fuel diversity and allows us to deliver the best value to our customers. Our reliability investments continue to improve service. And we are focused on driving down the frequency of outages and reducing the duration. Residential customer bills are competitive. And our fuel purchasing strategy, with our current rate case stay-out, help overall prices. Finally, we continue to move towards more clean power and increase our renewable energy portfolio.","I would like to highlight what the governor made public following his address. Concerning the topic of retail open access and deregulation, the governor stated that he believes the current structure allows customers to bounce back and forth depending on price, and in his words, arbitrage the markets. The governor is focused on the bigger picture. How do we help industrial customers be competitive in a global market? Our view is that retail open access only helps a select few, 0.02% of our customers. The remaining 99.98% of our customers are left to absorb the cost. Right now, the elimination of ROA could reduce all industrial rates by 10%.","We will continue to focus on ensuring that decisions affecting energy policy are in the best interest of our customers, our company, our shareholders and the communities we serve.","As I mentioned earlier, we have reached an agreement to purchase a 540-megawatt combined cycle natural gas plant in our hometown of Jackson. This outcome was the result of several planned actions that helps us achieve our goal of providing the best value for our customers and for our shareholders. By announcing the retirement of 7 coal plants, we knew we had a capacity shortfall to fill. The CON process allowed us to explore the potential of building, but always allowed us the option to buy. Now, we will suspend the CON process and put the Thetford plant on hold. We plan to close on the new gas plant in late 2015 subject to regulatory approvals, which times well with the retirement of the coal plants in early 2016. We will be replacing 950 megawatts of coal with 540 megawatts of cleaner gas-fired generation.","Last December, the MPSC approved our application to securitize the book value of the 7 coal plants, along with 3 other gas plants presently in mothball status. The $389 million of securitization bond proceeds will help lower customer rates. And the savings generated from buying versus building will create additional headroom to invest in other needed projects.","You can see on this slide how we backfill the capital savings from buying versus building. Over $0.5 billion will be reinvested back into the electric and gas business. Our customers will benefit by adding capacity when it's needed at a very competitive price. Our investors will benefit from lower risk, the redeployment of capital, more certain growth and, as we have been saying for years, no block equity is needed.","I also want to take a minute to thank Tom Web, Jack Hanson, Jim Brunner, and our advisor, Wells Fargo, for their hard work in negotiating this acquisition.","2014 starts like previous years with a rededication to our safety performance. Without a relentless focus on safety, we will not deliver results. Our focus on productivity and sustained cost savings continues. Our employee engagement remains in the first quartile for the second year in a row. Our regulatory strategy continues to be focused on a rate case stay-out until the 2015 test year. This is good for our customers and less risk for our shareholders.","Over the last few years, we have been focused on customer value and satisfaction. For 2014, we look to move our satisfaction scores into the first quartile of peer utilities. 2014 offers us the opportunity to deliver our 12th year of consecutive financial performance. Our year-over-year growth, based on actual results, continues to be better than our peers.","Now let me turn the call over to Tom, for a close look at the 2013 results and the 2014 outlook.","Thomas J. Webb","Thank you, John. Let me add my thanks to everyone for joining us today, we deeply appreciate it. Our reported and our adjusted earnings were the same. And at $1.66 a share, that's the first time that they've been the same since 1997. This is another nice sign of reliable, predictable results. And year-to-year EPS growth was up 7% again this year.","As shown on the left oval, the 7% increase reflects favorable weather and good sales performance at $0.21, offset partly by catastrophic storm costs and strong reinvestments at $0.19.","As you can see in the second oval, our rate case is aligned with planned investments. And as shown on the final bar, our O&M cost savings, worth about $0.10, they flowed through right to the bottom line. This creates a fast start to avoid the gas and electric rate cases in 2014.","Now recall a full year ago, in 2012, we had to work hard to offset a warm winter early in the year and then we were able to take advantage of a hot summer to invest more for our customers and deliver a 7% increase in earnings. For 2013, the year provided lots of opportunity to reinvest, $58 million, in fact, more than planned just in the first 10 months. We then had 2 extraordinary storms, wind in November and ice in December. But even with the worst ice storm in 126 years in the last quarter, in the last month and in the last week of the year, we met our numbers. We offset $37 million of storm-related O&M costs with insurance, lower-than-hoped charitable contributions and the favorable side of cold weather.","We delivered for our customers and our investors. And this commitment to operational and business performance has worked over the last several years. Up and down, it's different every single year. What's not different is that we delivered every year, maximizing business performance for customers and investors. It takes a strong well-aligned management team to drive the continuous improvement to make this possible. Welcome to CMS.","With that continuing commitment, here's the final report card for 2013, all targets met.","For 2014, we've provided guidance last year in our Investor Day in Grand Rapids and already have raised the low end of the guidance by $0.01 to a range of $1.74 to $1.78 or up 5% to 7%. Utility and all businesses are up from 2013.","Although it's pretty cold here today, normal weather and storms is what we forecast and our investments are self-funded, primarily with robust cost reductions. We're grateful that the Public Service Commission supported our proposal to avoid rate cases in 2014.","That's not a freeze -- it's not a freeze where we would just ask for big increases but later on. We've self-funded the 2014 planned investments, keeping rates low. In addition, purchase of the Jackson gas plant instead of new construction saves $0.5 billion, and securitization of our small coal plants will add to that savings.","Imagine, we have reduced costs sufficient to avoid a $49 million gas rate case and a $100 million electric rate case. This all comes from our long-used business model. It's not changed, it's working well. And there are many upside catalysts ahead. So let's look at just a few of them.","The core driver is our substantial investment need, catching up on improvements in productivity and customer reliability. We have opportunities to spend $20 billion over the next 10 years and that's 3x our market cap. But we do have all in nice bite-size, no bet-the-planet ideas. We've included $15 billion in our plans, limited only by our passion to keep customer rates and bills down. Even after pulling ahead $545 million of investment that John mentioned, investment in gas infrastructure, Smart Energy and electric reliability, as well as reinvesting almost $390 million in the gas business after securitizing coal plants, we have $5 billion of investment opportunity that's not in our plans. For example, as major PPAs expire, we'll need to invest more in capacity, a major priority for our customers. Controlled owned capacity provides flexibility to optimize performance for our customers. As we continue to drive down risk and strengthen the balance sheet, the rating agencies have acknowledged our progress with stronger credit ratings last year. And we may have an opportunity for even further upgrades.","Sales may be better than others as Michigan continues to grow, particularly in our service territory. As shown on the top left of this slide, key economic indicators like GDP growth and unemployment in our major service area are stronger than Michigan and in the U.S. We anticipate sales growth of about 1.5% this year. 2013 growth was flat excluding 1 special rate class, called E1, where we make no margin. Including E1 this year, sales growth would be about 1.5%. Excluding recovery in that class this year, our growth would be a little less than 0.5%. Over the next several years, we've planned conservatively at less than 1%. We prefer upside surprises and not downside.","Our EPS growth is not, however, dependent on strong load growth. Our growth is based on needed investments and solid productivity. Low growth over and above our conservative estimates could be another catalyst and we haven't factored this into any of our plans.","Our plans regarding capacity prices also remain conservative. As most of you know, we have 700 megawatts of gas IPP units in Dearborn. John likes to call these our race car waiting in the garage. Should capacity prices rise to, say, $4.50 or $7.50, earnings could rise $30 million to $50 million above levels today.","As you know, there's a chance that we could return to full regulation in a year or 2, as John described. Should this occur, any approved fixed cost coverage deployed over all our industrial customers, their rates would go down more than 10%. If this were spread over all customers, rates would go down 4%. Nice improvements. Policy does have big impacts on competitiveness.","And we're doing the things that we control. We're driving our costs down every year to improve our customer rates and investor performance. Excluding the 2 catastrophic storms in November and December, our costs were down 3% last year and they'd be down 6% this year. With plans to further reduce costs about 2% a year, we continue to improve our competitive position.","Over the last couple of years, we reduced headcount by about 1,000 people, largely through attrition, and hired 600 folks and that saved us $64 million. Looking ahead, our O&M costs will be down more than $100 million by 2017 compared with 2013. That's down more than 10%. Our changes in fuel mix and benefit sharing alone will cover this improvement. Of course, there are many other ups and downs as we deploy resources where needed and cut costs where not. Our drive to improve quality and customer satisfaction eliminates waste from fewer uncollectible accounts, less delayed service due to part shortages, faster dispatching with Smart Energy and more reliable scheduling. This all-out effort to improve customer quality drives costs out and that improves customer bills and customer satisfaction. Each of these catalysts is big and important. They're driven by a mindset to focus on customers and investors. For us, they fit perfectly together and make us a healthy company.","Our investment-driven model is not unique, but we work it well enough to improve our operating cash flow by about $100 million each year, and in some years, we've exceeded that substantially. We essentially self-fund our growth with no need for block equity on the horizon. As a percent of the market cap, our spending levels do exceed our peers, but as a risk-adverse company, so does our operating cash flow and liquidity and this is a nice place to be.","We are, however, far from perfect, so here's our sensitivity chart to help you assess our prospects. And here is our report card for 2014. Obviously, with the Arctic blast in January, we'd be well ahead of guidance. We will, however, likely put the surplus to use with either more reliability work for our customers should that surplus hold up.","So the mindset for customers and investors worked well for us. We're in our 12th year of premier earnings and dividend growth. Last week, we increased our dividend again, up 6%.","Thank you very much for your interest and for joining us today, and we'd be pleased to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Ali Agha from SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","A couple of clarifying questions. First off, with regards to the CapEx, which now that you moved from build to buy, is it fair to say that the CapEx over the next couple of years remains the same or is there a tightening potential given be the changes that you've provided here.","Thomas J. Webb","No, they're pretty much the same. Now there's going to be a little bit of movement around, but we have the flexibility to pull so many things ahead. Remember what John mentioned, more reliability spending, that'll be right upfront. Accelerating the smart meters that we're planning to do, that'll come in over the next couple of years. The gas infrastructure money will flow in on top of what we'd already planned to do. So the good news is we were going to be spending a little bit of money earlier and now we're going to actually be paying for a cheaper plant a little bit later. But we've been able to kind of smooth it all out. So I don't think you're going to see much difference, certainly, if you group together 3 or 4 years, but even in any individual year, about the same.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And John, with regards to your thoughts on how the electric energy law may change in 2015, given what you're hearing and from your experience, what's specific changes do you think take place in 2015 when that does happen?","John G. Russell","It's difficult to project what's going to happen, but there seems to be an interest, at least with the governor's energy policy, about doing more with renewable energy, ensuring that energy efficiency continues or as he said, which I like the term, not wasting energy, and I do think there's going to be a good debate about retail open access. I do -- I'd give you some news that I found out last night, that representatives, the house representatives, that initiated that bill, represent us here in Jackson. And yesterday, the Jackson City Council voted to oppose with a resolution, that bill. So that it does show, I think, that there is some pretty strong pushback to that bill, including in their own district, which I thought was a positive. So it's hard to tell. I think the discussion will go on. But one of the things that's going to be balanced here in Michigan is that we need to think about this in a reasonable fashion. And one of the things that the governor talked about is setting goals that are achievable and reasonable, so not the goals that are out there too far.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay, John. But is it realistic to think that a retail open access may completely go away? Is that a realistic outcome, you think, in '15?","John G. Russell","Yes, I think that is possible. I mean, as Tom and I showed in the presentation. 0.02% of our customers are benefiting and 99.98% of our customers are not. So at the end of the day, when you think of legislation, it should be for everybody's good. And if industrial rates are what the target is for the governor to reduce industrial rates, we could reduce those rates by 10%, which is a significant reduction. And many of the customers that are taking retail open access today are not your big users of energy. There are a few, but a lot of them are commercial accounts. So I think -- yes, I think we are ripe for that discussion. And I think we should have it. And I think personally, if you look around the country as you have, the trend towards deregulation is not getting any traction. The majority of the states that started it have gone back and those that haven't are in a position today of wondering where their generation will be coming from in the future.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Last question. Tom, you alluded to the extremely cold weather we've seen so far this year. Any sense, can you give us some of qualification of what that has meant for you so far?","Thomas J. Webb","It's cold and I've got a cold from it and that's a qualification that I've given -- quantification. And it's been hurting me for the last week. But no, we're not going to put numbers on it. Suffice it say, when we have temperatures this cold, you know they're pretty big numbers. And the reason we're not going to toss numbers on it right now is weather is fickle. We could end up having a very normal or mild-ish rest of the winter and eat that up. But if we don't, remember what we do, we are very predictable. As we get through the year, and we think it will hold, we'll put that money right back to work for our customers. So if we can do more reliability work or if we can find some pull-aheads on productivity, we'll make good use of it, that I promise you. Now we might not do that all in the very first quarter, we'll see how it plays out, but we'd certainly get going on it in the second quarter. So yes, pretty big numbers coming up, but I just wouldn't want people to get excited and start thinking about bigger year-end numbers because we'll make good valuable use of the resource.","Operator","And the next question is from the line of Greg Gordon of ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just couple of questions. I mean, you guys have done an absolutely fantastic job of earning to the high end of your expectations the last few years. And as I look at your presentation, it seems to me that for you to continue to do that, and it seems it does seem achievable, you have to start identifying the ability to sort of get to that $20 billion capital number in ways that are mutually beneficial for customers and investors, i.e., by keeping rates down. So what are the milestones that we should look for as investors over the next year that you're going to be sort of looking forward, just sort of identify that incremental $5 billion of opportunity in a cost-effective way for the customer.","Thomas J. Webb","So Greg, the way I would look at this, if I understood your question properly, is that we really don't need to go beyond the $15 billion, so it's $7 billion in the next 5 years and $8 billion in the following 5, so over a 10-year period. If we stay on that course, we think we're in a pretty good place to be able to deliver that kind of earnings and cash flow growth right on through. So that's a nice place to be. The advantage that we have is every single time we find a way to reduce our capital spending like we just smartly did on the capacity site by buying our capacity much cheaper than we could build it, we can pull ahead some of that money. And all those are valuable things because it gives us either more productivity or more reliability or better programs for our customers, so we're keen to pull in as much as we can because we'll be a healthier company. But we don't need to. And the reason we don't -- and I know you know this well, so forgive me for repeating it, but the only reason we don't is if we inflated that number above $15 billion, we're going to see more pressure on our rates going up. And we very much want to hold our rates down. And we just think going higher than inflation, for example, and we think we can beat that handily incidentally, but going higher than inflation is just the wrong thing to do for our customers on rate growth. So if we could find a way, we need to keep them flat. I don't think we can get there. We're doing it this year in 2014. But we'll make every effort to range [ph] well below inflation in the future. So I view it as upside, but not necessary beneath that growth that we've talked to you about, at least for the next 10 years.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And my second question was on the -- sort of any milestones that we might look for that would allow you to achieve the operating leverage you talked about on Page 28 with the big plant? I mean, what would have to happen for you just to realize some or all of that $35 million to $55 million? And I'm assuming those are pretax numbers, is that correct?","Thomas J. Webb","Those are. So that's the race car in the garage kind of thing. John doesn't like to say it, but he loves to say it so much. I even originally put in a Ferrari in here, but he was looking for something more descriptive, I think. All we need to do is see those capacity prices and away we go. As you know, and most people know, we have not put long-term contracts in place at the big operations purposely. As capacity prices fell away to near nothing and have not yet restored, we just think it made no sense to do that if we could structure our business in a manner that we could actually make money on it, which we do today, because we do have some short-term contracts and we do have agreements with our customers and suppliers around use of blast furnace gas and things of that kind. That allows us to be very efficient with these plants and make a little bit of money and be patient. As capacity prices come up, I promise you we won't be greedy and we won't wait and try to get to a peak of $7.50 or something like that, but we'll start layering in some contracts and take advantage of this. So I'd say it's a matter of patience. There are some people that don't think that capacity markets will come back for a few years. Obviously, the people that sold us the plant we just bought think that. But there are other people that think that there's some pressures coming up in and around with the coal closures and the like around 2016 that may create physics, that something will need to happen. And if it does, this is one place we're in a good position to get a little bit of extra growth. And then we have a big choice: do we let that flow through or do we take those resources and in some way put them to work, again to help customers. And that's a choice we don't have to make right now. That something that I would tell you is probably a couple of years away, to be realistic. It's not something that's just around the quarter. And it may be 3 or 4 years away. But thank you for asking about it.","John G. Russell","Greg, If I could just build on that just for a moment. One of the reasons I referred to it as a race car, the big plant has basically a 0 book value and has a great heat rate. So not only for capacity, but for energy. I think it's in the 7,000 range for heat rate so it is a very attractive plant that, so far, we haven't really planned a lot on, although Tom said we do have some contracts. It certainly hasn't been high on our radar screen and it won't be until capacity prices come back and we see the shift from coal to gas.","Thomas J. Webb","Remember there's some choices in there. It's a 2 combined cycle units of 250 megawatts each and a peaker as well.","Operator","And the next question is from the line of Brian Russo of Ladenburg Thalmann.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But just curious, the bill that Jackson City Council voted against is -- are you referencing House Bill 5184?","John G. Russell","Yes, yes. It was a resolution they passed last night, Brian, that -- a unanimous vote on the City Council that was a resolution opposing the Bill. So I think it sends a pretty strong signal to the representatives from Jackson that House Bill 5184, their -- our position on it.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. So it's been introduced, but it hasn't moved -- hasn't gained any traction in the House or Senate as of now, right?","John G. Russell","No, no, no. Haven't gone anywhere. But what I -- what we want to make sure the representatives understand is what people think about that in Jackson. And I think it's pretty strong statement that was made yesterday, in addition to hundreds of letters from residents and customers about opposing that Bill.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then you mentioned your stellar performance during the previous storms and I know there's an ongoing ice storm, formal investigation by the MPSC. If you could just comment on the -- or just update us on that, that'd be great.","John G. Russell","Yes, there was -- it's DTE, us and they don't control the municipalities or regulate the municipalities. But there was -- were some issues here with a muni that was having a little bit harder time than us restoring the customers. So at the end of the day, what the Commission decided to do is investigate it. I think what you'll find is, as I said in the call, I'm very proud of the employees, the response that we did. It was the worst ice storm in our 126-year history. The employees worked tirelessly to get through this. And the media coverage was very good for us -- very good, it was good for us, very fair and balanced and good for us. The employees responded, the customers were patient and I certainly appreciate that. So I think at the end of the day, the hearings will show that we did the right things. We did -- got all the crews we possibly could to get in. Our communication was good. I think what they're going to try to find is just validate that. We were doing the right things in the storm. And I hope to never have a storm like this. TIME really illustrated it well the last week of the year. It was a brutal storm. And I've been in this business a long time and I've never seen that much ice and that many workers. I mean, we had around 4,000 people working on Christmas day. That is a hell of a commitment on behalf of the company and all the people. The other utilities, which I do want to thank the other utilities because they sent the crews over from far away to work on Christmas Day, and I think we did pretty good and I think that'll show in the investigation.","Thomas J. Webb","Brian, let me just add, anytime we have storms of this magnitude, particularly back-to-back, it's a very routine thing for the Public Service Commission to do an investigation to make sure resources were brought to bear, all the right things were happening. So we're wide open. We've provided all the information during the storm, kept our commissioners and staff informed on what was happening. And they're appropriately doing an investigation to make sure customers were taken care of well.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Mark Barnett of Morningstar.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","A quick question on the -- one particular element that we may see some changes on in 2015. On the renewables, you look like you'll be fine to meet your initial goal and then there's a chance, I guess, that the next time they look at the levels of the RPS or whatever they choose, there might be a higher amount for CMS to need to supply. And I know you have a placeholder in your opportunity level for that number, but it's not really a very big number. Is this because there's already going to be capacity out there for you to maybe sign contracts with? Or can you maybe talk me through how that might take shape?","John G. Russell","Yes, let me start with that and maybe Tom and I can tag team on this one. First of all, the one thing that's important, I want to make sure we emphasize to everybody, what the Governor is talking about in his policy, his energy policy for the future, is a target date of 2025. So that provides a lot of time to be able to meet a new renewable energy standard, whatever that is. One of the things, I think, people forget about the targets that we have in Michigan is that some people think that they're not that aggressive. And I just want to make sure we're clear on that. We've get the second most aggressive renewable energy standards in the Midwest and we are going to meet all those. And the reason they're more aggressive is, yes, they're only 10%, but they're 10% by 2015. Some other states have 20% by 2020, 30% by 2030. Those are long term -- long time frame out. What we've done is we've actually moved forward to hit both the capacity and the energy targets that are required here. Moving forward in the plan, though, I would think that our basis for meeting it, whatever that will be, we'll have plenty of time to do it and we will own it versus long-term contracts.","Thomas J. Webb","Yes. And what I think you're referring to when you took a look probably at Slide 24, we show about $300 million set aside for higher renewables. That's not in our plan. So that's the size of what we've done with about half of our build today. So we're suggesting that you might see something go up from the 10% to half again as much. But we don't know. So let's just say that the standard goes from 10% to 20% and it's on the same basis. It may be completely different basis. With that would just be more opportunity for investment that we'd have to figure out how to contain.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And you're fairly confident. I mean, again, these are long-term projections. So it's a bit of a finger in the air that you would be able to self-build or instead of maybe looking at contracting?","Thomas J. Webb","There will be no worries.","John G. Russell","Oh, yes.","Thomas J. Webb","I mean, it depends on the size. If somebody says the new standards is going to be 50%, I'd say there'd be a worry. But if it's a reasonable progression, I think that we're -- I think the team's proven they're very capable of putting these, particularly the wind farms, into place and things of that kind. So no issue and we would do whatever we are directed to, either through legislation or regulation on how much of it we build.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","All right. One last item. You'd mentioned last year briefly that you were taking a look at some transmission ownership. And I'm just curious if that's anything that you've done any work on since then? I'm sure you have, but anything that you would talk about on that front that might pertain to your system?","John G. Russell","Yes, we continue, as we talked about, I think, in the last call or even in -- when we're in Grand Rapids together, we're working on it. It's slow, it's small. Again, it's just transferring some of the operations from the 138,000-volt system and it really is just a relatively small thing. And they have some potential in the future, as you talked about. If renewable energy continues to go higher and there's an opportunity to connect some of these wind farms, that's probably where the opportunity is. But right now, slow. It'll take a couple of years till we get the full approval.","Operator","The next question is from Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Can you just give a little more detail on this Jackson plant that you've acquired? Like what's its [indiscernible]? Is it going to need capital?","John G. Russell","No. It's built in 2002. Heat rate's about 8,400. It's combined cycle. It's a modular design. It's got great -- or quick start-up, which we're looking for. They've had General Electric contract for maintenance, so it's done on a routine basis. Jack Hanson who runs our supply side, he and his folks have been in there, looked at all the due diligence, that's been done or we've completed the due diligence. It's a good plant. And I didn't say this, but we can see from our building here. So we see the days it runs and it's in good shape. So I'm really pleased that -- it was built well, it has backup transformers, it has backup equipment because they get paid to run and they need to be available. So it's in good shape.","Thomas J. Webb","Minor investment ahead.","John G. Russell","Yes, yes, right.","Thomas J. Webb","Not a lot of capital to add to, so don't put that down as one of the opportunities for growth and capital spending. As we move ahead, if it turns out that we need more capacity, let's say, John's conversation about ROA were to come back, so we'd need more capacity or sales are better than what we expect or who knows what, remember an important comment he made about our Thetford plant. It's on hold. We have an air permit that still lives for a time and we can extend it. It's nothing we're planning to turn around and doing the next 12 months, but it's one of those options that are important to us that if there's further additional need for capacity, we have ways to bring more into place, either by doing this build or purchasing even more capacity if the prices are as attractive as they have been today.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","As we look at the potential for more renewable, how are you looking at the declining cost of solar versus wind? And what's the suitability in Michigan?","John G. Russell","The wind is clearly the renewable energy fuel source of choice. Solar really does not, based on conditions here, really is not as attractive as wind. The other thing, too, for wind and I guess it's any renewable resource that we've seen here, you really have to base it on scale. I mean, the scale is where you get near competitive -- not exactly competitive, but nearing competitive rates. Our wind farms are doing well, one that we're just building now, Cross Winds, on the east side of the state should have a very good capacity factor. I think it's important, Paul, you know this, but for everybody. I mean, Michigan's on a peninsula. So the wind regime here is good. But being close to all the lakes, surrounded by lakes, we also have a lot of clouds here. So it really does favor wind turbines at a scale size versus solar.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just really a few clarifying questions, and I'm sorry to be a little slow on this, but on Page 27, there are a couple of things going on with the without and with and I just want to make sure I understood it. The dotted line represents what exactly versus the blue solid bar versus the -- could you just go over that a little...","Thomas J. Webb","I would be happy to. So if you look at 2010 through 2014, all of those dotted blue bars, those are energy efficiency. So if you will, let's just pick a year. In fact, let's just pick the year 2014. We expect that the economy will be strong enough that sales will be up 2.4%. But we're going to turn right around and help our customers be more efficient. So we're forecasting that actual sales would be up 1.4%. So the difference in that dotted area is all about energy efficiency. So let me just get that part clear first, is that okay? And then I'll take the second bite.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, let's go. Sure.","Thomas J. Webb","Okay. Now the second bite is something that's subtle that we can't talk a lot about because of our contractual agreements. But we do have a very narrow customer class that we refer to here as E1. It's a class where we don't make any money and it's a class where, unfortunately, there was little volatility in sales. So their sales, if you look at 2013, fell down enough that it drove our overall sales down to 2.9%. If you exclude them, then our sales were flat. Forget EO, just sales were flat. In 2014, what we want you equally to know, they have a good recovery underway and we've already seen the recovery beginning at the end of last year and this year. Their recovery would drive our sales up 1.4%. Without them, we'd be about 0.5% growth. And so that's called without E1. So here's how I look at it real clear. Forget energy efficiency. it is what it is. Last year, our overall sales were flat. And this next year, we expect our sales to be up about 0.5%. If you do include E1, which will be in our numbers, you'll see that they'll be up about 1.5%. We try to stay conservative on our forecast so that when we get surprises, they're on the upside. I hope that wasn't too confusing, did that help?","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I got it, and I think you've explained it before. For some reason, it was -- I appreciate [indiscernible]","Thomas J. Webb","Don't worry. No, it's a little tricky. We don't like all the adjustments. We just wanted to be clear.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, got you. And then back to Greg's question about the race car thing. Realistically, I mean, you said that you had some contractual obligations, I think, associated with the 700 megawatts in Dearborn. When will those go away? And I mean, do you guys have any forecast on the capacity market or anything like that?","Thomas J. Webb","Well, we do. But forecast aren't very meaningful in my view on the capacity side because it's like me forecasting interest rates. For 10 years, I told you they'd be up, well, I'm finally right. So if you just give me a decade or two, I'll be right. Or some people say, the watch will be right twice a day or something like that. In your specific question, though, about Dearborn Industrial Generation and our earmarks [ph], we do have some near-term contracts, not really long in nature, but we will be looking at contracting the 2 combined cycle units, 250 megawatts each, and the peaker as we move further into relationships with our customers that can support them and capacity prices that made more sense. So there's nothing encumbering us today. Don't think of it that way. There's nothing holding us back except our own patience about the market.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Well, if these are such great plants and what have you and looking what you just did with Jackson, why aren't they candidates for what you just did with Jackson?","Thomas J. Webb","Good question. We don't -- it's something that you could do. We could easily take that plant and bring it into the utility. But there's a couple things going here: one, it's got a long history inside the company and we have avoided trying to create the debate and discussion about dropping that plant into the utility and seeking the Public Service Commission. So we haven't had that debate. But we also like the idea, the flexibility of that plant sits outside. It gives us a lot of opportunity as we go forward: one, as the capacity markets come back up, we can put it to good use in the open market, like an IPP would; two, if we get squeezed and we don't have options that are good enough, quick enough, we can turn it around and go to the Public Service Commission and say that we'd like to contract it into the utility or we would like to drop it into the utility. We have no plans of that kind. We have that nice optionality, and we think that's good for everybody.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, I got you. And then you mentioned that you guys did pretty well in, I think, during the storms and stuff, but there was a small company that I think at least you beat them to the press. They got a little bit -- it didn't seem to do so well. And I'm just wondering are there any opportunities to help one of these companies, maybe any consolidation opportunities or service opportunities there'll be more revenue for you? I'm just thinking, I don't know, when I saw that, I was just wondering.","John G. Russell","The company you're talking about is Lansing Board of Water and Light. And the reason it was pretty evident about the restoration is we surround them. I mean, we're in Lansing, too. They're in Lansing. As far as assistance for them, we provided assistance as we do with other utilities, with mutual systems crews. As far as any opportunity to help and assist beyond that, as far as potential financial transaction, really municipalities, they've got to make that decision. This is something that we've got several municipalities throughout the state. They're very tied to the local area and they do good. We know the people that run it and I think they just had a bad period there with a very catastrophic storm. And one of the things that the advantage of our size is and utilities our size, we can call on other resources and get the crews here and we can afford those last week-of-the-year problems. And sometimes if municipalities are a little smaller, they don't have the resources that we do. But as far as financial transactions, we like the plan that we have here and we believe, as Tom and I have talked about, we can continue to grow this business at 5% to 7% for the next 5 years with a plan that we have here.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then just finally, there's a small item with respect to the demolition and the securitization order and I believe that that wasn't granted in the securitization order, and I just I notice that you guys didn't have anything in the quarter about it. I don't know, could you just elaborate a little bit...","Thomas J. Webb","No, that's a fair question. It was viewed by some sort of a future cost. So therefore, rather than securitize it today like you take the book value and the recovery of that, we will put that into our normal depreciation filings and to our normal process. Nothing unusual. Fair request by the Public Service Commission. We'll still get recovery of those costs, at least we assume we will, as we go through time with a regular process that you would have on demolition costs. So no Issue.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Kevin Cole of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just guess with the Jackson plant being 150 megawatts smaller than Thetford, can you talk to the magnitude of shortfall that you expect in 2016 and how you expect to backfill that capacity?","John G. Russell","Yes, I mean, at the end of day, we are a little bit lighter than the 120 or 130 megawatts that we would have done if we would have bought it. What we are doing, though, is the renewable energy plant, Cross Winds, will be operational at that point. We're also upgrading our Ludington Pumped Storage facility by about 300 megawatts over the next several years. And, as you know, I think we've talked about this, our strategy is never to have 100% owned capacity to meet our load. I just think that puts you on a long side of a volatile market. And so that's not the position we necessarily want to be in. So we will be buying capacity from the market, which I think is the right thing to do. And as Tom talked about for DIG and things like that, there may be opportunities there and so forth. But based on what we've seen over the past several years, I'd rather be short in this market than long in this market. So we're a little short, about 100 mega megawatts here and there based on our load of up near 9,000 is really pretty small.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then how long can you defer without losing the air permit?","John G. Russell","About -- we've got an 18-month permit and it can be extended another 18 months, so into, I think, it's '16. And then at that point, if for some reason it did sunset, as we've said before, Thetford's a great site for us to build a natural gas plant. And I don't expect, this is my opinion, that if we did this permit sunset and we have to go back for another it would be that big a deal.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. The DIG capacity market, you were referring to the PJM capacity market, correct?","John G. Russell","Both. Tom was referring to both PJM and MISO.","Thomas J. Webb","Absolutely.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then how much is currently bid into your last PJM auction? And is there anything bid into the MISO capacity auction?","Thomas J. Webb","In the PJM auction, we just put one of the combined cycles in, so that's all we have committed. And we have to make a decision on what we do for -- this May for the next year.","John G. Russell","A couple of hundred.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then, John, you described, I guess, 2014 being the year of discussion and debate on energy policy.","John G. Russell","Yes.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","How much attention has energy policy garnered, thus far, in the election? And then can you kind of step back and talk to the views, I guess, Governor Snyder's view versus Mark Schauer's views on how they -- on where they might contrast with regards to renewables or choice?","John G. Russell","That's a good question. As far as energy policy in being a debate for the election, I don't think it's going to exist. There's only one bill that's out there and it has few sponsors and it's just not a topic that people want to talk about today. So I don't think that's going to be an election topic. Between Governor Snyder and Mark, I mean, they're both -- Governor Snyder's policy as he's talked about is measurable and achievable. So moving it forward, but also he's a very accountable person so he wants to make sure he is metric-driven, that whatever we're doing, we're making the steps to get to the end. He's very business oriented, which is good. I haven't talked to Mark Schauer about this. I did when he was on office. He represented us. I think all of you know he represented the Jackson area. We know Mark very well. I think Mark...","Thomas J. Webb","This has not been a topic.","John G. Russell","So the last I talked to Mark about this, he was in favor of renewable energy, doing more renewable energy, energy efficiency. But it has not been a topic for the election. So I'll just tell you those really are comments from talking to him in his previous position as a legislator.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And the last question. For the 2014 election, are there any like valid initiatives or anything like that, that we need to be aware of?","John G. Russell","I'm not familiar, are you? I'm not familiar of any.","Yes, and generally, you'll get those closer to the election time frame. So no, I'm not familiar with that anything yet.","Operator","The next question is from Andrew Levi from Avon Capital.","Andrew Levi","Just a quick question on the big plant or your stingray or Ferrari or whatever. But were there any opportunities in the first quarter or January with the extreme pricing in PJM to capitalize that? I mean, I don't know how contracted the plant is? The benefit?","Thomas J. Webb","No, in the very near term, we do have agreements and contracts where we protect ourselves, and therefore, we limit the size of the upside, and of course, we limit any downside. There is some upside because we can run the plant a little more than what we have in contract. So small upside. I wouldn't look at that as anything big for 2014.","Andrew Levi","Okay. So you weren't really able to capitalize on the extreme pricing?","Thomas J. Webb","Well, a little bit, so limited amount. Not a lot.","Operator","And the next question is from Andrew Weisel of Macquarie Capital.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Just got 2 quick ones. The first, on the rate case, can you just give us a little more detail as to when we should expect the filing relative to -- start with that one.","Thomas J. Webb","So let's focus on electric because I think that's where the keen interest is. We've made no changes to our plans that we announced last year where we deferred the rate case into a test year for 2015. So we haven't actually scheduled anything yet, but more toward the end of 2014. We'd probably be making a filing for something in 2015. And what's really nice about what John just described with the purchase of this plant in Jackson is that sits in there perfectly. We probably will use that rate case process to get that plant approved and into the rate base. And again it fits nicely, so that we'd have a final order by the end of 2015, early 2016 latest. And that would give us our next rate case, but nothing happening during the course of 2014. And gives as the plant when we need it. So it just fits so nicely and it's one of the things that we liked with this particular transaction.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Okay, great. And then the other quick one I had was about a year ago, you had talked a little bit about the propane-to-gas conversions. I see that you have that listed now as one of the opportunity level things that are not in the case plan. Any updates on either progress you've made or interest you've seen or how we should think about that as part of the $1 billion that you have pegged as an opportunity?","John G. Russell","Yes, This is John. It's really going well. I mean, a couple key -- that's the connect, as I call it. Propane prices, there's a shortage today. There was an emergency -- state of emergency -- energy emergency stated by the governor here in Michigan. Wisconsin had the same issue due to the shortage of propane, not just the price but the shortage. So customers are really able to save, in our case, about $1,200 a year. We're seeing some interest in the legislature, particularly in Michigan house to begin to work towards getting pipelines expanded into areas that don't have natural gas but have propane. And one of the reasons that this -- for your information, one of the reasons that propane shortage has occurred in the Midwest is because many of the grain dryers, the farmers that were drying the crops from last year, what caused that to happen as they used a lot more propane than expected because it was a wet year and they had to dry the crops. Now it happened is there's a shortage and we have the cold winter and the prices are higher. So what Michigan legislators are looking at, there is plenty of natural gas. We've got safe and reliable pipelines. How do we extend those pipelines out to those big users, which are the grain dryers and then connect the customers along the way. So we're currently working on that with the legislature. I think there's good opportunity to grow this business in the future.","Operator","Sir, we have no further questions in the queue.","John G. Russell","All right. Well, let me wrap this up by saying 2013 was another very good year of performance for CMS Energy. Building on the 2013 results, we expect to have another strong year in 2014. And as always, both from Tom and I and the team, we really appreciate your interest in the company. So thank you for joining us.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

This call is being recorded. Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today, beginning at noon Eastern time running through May 3. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. ","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Laura Mountcastle, Vice President and Treasurer. Please go ahead.","Laura Mountcastle","Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. With me are John Russell, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Tom Webb, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. ","Our earnings press release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on our website.","This presentation contains forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and should be read in conjunction with our Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs. The forward-looking statements and information and risk factors section discuss important factors that could cause results to differ materially from those anticipated in such statements.","This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of each of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in the appendix and posted in the Investor section of our website. ","CMS Energy provides financial results on both a recorded GAAP and adjusted non-GAAP basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company's present operating financial performance unaffected by discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, regulatory items from prior years, or other items. Certain of these items have a potential to impact favorably or unfavorably the company's reported earnings in 2012. ","The company is not able to estimate the impact of these matters and is not provided reported earnings guidance. ","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to John.","John Russell","Thanks, Laura. And good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today on our first quarter earnings call. I'd like to being by first congratulating Laura Mountcastle on her upcoming retirement, which was announced yesterday. Laura will be leaving us effective July 1, having served as a key financial officer of our company for 18 years. ","Laura has held the role most familiar to those of you on the phone as Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer since 1999. I know you will join me in wishing Laura the best and Laura, I'll tell you, I've always enjoyed working with you and I want to publically thank you for your great years of service to the company and on behalf of everyone of the company, we'll miss you. ","Laura Mountcastle","Thank you, John.","John Russell","Good luck. Let me begin the presentation today with a few brief comments about the quarter before I turn the call over to Tom to discuss the financial results and outlook for the remainder of the year. Then we'll close with Q&A. ","First quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.37, down $0.14 from 2011. The results were impacted by the warmest winter on record in Michigan, reducing earnings by $0.13 this year and $0.18 compared to the colder than normal weather a year ago. ","The good news is, we've identified a number of actions some of which have already been implemented to offset the adverse weather. Tom will discuss several of these with you later. As a result, we are reaffirming our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $1.52 to $1.55 a share. ","On the regulatory side, our electric and gas rate cases are proceeding on schedule. I'll give you an update on these two in a minute. In early April, the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled in a DTE case that the Michigan Public Service Commission lacks statutory authority to adopt a revenue decoupling mechanism for electric utilities. As the result of this decision, we wrote off a $59 million regulatory asset covering the period from December 2009 through November of 2011. ","The Court's ruling does not affect our 2012 adjusted earnings guidance since the electric decoupling mechanism was only authorized through November of last year. And I also am going to talk about the bill to raise the retail open assess cap in Michigan and give you an overview on the operations for the quarter. ","Many of you are familiar with our rate case timeline. We are nearing the deadline for the Commission to issue a final order in our electric rate case. All of the testimony and briefs are filed and the staff in ALG have filed their recommendations. The final order is due no later than June 8. ","The gas rate case is scheduled for a final order by August 31. Because of the limited size of the case, there's a chance we could settle this case. In March, a bill was introduced to raise the retail open access cap. We are opposed to this bill, which would benefit a relatively small number of business customers at the cost of all other customers. There is wide spread opposition against the bill including the Chair of the Senate Energy and Technology Committee and the Chair of the House Energy and Technology Committee. ","Both have publically voiced their opinion that the 2008 energy law is working with regard to the cap and have no intention of taking action on the bill. If enacted, it would allow all customers on the waiting list to go to ROA, retail open access, and then permit further annual increases in the cap to about 40% by 2016. This would shift up to $400 million of cost to our remaining customers.","We will continue to inform key members of the legislature and the administration of the consequences to our remaining customers if this bill is passed. ","Let me give you a brief update on operations. Major construction continues on our 100 MW Lake Winds Energy Park. Concrete foundations are nearly complete and wind turbine components are being delivered. The facility is scheduled to begin operations later this year. ","Low natural gas prices have resulted in record monthly send-out at our Zeeland natural gas power generation facility. In February the combined cycle portion of the plant set a record capacity factor of 86% compared to 11% for all of 2008. The acquisition of the Zeeland plant in 2007 has been a great addition to our generation fleet and has helped us to maintain a balanced energy portfolio. ","Low natural gas prices will also generate savings for our gas customers. Starting in April, the commodity portion of our customers' bill was reduced by 13%. We project our customers will save more than $100 million over the next 12 months and $300 million over the next two years. ","Ironically, many of our customers who have switched to an alternative supplier are paying more for their gas than our bundled customers. This month, we offered a voluntary separation program to all salaried employees similar to the programs we offered in 2006 and 2009. This decision was driven by our goal to ensure that we are properly staffed to serve our customers effectively and to run our business efficiently. We have informed the union leadership of this program and are in discussions with them to explore a similar program for our union employees. ","Our business model has been working well for several years. It relies on good regulatory and legislative framework and a disciplined execution by the management team. This supports a customer-driven investment plan with customer rate increases that are affordable at about the rate of inflation. With this model we have delivered consistent cash flow and earnings growth in the past and we expect it will continue for many years. ","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom to discuss the first quarter results, if he can get through it with his cold. ","Tom Webb","My apologies to every \u2013 thanks, John. But my apologies to everybody. I'm coming through with a little bronchitis today. Let's go right to the next slide and talking about our results. Excluding the decoupling write-off that John just talked about, adjusted earnings were $0.37 a share and this is down $0.14 from last year reflecting the record warm winter. ","On a weather-adjusted basis earnings were $0.50 and that's up $0.04 from last year. Now, we are writing off our electric decoupling regulator asset because we no longer assess recovery as at least 80% probable. Two weeks ago the Michigan Court of Appeals found that the Michigan Public Service Commission does not have statutory authority for electric decoupling. Although gas decoupling is expressly addressed in the 2008 energy law and the intent may have been to include the electric business as well, the Appeals Court judge found that in a plain reading of the law, electric decoupling was established.","This appeals case brought by ABATE against the Michigan Public Service Commission regarding the DTE rate case order reduces our confidence in recovery. The standard to maintain such a revenue regulatory asset is high. Please recall that for planning purposes we had assumed that present and future electric decoupling for the economy and weather was discontinued in any event. We were however surprised by the Appeals Court order and have taken the one-time write-off of the anticipated $0.14 recovery as you can see on this chart. ","Now importantly, gas decoupling continues and you see the numbers on the chart for that. And energy optimization incentives also continue for both electric and the gas business as shown above. In our service territory, the first quarter weather was the warmest on record. Personally, I'm hoping the graph shown here that looks like half an ice cream cone, will look more like a full cone later. But kidding aside, we take this very seriously and we do not dismiss weather as an excuse to miss our earnings or our operational goals. ","A few weeks ago we estimated the adverse weather impact at $0.16 when we gave you a look ahead. But as you can see here the final data came in at $0.13. We have a plan in place to offset the $0.13 of adverse profit associated with the warm winter weather. Some of the actions are natural offsets. For example, with lower sales, pressure on customer bills eased and uncollectible accounts declined a bit. ","With less gas flowing through the system, less gas was lost. On the other hand, hard work is also paying off. Our major multi year effort to improve employee safety has resulted in more employees going home safely each day and therefore we have fewer injuries. Fewer injuries reduces the size of our injuries and damages reserved too. More good news. And you can that, all this detail, with the earnings numbers on the right hand side of this slide. ","Although the weather is not the reason we are reshaping and resizing our team with a voluntary restructuring program to better meet the needs of our customers. In total, our recovery actions offset adverse weather of the $0.13 a share. $0.08 or 60% of that work is complete, done, and $0.05 is underway including the voluntary restructuring program. ","Now as you can see here, strong cost discipline, the continuing sale recovery and rate cases help us keep right on track to earn our $1.52 to $1.55 a share for this year. The Michigan economy continues to recover at a faster pace than the nation with unemployment for example down six points from the recession peak but still above 8%. The US unemployment levels are down two points from the recession peak but also still a bit above 8%. ","US auto sales provide an indicator of recovery in Michigan. Sales were up sharply. US production also is up; 18% so far just this year. Finished vehicle inventories remain low at 54 days supply and a 60 to 90-days supply is more normal. This and continuing used car prices bode well for the new car sales ahead. ","As you can see here, the economic recovery in our service territory in Michigan continues in its third year with industrial sales at pre-recession levels last year. Industrial sales were up 10% in 2010, 4% in 2011 and we expect another lift of about 6% this year. Total weather adjusted sales were up 5% over the last three years. As shown at the top of the bar sales were of course higher excluding energy efficiencies and that may be a clearer measure of the underlying economic growth in our service territory. ","The recovery over the same three-year period was about 8% instead of 5%. Perhaps many people including us have been under calling the resiliency of the economic recovery in Michigan. A key aspect of our recovery includes our passion about maintaining responsible customer rate increases at or below the level of inflation. ","Our earnings and cash flow growth is based primarily on capital investment and rate base growth. Our forecast of spending over the 2012 to 2016 period continues at $6.6 billion. We've had lots of opportunities to increase the size of this but have continued to prioritize in a manner to fit in more content without increasing the total. With faster than planned replacement of pipes and poles, quicker implementation of the smart grid and a modest increase in gas generation capacity, we easily could be spending $10 billion. ","This would however require increases in base rates of more than 4% a year, which we don't believe is reasonable or sustainable year in and year out. The precise spending level of $6.6 billion is not critical but the general goal of holding down base rate increases is important to us. ","Our liquidity as a percent of market cap continues at a strong level and it's nearly twice as thick as most of our peers. In fact, I'm pleased to report that we just renewed our $150 million revolver for five years at more attractive terms maturing in 2017. Keeping a thick level of liquidity, pre-funding our parent debt maturities a couple of years in advance and maintaining a strong backup plan continues what some of you have called our healthy belt, suspenders and sky hook approach. ","Recently Fitch upgraded our utility ratings with secure debt rated at A-, up a notch. Moody's has moved the utility and CMS from stable to positive outlook. And we welcome these votes of confidence in the plan. ","And here's our cash flow for the parent and the utility. These continue at healthy levels. This is our sensitivity ready-reckoner chart for 2012. With three of four convertibles now retired, the dilution exposure has been reduced substantially. So we'll drop the sensitivity in the next quarter's chart. ","With more gas requirements contracted our cash flow sensitivity to changes in gas prices is minimized from what we showed you a quarter ago at $60 million per dollar of gas price to $25 million as we show here. Now, we are however adding coal inventory with the shift of economic burn from coal to gas. We expect that higher than planned inventories will adversely impact working capital by about $50 million compared with planned. ","We've taken steps to mitigate this but we do have more work to do. ","We are on target for all of our financial report card measures as shown here. This is a good reflection of the health of our underlying business, operationally and from a regulatory standpoint. ","Now let me sort of end the formal part of the presentation before we take questions with my own good wishes to Laura and my deep appreciation for her being my business partner over the last decade. ","With her leadership, we avoided the abyss of bankruptcy, totally restructured both consumers and CMS balance sheets and helped restore consistency and integrity. Few companies have been on such a steep roller coaster and then delivered nine years of consistent earnings growth. We thank you, Laura, and we will miss you. ","So, thank you all for joining us today and John and I would be happy to take questions now. So, Grant, if you'd open the lines, we'd appreciate that and apologies again to, everybody, for coughing at you during the call. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","Thank you very much, Mr. Webb. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Kevin Cole from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. ","Kevin Cole - Credit Suisse","Hi. Good morning, guys. ","John Russell","Morning. ","Tom Webb","Morning. ","Kevin Cole - Credit Suisse","And thank you, Laura, for all your help over the last couple of years and keeping me up to speed. I guess \u2013 so I guess the first question would just be just on the change of decoupling. And so as I understand it the ruling even restricts very narrowed decoupling that would be focused on energy efficiency only. And so from here do you expect the MPSC to take this back to court or to abandon decoupling totally? Or can they just simply call it a tracker instead of decoupling and call it a day? ","John Russell","Kevin, it's really up to them to decide what they want to do. The unique position about us in this is that it is a DTE case. I mean, ABATE has also sued us and our case is pending. So we are a bit of an observer in this rather than an active party. So it's really up to the Commission to decide what they want to do. ","They have issued a request for parties to submit by I think the middle of May, comments about this ruling. So that's the first step that they've taken. They'll have to decide along with ABATE and DTE what they want to do in the next steps. So we'll kind of follow their action. It's hard for us to lead on this one because we really \u2013 it's not our case. ","Kevin Cole - Credit Suisse","Okay. And then I guess on the \u2013 on your weather slide where you list the recovery actions. Should I read it as of the categories under complete, those are for the most already locked in for year and we should see them probably more so in the third quarter? And then the underway is \u2013 are still yet to be seen but are on your goals?","Tom Webb","Good description. The complete categories are done. Decisions are done and actions have either been taken or completed. But you will see those roll into the second quarter and third quarter. Most of them, like the low cost financing, you're going to see that soon. The pension cost is actually one that is already been picked up upon. So there's a lot of good things happening there. ","The underway would be your interesting side because under efficiencies includes the restructuring program that John just described that we're doing. And on the economy, we are seeing a stronger tick-up in sales so there's a little piece of sales that's flowing through that we just didn't anticipate and we're still using our approach of being pretty conservative. ","We'd rather be wrong and surprised on the favorable side on this sort of thing. But it looked so good that we pretty much had to pick it up. So we feel pretty good about what's on the underway as well. But, yes, good characterization. Complete, we finished. Underway, coming events that are being worked on now. ","Kevin Cole - Credit Suisse","Great. Thank you, guys. ","John Russell","Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc. Please go ahead. ","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","Good morning. ","John Russell","Morning. ","Tom Webb","Morning. ","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","Congratulations, Laura, and again thank you for all your help over the years. ","Laura Mountcastle","Thank you. ","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","Can you give a sense of maybe a headcount or FTE count on the early out?","John Russell","Yes. It's still early. I mean, Paul, we've \u2013 the request closed Tuesday of this week, Tuesday evening. And just for everybody's benefit, we do this a little bit different than most companies. It's not based on everybody that submits gets this. It's basically we select who gets it based on the fact can we do business without that position in the future. ","Right now, I'd say though we would probably be anywhere, it could potentially be anywhere from 5% to 7% of our salaried workforce, which is around 300 people. That doesn\u2019t include the union results because as I said we're still in negotiations with them. ","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","And is there \u2013 I guess the first question touched on this. But is there anything \u2013 legislative approach to getting decoupling reinstated?","John Russell","There may be but, I mean, the fact that the Appeals Court looked at the law and what they ruled, even though it's disappointing for us particularly because of the write off, the word electric is not in the law. So it's hard to argue with a fact that if it was intentional they should have included it in there and since it was excluded their judgment seems logical. ","But there are other ways that we can get around this and I don't really want \u2013 and we're not getting around the law, but other things the regulators can do and I think that's why they're asking for the utilities to respond back to them in the next few weeks to decide what approach do we use. As Tom said, they resolved the \u2013 they ensured that the trackers \u2013 they supported trackers so there's ways you can track revenue. There's way you can track other things, which is fine. And I'm glad to see they endorsed that during the hearing so that'll be a published case, which means that that should have a lot of substance in the future for how we actually go about looking at this. ","So there are opportunities. We'll have to see what the Commission decides to do, what DTE decides to do and then we will certainly support what we can in that case. ","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","And you just kind of touch on a big topic this quarter has been coal to gas switching and potential forced burns, just kind of where CMS stands on that regard?","John Russell","Yes. We've seen the same thing. As I mentioned, our Zeeland plant, which I'm really glad we purchased a few years ago has gone from a peaking plant to a base load plant. We've even seen at times that the \u2013 certainly the combined cycle is dispatched ahead of coal at times, particularly some of our coal plans. But even peaking, even the simple cycle has dispatched some coal on a certain, some certain timeframes. So we're seeing that as an advantage that we have the gas plants. A disadvantage that we're really cycling the coal plants a lot more than we have in the past and right now some of the coal plants are out market. So it kind of fell in line with the strategy that we've had is to take some of these older units and mothball them in the next couple of years anyway. ","Tom Webb","There's another little benefit that comes with this. The downside is those coal inventories that I mentioned are a little high but a benefit is our PSCR costs are dropping sharply benefiting from these low gas prices. So you remember we talked a lot about keeping our base rate increases at or below the level of inflation. But we said GCR cost and PSCR costs were important to us. GCR cost are obviously negative each year creating lots of headroom for our customers. And PSCR costs, which we've been worried about, they're now half the size we were looking at maybe the last time we talked to you, everyone in New York. ","So there's a lot of benefits that come through this. ","John Russell","And, Paul, that\u2019s the headroom we're looking for. ","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","Got it. Thank you very much. ","John Russell","Thank you. ","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. ","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Can you hear me?","Tom Webb","","Yes. Welcome.","John Russell","Yes. ","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","First of all, congratulations, Laura. It's hard to imagine that it's kind of \u2013 I don't know. I'm surprised to hear it. So anyway, congratulations. So as I'm getting over that, let me \u2013 most of the questions have been asked but I want to sort of follow-up on and I'm sorry if I missed this. The weather adjusted numbers in the release, does those include leap year?","Tom Webb","They do. So when you read our numbers we have a little lift for leap year this year and you'll have a little fall off from that next year. And I'll give you just a rough rule of thumb for us on the electric side. It would be \u2013 I'd round it up and call it 0.3% of sales. Does that help you?","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Okay. So in other words wouldn't it be 1.7% of total system sales. It would be 1.4% more or less?","Tom Webb","Yes. If you were to \u2013 if we looked at electric sales and I took you to our chart, which was Slide 14, where the weather-adjusted number was about 2% and I'm talking about the full year. You'd take about 0.3% off of that or if you went to the number without energy efficiency, more an economic look, would be about 3% and you'd take 0.3% off of that. ","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Okay. So the plus 2% that you have for 2012 would be \u2013 I guess what would the number, I'm sorry, what would the number be if we were to basically back out the impact of the leap year?","Tom Webb","You'd take the full year number of 2%, which is just the weather-adjusted number and you'd make it 1.7%. Or you'd take the number that we show on the chart that says 3% without energy efficiencies, so more of the economic growth number and you'd make that 2.7%. ","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Okay. And then the number for the quarter itself \u2013 I mean, that's a full year number. Is that correct?","Tom Webb","Same thing. ","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Okay. That makes it look like residential weather adjusted numbers would be considerably lower. I mean, it looks like commercial and what have you \u2013 how do you explain what's going on weather adjusted with respect to those \u2013 do you follow me?","Tom Webb","We're seeing \u2013 I do. We're seeing good growth in the first quarter with residential up even if you took the leap year out. We are seeing industrial continuing up where we're talking about full year numbers in that 6% plus area. We already saw that again in the first quarter. But the commercial is the drag and it has been the drag for some time for us. ","We are watching our commercial customers hold back. So before they add on any headcount or add on another location or put back a location that they took out. Of if they're stores, reopening a store that\u2019s in a mall or whatever. They're holding back. The industrial recovery leads big. We're not seeing a good residential turnaround, which lagged. And the commercial hasn't yet made that big turn. That's ahead. ","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Okay. So the residential would be about 0.6% basically? Is that how we should think about it?","Tom Webb","And I don't know that I have \u2013 that number I gave you, that rule of thumb. I don't know if it's precise by class but it probably is close. ","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Okay. Listen, I appreciate it. ","Tom Webb","You're welcome. ","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","And thanks a lot, Laura. Have a great one. ","Laura Mountcastle","Thank you, Paul. ","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Barnett from Morningstar Research. Please go ahead. ","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research","Hey, good morning, everyone. ","John Russell","Morning. ","Tom Webb","Morning. ","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research","Congratulations, Laura. Just real quickly, you had kind of touched on this a little bit but with the voluntary separation program, I know your guidance assumes some cost reductions. I'm just wondering does that include also some assumption of charges for severance for the year in addition to the headcount reductions?","Tom Webb","Yes. Before we get the final numbers in and we're only in the middle of that process as John mentioned. Our estimates would be that the upfront cost of this will be somewhere between $5 million and $10 million. And that's all based on the number it takes that we approved. Because as people come in we have to say yes or no. And then the savings that we would get from that, we think will probably give you about a 12-month payback. So we will take the upfront one-time piece, call that out so that you can see that separately not let that impact your future if you choose, and then we will give you the ongoing savings that we get. Obviously a half a year this year and then the impact for the full year next year and tell you about that. And I would tell you that the savings this year probably be over $5 million and on a full year basis probably closer to $10 million.","Now those are rules of thumb just at the moment and we will know more the next time we're with you in an earnings call. We'll have it all complete and lay it out for exactly what it is.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research","Okay. Thanks for that.","Tom Webb","You\u2019re welcome.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research","And I know that you like to look over the long-term and a little bit further over the cycle with big investment plans, but with your environmental CapEx where you [ph] sold (31:16) out. Given the current dispatch fundamentals, are you taking another look at any of your plants and investment decisions you started to make already? Or how is that affecting your thinking?","John Russell","Yeah, Mark, we looked at that carefully. The \u2013 we're comfortable and confident the decision made with a small seven to mothball those and maybe ultimately retire the right move. The big five coal plants, the work that we\u2019ve done already makes sense because they are competitive. Although as I said earlier, we're moving them around a little bit, cycling them a little bit more than we have in the past. ","But the \u2013 also the belief we have that by 2015 when we see some of the environmental rules, math\u2019s and others go into effect, what we\u2019re going to see is capacity prices rise, gas prices begin to trickle up at that point and at that point, there's \u2013 we believe that these high efficient coal plants will be in the money. So as far as the decision we\u2019ve made, the decision we made to put full environmental controls on the big five coal units makes sense in the short term and the long term, mothballing the small seven makes sense in the short term and the long term.","","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research","","All right. Thanks. That\u2019s all for me.","John Russell","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ali Agha from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Thank you. Good morning.","John Russell","Good morning.","Tom Webb","Good morning.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Tom, going back to your offset that you laid out for us for the \u2013 and  through the quarter, could you give us a sense of what your interpretation was for the ELJ recommendation on your electric rate case? And some sense of what may have been assumed by you guys to keep you on your guidance track? Any color or thoughts there?","Tom Webb","Well, Ali, you know by now that we don\u2019t usually predict rate cases. We talked about our self-implementation, and where we are. For me to start giving you numbers that we've assumed is kind of self-defeating. So I won\u2019t add much to that except to say that we try to self-implement the appropriate numbers so that there isn\u2019t a large refund of any kind and just do the right thing there. But all the other assumptions you'd look at, we plan on normal weather, for example, and last year we were cooking. So there would be an upside if that were to happen again.","On the other hand, if it were a very mild summer, we'd have to take a hard look at what we\u2019re doing. That would be a big challenge on top of this mild winter. So I would say look for normal things not extraordinary things. Normal weather, reasonable recovery in our rate cases and the like, as you look for the future numbers. We've tried not to be aggressive anywhere here.","One thing that John and I probably didn\u2019t make really clear is that none of the recovery items we've shown you today cause us to do anything to the business that we think is unusual or make any sense. Sometimes you\u2019ll hear us talk about if we got some upside we'll put some more money in tree trimming or even the other way around. We haven\u2019t touched our forestry program. We haven\u2019t touched our outage program, because we want all of those things to hold their own if we can. We've worked at the things that are all good business decisions. So I hope that helps a little bit.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Sure. But I guess from another perspective, let me ask you this. Were you folks surprised by the number that the ELJ put out there? And relative to what your interim rate increase had baked into them?","Tom Webb","Well, I don\u2019t know if surprised is an important kind of view, but it\u2019s inconsistent with what we think the ultimate recovery should be.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Okay. Okay. And separately, John, to you. There have been rumblings that in Michigan at some point the governor himself is planning to lay out an energy plan or an energy vision. Which side do you have on that? Do you have in your mind any implications as far as whether it\u2019s open access or any other electric-related issues are concerned?","John Russell","Yes. I expect something to come out this fall. We\u2019ve talked to the administration. They\u2019re going through their plans right now for this. Most of the focus I think he is going to talk about, and it\u2019s still being developed right now so let me say that, is it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with retail open access or anything like that. It has more to do with infrastructure. And so, how do we have electric and gas infrastructure in place for the future of this state.","And I expect, and this is my assumption, I expect he\u2019ll also look at some of the natural resources that we have here in the state with some of the best storage facilities for gas in the country. The gas plays that we have, particularly up north. The Great Lakes that we have with water, I mean, we\u2019ve got some incredible natural resources here in Michigan and how do we position those for the future success of Michigan. He tends to be looking at the impact both from a financial impact to the state as well as an impact to the residents of this state in a favorable way. So that\u2019s what I think the focus is going to be. But we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do with them between now and then, and again I don\u2019t think he's landed on it yet. He's got some budget issues, which he's dealing with right now.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","I see. And last question just to keep a track of this bill you referred to retail open access. My understanding, it\u2019s still in Committee, hasn\u2019t come out. Is that where you think it basically ends up? And I mean is there a particular cut-off date by which we know that this bill is pretty much dead?","John Russell","Year-end.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Year-end.","John Russell","Yes, you\u2019re right. I expect it\u2019ll stay in Committee. It doesn\u2019t have any traction and year-end it'll die if nothing is done with it.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","I see. Thank you.","John Russell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Russo from Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead.","Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann","Hi. Good morning.","John Russell","Morning.","Tom Webb","Morning.","Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann","Congratulations, Laura, and best of luck.","Laura Mountcastle","Thanks very much.","Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann","In terms of the timing of the electric rate case final order, I think it\u2019s ripe for decision. Do we expect the Commission to rule on that by June 8? Or is there something that we can expect kind of any day now?","John Russell","No. Usually they make the decision close to the deadline. I mean with the new Chairman they may advance it a little bit, but at the end of the day there isn\u2019t a lot of motivation to make the decision earlier rather than later. But yes, I expect it just before. I don\u2019t think they'll go beyond the deadline because then as you know the law indicates that we can move forward and their rates are final. So expect just close to it. Although as I mentioned \u2013 I\u2019m sorry.","Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann","No, go ahead.","John Russell","On the gas side, I\u2019d \u2013 maybe a little bit different on the gas side.","Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann","Understood. My other questions have been asked and answered. Thank you.","John Russell","Thanks, Brian.","Tom Webb","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Steve Fleishman - Bank of America","Hi. Thanks. Good morning.","John Russell","Morning, Steve.","Tom Webb","Morning.","Steve Fleishman - Bank of America","Laura, 18 years, oh my gosh.","Laura Mountcastle","I know. Hard to believe.","Steve Fleishman - Bank of America","Congratulations. Couple of questions. First, on the \u2013 I believe there was another provision in the DTE order about smart grid spend and potentially not allowing that. Can you just talk about the order there and how you're thinking about it and implications?","John Russell","Yes. The one thing that came out there is the courts ruled that there wasn\u2019t a sufficient record in that case to move forward. I think as you know, we\u2019ve been pretty slow and methodical in our rollout of smart grid and implications to us; we\u2019ve already done what the court is asking DTE to do. And I think you\u2019ll have to ask them, but I think they\u2019ve already done it too. So we\u2019ve got the full business case reviewed with the staff and it\u2019s in our plan. So it really was that first case, that 2009 case they were focused on for them.","Steve Fleishman - Bank of America","Okay, great. And then, second kind of a high-level question. Obviously you guys did that nice additional dividend hike earlier this year. Should we assume now that you have the payout ratio in line that you\u2019ll grow dividends kind of in-step with the earnings growth?","Tom Webb","That would be a good assumption.","John Russell","Yes, that would be a good assumption.","Steve Fleishman - Bank of America","Okay. One last question. On \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you have handy the data on capacity factors of your coal fleet this quarter versus last and maybe also of your combined cycles. Or your \u2013 or otherwise your mix?","John Russell","Yeah, I can get \u2013 I don\u2019t -- let me try to find it right here. I don\u2019t know. Do you guys have it real quick? We don\u2019t \u2013 yes, I don\u2019t think we have it by quarter, Steve. We can give you...","Tom Webb","Okay, no we can do it.","John Russell","Did you do it by quarter? Good. Okay. I don\u2019t have it here.","Tom Webb","So let me just make sure I'm getting this read right. Campbell 1 about 68% capacity factor in the \u2013","John Russell","That\u2019s coal.","Tom Webb","First quarter. And Campbell 3, another big coal unit, about 50% and then the KARN units run about 35% and 50% in the first quarter. There\u2019s two of them over there, coal units. And then jump down to like Zeeland, the combined cycle is 71% in the first quarter. So if that gives you a little sense as to what you\u2019re seeing.","Steve Fleishman - Bank of America","Do you by any chance have what those would have done last year\u2019s first quarter as a comparison?","Tom Webb","I tell you, Steve, I mean Laura's stepping down and now you're asking all the detailed questions. All right. Here you go. Let me do Zeeland first. So the 71-ish percent in this quarter, same quarter a year ago was 27%. And the \u2013 let me use the Campbell 3 unit because it's the big coal unit that\u2019s up on the west side of state where it was about 50% in the first quarter. It was about 77% in the first quarter a year ago.","John Russell","Tom, let me just on that one, though, we had a large outage on that plant this year in this quarter. So Campbell 3 would \u2013 because it\u2019s efficient, very efficient it would normally run. So that is one exception, Steve, when you look at it \u2013","Tom Webb","So let me round the Campbell units out just in my way of doing it because there was an outage on one of the other units last year that I was going to skip. I'd say that coal, the big coal units on the west side of the state were around 70-plus percent and what you\u2019re seeing now if I kind of average them out and think about some changes, well Campbell 1 was running at about 68%. So you can see that transition. But the big deal is to see the shift on the gas side. Because remember even though they're big coal units, they're still big efficient base load units. Zeeland going from 27% capacity factor in the first quarter of last year up to 71% in the first quarter of this year. That\u2019s probably the best indicator for you to see what we're looking at. Does that help?","Steve Fleishman - Bank of America","That\u2019s great. Thank you so much.","Tom Webb","You are very welcome. Thanks for joining.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Good morning. My questions were asked and answered but, Laura, congratulations and good luck. We\u2019ll miss you.","Laura Mountcastle","Thank you, Jonathan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question then comes from Andy Levi from Avon Capital. Please go ahead.","Andy Levi - Avon Capital","Hi. Can you hear me?","Tom Webb","Yes. We can.","John Russell","Yes.","Andy Levi - Avon Capital","Hi. Good morning. And, Laura, I thought it was 20 years I knew you.","Laura Mountcastle","(inaudible)","Andy Levi - Avon Capital","Yeah, so I think still have that San Francisco 49ers hat you sent. So I wish you luck, Laura and I\u2019ll miss you. Just three very quick questions. Could you just talk a little bit more about you mentioned a possible settlement in the gas case. Any other details you can give us on that as far as kind of \u2013?","Tom Webb","Why don\u2019t I just jump in and say that kind of thing, it's really too soon to talk about. You can imagine if settlement discussions are ahead people don\u2019t like talking about them. So I think John described it well saying it\u2019s small. It's a good candidate for that. So it\u2019s something we\u2019ll talk about later.","Andy Levi - Avon Capital","Okay. And then as far as the employee reductions. Is there kind of a rule of thumb that we can use as far as cost per employee savings wise?","Tom Webb","You can but I will tell you, the real issue there will be our choice on how many we actually replace and how many we take that savings on. So even though I give you a number like that, I think it'd be better to see sort of the whole millions and that indication I gave earlier that the upfront cost for the size of the pool we\u2019re talking about, $5 million to $10 million. And then the savings being a little over $5 million for this half a year, closer to $10 million for a full year, so one year payback. If you don\u2019t mind, I'd rather leave you with that instead of employee indicators because the incrementality will have a big factor.","Andy Levi - Avon Capital","Okay. Thank you.","Tom Webb","Okay. Thank you.","Andy Levi - Avon Capital","And one last question. On the decoupling case are you guys going to make comments on that too?","John Russell","On the DTE case?","Andy Levi - Avon Capital","Yes. File comments or are you going to leave it to everyone else?","John Russell","Yeah. Depending on what the parties that were sued decide to do. So it is really their lead and it was ABATE bringing the case to DTE with the Commission. So it really will follow \u2013 we'll work with DTE and the Commission to decide what they want to do and then, yeah, we can file amicus briefs and other things to support that. But it really is their lead because we are not a party to this case.","Andy Levi - Avon Capital","Right. Okay. Thank you.","Tom Webb","Thanks Andy.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","I have a follow-up on the coal. Can you talk about your rail contracts and your coal contracts and is there any take or pay risk we have to worry about?","John Russell","No. We've got multiple contracts \u2013 we got contracts that are laddered in over several years, Paul. Right now though as Tom said, we\u2019ve got a lot of capacity in our coal and so what we\u2019re working with is to burn that coal whether it's Eastern or Western, to work with the rails, to try to improve the delivery, maybe delay the delivery to do the best that we can from that standpoint. But, no, it's not really take or pay. I mean we\u2019ll take the coal. We would just rather not have the inventory if we can avoid it.","Tom Webb","So I think a lot of companies are facing this right now and therefore the rail companies and the coal companies are talking to everybody about the right thing to do. And recall we used to have a lot of long-term shipping contracts. Today, they're more short-term in nature. So there\u2019s actually an opportunity to address this economic issue maybe for the benefit of our customers here. So we'll be working in a cooperative way with our suppliers to do the best we can.","John Russell","And just one thing that may separate us from others is that we do have the barge. I mean because we are in the Great Lakes. So we have both rail and barge so we're not fully dependent on the rail.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","Okay. Thank you.","John Russell","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you for your question there. We've got no further questions currently in the queue.","John Russell","","All right. Well let me wrap it up. Thank you all for joining our call today. I do appreciate the questions. They were very good and also the recognition for Laura who we will all miss as everybody else will. And it does seem odd only 18 years with us. I mean, geez, too early, Laura.","First quarter weather presented a challenge for us, I think we covered that. We're taking a number of steps, recovery actions to keep us on track and to deliver our 2012 financial goals. We remain committed to delivering on our promises, providing value to our customers and to you, our shareholders.","So thank you for your interest in CMS Energy.

After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time.","Just a reminder, there will be in rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12 PM Eastern Time running through February 11. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations' section.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. DV Rao, Vice President, Treasurer, Financial Planning and Investor Relations.","Venkat Dhenuvakonda Rao - Vice President, Treasurer, Financial Planning and Investor Relations of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are John Russell, President and Chief Executive Officer; Patti Poppe, Senior Vice President of Distribution Operations, Engineering and Transmission; and Tom Webb, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","This presentation contains forward looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially.","This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and also posted on our website.","Now, let me turn the call over to John.","John G. Russell - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, DV, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on our year-end earnings call. I'll begin the presentation with a review of last year's results and this year's priorities before turning the call over to Patti for a review of our unique customer and investor model. Tom will provide the financial results and outlook, then as usual, close with the Q&A.","2015 earnings per share were $1.89, up 7% from the prior year's actual result. We are raising our 2016 guidance to $1.99 to $2.02 per share. This is an increase of 5% to 7%, reflecting our predictable and consistent 5% to 7% performance year-over-year. Recently, our board approved a 7% dividend increase, raising it to $1.24 per share. This results in a competitive payout ratio of 62%.","2015 was a record-setting year. I'm most proud of our safety result, the best in our company's 130-year history. Our distribution minutes were the best in a decade and the generation plant performance was the best ever. Customer satisfaction rose to first quartile for both residential electric and gas customers.","Since 2006, the company has achieved breakthrough performance. Safety incidents are down 79%. Productivity is up 62%. Outage minutes are down 34%, and employee engagement is first quartile. I'm confident this performance will continue to drive the results you have been accustomed to. These areas will continue to improve, and we look to other initiatives to improve service and reduce costs.","Michigan currently has a strong energy law on the books. The law supports 10% renewable energy, energy efficiency standards, forward-looking test years, and a retail open access capped at 10%.","As you would expect, the Governor is focused on the water issue and Flint. His attention should be focused on helping the people of Flint, a city that we serve. In the meantime, we expect the energy committees in the House and Senate to continue their work. We expect an updated energy law will be passed by the first half of this year. But keep in mind \u2013 and this is important \u2013 the update to the energy law is not in our plan. In fact, we have not included any law related capital investments in our plan.","For 2016, we plan to continue our breakthrough performance. Operationally, we will continue to make safety a top priority for our employees, customers and the communities we serve. Again, this year, we are planning cost reductions to our industry-leading performance. We will continue to execute our strategy and deliver the same predictable financial performance as we have in the past.","Now, I'd like to welcome and turn the call over to Patti.","Patricia K. Poppe - Senior Vice President of Distribution Operations, Engineering and Transmission of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company, Consumers Energy Co.","Thank you, John. We're especially pleased to announce today that we are raising our guidance beginning in 2017 to 6% to 8% from 5% to 7%. This reflects the increase in capital investments to $17 billion over the next 10 years from $15.5 billion as announced last week.","As most of you know, we have been delivering 7% growth each year for over a decade. While this increase reflects the higher level of capital spending, it demonstrates our comfort in continuing 7% growth, the midpoint of our new range for years ahead. You might ask why we're not raising the guidance for 2016, we still have opportunities to reinvest O&M and to strengthen our reliability and the higher level of capital investment doesn't fully kick in until later this year.","Our confidence in the sustainability of a premier earnings growth rate is a reflection of our business model where we self-fund a large portion of the capital investment growth for our customers. We do this by reducing our cost and avoiding the need for block equity with its associated dilution. This model permits us to keep base rate increases at or below inflation resulting in sustainable growth.","Both our core and increased level of capital investment are targeted to improve customer service, enhance reliability, and among several others things, increase affordability by providing for cost reductions. The $1.5 billion increase in capital investment includes $800 million in the next five years to replace aging infrastructure and improve service reliability. It also includes another $700 million in the following five years to provide for the clean energy resources we believe will be needed to meet the Clean Power Plan in the most economical way.","We still have considerable opportunities for even more capital investment. Those opportunities include replacing PPAs when they expire. These opportunities alone represent the need for an additional 2,000 megawatts of capacity and around another $2 billion of capital investment. We also need to do more with our gas infrastructure and modernization of the grid. And likely, we'll need further capital investments for renewables. None of this is attributable to the update in the 2008 energy law. These investments will be required with or without a change to that law.","In the past, we reminded you that we've been able to reduce our cost while most of our peers add cost. Our track record is evidence of our ability to be more productive for our customers and our plans for the future continue this. They are based on good business decisions that have already been made that permit ongoing legacy cost reductions, productivity gains as the workforce turns over, the shift from coal to gas generation, the introduction of smart meters, and the elimination of waste.","As we improve customer quality through better work processes, we'll save on overtime cost and temporary workers by simply doing it right the first time. For example, nearly one-third of the time when we roll trucks on a job, something goes wrong. The right parts aren't on the truck or other parties who need to be on site aren't always on time. We're aggressively pursuing these opportunities to improve quality for our customers. For 2014 and 2015, we reduced our cost by 4% and by 2018 expect to have reduced our cost by at least 10%.","While our model is successful with our cost reductions, it helps equally as sales grow. Our team believes that our sales growth will be about 2% this year and in the future, but we plan conservatively. For the purposes of executing our model, we're assuming growth of 1%.","We put all of this together and end up with the attractive business model for our customers, where their level of service and affordability improves every year and the same model permits us to deliver 6% to 8% earnings growth beginning in 2017. It's a reaffirmation of our confidence in our ability to deliver earnings per share and dividend growth at a level that you have come to expect.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company","Thanks, Patti. Let's look at the business for 2015, 2016 and beyond. As you can see here in 2015, our earnings grew by $0.12 or 20% on a weather normalized basis. We achieved these consistent results despite the fact that December was the warmest on record, exceeding by 10% the previous record in 1923. For December, Michigan was 37% warmer than normal.","As we mentioned last week, we offset the mild weather and a couple of year-end storms by achieving a tax settlement in Michigan, putting off some donations to our foundation and other improvements. With the mild weather, bills were substantially lower than expected which is helpful to our customers, but it also results in lower uncollectible accounts.","So weather was not normal, dragging down profits. Our commitment to manage the work was normal. No excuses from us. We're pleased to have continued great progress for our customers and once again delivered on 7% growth for our owners.","We achieved all of our financial targets for 2015. These included strong capital investment, healthy balance sheet ratios, dramatic customer price decreases, robust operating cash flow growth, top-end of guidance EPS growth, and as announced last week, another substantial increase in our dividend.","For 2016, we're pleased to have raised our guidance to reflect 5% to 7% growth on top of high end 2015 results, which were at the top end of guidance for 2015. We continue to build success upon success, no recess here.","While our electric and gas rate cases primarily reflect capital investment, they also permit us to flow through productivity improvements to our customers. This is one of the elements of our model that makes high-end earnings growth sustainable. It's also noteworthy that three quarters of the rate change impact already has either been authorized or self-implemented.","And let's not forget the Ferrari \u2013 excuse me, as Patti would say, the Tesla in the garage. After all, the Tesla does zero mph to 60 mph in 2.8 seconds. That's faster than the Ferrari Spider. At DIG, we have long-term energy contracts locked in providing stable results. And with a large portion of capacity available, we continue to have room for upside.","Here's our sensitivity slide that we provide each quarter to assist with assessing our prospects. There's not a lot of news, there seldom is. You can see that with reasonable planning assumptions and with robust risk mitigation, the probability of large variances from our plan are minimized. And while we look forward to the 2008 energy law update, our plan does not reflect any of the upside associated with it.","Our cash flow and earnings growth are driven by our capital investment program. With our recent announcement, increase in capital investment by $1.5 billion to $17 billion over the next 10 years, earnings and cash flow growth will accelerate. Starting in 2017, we are lifting EPS growth guidance to 6% to 8%, bracketing historic growth at 7%. The higher investment kicks in for 2017, and we have more O&M reinvestment to accomplish yet this year. We still have opportunities in excess of $3 billion to add to our plan in the future.","For the last 12 years, our gross operating cash flow has been growing by more than $100 million each year. Since 2004, it has increased from $353 million a year to $1.9 billion. Over the next five years, it should grow about $800 million to $2.7 billion. Cash is king. Our net operating cash flow also grows by $0.5 billion. This reflects capital investment recovery, aggressive working capital management, and honestly, a little help from Uncle Sam.","New bonus depreciation is welcome, funding part of our increased capital investment and preserving NOLs for future shelter. Amazingly \u2013 I have to admit, amazingly, we may go over seven years instead of five years with no need for dilutive block equity.","While the benefit of bonus depreciation is about a third of our CapEx lift of $1.5 billion, it's half of the rate base increases for the 2016 to 2020 period. With the lift, billing CapEx in behind the Jackson Plant purchase, which was accelerated to December 2015 from 2016, and our incremental pension contribution rate base rises $1.2 billion, one half of which is funded by bonus depreciation. This results in an upside to earnings of $0.02 or 1% a year and that starts in 2017.","Here is our new report card. We anticipate another good year in 2016 and an even stronger year in 2017. With no big bets and robust risk mitigation, our model serves our customers and you well. Few companies are able to deliver top-end earnings growth, while substantially improving value and service for customers.","Value for customers is what has made our plan so sustainable. Here is how we do it. Reasonable cost reductions of 2% to 3%, conservative sales growth at 1%, and other tools that avoid dilution worth another 2% allow us to self-fund 5 points to 6 points of earnings per share growth. Customer base rate increases can be at or below the level of inflation.","This very same model that self-funds investments for our customers also allows us to self-fund a large portion of our capital needs. The model has worked for a decade. It's our plan for the next five years. That's making it attractive for investors and customers and consequently, sustainable.","John, Patti and I will be visiting Boston and New York next week, and we look forward to answering your questions about these plans. So until then, Steve, would you please open the lines to take some questions today.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much, Mr. Webb. And our first question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Daniel L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning, everybody.","Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company","Good morning.","Patricia K. Poppe - Senior Vice President of Distribution Operations, Engineering and Transmission of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company, Consumers Energy Co.","Good morning.","Daniel L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","I guess we've been waiting and debating this \u2013 the growth rate increase for a number of years. So, it finally came. What drew you guys and the board to go ahead and make the decision to officially raise the growth rate now versus waiting for legislation or just kind of following the old playbook of beating every year without raising the growth rate?","Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company","Dan, you've been pushing us the hardest for the longest period. I remember saying uncle in meetings with you, so I'll turn this over to John.","John G. Russell - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good setup. Thank you. Really what we needed to do was vest (17:14) the capital. I mean this is what we talked about, I think, in the last call when we announced Patti's succession plan. The end of the day is we can't wait for the law to be done for us to make investments for our customers. And that was clear as we're moving forward. So, as we increased the amount, bonus depreciation obviously took a little bit of that away, but it certainly allowed us to continue to grow at even a higher rate than we had before.","But also, keep our customer rates at or below the rate of inflation. And that's something that we finally decided to do. And as Patti mentioned in her presentation, we also have increased the operating cost, particularly in the O&M area that we're seeing the results that our customers want from service and quality, and that's really what we're going after. So now is the time, and obviously with our performance, we think bracketing it between 6% to 8% is the right approach going forward.","Go ahead, Patti.","Patricia K. Poppe - Senior Vice President of Distribution Operations, Engineering and Transmission of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company, Consumers Energy Co.","And with our operating plan, we have increased confidence in our ability to control cost and make those capital investments, many of them which help enable those cost reductions to protect our customers from any kind of rate spikes. So we feel very good about the total combined effort to achieve 6% to 8%.","Daniel L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And then I guess kind of in the spirit of keeping the rate \u2013 the bill inflation below the rate of inflation, legislation presuming it gets done and you have another layer of CapEx needs to be spent, does that provide incremental investment opportunities or do you think that just re-sequences how you're going to spend this expanded capital budget?","John G. Russell - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I mean, as Tom pointed out in his slides, there are opportunities of $3 billion on top of what we already are talking about. But part of that has to come out of not only the law, but I think what's going to come out of that regardless of the law is what happens with Michigan's response for the Clean Power Plan. I mean that really is going to drive what we do as far as meeting that plan. And those opportunities aren't in there. And as Tom mentioned in his presentation too, we've got some PPAs that are expiring over the next 10 years or within the next 10 years that we need to look at too and see how we're going to replace those.","Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company","I will just add one thing. Patti mentioned just a minute ago the robust nature of the model and the cost reductions that come out of some of the investment. Don't forget, of the $3 billion opportunity in CapEx we just talked about, could be that $2 billion is what John just said related to these PPAs, we can replace our PPAs cheaper than the PPAs. We can build plants cheaper than what the PPAs are today. So therefore, the model really works if and when those come in. We still keep our base rate growth down, and we still can grow a little further.","John G. Russell - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And Dan, I think what's most important in all this discussion, we continue to do what we say we're going to do. Consistent, predictable regardless of what the guidance is, we tend to hit it, we have it every single year on top of actual results, which I think separates us from some others.","Daniel L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Very good. Thank you, guys.","Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company","Thanks, Dan.","John G. Russell - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Dan.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning.","John G. Russell - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company","Good morning.","Patricia K. Poppe - Senior Vice President of Distribution Operations, Engineering and Transmission of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company, Consumers Energy Co.","Good morning.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning. If I look at the data correctly, I believe weather normalized electric sales were down 0.7% in 2015. Can you just walk through what caused that? Was that a surprising development? And what gives the confidence that it will be up 1% in 2016?","Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company","Good question. And thank you. And you can see that on what we call 11 and 12 of our data that comes out with the press release. The sales were down, and residential was flat, commercial was off a little bit, as you can see there, but industrial was off a little bit. Recall this. We actually can't name the customer here, but we do have a customer who has spent most of the year getting a supply issue taken care of. And so, they have actually dampened our sales through the year. They're not a big margin, so it's not a big issue.","They are starting to turn up already, and so their restoration of just getting back to where they used to be \u2013 and I suspect they're going to be better \u2013 will kind of offset the negative with a plus this year. And here's the important part. I would tell you our internal data tells us that we're going to grow more than what we've shown you today. So, where we show you 1% and then 4% on the industrial side, our internal data gives us higher numbers.","We just don't believe in going out there with something that we can't deliver on. So, we've put in more conservative numbers. Here's what's going to drive the uptick. I think by the way residential and commercial will still be a little uneven, but I'll just call it flat. The industrial side is coming around because we're seeing new companies hooking up new facilities, new businesses coming into the state and our existing business is doing better.","So, for example, we got a brake maker \u2013 high-end brake maker who is going to add 24 megawatts. And I mean they're building the building and doing the work right now, so that's coming out. We see one of our automotive folks actually putting in new paint facilities and running more extended periods of time. That's another big chunk of megawatts coming in that wasn't there before.","We see just a variety of people, particularly on the food side, housing side, plastic and rubber sector, and paper and paper product sector that are all giving us precise information about upticks. So, we see some good news and we're happy for that. But we'll tell you 1% growth, we think, will be quite good, suits our model.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Understood. Second question. What happens to the model if anything \u2013 if we do come back into a period of rising gas prices which we used to have, but obviously haven't had for the last several years, does that impact your model and your planning in any way?","Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company","No, I would just tell you that these prices are phenomenal. And even if they did rise, and I admit if you look at it from this moment to the next moment a year from now, say, they did rise, sure, that's an increase. But people are looking at absolute bills, writing checks. And when they look at where they were \u2013 even if we had a substantial rise and they look at where they were just a few years ago, way better situation, they compare gas for whether it's home heating or industrial or electric, they compare that even with higher prices to alternatives, it's pretty doggone attractive.","So we don't see that as a big issue. But I'll tell you again, if you saw the detail of our five-year plans, you'd see that we have gas prices rising quite a bit, and even inside of that, our model still delivers what we tell you about with being able to keep base rates low, bills low if we can and also grow the business. So for us, we don't see an immediate concern.","John G. Russell - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me just add there, Ali. One thing about the gas business is to remind everybody we've got a substantial gas business here, the fourth largest in the country. We've got the largest utility storage fields in the country. So at the end of the day when gas prices rise, we've got over 300 billion cubic feet of stored gas both base and working gas that we can draw out which really keeps us competitive in a rising market.","It tends to work the other way in a declining market actually because the gas in the storage fields tends to be a little bit higher price than the market. So it does give us a competitive advantage, allows us to use our transmission system fully, but we're buying gas all through the year which really helps our customers.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Understood. Last question. Again, great model, great track record. As you look out over the next five years, 10 years, what's your biggest worry? What could potentially go wrong here?","John G. Russell - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I like what we have. I mean, Patti is sitting here next to me. I feel pretty good about the next five years because our plan is unique and we can see clearly for the five years. And the sensitivities that you talk about, we've planned for conservatively. So I feel good about that. I actually think the opportunities we have and as Patti's talked about here with the growth rate and some of the other things we're talking about, are better than we've had in the past. And I will turn it over to you; obviously, it's your five years.","Patricia K. Poppe - Senior Vice President of Distribution Operations, Engineering and Transmission of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company, Consumers Energy Co.","Yeah. I would say that we are optimistic, and we \u2013 to sustain the kind of performance that we have become known for, does require endurance, it requires innovation and we have that. And so we are prepared. We have a good eye on what our opportunities are to continue to make the model work. And so, we are, I would say, very optimistic about our future look here in the next five years to 10 years.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company","Thanks, Ali.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. And Jonathan Arnold, your line is open.","Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company","Jonathan, you might be on mute.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning.","John G. Russell - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company","Good morning, Paul.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I'm looking at the Tesla slide. Could you just help me with one question on that?","Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company","Yeah.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","The capacity line, are those percentages? Is that megawatts or...?","Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company","So, when you look down at the yellow bright part in the bottom, that's the percent available. So, if you look at capacity in the future, we have 90% of our capacity available. Now, near-term, obviously, we don't. So, in 2016, there's 10% available and 2017 25% available, then we've held our powder dry beyond that. So, when you look at the energy line, you can see it's only 25% available. We've contracted most of that.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And then how deep are those markets? And what kind of visibility do you have on pricing?","Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company","Well, the bilateral markets do a lot to tell you where you really are right now. Our sense is the energy markets got to some pretty good levels that we liked. So, over the last couple of years, we locked in some long-term contracts.","On the capacity markets, we still see there's going to be some movement up and down and we see in the ups, there will be opportunity. You may recall from the past, we're not trying to wait for a peak and miss it. We're just layering in these capacity contracts as we get to a little bit better level. So, we were doing it at $1 and then $2 and $3, and we've done some recently in the $3-plus zone.","But we think there's still going to be some opportunities. We like having DIG available as a backup as it had to bid into our utility, but we also like the opportunity that when those markets rise a little bit because people see a shortfall in zone seven, we can service that market and that's the upside of the $20 million and $40 million that shows on the slide.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","What's the latest MISO view on the capacity adequacy in zone seven?","John G. Russell - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Paul, it looks like \u2013 I will use what the commission has. The latest update is we're about at the capacity level. We're about 500 megawatts short for zone seven for this year. But based on 22,000 megawatts, that's in the noise. So really, I think the outlook if you're thinking about the future \u2013 let's look at 2017. I mean as you know, we're closing seven plants in April of this year. There is some other activity that may occur based on the Clean Power Plan. So let's see what happens in 2017. But right now, Michigan should be good for this year. I don't see that as a problem. But we're right at about that line right now. And also, there's not a lot of new plants being built. So, really it's using the excess capacity up.","Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company","So you can figure our view by looking at that slide you just reviewed, we would not hold 90% of our capacity available for the long-term future if we thought over time there was no opportunity for uptick in those prices.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you. And I think \u2013 how many years is it now you've hit the top end of 5% to 7%?","Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company","13.","John G. Russell - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company","(29:44)","John G. Russell - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Tom, say that again, 13.","Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company","13.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Can I assume from that you're pretty confident that you can hit the top end of the new range?","John G. Russell - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I certainly am. Patti?","Patricia K. Poppe - Senior Vice President of Distribution Operations, Engineering and Transmission of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company, Consumers Energy Co.","We have communicated a range of 6% to 8%. We're very confident in our 7% performance, which is the midpoint of that range.","John G. Russell - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's a good model.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you very much. And when do we go to 7% to 9%?","John G. Russell - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Paul.","Patricia K. Poppe - Senior Vice President of Distribution Operations, Engineering and Transmission of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company, Consumers Energy Co.","Nice talking to you, Paul.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks guys.","Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company","There is one thing that I will add as I know you're pulling our leg a little bit on that. But remember what we have said for a long time, we might get up to 6% to 8% because we really think that is the very high end of the best performers who can do it year in and year out. We think when you try to become something you are not, so you try to get performance that's better than a utility. Again, it's only a matter of time before the model breaks. That's why we believe so passionately in the model. We could give you 9% and 10%, but our customers would feel it, so that's not very sustainable. So sorry, my $0.02.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks, again.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Your line is open.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, good morning.","John G. Russell - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company","Good morning.","Patricia K. Poppe - Senior Vice President of Distribution Operations, Engineering and Transmission of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company, Consumers Energy Co.","Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","So, first quick question, a little bit of a follow-up actually. Let's talk about what's in the garage there again if you will. I want to know \u2013 the Tesla, let's say. What is the long-term assumption here? So clearly, we have a potential short situation in the near or medium term. You're raising your long-term expectations. How do you juxtapose the higher growth rate with the price trajectory in the long term here for MISO capacity? And I suppose that's implicitly asking where do you see prices going again in the five year to 10 year range?","Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company","So it's interesting, you tied the Tesla slide which is not the utility to the utility story. And what I would tell you, we see our earnings growth and 90%-plus of our business out of the utility in that 6% to 8% range. And so we feel very good about that. Now, when you talk about the small business and enterprises that's outside of the utility, that's really the big piece that you're referring to here. And all we're saying is we've got a nice steady pattern of profit contribution from that group and this plan.","But it is a nice upside opportunity, because our view \u2013 and we might be wrong \u2013 but our view is that we will see capacity prices reach points where they will be a little higher than this $3 zone that we're in today, the $3 to $4 zone, and we'll be able to take advantage of that and help people. So we see that as an upside that's not in our plan. We think when we don't know something and we can't count on it, we just don't build it into our plan. We're pretty old fashioned that way.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","So said otherwise, you're not banking on any improvement and the 6% to 8% \u2013 if prices were to stay in this $3 range, that is your assumption just said differently?","Thomas J. Webb - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CMS Energy Corporation and Consumers Energy Company","Yeah. Or I'll say it my way because I know you're asking a little bit different. We really do believe in the 6% to 8% growth. And we believe that there are opportunities to do better than that. We may have chances to plough it right back into our business for our customers as you've seen us do for some time, because new things happen.","And if there are things we can do for our customers, that makes either their prices better or their service better, we're going to go for it. And still let you have the 6% to 8%. So I know Julien, you don't want to hear this, but we don't see a plan where you would expect to see our growth above 6% to 8%. And if that's not good news, that's just the way we think.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. That's great. And then, quickly following up on the other side of the equation here the dividend. How are you thinking about that in the context of this higher growth rate? And I suppose just to frame it, you've talked about outsized dividend growth relative to earnings at least in the past, how do you think about that now?","John G. Russell - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think part of the dividend increase, we've been very clear. We expect the dividend increase to grow with the growth of the company. So when we talk about outsized or larger, it's larger than what most in the industry increase. But as far as the payout ratio, it's very \u2013 it's right at the level that we want to be at. So at the end of the day, I expect the future dividend increase to grow with our 6% to 8% guidance in 2017 or 5% to 6% guidance in 2016.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. All right. Great. Well, thank you very much for taking the time.","John G. Russell - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Thomas J.

Our earnings new release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on our website.","This presentation contains forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements should be considered in the context of the risks and other factors detailed in our SEC filings. These factors could cause CMS Energy's and Consumers' results to differ materially.","This presentation also includes non-GAAP. A reconciliation of each of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in the appendix and posted in the Investor section of our website.","Now, let me turn the call over to John","John Russell","Thank you, D.V., and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call. I missed the last earnings calls due to emergency surgery. Now, I'm back and feeling good and I want to thank the management team for doing a great job while I was recovering. Now, let's get to business.","I'll begin the call with an update on earnings, provide an operational and legislative update, and talk about some recent renewable energy developments and how those fit into the generation portfolio. And then I'll turn over to Tom, he will discuss in greater detail the quarter and additional upside.","Adjusted earnings per share for the first nine months were $1.51. This is up $0.09 from last year, or 10% on a weather adjusted basis. Today we are raising the bottom-end of our 2015 adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.01 to a new range of $1.87 to a $1.89. This is up 6% to 7% over last year. In addition, we are introducing 2016 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $1.97 to $2.01. This is up 5% to 7%, which supports our consistent and year-over-year predictable performance.","Here is a view of our past performance and future expectations. Our past earnings performance has been consistent and predictable. We are confident in our plan to achieve the higher end of earnings growth.","Further growth up side not in our plan include more renewables, new capacity and more investment in our gas system, already one of the largest in the United States with 1.7 million customers, 29,000 miles of distribution and transmission pipeline, and over 300 billion cubic feet of annual deliveries.","Operationally, we continue to have strong performance both electric and gas residential customers' rate us in the first quartile for customer satisfaction. We continue to leverage our large gas system with low natural gas prices and the largest LDC gas storage system in the country.","We have invested more than $400 million in gas transmission and compression in recent years and our customers are benefiting from that investment. Our customers are paying 60% less for natural gas than one decade ago, creating headroom for additional investments.","Overall, the businesses operating at a very high level and we're sitting company records in safety, reliability, and generation. Recently, our unit three coal plant completed a record continuous run of 679 days. That is the sixth longest ever in the United States. Our major projects continue on schedule. We're seeing better-than-expected results from the Ludington upgrade, smart meters are being very well received by our customers and we're adding more gas compression.","In addition to the strong operational results, we've had a string of recent economic development wins. Our strategy has been to partner with state agencies and target companies looking to expand or site new facilities in Michigan. As these customers begin operations we should see an increase our sales and a lift to the overall economy.","The update, the Michigan Energy Law continues to move closer towards the goal line. The Senate and House are closely aligned and final bills are expected after hearings are completed this month. Over the next two months we expect committee and full votes from both the Senate and the House. This will allow time for the Governor to sign the Bill into law by the end of the year.","A comprehensive update will help to eliminate unfair subsidies and integrated resource plan will ensure there are sufficient resources in place to meet the supply needs of our customers and to comply with Federal and State environmental regulations. But as a reminder, our long-term plan is based on the existing 2008 Energy Law and not changes to this law.","We're not waiting for new energy legislation to introduce more renewables into our portfolio. Recently we signed a competitive wind purchase power agreement, the 100-megawatt contract spent 15 years with an option to purchase. We have broken ground on the state's largest solar gardens at Grand Valley State University's campus. By the end of 2016 we plan to have 10 megawatts of utility scale solar on our system. These additions to our portfolio will increase the renewable energy share beyond the 10% required in the 2008 energy law.","With the retirement of seven coal units next spring, our coal mix will shrink to less than 24% of total capacity by 2017. The addition of the Jackson gas fired plant will add more flexibility while reducing operating costs. The major expansion at our Ludington Pumped Storage facility also will improve our portfolio.","Overall, we're in a good position to meet the EPA's clean power plan. Although, there still is a lot of work to do we expect Michigan to be fully compliant with the deadline.","Now, I will turn the call over to Tom to discuss the third quarter results.","Thomas Webb","Thanks, John. Welcome back. Thank you for joining our call today everyone. We appreciate your interest in our company and for spending time with us today.","Our third quarter results of $0.53 a share reflect continued consistent progress up $0.16 from a year ago. All business units exceeded plan for strong quarter. For the first nine months, earnings at $1.51 a share were up $0.09. And on a weather normalized basis, earnings were up $0.13 or 10%.","As you can see here, and as usual, strong performance positions us for delivering the high end of full year guidance. As shown in the dotted circle cost performance continues to be robust.","This slide has become popular with many. Higher than planned cost reductions and favorable weather provide substantial room for O&M reinvestment. This is improves customer reliability, generates incremental productivity and accelerate planned major outage at DIG from 2015 to 2016.","I just walked the DIG site and the outage is going very well. The celebration accomplishes two benefits. Accelerating the outage cost into 2015 when we have ample room to absorb it and freeing up capacity and what will be a tight market in 2016.","In addition, you may recall that we will be increasing DIG's capacity by 38 megawatts to 748 megawatts. The impact of this reinvestment in 2015 makes it easier to achieve better reliability and profit next year.","While we're on the subject to DIG, the Ferrari in garage, you can see that the engine has been purring. As capacity prices in Michigan have risen, we've been layering in profitable contracts. Over the next few years we could exceed our plan by as much as $20 million and as capacity prices reach the level of Kona as much as $40 million.","For example, in 2017 about half our capacity and a quarter of our energy is still available. We're discussing a contract now that could use some of this and increase profit by about $15 million to about $35 million in 2017.","The bulk of our growth, of course, comes from our gas and electric utility investment. Please remember that our earnings growth is not predicated on utility sales growth or cost reductions. Upsides from these are directed to our customers. These do, however, create headroom for more capital investment.","Our capital investment program over the next 10 years is 45% greater than the last 10 years, that's 45% greater. More than a third of this investment is for gas infrastructure while many see more convergence. We're fortunate to already have a rich mix of gas in our business.","As a percent of market cash, CMS investment exceeded 10% over the last 10 years. It is at 16% over the next 10 years. The opportunity to increase investment by another 30% or $5 billion to over $20 billion continues to be practical, particularly when many of the investment opportunities do not increase customer bills.","Some of the opportunities include capacity for retail open access customers should they choose to return to bundled service, more renewables, additional gas infrastructure, and replacing PPAs with new generation that will reduce customer bills.","And many have commented on our model that starts with the customer and enhances results for investors. This organic capital investment program does not include any big bets.","It is, however, what drives our earnings growth at 5% to 7%. We're able to self-fund much of this growth keeping base rate increases at or below the level of inflation. Our five-year plan includes O&M cost reductions worth about 2% a year, a conservative forecast of sales growth at about half a point per year, the ability to avoid the need for block equity dilution worth about another point and other.","This self-funds five points of growth without raising customer rates. This is a big win-win with earnings growth at 5% to 7% and customer rate impacts that stay below inflation.","Our model is simple. Perhaps it's a little unique. And we have many capital investment opportunities that just aren't yet in the plan. Most of these can be accomplished without increasing customer bills.","For example, replacing PPAs as they expire and the potential that customers on - may return to bundled service provides incremental capital investment without increasing customer bill.","Now imagine adding the equivalent of about a new 700-megawatt gas plant every few years for the next dozen years and that on top of our plan. Here is some of the key detail around cost reduction actions, down nearly 3% a year on average since 2006.","Looking ahead, we don't do it by squeezing a rock. We achieve our reductions with good business decisions. For example, as we switch from coal plants which require substantial number of people to operate to gas generation and wind farms which require about 10% of the work force needed to run coal, we're able to reduce our O&M by about $35 million.","For another example, as we lose about 400 workers a year through attrition, new workers are added at a savings of about $40,000 each. This comes from decisions made years ago to bring new hires with defined contribution plans rather than defined-benefit pension programs and on more competitive healthcare programs. This saves another $35 million.","Well, we have a clear plan for how we will continue our cost reductions in the future; we're working on new ideas. For example, our call centers are too busy. As we introduce better service, billing, and emergency mobile application we can respond faster and reduce call center workload. This reduce costs.","Second, new technology will permit us to modernize the grid more efficiently and maintain our systems at a lower cost. A line loss reduction of 1 to 2 points could save $25 million to $50 million. And third, as we improve customer quality through better work processes, we will save on overtime costs and temporary workers by simply doing it right the first time.","Nearly a third of the time when we roll our trucks on a job, something goes wrong. The right parts aren't on the truck or other parties who needed to be on site aren't on time. We are aggressively pursuing these opportunities to improve quality for our customers. Cost reductions come for free.","Let me take a minute to update you on the economy and sales outlook. Since 2010 through last year, Michigan's GDP is up almost 14%. That is the third best State in the Union. And the largest city that we serve, Grand Rapids, is up 21%. That's among the top 10% of all cities.","You can see the strong economic data for Grand Rapids compared with Michigan and the U.S. on this slide. We continue, however, to plan sales conservatively to help ensure that this is an area of upside rather than a risk. We project that industrial sales will be up about 2% annually for the next five years, with overall sales up about half a point.","With a robust business model, we have been able to consider consistent annual earnings growth of more than 7% for more than one decade, through recessions, through adverse weather, through changing policy leadership, through anything else that came our way. As we do, we hope you too see this is a sustainable model for our customers and investors for a decade ahead.","Now here is our sensitivity slide that we provide each quarter to assist with assessing our prospects. You can use this slide for 2016 and 2015. There is not a lot of new news that we do here some analysts raised concerns for the sector about interest rates. That is not a surprise. In a time of volatile views about interest rates, I know I've been wrong for 10 years in a row.","It is comforting, however, to know that our model is not very sensitive to changes in rates. Higher borrowing costs related to higher interest rates is largely offset by the impact of higher discount rates on our benefits and retiree programs and this excludes a higher return on equity should rates rise a lot.","On top of this, our practice includes pre-funding parent debt two years in advance, larger than peer liquidity and maintaining a smooth maturity schedule. This further insulates us from risks to changes in interest rates.","So here is our report card for 2015. We are in a good position with substantial benefits from the Arctic blast earlier in the year as well as better than planned cost reductions. We're putting this surplus to good use with reliability improvements for our utility customers and accelerating outages to enhance the outlook for 2016.","This will be our 13th year of transparent, consistent strong performance. Continuing our mindset that focuses on our customers and our investors permits us to perform well. We hope you agree we've achieved substantial improvements in customer value and customer satisfaction. We've got the best cost reduction track record in the nation, our 13th year of premium earnings includes premium dividend growth and we plan to continue this performance for some time.","So thanks for your interest and thanks for your support. We would be delighted to take your questions. Operator would you please open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much, Mr. Webb. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operating Instruction]","Our first question comes from Michael Weinstein with UBS. Please go ahead.","Michael Weinstein","Hi, good morning.","John Russell","Good morning.","Michael Weinstein","On the legislation, what are the key debates that are currently being talked about in the legislature as those being negotiated, I guess firmed up for eventual presentation to the committees? Are there any major changes that are now being talked about or anything significant to be looking for?","John Russell","Yes, let's go through it. Right now I think they're mostly just small adjustments to the bill. There's some issues going on today about retail open access. When they return how many years they have to have capacity, whether it's three years, five years, so there's some issues there. And what's the determining factor for if there is a shortfall Michigan.","On the integrated resource plan, I think you're going to see some debate about the difference between having the integrated resource plan and also having a renewable energy standard. So, right now these are kind of I would call adjustments to bring the bills together. We're the very end of this process, so I would expect that they happen, but most of its really revolving around the retail open access.","And as the queue continue, there's a queue that we beyond the 10%. The customers come back, do they have the right to leave or do they stay throughout that entire time. So, that's what's going on today. I think an important piece to Tom and I both mentioned and we want everyone to understand, we're not planning for any changes in our plan for the next five years that this law will change. So, if it does change, these are things that can benefit us as Tom talked about in his section of the presentation.","Michael Weinstein","Right. So, were you saying that right now the plan is for 5% to 7% growth? Is that something that could change upward if legislation passes that you guys will be talking about later?","John Russell","Right now - again with giving you guidance 5% to 7%, we continue to hit the high end of that through the years. Right now you know what our process is and Tom showed it on one of his slides.","We continue to go back and reinvest the positive weather, the cost savings for customers and their value. So, we're going to continue to do that. We see plenty of opportunities that way.","On the other hand though as Tom mentioned, if the law passes and if all this stuff happens, yeah, there may be an opportunity in the future sometime to with a new plant or PPAs to do something that would cause even additional capital investment for us, which could drive some earnings growth.","Michael Weinstein","That's great. Thank you very much.","John Russell","Yeah. You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Daniel Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Daniel Eggers","Hey. Good morning, guys.","John Russell","Good morning Daniel.","Thomas Webb","Good morning.","John Russell","Dan you have cold?","Daniel Eggers","Yeah, I do unfortunately. Great timing and earnings, unfortunately. So, anyway hopefully I'll be better by EEI. When you think about just trying to bridge the IRP and RPS together, what is it going to look like process-wise and there's going to be a process difference really from how you guys do planning and how you work with the commission if they are separate entities or if they are merged together.","John Russell","If - I want to make sure I understand, Dan. The plan, it looks like it's going to, is an integrated resource plan. The process that is used today is the state which I give the governor a lot of credit for this. What he is doing is trying to develop the best plan possible for Michigan and he's coordinating a lot of departments to work on this at the front-end. So there's no surprises at the back in. What the legislation will do, we expect is to support the integrated resource plan. And what I mean by that is to hit the clean power plan target.","If we need to reproduce more renewable energy, or more energy through renewable energy or have energy efficiency that will all be included in this plan. Now the good news about the law the way it is today, at least, not the law but the bills that are there is that, that would allow us to go forward and have our capital plans approved to meet the integrated resource plan and that's the assurance we want that as we go forward to meet the plan for the clean power plan which is a federal law that the state law and regulation supports us meeting that target.","And I think as many of you know many of the laws - some of the regulations that the EPA has come up with has up an overturned at the last minute. We don't want that to affect our investments and whether it's the right choice. So the preapproval process is important to us.","Thomas Webb","It's like a big con.","John Russell","Exactly, which is in the current law today.","Daniel Eggers","Okay, got it. And then I guess just on the need for open access customers to procure capacity, do you have any feeling for the 3 or 5-year decision process, and would dig be a candidate to provide capacity to some of those customers or do you think that capacity will procured elsewhere before there a chance for the open access customers to get to it?","John Russell","I think the three to five years that really is - what we want here Dan and we've been pushing in the legislation, we want to have it material that if somebody is going out to the market and if we have to supply them later, we have to have enough time to build that asset or secure that asset. So I think five years is right. If three years is what it comes down to that probably gives us sufficient time with more risk than the five-year component? And as far as DIG, I will turned it over to Tom because he keeps talking about that for already, so I will turned it over to him.","Thomas Webb","I still think it's an important as Mustang GT but whatever. The truth is, even today some of our capacity, not much, but some of our capacity actually goes to some of the AESs to serve retail open access customers. We don't have any bias for or against that, and if there is a change in the law it's probably going to be a gradual change anyhow people need support and we'll provide that.","I would tell you the principle purpose though of DIG is to supply folks in Michigan, where it can and to back up the utilities there is needs there. So it has a nice dual purpose and it really is a good engine because for the first time today I kind of admitted that the $20 million for 2016 probably going to look more like $35 million for 2017. It's almost impossible at this point with the contracts that we have not to have that happen. So it is a nice opportunity.","Daniel Eggers","Got it. Thank you guys.","John Russell","Thank you. Hope you feel better.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ali Agha","Good morning.","John Russell","Good morning.","Ali Agha","First question Tom or John, you know the investment in the company mechanism that is part of your filing of the rate cases, is that still on the table realistically given the ALJ and staff keep coming back and opposing it? What's your sense right now on the commission's views on that metrics?","Thomas Webb","It is still on the table. And for example, in smaller portions it is already being done in Michigan for utilities, but not the big picture. So not the question you are asking for covering all of your capital.","So I think some people see this as a wonderful opportunity to actually have better more thorough regulation looking at the total business around CapEx rather than just a narrow slice of one year. So there are folks who think it's a really good thing and, of course, we would be happy with it. And there are folks who think you should not look at that far.","Here's what I believe is going to happen. More and more there has been interest and people of asked us more about it in the decision-making process. So we are moving in that direction. If we move into the integrated resource planning process, it may even dump the whole idea because it may give you the confidence you need for capital investment over several years so that you kind of got that support you need. It's a little different, but it's kind of the same answer. So one way or another I think we are all going to be looking further out at the business together so better decisions are made for customers.","John Russell","Let me just add to that. I absolutely agree with what Tom said. And look at our gas business, I mean as big as our gas business is and the fact that our prices - customer prices are down 60%, I mean, this is a good opportunity to put the infrastructure in place now without putting a real burden on our customers because their costs are really coming down rather than going up. So that's what we're trying to see in the gas case that we are testing to.","Ali Agha","Okay. And then secondly, on a weather adjusted basis, system deliveries have been negative last two quarters and negative year-to-date. Can you just kind of elaborate like what is the trend going on there in terms of that negative trend there?","John Russell","The Residential and Commercial segments have been flat at best. So up a little bit one month, down a little bit the next month, sort of flat to down. Industrial has done pretty well and continues underneath to do very well. But in this year we got when customer who had an outage that they are coming back very slowly from. We don't make a lot of money on this customer because it's a very good rate, but it is still important to us for as business. So is there coming back up, we're probably going to see most of that benefit show up next year than some of it this year as we had hoped and anticipated.","So the outlook that I'm giving you probably still pretty good where we talk about Industrial at 2% a little bit better, and this is not of energy efficiencies. When you look out to 2016 and we are going to tell you flat to down on Residential and Commercial because candidly they are not picking up like they do out of the typical recovery after a session.","So we're going to plan on half a point of growth. We're probably a little conservative. But we will see how that plays out. We would rather be there and not be hurt much in our self-funding plans on rates by counting on too much from sales. But good observation. We have been flat, Residential\/Commercial and Industrial which typically would've been up more than you are seeing now is one heavy user who is just coming back from their outage, much slower than they had anticipated.","Ali Agha","Got it. And last question. The ongoing cost reduction programs that you have going up for the next few years as well, how do you think about that in terms of the headroom that creates and doesn't try to quantify that in terms of the headroom that creates for rate based investment without customer rate impact. In other words, a $1 saving in O&M, what would that equate to in terms of extra CapEx spending without customer rate impacts?","John Russell","So an easy way to see that is slide 17 and the one that says O&M cost performance, and you can see there the dollars and how they are really happening in the next few years where from 2014 to 2018 we will take out about $100 million net, there's a lot of ups in there as well. But net down $100 million and that's worth 10%. So you can do that math and bring it down little bit and think $10 million is about 1%, if that helps a little bit.","So then when you think about our self-funding model, we're looking for about two points of cost reductions, so 2%. And that, mixed with the other things we have over the next five years keeps us in a position where we could grow as high as 7% and our customer rates would still be at or below inflation which we're guessing at roughly 2%. So that gives you some of the math that you can work with. I hope that helps.","Ali Agha","Yes. Okay. Thanks. Thanks a lot.","John Russell","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Weisel with Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.","Andrew Weisel","Hey. Good morning, guys. John, sorry to hear about surgery, having gone through on myself recently. I sympathize and definitely hope you get well quickly.","John Russell","Thank you. I'm feeling good. Good to be back.","Andrew Weisel","First question, just to elaborate on the O&M conversation you were just having. These other ideas, slide 18, roughly 50 million to 80 million of additional cost savings, can you give us a sense of timing as to when you would make some decisions on those and when the benefits might start to show up ?","John Russell","Sure. If you look at them in the categories that we laid them out, the two way communications as we called it, which is more mobility, that's something that's going in place now. But you've got to have your systems well-coordinated to make that work. So I will give you an idea around that.","Smart meters in over the next year and two will have most of our smart meters in and with that will come some mobility plus. So that sort of a timeframe where you might see that kind of thing happen.","On the grid modernization, I had push that out little bit further, because that's better data, better line sensors, but smart meters, so I would go out several years before I would think of that as an opportunity. So you've got one couple of years from now, another one maybe five years from now and then go down to work management.","Now that's one where we will actually get improvements every month, every quarter, every year, and it will start slow. It is this simple. I always tell people when you are changing your process, try this yourself. If you drive a car and you back out of the driveway and you try to back out and turn the opposite direction of what you normally do. It is very hard to do. I guarantee if you try to do that over the course of one week you're going to be wrong at least a couple of times during that week. So it takes a lot of discipline, a lot of work and then a lot of practice to make these things happen.","Plus, we need some better systems for our work management and that's going to take us some time to put in place. So I'd say you will see gradual bits of that come in over next year. Small amounts and the in a little bit more the next year and during the life of five years I think you will see a lot of that begin to happen.","So I would call that one over five years. I would call technology or line loss past five years and communication something over the five-year period. And keep in mind, some of these will end up blending right in to our plans. They will actually be some of the cost reductions we're talking about, but a lot of these will be incremental and that is a nice place to be.","Andrew Weisel","Okay. Thanks a lot for that detail. Next question is the five-year plan, obviously 5% to 7% growth. In the past your slide decks have showed there is upside opportunity of 6% to 8%. Is that something by year end if the Michigan Energy Law goes the way that you are hoping and ROA returns, you might make that change sooner rather than later?","I know it's a question you get pretty often in a bunch of different ways, but trying to get a sense of how soon that 6% to 8% might become a target whether it be early in the new year or not until we have a better sense of the nuclear contract or however you can help frame up the timing.","John Russell","Let me start and then Tom you may want to pile on this one a little bit. Let me just go back and say again we're very comfortable with our 5% to 7% growth rate. And what has helped us is we really balance the financial performance for investors with the customer value that they get.","So, what we're constantly doing is looking at the financial, the operational, and the customer side of this business. We think today for the next several years, there's more opportunity to invest and I'm talking not only capital, but O&M back into customer value and back into operations.","Just as Tom talked about in the previous question, here's the truck rolls and some of the things we need to improve on. That's where I think for the next few years we really need to continue to invest and continue to grow at 5% to 7%, which is higher than our peers.","What would cause this to change; I think as Tom said in the slide that up there right now, you can see if the law goes into effect, and Tom made a good point I want to emphasize, if the law goes into effect as we expect and there are shortages of capacity in Michigan, which we expected the future, customers will return to us. But it's not going to happen overnight and it's going to take time. So, we will roll that in as we go forward.","But if you look at that in the future, if the customer's satisfaction continues to be first quartile and if the operations continue to be best-in-class then there may be a few catalysts that Tom talked about in the out years that would drive us to that.","And you saw there, the PPAs are long-term. The retail open access is shorter term than the PPA, need to replace those. That's where I think you ought to think about for us. I mean our plan is pretty good that we have here today and there's upsides which we wanted to show you, but right now we don't want to commit to those yet because there is more work to do in the base business that we have.","Thomas Webb","So, I'll just add the real purpose of this slide we show where it says we self-fund a lot of the growth for our customers and their rate is when we are talking about the upside opportunity, we're trying to demonstrate short-term if ROA customers came back and longer-term when we might need to replace those PPAs and we could build gas plants or put in wind farms cheaper than the PPAs.","Those are opportunities that we can put in place. And by the way there were - those things I just said as much as $3 billion. But those are opportunities we could do without hurting the self-funding part, without causing our customers to have bills going up any higher. So, that's really the illustration there. Conversations about where we might go beyond five to seven I think are something for the future, but we want you to know we wouldn't go there if we couldn't take care of our customers at the same time.","Andrew Weisel","Okay. Then lastly on the long-term load growth, you talked about planning for 0.5%. Is that based on the current Michigan Energy Law? Or is that embedding an anticipation of higher energy efficiency when this law gets revamped between now and year end?","Thomas Webb","Well, it could be both. But, what we assume and our numbers now is that we would have about a 1% energy efficiency deduct from the economic growth. And when I say it could be both, the other thing that's not in our numbers is a heavy hand on economic development where we're beginning to see a lot of progress now. So, economic development brings in more customers, spreads that base, there could be room for energy efficiency to go up and be even higher and still get these numbers that were talking about. So I think we've got you in the right ballpark whatever happens.","Andrew Weisel","Got it. Thank you very much.","John Russell","You are welcome. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Paul Ridzon","Is that foot still the next resource and what's the permanent process there look like now?","John Russell","Yes it is. [indiscernible] is existing site that we have. It has gas infrastructure, it has electric infrastructure in place. We currently have a permit that I think extends through this year into next year. So we have an active permit to build on that site that's been approved by the DEQ. I do not expect to move forward with that would pretty much put the project on hold until we see what happens with legislation, but yes it's a great site, it's ready. The community will accept it. We've got some older peekers on the site right today and we could move forward if we need to.","Paul Ridzon","Can you give a little more detail of what part of energy legislation is the commonality around?","John Russell","The commonality?","Paul Ridzon","What aspects of it does everybody agree with?","John Russell","I think generally everybody agrees with start with retail open access. We have to do something about it because there's an unfair subsidy. What we do about it, is a debate. Is it 10% with the Q? Is it full regulation which we're moving away from full regulation more to keeping the 10% with probably a one-way door? So if you return you'll stay with utility.","The integrated resource plan is a bit of a debate because what the governor is trying to do is, put in a plan that meets the EPA clean power plan that also is best for Michigan. While at the same time, I think some of the Democrats in the House and Senate want to have a standard in there that they can count on to that, that will be part of the law regardless of what happens with the integrated resource plan so that's a debate right now. The commonality, I think we talked about this in the past from a regulatory standpoint, self-implementation will go away but we will advance the timing of rate cases from 12 months to 10 months and if they are not been in 10 months you go into full implementation. It doesn't - it really is.","Paul Ridzon","Could I just add a little bit?","John Russell","Yes.","Thomas Webb","I would just say, you've got two bills one in the house and one in the Senate that it moves closer together.","Paul Ridzon","Definitely.","Thomas Webb","And there is a lot of similarity in those bills, but there are some people who really don't like certain parts and so of course now is the time people are pushing real hard. So there are individuals who are pushing real hard on different points in different ways that, but I would say the momentum is in those two bills which is pretty good. So I would say there's a lot more commonality at this point, even with a lot of arguments going on from the few people to move ahead with the pretty good law.","I think, Paul that we're confident we will be done by the end of year because there isn't - I mean we've had the hearings, the hearings are completed. We are very close and I think they are very close. If they weren't I don't think we would have rated this as successful by the end of the year. Here we are almost in November that in two months the thing is going to get done.","Paul Ridzon","The wonderful thing about that is the 2008 energy laws pretty good.","Thomas Webb","Yeah.","John Russell","And we are in quite a great position if nothing changed but this is a wonderful opportunity to address the EPA rules and to address renewables and to address our way and to address a little bit better regulation. And so there's a lot of opportunity in there for our customers and we are thrilled about it.","And I'm going to pile on just one more time, Paul is that, you also have two leaders there three with the governor, but these two leaders have spent a lot of time with Senator Nofs and Representative Nesbitt to get this thing right so that they could be aligned. They have spent a lot of time, a lot of committee hearings and they've been talking about for quite a while. So when they bring it together they want to make sure that the debate is limited.","Paul Ridzon","Where is decoupling?","John Russell","It is in the bills, whether it makes it or not, we will see. But it is in the bills. On the gas, it exists today.","Thomas Webb","So the way it is structured in there is optionality. It so it so that if utility wanted to ask the public service commission for decoupling, then they could do that. It gives the commission the authority to do that with the clarity that wasn't there for both gas and electric last time. And then the commission and the utilities get a chance to decide if they want to put it to use when they get out there in future rate cases.","Paul Ridzon","And any update on Palisades? There's been some noise around introducing nuclear plants. Any threats there in the near-term?","Thomas Webb","No, we don't see any issues there. I think the filings and the things they are doing with FERC to move along and keep the plant and running successfully appeared to be all going well. You know, our only issue candidly is that at the end of the contract with us we would like to make sure for our customers that it is more economical. If it turns out that building a gas plant is a lot cheaper for our customers then we are going to have to negotiate hard to extend the contract or go with what's best for them. But everything we know and you should ask them rather than us, they appear to be doing a good job.","Paul Ridzon","Then lastly, Tom, you said you prefund two years in advance, is it just interest rate hedges or can you elaborate on the process?","Thomas Webb","No, we're so chicken, we are unbelievable. We have just because we got frightened in 2002 we never let go of this idea that we just want to be conservative when it comes to the financial side of the business. So for the parent, we actually reach out for two years and we don't necessarily take the debt out, but we raise the debt so the cash is in place. We don't do it with arbitrage or hedging or anything like that. We literally raise the cash. You are going to say what kind of conservative people are you? But we are. So we raise it. We put that in put in place and when economics are right actually call the debt and take it out, we do that. So we have the resources ready to go for two years out in time. And it's just that simple. There's no magic to it.","Paul Ridzon","And typically what is that level that you are carrying extraneous?","Thomas Webb","Do you mean how much cash? You know, what, this is really easy to do because we give you our maturity schedule on the parent and utility, just look at that and look forward and you can see either that there is nothing left for the next two years or whenever the debt is look at cash line and you will see it is bigger than that. So you can watch that all the time. As we move through time depending on the size of the maturities.","Paul Ridzon","Thank you.","John Russell","Thank you very much.","Thomas Webb","We like being chicken, by the way.","Paul Ridzon","We like it to.","John Russell","Good.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.","Venkat Dhenuvakonda Rao","All right. Well, let me close things out. First of all, I want to thank everybody for joining us today on the call this morning.

This call is being recorded. Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at noon Eastern Time running through March 1st. This presentation is also being webcast, and is available on CMS Energy\u2019s website in the Investor Relations section.","At this time, I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Laura Mountcastle, Vice President and Treasurer. Please go ahead ma\u2019am.","Laura Mountcastle","Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. With me are John Russell, President and CEO; and Tom Webb, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Our earnings press release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on our website. This presentation contains forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and should be read in conjunction with our Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs. The forward-looking statements and information and risk factors section discuss important factors that could cause results to differ materially from those anticipated in such statements.","This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of each of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in the appendix and posted in the Investor section of our website. Reported earnings could vary because of several factors, such as legacy issues associated with prior asset sales. Because of those uncertainties, the company isn\u2019t providing reported earnings guidance.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to John.","John Russell","Thanks Laura. Let me welcome everyone for joining us today in our call. Since I will see many of you next week, excuse me, I\u2019ll keep my comments brief and be available for questions after Tom covers the results. 2011 was another year of strong financial performance. Our adjusted EPS was a $1.45 slightly exceeding the guidance set back in February and up nearly 7% from the $1.36 in adjusted EPS reported in 2010.","This was the ninth consecutive year we achieved or exceeded our original EPS target. Gross operating cash flow continues to grow primarily driven by our investments in the utility. In 2011, this cash flow was $1.6 billion. It is expected to continue to grow at about $100 million a year over the next five years. Our shareholders experienced an attractive 24% TSR last year and nearly a 150% TSR over the past three years.","It appears the market has recognized our consistent financial performance and significant dividend increases over this period. Although we have made good progress increasing our PE multiples, we still have more work to do to fully eliminate the peer discount. Few weeks ago, we raised the dividend 14% to a payout level of 62% which is in line with our peers.","This is a sign of the Board\u2019s confidence with our progress and with our long-term business outlook. Overall, I am very pleased with the results in 2011 and look forward to building on our success in 2012. One of our top priorities in 2012 is to focus on our customers\u2019 needs as fundamental as this may seen, we can do a better job. Last year, we launched the customer value initiative which focuses on moving up the value chain. We will talk more about this important initiative next week at our Investor Meeting.","We also want to firmly align with you, our shareholders. We will continue to be transparent with our business model, clearly identifying the financial and operational metrics most important to you and delivering the results. We are fortunate to have a good energy law in Michigan that provides the foundation for investment decisions and lays the groundwork for regulatory decisions. However I believe there is room for improvement, for improvement in the process that will be in the best interest of all parties.","I believe the few process changes could make Michigan\u2019s regulatory model one of the best in the country. Risk is one of the key elements of any investment or business decision. We focus on identifying financial and business risk and evaluating the alternatives along with the cost of mitigation. I have confidence that we have mitigated as much risk as possible or have backup plans in place for the various risks we may encounter.","We are establishing our 2012 adjusted EPS guidance at a $1.52 to $1.55 per share in a tight range of 5% to 7%. This should support continued TSR performance in the 9% to 11% range. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom to share more insights about 2011 and 2012.","Tom Webb","Thanks John. Let me welcome to everybody on the call today. Nearly 10 years ago, we established a course to rebuild the company and grow EPS at what we call the mid single-digit pace. That evolved in the 6% to 8% a year. We met that goal and we met it at the high end of the range. We dipped once in 2007 to reflect the planned sale of international assets before the full-year benefits kicked in. The full-year benefit of lower debt and interest expense and higher utility equity and earnings occurred in 2008 as planned.","This major sale made possible our consistently strong earnings performance. In 2010, we moved to increase certainty of our investor return. We shifted a bit towards dividend yield by increasing our dividend 40% from a yield of about 3% to one at 4%. We also aligned our EPS growth outlook at 5% to 7% and started from the high performance accomplished in 2010.","And as John just highlighted for you, we exceeded our EPS target last year continuing to perform at the high end of our projected range. Our dividend increase last month was the sixth in a row at $0.96 a share, it represents a 62% payout, and that\u2019s about the average of our peers. This combined with strong EPS growth should provide a healthy TSR and the good platform for continued growth. Equally reflective of our past performance and outlook is our continued operating cash flow growth. That\u2019s averaging about a $100 million each year.","This investment driven growth provides the capacity to enhance the dividend and the capacity to reduce parent debt when our investment needs ease. As you can see here, our 2011 earnings growth compared with 2010 was driven by our core business, the utility. The impact with soft energy prices on our ITPs was largely offset by refinancing in the attractive financial markets.","And this performance isn\u2019t easily accomplished. Our team works hard every day to deliver it and here is a sampling of the absent flows during 2011. As you can see in the green bulge on the left top of the slide the cold winter a year ago provided financial capacity to accelerate reliability spending, specifically including more tree trimming than we originally have planned.","As you can see in the red dip, around the spring time we had to pull back a little when record storms occurred including ice storms doubled level of previous years. The hot summer along with good tax and better than planned operating performance provided space for more customer reliability investment. We pushed hard last year and in prior years to balance our work in a manner that accelerates customer performance improvements and delivers consistent earnings growth.","It\u2019s not easy that the model works well for our customers and you, our investors. So here is our final report card for 2011 always but there is no rest, we\u2019ve been working on 2012 plans for more than a year. We are providing 2012 earnings guidance in a narrow range for the first time in many years at 5% to 7% resulting in earnings at a $1.52 to $1.55 a share. As usual, we\u2019re building this off our results last year where we were already at the high end of our long-term growth range.","So here is a look at the work ahead. We\u2019ve already faced mild winter weather in January and February, and recall we do not have decoupling for weather in the gas business. Although adverse weather has cost us about a $0.05 a share so far this year, we are able to offset it. We\u2019re taking action to address additional mild weather if it\u2019s necessary and this is fully consistent with our strategic model.","So how does it work in 2012? It\u2019s the same investment driven model we\u2019ve used for several years. The same model that drives us for the next five years. Our customer driven investment continues at a pace that grows rate base, EPS, and operating cash flow at about 5% to 7%. But why not invest less? Because there are investments \u2013 these are investments that are needed to meet laws, regulations and responsible service levels for our customers. Then why not invest more? We work hard to prioritize the capital spending in a manner to keep our base rate increases at or below inflation, otherwise we don\u2019t think we\u2019re serving our customers in a responsible manner and one that would be sustainable for you.","Importantly many people across Michigan worked hard to establish the new State Energy Law in 2008. And we\u2019re fortunate to have fair regulation that supports that law. For 2012, our electric and gas rate cases are primarily about new capital investment. The investment represents 95% of the gas and 97% of the electric self-implementation levels. The gas case maybe at a size that settled but we\u2019ll learn more about that later today.","Staff positions on both cases reflect ROEs that are below the national average. They also include sales on uncollectible account levels below existing experience. As in our last three rounds of rate cases, the commission may choose to strike the balance that provides resources to continue needed investment and reflect existing conditions. We\u2019re fortunate that they have seen these needs and our commitment to serve customers. We\u2019re working diligently to keep our cost and customer rates low, but while incremental power prices are extraordinarily low, well below replacement costs, some customers seek to temporarily leave bundled service.","Some of those not within the 10% cap established in the 2008 Energy Law have pressed for a higher cap. Key legislative and administrative leaders have reviewed the situation and chosen so far not to make any change during the period of artificially low prices. When prices return to a level that reflects replacement costs, our base load generation costs will provide clear advantages to all our bundled customers.","Our model includes strong customer focus and we\u2019re pushing hard, in fact very hard to enhance service and minimize prices. We continue to deliver base rate increases at or below the level of inflation. To support this, we reduced O&M in our last two rate cases. We expect to keep our base rate case increases below 2% through the next five years. Our approach is to bring smaller, routine rate cases annually in order to simplify the process, avoid rate shocks and permit timely recovery of investment, the primary focus of each request.","In the gas business, we expect that reductions in our DCR will result in savings to customers that more than offset increases over the next three years. We don\u2019t expect to be as fortunate in the electric utility, but we are continuing to work to slow the growth of fuel and PSCR cost. An important part of the plan to hold down rates includes reducing our O&M cost in a manner that enhances service while eliminating waste. In the last two years, we\u2019ve reduced our headcount by 4% and this is a big contributor to our plan that not only offsets inflation but reduces total O&M cost by 4%.","Over the next five years, we expect to lower O&M costs by a further 1% each year more than offsetting inflation costs and productivity. We\u2019re into the third year of economic recovery in Michigan which is shown here, weather adjusted electric sales up 2% in 2012. This helps all customers by spreading the impact of needed investment more broadly. During 2011, Michigan added 80,000 private sector jobs. Over the last two years, unemployment dropped five points from 14.1% to 9.3%.","While U.S. unemployment dropped a point, Michigan ranked number one among all states in manufacturing growth up 13% and number two in construction growth up 3%. U.S. auto production is up 17% so far this year compared to last year. Used car prices are high and that\u2019s another signal of improving new car sales ahead.","Clearly the revisions to business taxes, the auto recovery and the constructive approach to economic development are working. For example, in the most recent State Business Tax Climate Index update that came from a nonpartisan tax research group, Michigan advanced from 49 to number seven among all 50 states. Pretty good track record. Although last on our list today, an important and unusual to most utilities element of our model includes the use of NOLs to provide \u2013 to avoid the need for equity, not just for this year, not just for next year, but for the next five years.","We planned routine drift in another small equity programs but no new block equity offerings over the next five years. Now clearly it\u2019s an appropriate business case presented itself, we wouldn\u2019t have to take to bring it to you but we are able self fund planned investments of about $6.5 billion over the next five years. Cash flow is healthy with 2012 utility operating cash flow at $1.6 billion, up another $125 million. Recall that we accelerated both parent debt funding and companywide pension contributions in 2011, eliminating the need for more pension funding this year or next year.","We lowered our discount rates at the end of the year to 4.9%, 50 basis points lower than the prior year. We also lowered our expected return from 8% to 7.75%. The adverse earnings impact of about three pennies a share was more than offset by the effect of our cash contributions to the pension fund. So as we do with parent debt, pre-funding the pension plan provides another strong measure of risk mitigation.","Here is our routine profit and cash flow sensitivity chart, updated to address 2012. You can use this to easily reach your own estimate of our outlook. Now please note that we expect electric decoupling for energy efficiency to continue but we anticipate decoupling for economic and weather changes to end. We\u2019ve highlighted that here in our sensitivities. Although we prefer to continue decoupling for economic increases or decreases, this probably provides an upside during the recovery.","Please don\u2019t forget we\u2019ll seek to reinvest any gains should they occur in more reliability. Also please note the ROE sensitivity. We anticipate a reduction from existing authorized levels and you can see some possible impacts here. So here is a recap of our targets for 2012 with important improvements over 2011. And don\u2019t forget the Investor Meeting that\u2019s schedule for the New York Stock Exchange on February 29. You\u2019ll have a chance to hear from our executive team and join us in celebrating our 65th anniversary, or 65th year of listing on the New York Stock Exchange as well as our 125th year of proudly serving the people and the businesses of the State of Michigan.","So John and I would be delighted now to take your questions operator, if you\u2019d open the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you very much Mr. Webb. The question and answer session will be conducted electronically. (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll pause for just a second. Our first question comes from the line of Kevin Cole with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Daniel Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Good morning guys, this is actually Dan.","John Russell","Hi Dan, good morning.","Tom Webb","Good morning, Dan.","Daniel Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Good morning. I guess first question is just kind on the O&M outlook. Can you give a little more color where you guys are finding kind of the magnitude of reductions and do you expect this year maybe to kind of help us get a little deeper into where you\u2019re going to pull that money [ph]?","John Russell","Yes, let me just take that one. What we\u2019ve done is as Tom mentioned we\u2019ve reduced our headcount by 4% over the past two years. We\u2019ve made a large investment in SAP, one of the largest in the country. I think a few years ago to automate many of our processes. We\u2019re starting to see the benefits from that automation now. We also reached an agreement with our union last year which so all employees of the company would eliminated the legacy costs going forward.","So we no longer for new employees have any defined benefits programs or all defined contributions. So between healthcare, legacy issues, productivity improvement which we\u2019re going to show you some of that in New York next week, reduction in headcount and overall we continue to invest capital to reduce O&M and fuel costs which on the O&M side is paying the dividend.","Daniel Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, got it. Tom, just make sure I had this, the guidance you guys gave today, does that the ROE imply for electric, is that based off of the 10\/7 number or a different number?","Tom Webb","Now it\u2019s a fair question Dan, but for obvious reasons we\u2019re not actually naming the number. The way I would ask everyone to think about the answer to that, if you look at the sensitivity chart that we provided you, we show what would happen if there was a 20 basis point drop on electric and gas. And I would encourage everyone to know that we can manage that kind of level.","And then I would just tell you, remember our plan whether we have adverse weather, whatever happens is to do our best to stick right to our guidance and get it. And it goes the other way. If we get some wind falls, some good news, some favorable weather whatever may happen, we\u2019ll turnaround and reinvest that. So we\u2019re expecting a drop in the ROE. We don\u2019t want to forecast what we think it will be because we don\u2019t know. But we will go after doing the things we can control to live within that guidance we\u2019ve provided.","Daniel Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Nicely evaded, thank you. And then\u2026","Tom Webb","Thanks Dan.","Daniel Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thank you guys.","Tom Webb","Thanks Dan.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Barnett with Morningstar. Please proceed.","Mark Barnett \u2013 Morningstar","Hi good morning guys.","Tom Webb","Good morning.","John Russell","Good morning, Mark.","Mark Barnett \u2013 Morningstar","ROE notwithstanding, can you talk a little bit about the discrepancy between the staff positions and where you plan will self implements maybe especially on the investment side since it\u2019s not really something that\u2019s proved any kind of sticking points so much with that?","Tom Webb","Yes, what I would ask you to do which is the easy thing for everyone to do is think about our slide 19 which gives you the difference in the gas case where we have proposed self implementing a $23 million compared to the staff at $22 million. And I think the focus would be look at the big items. There is a difference in ROE which I know Dan credits us [ph] for evading that a little bit but there is a difference there and I have a funny feeling, there will be some good analysts to configure out our number from these.","And on uncollectible, it\u2019s simply recognizing a three year history rather than the present experience. So we\u2019re hopeful on that particular one that folks will acknowledge where we are today. And maybe do something creative whether it\u2019s a tracker or whatever it maybe as a way of ensuring that we don\u2019t over recover on new ways because that\u2019s not our intent. We just want to recover whatever the experience is. On investment, there is some very small pipeline things that are in discussion right now.","Generally it\u2019s hard to find an example where we\u2019ve ever been trend down on investments. So as long as there is confidence we\u2019re doing the right thing, I think we\u2019ll get proper recovery on the investments. So there is not really deep terrible issue there. And on revenue it\u2019s a little bit \u2013 this isn\u2019t really the mainstream revenue, this is sort of the buy-sells that we do that kind of thing in the gas business. And this is again staff taking a looking at a three year history rather our most recent experience. And if you look at what\u2019s actually happening today, I think that we can find common ground on that one as well.","And O&M is sort of a little bag of a variety of different things. So the impression that you might get there is that we may not be as far apart as it appears and when you think of the size of where we are, it\u2019s probably something that could move toward settlement, those things take a little bit time though. And we\u2019ll see that will up to the staff and the commission and all the other parties too.","Mark Barnett \u2013 Morningstar","Okay, thanks a lot for that detail. And I guess one more question might be a little hard but if you look at obviously the mild weather, you commented a little bit on the earnings impact already but and you mentioned some of the flexibility you have to offset kind of maybe some continued weakness. Is there a limit to how much flexibility you have or is it a little hard to quantify?","Tom Webb","No, there is absolutely a limit but we\u2019d never quantify it because we surprise ourselves. And I\u2019ll give you an example that kind of relates to that. We work hard to bring the O&M cost down because we don\u2019t benefit from that except in the short-term that\u2019s a way of creating headroom and helping our customers and offset the recovery we get from the capital investments that we are putting in place for them.","This year, we\u2019re able to take our O&M costs down by about 4%. That maybe one of the best that we\u2019ve done when I look through modern history our track record has always been up more closer to inflation levels. But we are blowing the inflation away and we\u2019re going to zero and we\u2019re not stopping we\u2019re going down. We told you here that we are looking for the forward years to be flat to 1% down, but as we get closer to each year that\u2019s when we work harder to do the things that provide the productivity that make a lot of sense.","And I\u2019ll give you one example. Hardening the system is something that we\u2019ve been doing for sometime. We put investment in place to put better poles, better wires, better pipes in place and by doing that, when storms and problems like that that are O&M related occur, we don\u2019t have as much problem. We don\u2019t have as much damage. And I think that a team that\u2019s focused on improving all the time finds and surprises itself with how much it can do. So if there are limits, of course there is a point where we can\u2019t go much further and therefore do actions that jeopardize the service that our customers would get.","Do we put a number on a cap on it? No. And so we\u2019ll \u2013 I can\u2019t tell you this, this will give you a little help. We didn\u2019t anticipate $0.05 a bad news in the weather in January and February where we don\u2019t have any decoupling on the weather side for the gas business. So that wasn\u2019t easy but we\u2019ve gone off and we\u2019ve already have all the plans in place to fully accommodate that. We expect that the weather is pretty mild. You don\u2019t have the benefit of this but I am looking out the window here in Jackson, Michigan. I wouldn\u2019t say put your bathing suit on but it\u2019s a little more pleasant than what we might normally see this time of year. So we\u2019re putting some work together to figure out what we can do.","Mark Barnett \u2013 Morningstar","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Tom Webb","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please proceed.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust","Thank you, good morning.","John Russell","Good morning, Ali.","Tom Webb","Good morning.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust","Hi Tom or John, just to be clear as Tom, you alluded a couple of times to the potential for settlements on the rate cases, were you just talking about the gas case or is that possible for the electric as well?","John Russell","Ali, I\u2019ll take that one. I think it\u2019s if we do \u2013 if we could reach a settlement, it would be likely in the gas business because the amount that we\u2019re asking for is relatively small. And that is going to be more than offset by the reduction of gas prices to our customers. So regardless of the amount that we get in that case, customers will benefit from a pretty significant reduction in gas costs.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust","Okay. And then secondly, going back to the discussion on Retail Open Access, there has been some talk of press that the Governor\u2019s Office, that the Governor may ultimately take a closer look on his end and then decide if anything needs to be changed, etcetera. Is that still true, can you just give us an update on where the Governor\u2019s thinking is currently on this?","John Russell","Yes, I was with him yesterday and there is no interest on his part from what he shared with me and others on moving \u2013 taking on energy legislation. So this is for the record for everyone, the Governor has made it clear, he likes the energy legislation, the Head of the Senate Energy Committee likes it, the Head of the House Energy Committee likes it. This isn\u2019t to say that somebody may not introduce the bill to increase the cap or do something different but I think the Governor\u2019s interest is more in infrastructure investments, finding a way to make investments in infrastructure which creates jobs and benefits the state in a long-term basis.","It also would help the infrastructure that I think he is worried about which is the road infrastructure. I think as you know as we go and do replace pipes and mains and services, it does cause havoc in the roads but after it\u2019s completed the roads are replaced. So it may be a nice combination in the future to be able to replace the infrastructure where you have gas mains at the same time have the infrastructure of the roads replaced at the same time.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust","Okay. And last question Tom, the enterprise results tend to move around somewhat year-to-year. Should we take the \u2018011 results as kind of a good base to think about in the future or what could be the big variances there to be thinking about?","Tom Webb","Yes, on enterprises, in fact I\u2019ll give you a value add on this. I\u2019ll give you enterprise and one other little piece that\u2019s outside the utility. Enterprises came in around $0.02 of our earnings and that\u2019s the low side. You can figure out why ITP markets are awful. And we have two-thirds of the dig operations exposed on contracts because we\u2019re waiting for the turn to put some more favorable contracts in place. So couple of pennies, and I would say that\u2019s closer to the floor, so that maybe a little bit of upside in that but the way to measure that is use your own judgment on when you think the power prices in the ITP market will actually improve a little bit.","So it could be this year, it could be next year. And then the other little one just to take it out is the EnerBank, that\u2019s the only other piece that\u2019s outside of the utility and that\u2019s worth about three pennies of earnings, pretty stable, pretty reliable little business.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust","Got it. Thank you.","Tom Webb","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi good morning.","John Russell","Good morning.","Tom Webb","Good morning, Jonathan.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Tom, just I think that you mentioned one thing I want to talk about just sense of start with that on EnerBank, were you highlighting that is something that has been an unusual help in Q4, just to help to offset or would that \u2013 and I just not quite sure why you called it out in the slide?","Tom Webb","Yes, the only reason I called it out was so that you would see everything that\u2019s outside of the utility. And between our enterprise business which is the little renewable plants and our Dearborn Industrial Generation, IPP, the only other thing that exists is the EnerBank. And we\u2019re big on transparency, so I wanted you to know for your own planning purposes when you\u2019re modeling the utility what\u2019s left. No, I am not trying to tell you that EnerBank was any particularly strong contributor in any unusual way to our business last year or this year, but rather to tell you that its inside of that little small organization. It\u2019s grown very well. And it\u2019s got its risk measures well under control.","So we are very comfortable with where they are but put the two together, we\u2019re only looking at about a nickel contribution to our earnings, enterprises and EnerBank.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. So besides these would imply that it somehow kind of close the gap in Q4 or something?","Tom Webb","No, I mean you could see some movements up and down but no, nothing. They did well, I am sure one of them maybe listening and I want to complement them on the excellent work they do but no, given within the scale of the company not a giant change.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. And secondly I am guessing this no real changes to the broad annual year-by-year CapEx plan that you laid out TEi [ph] in November, is that correct?","Tom Webb","No. We\u2019ve had a little bit of change as the EPA has been trying to put new rules in place and the courts have been moving them around but what I would tell you and our folks that work very hard on this probably want to appreciate my comment but it\u2019s a lot of hard work but a lot of noise when it comes to looking at our total capital expenditures of $6.6 billion.","So we\u2019ve had to move the spending around a little bit inside of the five year period but not in total. So there will be lots of other things we\u2019ll be looking at but I would tell you what you\u2019ve seen in our spending pattern is pretty similar to what we have in as we move one year out, we\u2019ll give you fresh five year look. But keep in mind we\u2019re deep into those spending plans, particularly on the EPA works. So you see this year at $1.4 billion but that\u2019s not new news from what we have been telling you in the past. We\u2019re well into that spending program.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","So to make up the $1.4 billion more or less unchanged?","Tom Webb","Well minor changes but from the scale of what we look at when we break it out in distribution and the environmental work and in generation, it\u2019s pretty much what you\u2019ve seen. And we\u2019ll talk to you more about that when we come out to New York, I hope you\u2019re able to be a part of that because we\u2019ll have the executives there who will tell you about where that investment goes on the environmental side, and what it does for us and we\u2019ll talk to you about where it\u2019s going on a distribution side and why it\u2019s so important to our customers.","So you\u2019ll get to connect some dots that I think will be real helpful. You\u2019ll get to ask the experts and they may tell you it\u2019s slightly more than noise but I\u2019ve got the big picture look.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. And Tom if I may one other thing, you\u2019ve talked about closing your smaller coal plants in 2015. I was just wondering I mean at the current low enough [ph] gas prices can you conceive of a situation where that might potentially be accelerated and in fact was to how and what would be the implications to the plan and maybe transmission or other offsets?","John Russell","Jonathan, this is John. No, we would not accelerate even with the low gas prices, what\u2019s unique about our smaller coal plants is they are cost effective. They burn western coal. They are almost not fully depreciated but close to fully depreciated. So their dispatch cost is still very competitive in the market. So despite the natural gas prices, they are today \u2013 these units are still running. What causes to them to be more fault [ph] is the fact that the EPA rules would likely require additional equipments to be put on which will cause them to be dispatched at a higher cost.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thank you.","John Russell","Thank you.","Tom Webb","Thanks Jonathan.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please proceed.","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann","Hi good morning.","Tom Webb","Hi Brian.","John Russell","Good morning.","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann","Tom, you mentioned earlier of possibly addressing parent debt once the capital budget eases, just wondering if you could maybe elaborate on that a little bit?","Tom Webb","Yes, that\u2019s a great question. We have a goal inside the company to try to keep that debt flat or bring it down. I would like to two points about it. One is that with all the bonus depreciation that we\u2019ve been getting each of the last few years including a 100% last year. It\u2019s been wonderful but it all happens in the utility and creates a bubble at the parent debt because we aren\u2019t able to use our NOLs to shelter taxes because they are already sheltered down at the utility.","So for that reason you see a little bubble up, we don\u2019t like it, but we know it\u2019s very temporary and we\u2019re still on our trajectory to bring that down as we go through time. So that\u2019s our plan. But the second point is the reason we\u2019re not bringing it down at an even faster clip is simply because when we invest in the utility, we get that 10% to 11% after-tax return. And when we take out the parent debt, we only get a 4% to 5% after-tax return. So the comparison on the economics is real simple.","But we\u2019ll talk to you more. Hope you\u2019ll be with us too. We\u2019ll talk to you more in New York to remind you about the things we do to ensure that we are well protected like thick liquidity and pre-funding and all that so the parent debt won\u2019t be an issue. And as we keep growing the utility, the cash flow grows through time and it gets to a very high level which was the point in the slide. So that when your spending comes off a little bit, you can put that to use in more dividend or you can put it in use to parent debt reduction, there will be a lot of wonderful choices that we\u2019re creating for ourselves. But it\u2019s a few years away.","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann","Okay. And just embedded in the 2012 guidance, what is the assumption on the parent debt costs on a per share basis?","Tom Webb","I\u2019ll get that for you. Our interest expense you mean?","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann","Yes, the corporate expense stat?","Tom Webb","Yes. We would \u2013 the total number \u2013 well this is corporate and other, let\u2019s see if we can get that answer on the debt part alone but its $0.39 negative to cover interest expense as well as all our corporate costs. So if you go ahead we will have somebody quickly look up the interest only. We have that handy for that.","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann","Yes, that\u2019s fine, the $0.39 is fine. Thank you very much.","Tom Webb","You got it. Thank you for asking.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) All right. Ladies and gentlemen that will conclude the question and answer portion of our call. I\u2019d now like to turn presentation back over to Mr. John Russell for closing remarks.","Tom Webb","Just before John wraps up because we don\u2019t like to leave anything open, the interest expense side is $0.35. Sorry we didn\u2019t have that at our finger tips. And then again follow-up in New York we can give you more detailed split of that, how that\u2019s done. So I\u2019ll turn it back to John. Thank you.","John Russell","Thanks Tom. Let me wrap it up and I\u2019ll wrap it up briefly. Tom and I are looking forward to seeing all of you in New York next week. I just want to give you a heads up for you New York. There probably won\u2019t be anything revolutionary there or big strategic announcements. What we really want you to do is meet the executive management team. We\u2019re going to talk about the customer value initiative. We\u2019re going to talk about environmental compliance plan and we\u2019re going to talk about our regulatory strategy. And we\u2019ll have the experts there for you to talk to. And I am proud to have them there and I want you to get a change to meet the people that make this company successful.","So with that I am glad you joined us today. We look forward to seeing you next week in New York. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference. We thank everyone for your participation. You may now disconnect.

[Operator Instructions]","Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12:00 p.m. Eastern time, running through February 5. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Glenn Barba, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. Please go ahead.","Glenn P. Barba","Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. With me are John Russell, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Webb, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Our earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on our website. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements should be considered in the context of the risk and other factors detailed in our SEC filings. These factors could cause CMS Energy's and consumers' results to differ materially.","This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of each of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in the appendix and posted in the Investors section of our website.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to John.","John G. Russell","Thanks, Glenn, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on our year-end earnings call.","I'll begin the presentation with an overview of the year before I turn the call over to Tom to discuss the results and outlook, then we'll close with Q&A.","2014 adjusted earnings per share were $1.77, up 7% from the prior year's actual result. For 2015, we are raising the low end of our guidance from $1.85 to $1.86 per share. The top end remains the same at $1.89. This reflects our plan to grow earnings per share by 5% to 7% off last year's actual performance.","Last week, our board approved a 7.4% dividend increase, the ninth consecutive increase in as many years. The new annual dividend of $1.16 per share results in a competitive payout ratio of 62%.","2014 was another successful year, both financially and operationally. The settlement of the gas rate case was constructive at $45 million with a 10.3% return on equity. We achieved our 10% renewable energy target 1 year ahead of schedule with the completion of the 111-megawatt Cross Winds Energy Park.","In addition to improving customer satisfaction scores and moving towards a more competitive rate design, we invested a record $1.7 billion in the utility, in the areas of system reliability, environmental compliance, gas infrastructure and technology. These projects add value to our customers and deliver financial results for our shareholders.","Our strategy is centered around breakthrough thinking over the long term. We begin by focusing on operational excellence and maintaining our first quartile cost performance. By the end of this year, we will have reduced O&M expense by $150 million since 2006, a 13% decrease on an absolute basis. We are able to grow organically with no big bets, through our transparent, 10-year, $15.5 billion capital investment plan.","This year, we anticipate comprehensive energy policy in Michigan. The updated law as well as the predicted MISO capacity shortfall next year could provide future opportunities. Last week, we received an 18-month air permit extension for Thetford gas plant. This will provide us optionality to meet a capacity shortfall but it is not in our plan.","We are committed to providing our customers with exceptional value. Our dedication to improving customer satisfaction has moved us from fourth quartile to second quartile for electric and gas business customers, and to first quartile for residential customers; a significant improvement over the past 4 years. In 2016, we anticipate having all 4 segments in the first quartile as we continue to focus on customer satisfaction by delivering the quality service our customers expect. Customer satisfaction is an important element of our breakthrough thinking that leads to predictable financial results.","The reelection of Governor Snyder and the reappointments of Senator Mike Nofs and House Representative Aric Nesbitt, as chairs of their respective energy committees, add stability in the political environment. The commission remains chaired by John Quackenbush and we anticipate the appointment of a new Commissioner to replace Greg White, who will be retiring midyear. We look forward to working with these respected leaders to advance energy policy.","Energy policy is a priority for the Governor, as he mentioned during his State of the State Address. He wants an energy policy that will be adaptable, affordable, reliable and environmentally sound. The Governor also announced that he is creating a new agency to better coordinate energy policy in the state. He is expected to offer more details when he delivers an energy message in March.","The Governor is focused on adaptability over the long term as Michigan moves towards less coal and more natural gas generation and renewable energy sources. We look forward to working with the Governor to support his goals.","Each year, we build our growth off prior year's actual result. Our model has continued to produce predictable results that build on the high end of performance. And the company's organic growth strategy continues to support the 5% to 7% long-term growth rate.","For 2015, we expect more breakthrough performance. Operationally, we will continue to make safety our top priority for employees, customers and the communities we serve. Our industry-leading cost performance puts us in a desirable position but we're not done. Again this year, we expect to take out more costs through increased productivity while maintaining a high level of employee engagement.","By improving customer value and quality of service, we will continue to increase customer satisfaction. This year, we have an opportunity to work with policymakers on a new energy law that will secure Michigan's energy future for the next decade and more. All of this and deliver the predictable financial performance as we have in the past.","Now I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas J. Webb","Well, thanks, John. And thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today. As always, we deeply appreciate your interest in our company and for spending time with us today.","I'll cover the 2014 results, 2015, our future plans as well as upsides. As John mentioned, the full year results at $1.77 a share, are up $0.11 or 7% from 2013. As you can see here in the left shaded circle, cost savings fully funded our capital investment in 2014. We avoided both gas and electric rate cases for 2014. We also put to work the substantial upside from better-than-planned cost performance and favorable weather in substantial O&M reinvestments. These approached $100 million in 2014 on top of a similar amount in 2013.","This slide, which I suspect is familiar now to almost all of you, shows how on top of large planned cost reductions of $150 million in 2014, we further reduced our cost by $21 million. This and the colder-than-normal weather in the earlier part of the year provided room for substantial O&M reinvestment to improve reliability, generate incremental productivity and prefund parent debt. This not only maintains a conservative risk profile, it makes it easier to continue improved performance for our customers and to deliver consistent, high-end earnings per share growth.","We achieved all of our financial targets for 2014. But please recall, we had cautioned earlier in the year that we might fall short of our cash flow target. We're delighted to report today that we are able to accomplish additional working capital improvements to achieve the operating cash flow objective of $1.45 billion.","Now looking ahead to 2015. You can see that the O&M reinvestments we made in 2014 already are bearing benefits. Much of our capital investment is self-funded by our own cost reductions, and half of the rate increases needed for 2015 already are in place. We've got a nice, fast start to the year.","Earlier this month, we settled our 2015 gas rate case, our first since 2013, at $45 million. This included continuation of our return on equity at 10.3%. The 2015 electric rate case is well underway. It has 3 distinct features: first, it provides us with the opportunity to put the purchase of the new Jackson gas plant in a rate base when our customers need the capacity, and we're proud to do it at one of the lowest purchase prices for a gas plant ever paid; second, we'll be recovering the portion of our customer reinvestments -- or investments, that we have not already self-funded with cost reductions; and then last, this case includes a new rate design, which permits residential customers to stay fully competitive and allows industrial customers to become more competitive.","Electric residential bills are below the national average. Industrial rates are above the Midwest average and we have a solid plan to improve. Driven by our own cost reductions, improved rate design, and the prospect that subsidies for ROA customers will disappear, industrial rates can be competitive, too. ROA customers may return to bundled service because of policy changes or naturally as capacity prices normalize. This would end the existing subsidy worth about $150 million. Here's our standard sensitivity table to permit you to evaluate our outlook.","Here's our report card for 2015. We continue consistent, high-end earnings growth at $1.86 to $1.89 or up 5% to 7% from the high-end 2014 results. Operating cash flow should grow another $100 million to $1,550,000,000 and with no big bets. Last week, we increased our dividend by 7.5% and plan to stay in the 60% to 70% payout range. Importantly, our total price changes for electric and gas customers will reflect reductions of 3%. Yes, reductions of 3%, further increasing competitive value for our customers. Our balance sheet and CapEx measures are strong, and we're able to self-fund our organic CapEx programs with cost reductions and NOLs.","Shifting to the longer term. Our future plan includes: healthy levels of investment; O&M cost reductions; modest sales growth; and a continuation of the 2008 energy law. Both earnings per share and the dividend should grow 5% to 7% each year. Our mix of capital spending during the last 10 years will shift and grow over the next 10 years. We'll be putting more capital investment into gas infrastructure and electric reliability as we continue investment in other important parts of the business. Capital investment grows 45% with no big bets.","O&M costs, net of increases, continued to plummet with reductions of 2% in 2012, 3% in 2013, 3% in 2014, and we project another 3% in 2015. Compared with our last call, cost reductions are even bigger. In 2014 and 2015, O&M costs are down 3% each year instead of the 2% we previously reported. This progress reflects our conservative planning followed by better performance. Since 2006, we've reduced our cost by 7% through 2013, and with the acceleration, just discussed in 2014 and '15, we've got a fast start at accumulative cost reduction of 17% by 2018.","Weather-normalized sales growth in 2014 was stronger than forecast. 2015 looks stronger than we thought as well, with electric industrial sales up 3% and overall sales up 1%. We still intend to plan 2016 to 2019 conservatively with our estimated industrial sales up 2% and overall sales up 0.5%.","We plan to grow operating cash flow by another $100 million to $1,550,000,000 in 2015. That's up $500 million from 5 years ago, and we expect gross operating cash flow to rise to $2.4 billion by 2019, up another $500 million. Our operating cash flow levels already exceed peers.","So here's a summary of what we have in our plan, with consistent earnings growth at 5% to 7% a year and good dividend growth that reflects the same. Since 2007, we've raised our dividend every year and on average by 25% a year.","Now there are several areas, however, that are not reflected in our plan. These are meaningful upsides. Our capital spending could be substantially higher. Our sales growth and our cost reductions also could be better. In addition, our plan does not assume any changes to the energy laws such as: changes to retail open access, renewables, or energy efficiency standards. These may all result in large upsides.","Our capital investment plans over the next 10 years are $15.5 billion, as we mentioned, up 45% from the last 10 years and there's an opportunity to increase that level by another 30%. We'll work to incorporate these opportunities without adding pressure to customer prices.","Now here's a great example of that. One aspect that's still not included in our plan is new capacity investment. Should ROA customers return to bundled service either in response to policy or market changes, we would need to add investment to provide another 800 megawatts of capacity. Later in the planning cycle, we'll need to replace expiring PPAs with more than 2,000 megawatts of capacity, and we believe we can do that without raising customer bills by $0.01. These opportunities alone require 3,000 megawatts of new capacity at consumers. None of this is in our present plan.","On top of capacity needed at consumers, the Ford GT or alias Ferrari in the garage is fired up. Capacity prices have begun to increase in the Midwest and there is an opportunity for our Dearborn Industrial Generation plant to realize profit improvements of another $20 million to $40 million. We already have locked in $10 million, moving from $5 million to $15 million, with an opportunity to add further $20 million to $40 million and that is not yet in our plan.","While we have an enviable organic growth plan, we have upsides: 30% more CapEx; new energy law improvements; higher sales; deeper cost reductions; and higher capacity prices. Our track record's pretty good. Our planned future is brighter than the past and that's before any of these likely upsides.","We're committed to high-end earnings and dividend growth, continuing our track record of a dozen years. We're committed to rapidly improving customer satisfaction with better value and performance. We are committed to our customers and to you, our investors.","We thank you for your interest and your continuing support. We'd be delighted to take your questions. So Lori, would you please open up the lines?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So quick first question, perhaps just a clarification, if you will. You talk about the ROA and the potential for up to 800 megawatts. Can you perhaps talk about the configuration? What sites -- how many combined cycles or peakers [ph]? Or how you plan to meet that to the extent to which we get clarity on that in the next few months here?","John G. Russell","Yes. Let's talk about it. We've got 800 megawatts that are off on retail open access right now. If that does come back, our plan to meet that -- and I don't expect it'll come back, if the law changes or based on market conditions all at once, but the options we have are: buying from the market, increasing the production at some of our current margin units that we have. As you know, we've asked the Public Service Commission to allow us to purchase the Jackson plant, which is another 540 megawatts, plus we have DIG, which Tom had talked about, too. DIG has available capacity in the state that we can purchase, and in a long-term basis, I think Thetford is probably the plant that we'll go to where we did get the air permit extended.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. So it would just be Thetford in the long term, though, just to be clear?","John G. Russell","Yes. Yes.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the UP situation, is there any opportunity to be involved there? I mean, obviously, that's kind of wrapping up here, but is there anything you can do on your side?","John G. Russell","No. I like where we're at right now.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then perhaps more broadly, as you look towards the energy legislation in the state, and specifically on the RPS side, where does that stand right now? Where are your expectations for the RPS to be increased? And secondly, to the extent to which it is, what are your expectations around being able to rate-base more than 50% as it stands? Perhaps, how are the conversations going, at least initially, if you can?","John G. Russell","Yes, let me give you that -- what was that last part, rate-base, 50%? I didn't understand that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes. Perhaps, how much of the potential spend could you rate-base?","John G. Russell","Yes. The energy policy, I think, is the key question for today. The Governor was pretty clear in the State of the State that he does want to move forward with energy policy. I think the situation that has occurred in the Upper Peninsula, as you referred to, really highlights the need to do something here in Michigan to take care of our customers with the Michigan companies, and not let MISO or the federal government step in to solve the issue that they were talking about before, so -- or what they did in the UP. So I think the timing of changing it is good. As far as the renewable energy, energy efficiency, that will all be part of the mix. I think it's important for us to look at the balanced portfolio, which includes what we're doing by reducing our coal fleet -- reducing the number of units in our coal fleet, increasing the gas. And I think the renewable energy standard will, one way or another, continue to grow in the State of Michigan, and I think that's good. I think it's good for our customers, but it will be a healthy debate with the Republicans in the House, Senate and the administration for the level that we choose. As far as the 50% in the 2008 law, I don't expect -- I mean, one of the things that we've been able to do, which is a tribute to the team, is build the renewable energy cheaper than we have purchasing it from other people. And that's very clear in what we've done over the past several years in the 2008 energy law. So if the intent of the law is to increase renewable energy and do it for our customers and do it in a cost-effective fashion, we ought to be able to do it all ourselves.","Thomas J. Webb","So Julien, I'd just add, we haven't assumed any extra renewable investment in our capital investment plans. So remember, when we talk about anything moving up from the 10% standard a little bit or a lot, whether it's 50% or all or none, none of that's in our plan. So that's all upside. That's part of that $5 billion that's not in our capital investment program yet.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then perhaps lastly, what's the timing that you guys see the legislation proceeding?","John G. Russell","I think the Governor -- as I mentioned, in March he's coming out with an energy message. So I would expect that he's interested, knowing the Governor, and I think, for those of you that have followed him he doesn't really wait long to get things done. So I expect he will move on it. I think the importance of doing it is important in '15, and its -- I talked about this energy agency that he created. One of the things that he sees, I expect, is the need for better coordination between the various departments in the State of Michigan, particularly as the State of Michigan develops its state implementation plan for -- to be able to comply with the clean power plan. So that really is a, kind of an all-inclusive plan and I think on his view is, let's get as many people are around the table to do this right for Michigan. And so, I think he'll be anxious to move forward on this quickly.","Operator","Your next question is from Ali Agha of SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","John or Tom, this last dividend increase that you announced, and John, you mentioned, 7.4%. Was that a signal of the kind of earnings growth power that you're seeing at least near-term or was that more fine-tuning on the payout ratio? It's a pretty big hike, and I was wondering if there was a message behind that dividend hike?","John G. Russell","I Ali, I wouldn't look into it too much, except for the fact that it really did show that the Board was confident in our plan. We shared the 5-year plan with them and as we've told others that we continue to grow at 5% to 7%, and you should expect the dividend growth to be in that range too. So I'd take it as a sign of confidence for our plan.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, John also, I mean you've alluded to retail open access a couple of times. I mean, just -- what's the latest that you are hearing as these things are getting firmed up, energy policy changes, et cetera? Where is the sort of, I think, focus right now legislative-wise on whether to get rid of retail open access or where are you heading?","John G. Russell","I think the -- as I mentioned earlier, I think the most important thing that everybody has seen, so I'll use this as a generic, is what's going on in the Upper Peninsula. And when you follow that, and I assume most of the people followed that, Wisconsin Energy couldn't close down their plant because the federal government stepped in, to ensure reliability for the customers in the UP. The Michigan Governor and administration and others stepped in again, then, to prevent that from happening and have their own solution, which I think really determined that the Michigan solution for Michigan customers is best. And the one thing I still don't know is what the impact to the Upper Peninsula customers will be when this is all said and done. What we were able to determine before this deal was cut is that half of the customers up north would see a significant increase in rates on January 1, and that's been postponed. So the reality, the unintended consequence of full deregulation, which, in essence, is what happened in the Upper Peninsula because of the one company going to a different provider, really is playing out now in a way that is causing a lot of people to question this hybrid market that we have here in Michigan.","Thomas J. Webb","And we have a lot of confidence that the legislature will do what's in the best interest of Michigan and all of our customers. And to eliminate $150 million subsidy they're paying today is something that certainly gathers their attention.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I know. And then, you -- again, you folks have alluded a couple of times to stuff that's not in the plan, upside potential, both on the regulated side and with DIG as well. Is there a scenario that you could see out there that, frankly, you come back to us and say, \"Look guys, all of these good things are coming together, we told you 5% to 7%. But you know what, realistically, we're going to be north of 7% just looking at the visibility.\" Is that a realistic scenario that you could actually exceed 7%, given all of these upsides you've talked about?","John G. Russell","I don't see that right now. I think that's a question we've had in the past. I like the plan we have today, 5% to 7% growth, that's consistent, transparent and predictable. What we've shown you, and then Tom's slide does a nice job with the weather slide, that we reinvest and increase our expenses as we continue to have upside. And what that is, is it does a nice job balancing -- of balancing financial performance better than our peers, while also having operational performance at or above our peers. And we still have some work to do on the operational side to get to be first quartile in all the areas that we're working on. So I see the long-term, at least in the near-term, the 5-year plan, continuing the progress that we've made, continue the 5% to 7% growth, make more investments, as Tom indicated, if they're necessary, at the utility or if DIG continues to do well. I think the opportunity we have is to make sure that we have best-in-class operations and best-in-class financial results and that's what we're going to shoot for.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","In other words, John, if I paraphrase that, if you are seeing yourselves running above, like you've done in the short term, you will spend more money to keep you within the range; that's the way we should think about it.","John G. Russell","That's a good way to describe it. We've continued this approach now, for 3 to 4 years and I expect we'll continue it.","Thomas J. Webb","And I would just add, to spend more money to make our customers better off, we still have a lot of things that we need to do and not leave you short at all. We will work hard to deliver on that high-end while we take care of our customers. Maybe 10 years out or 5 years out, it won't be good investments we can make on the O&M side, maybe something will trickle through. But we got a lot of work to do over the next 2, 3 years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Eggers of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just with the Governor's speech in March and the new energy committee coming, what do you guys see as a progression, I guess, to see legislation move this year? How does legislative calendar work for their ability to put something up and get it done and what are realistic timelines for seeing a conclusion at the state?","John G. Russell","I think the timeline -- the reasonable timeline is sometime in '15. And you can go through the one slide that, I think, is important is the fact that the Governor's back and both the Senate and House are being -- energy committees are being led by experienced leaders. So the good news there is that they don't have to come up to speed. Most of the Senate energy committee has a lot of experience. Most of them had voted for the 2008 energy law. So the good news is, there won't be as much of a catch-up required for them. And the House, there's a lot of new members, so that may require a little more time on the House side of it. But when you look at this, it's possible, I'd say anytime in '15. I don't want to put a number on it Dan, because it's not -- anything can happen. But the natural time that we've talked about before, natural sunset for the 2008 energy law was or is 2015 and I expect it'll be done by the end of the year.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And John, as you're feeling that it's important to have your EPA at around 111, do you see a clarity on what those locations are for the state, before they can try and formulate a bigger, grander plan?","John G. Russell","Yes. Let me, from -- that's a great question. From my standpoint, you know that we're well positioned to meet the clean power plan; closing down the 7 coal units. We can achieve the interim basis and -- on our path to achieve the long-term basis that they have. What I was really pleased with, and we haven't seen all the details yet, is the Governor looking at this as a comprehensive solution for Michigan. So when he looks at energy departments, the DOE, the Department of Environmental Quality, he looks at the MPSC and having the environmental folks together talking about this, I think it positions Michigan well for the future without surprises. I think the coordination at government can be an issue at times and he's addressing it head on.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And I guess one of the bounding principles to your CapEx program has been managing customer bills and keeping that inflation below 2%. This year, again, you're below 1% and you're finding better O&M savings than budgeted. What is the outlook for bill inflation over the next couple of years? And does that create room or more flexibility to bump up the CapEx plan?","John G. Russell","Yes, I think it does. When you look at that, we -- on a bill basis, we continue -- the natural gas business, we'll start there, is very solid, because of the natural gas system that we have and being able to store natural gas with the prices of natural gas coming down. What you see on the electric side is, that Tom highlighted a couple of his slides there, you see a couple of things. We can continue to grow capacity or grow our capacity, build it while customers come back from ROA. So retail open access customers return, we have $150 million of subsidies that go away, that could be put into paying for the additional capital that we have. Longer term, we have several long-term purchase power agreements that are higher-than-market. And I think one of the slides that Tom showed you there today is, that as we terminate those contracts or they sunset, that we're able to build capacity and save our customers' money. And the one thing, I think, everybody knows, but I'll just mention it again, one of the reasons we can continue our O&M and we don't -- O&M reductions, and we don't see an end to this, is we've addressed the legacy issues, which, I think, we're one of the few companies that have done that across the board including the union. Those are the benefits that keep giving to us year over, year-over-year as we turn over the workforce. The other issue too, is we invest capital. We invest capital for several reasons, but 2 areas that are important to emphasize here: we invest capital to reduce O&M; and we reduce [ph] capital to reduce our fuel costs. And there's several examples; going into all this I don't want to give you, but, you think about smart meters. We're installing smart meters, we're almost at 700,000 smart meters, we invest capital, improve customer satisfaction with the ability to read accurately, all the time, to help our distribution operation and to eliminate the O&M cost of reading the meters. And this is going to continue as we shut down the 7 coal plants. We have a larger workforce compared to getting the same amount of megawatts and capacity out of our gas plants with much fewer associated costs. So this future, I see as -- I think, Tom referred to it as bright. I see it as bright. We scratched the surface now, and now, we're starting to see some of the things that we did a few years ago pay dividends as we go forward in the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Barnett of Morningstar.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","You've touched on this subject a little bit already, but I wanted to maybe hear some of your comments on, how you're going to deal with new rate design in terms of the conversation with regulators that you've had so far? And do you think that's kind of going to be a fairly easy conversation, given where the Governor stands on it and where, probably, some of the legislators stands on it or maybe, you could give a little more detail on how you expect that to change?","Thomas J. Webb","Yes. So you know that's well underway for both the major utilities in the state and there's a lot of different views, no question. But through the working groups that led up to the legislature saying, \"Let's make these changes,\" the commission now has a process underway to go ahead and execute these changes. They will actually help our energy-intensive customers reduce their rates by 16%, overall, our industrial customers by 10%, and then the offset that comes on the residential side, we cover that. We cover that by skipping rate cases, by being more productive, and when you look at the Slide #17, about electric customer prices, that really shows how it works. That shows we're able to keep our residential bills well below the national average and put rate design in place among -- with all the things to do to take our industrial rates and bring them down close to or into the competitive area. So we anticipate there'll be lively discussion because when one goes up, one goes down, it's the way life is. But we also expect that the policymakers and the regulators will look to do what's best and I suspect this will get through.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And with the March speech, obviously, that's entirely in the Governor's court and his prerogative, but do you expect there to be kind of harder details? And obviously, there have been a lot of things in the conversation already and he'll probably talk about this new agency as well. But I mean, not necessarily specifics on renewables but maybe some other areas that he's going to be targeting. Do you really expect that to kind of come out in March or is it going to be a, as you said earlier, kind of a through-2015 process?","John G. Russell","No. I think he's going to provide more details in March. I mean, for the Governor to state that 1 of his priorities in the State of the State was energy means he wants to get something done on energy. He also indicated in that same State of the State that March is going to have a presentation or discuss the details more. So I expect he's working on it now and I expect we'll all see a lot more details in March.","Operator","Your next question comes from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI, Research Division","I know that you said that for now we should assume that you're going to plan within the 5% to 7% aspiration. But I just want to be clear that you also said something additional just now, in answer to a subsequent question that, if there were further headroom created in the business model by either your ability to reduce costs further or to take advantage of the reduction in subsidies or to have to respond to the necessity of getting more capacity into rate base, those would constitute scenarios under which you might be able to exceed 7%. Is that correct? And then I have a follow-up.","John G. Russell","No. No. 5% to 7% is our range. That's what we'll continue. Yes. I hope I didn't confuse anybody. If there's capital opportunities in the future, I think the question that was asked of me is, how will that affect your rates in keeping the bills competitive? And we have ways to invest capital and keep the bills competitive. But Greg, what I see happening is 5% to 7%. If we make any additional capital investments and we have better growth than that 5% to 7%, we will reinvest expenses back into the business to get our operational performance to be best-in-class. And I see that happening for the next several years.","Thomas J. Webb","And then, I may have misguided you as I said, as you go out through many years there is a point where, if those reinvestments are not economical, they don't make sense to our customers we're wasting their money. We're not going to do that and there could be a little bit of flow through into the guidance, but that's out a few years. We got plenty to do in the next 2 to 3 years. And even though we've got a 10-year plan we're really focused on the next 2 to 3 years, making things work.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI, Research Division","Well, I guess, that's my point. There's so many potential capital investments that will be beneficial to the customer and to the Michigan economy that, under certain circumstances obviously, that if you could find more headroom and keep rate increases at a minimum, I guess, the inference would be that you could perhaps do better. But your saying that you'll manage it, right [ph]?","Thomas J. Webb","We, sure -- no. I think, Greg, you're right. We would, theoretically, but remember, last year we reinvested about $100 million -- the year before in '13; we did another $100 million just short of that this year, and we see that opportunity to do it again in '15 and '16 if the opportunity persists. And I mean, there's a lot of examples but we had a little bit of a ice here in Michigan this morning, and good -- even though our system's running really well, if we can do more tree-trimming that's a big way to improve reliability. So that's just one very simple example of what we can do. So we don't want to disappoint you, but 5% to 7%.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI, Research Division","You're not disappointing anybody, believe me. A follow-up question on the capacity-price slide. Just want to be clear. When you say was, now and future, is was what you -- the $5 million, what you earned in '14 is now, $15 million what you expect to earn in '15 and then what's in the guidance? And...","Thomas J. Webb","Just for clarity, I will use that slide. We told you previously that we had about $5 million in the DIG numbers for capacity margins, if you will. That number is now $15 million because we have put in place a few of those contracts as we've been layering things in. So that impacts about $15 million; that's in our plan: We built that. But there's still, we think, another upside of $20 million to $40 million as we layer in more capacity contracts and again, we're not trying to wait for a peak. We're just -- as they come up $0.50 or so we'd layer in a few more long-term ones, as they come up maybe, another $0.50, layer in a few more. So it's a slow process. But there's another $20 million to $40 million upside that's not in the plan. We're not comfortable with putting that in our numbers until we know we're going to let those contracts.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI, Research Division","And that's a business outside of the regulated utility construct, right? So that would be sort of -- if you were to see a scenario where you get very quickly to the, sort of, midpoint of that $20 million to $40 million that could potentially provide an upside to the 7% then?","Thomas J. Webb","That's correct. But it also, we -- connect all the dots, allows us to have an opportunity to put a little bit more into the utility, now we haven't under-earned in a long time, but we'd put a little bit more in there and let DIG kind of help that. So we do connect that up, it's not totally separate when we give you that 5% to 7% earnings growth. But I admit, at least it's in a different segment.","Operator","Your next question is from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just -- can I just to pick up first on something from Greg's question, make sure I understand, the new 9-year contract at 406 [ph]is that part of the transition to the future scenario? Or is that sort of part of the now?","Thomas J. Webb","Yes. That 9-year contract's already baked in. That's included. So what I'm talking about -- and I'll give you a feel for this. This may help you a little bit. We've layered in capacity contracts that cover the bulk of this year for '15. But we could layer in almost another 500 megawatts in '16, another 600 megawatts in '17. So there is capacity there. We've not locked up, because we anticipate that capacity prices will rise a little more than they have today. We're seeing that in bilateral discussions, so that's the opportunity that's not in.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So that -- we should think of the contract as sort of firming up the -- your view of where prices are today, but it's part of that current plan?","Thomas J. Webb","Yes, exactly. So remember, when you read that 9-year contract, read carefully, that's energy and that was an update on that. The capacity side, you see a couple of contracts that were done, in fact with consumers, that were recently approved. But we've got a lot of space to move up and we're just not -- you know us, we're so conservative. We're not going to put it in the plan until we're pretty certain that we can do it.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then Tom, I know -- could you give us a little insight into what types of specific items have enabled you to bring the O&M forecast through negative 2 to negative 3 for these 2 years? .","Thomas J. Webb","Yes. And I'm going to do that maybe a little bit differently. I'll get to your question this way: to give you a better feel for what's ahead, 2015 compared to what we did in 2014. We're going to get another 3% out even though, everyone's aware, that most all companies have had to reflect the mortality tables. That cost us $35 million. And the new discount rates and for us, that cost us a little over $20 million. So right there, there's $55 million of higher cost. We count it all. We don't adjust it out. We don't say, \"Oh, that's terrible. We just -- we won't count the bad stuff.\" We've fully offset that with better pull-top maintenance that we're doing. There's work in that area that will allow us to be more productive and efficient with what we're doing in O&M, there's $25 million to $30 million there. Our productivity across the board, higher quality improvements is another $30 million, here's a place where you're throwing money down the trash can: Our uncollectible accounts have gone up a little bit in the last year or 2 and no customer's interested in that and neither are you. So we're looking to get $20 million improvement in those uncollectible accounts. IT productivity, gets us another $15 million. Remember the Classic 7, we're getting prepared to go away so some of that cost begins to go away. There's about $7 million in there. Overhead, I'm too expensive, so 1 day they'll get rid of me, but not yet, but there's another $500 million of overhead that we have planned to go away this year. So there were a mixture of things in what I just went through that are a little richer, a little better, than what we have told you previously. So instead of being down 2%, you know we were already looking at all these items. We just didn't want to promise till we felt good about getting them. We're now at 3% and candidly, our internal numbers are a bigger reduction than that. But 3% is all we're willing to put on the table at this point for 2015.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And then can I just ask one thing on the -- did I hear you say that your target dividend payout ratio is 60% to 70%? Or was it that it's just 62% for 2015?","Thomas J. Webb","No. It's 60% to 70%. The range we think we'll live in over time. That's us guessing where other companies and our peers will be over time, on average. Very precisely, the number is 62% today.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","But you did then say 60% to 70%. So my question, I guess, is how should we think about the fact that you're at the lower end of that range currently? And your comments about potential for incremental investment. Should we assume that if some of those don't play out, the dividend could really grow even faster or...?","Thomas J. Webb","No, I wouldn't think of it that way but I'd think of it this way. The average of our peers is 62%. So that's why we're trying to be there. If that -- and there are some companies that are higher. I think they have a little less opportunity to make capital investments so this is a way to give some money back. As that number goes up, that average goes up, we're going to look seriously at chasing that, unless our 7% or high-end kind of numbers don't get us there, right? So we just want you to know that we doubt the average will go higher than 70%, we doubt it will go lower than 60%. So being at 62% is the average where we should be, but if anything, the bias would be to the higher side and we'll watch that as we evaluate it each year with the Board.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","But it'll be dependent on where the peers track basically?","Thomas J. Webb","Exactly.","Operator","Your next question is from Andrew Weisel of Macquarie Capital.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","I'm actually all set. I meant to withdraw my question.","Operator","Your next question is from Brian Russo of Ladenburg Thalmann.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But just a clarification on the $20 million to $40 million upside based on future capacity prices. Can you kind of book end over what time periods that we might expect that?","Thomas J. Webb","Yes. I -- we're guessing, right? And hopefully, intelligent guesses. But we suspect, as MISO sees a shortfall of approaching as much as 3,000 megawatts in our Zone 7, that as people get closer to 2016 when they predict that, they'll want to have the comfort that they're not going to have an issue. So more people will look for capacity and there won't be a lot of it around, and so the opportunities for those prices to naturally go up will occur, we think, in '15 and maybe as late as in '16. So I see us being able to execute contracts on some of the surplus capacity at DIG that we just talked about, in that 500-megawatt-plus zone, in that period. So it may all occur in '16, but I get the sense that there may be a chance yet in '15 as people try to protect themselves appropriately.","Operator","Your next question is from Paul Patterson of Glenrock.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just on Slide 23, just a few quick housekeeping items. The fuel savings of $25 million that you have in O&M, what's that about?","Thomas J. Webb","So think of that as mix of plants. So as we take our coal plants out and we replace them with renewables and gas plants, it takes fewer people to actually manage those operations. And therefore, that's productivity. That's a lot of people coming out. So...","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I got you, makes sense. Okay and then, with benefits going down $75 million, what's driving that?","Thomas J. Webb","So we've done a series of things over the years as much as 9 and 10 years ago, we changed our pension plans, both for salaried and for hourly workers to define contribution program for new employees that come in, and we kept our promise for employees that had these defined benefit programs. So as you can imagine, we have an attrition rate of about 400 people a year and as new people come in to replace them, they're coming in on more attractive programs for them and for the company. Same thing on health care and retiree health care. A year ago, we actually changed our retiree health care sharing. So people that contribute to their health care today will continue to do so, at a lesser amount, but they'll continue to do so in their retirement years, and again, more and more people go into that, our savings continue to compound as we go to the future. So this $75 million is a recognition on what's going to happen over the next 5 years.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. I mean, just to clarify this. Sometimes when changes are happening to retiree benefits, et cetera, those expected reductions are showed up in the current period as a reflux of a lower obligation effectively and it impacts earnings in the near term, if you follow me. It sounds like this is something that you've done in the past and you guys are actually predicting seeing the benefit in the future. Do I have that correct?","Thomas J. Webb","You do. Let me just make sure you got it, though. So we did recognize that good news for existing employees. That's history. And now we're going to recognize that, or we're forecasting, as we change our employee mix we'll see more of it.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Okay, that makes sense. And then you mentioned working capital as being a benefit to operating cash flow in 2014. I was just wondering if you could clarify little bit, sort of, quantify that maybe? And sort of what the nature of that was and whether that's going be ongoing? And if so, for how long? If you follow me.","Thomas J. Webb","Well, yes, it will be ongoing. But remember the nature of working capital, when you achieve the improvement, you need to repeat that to hold your level of cash flow. So I don't want you to think that you can start compounding what I'm going to say. But we saved over $20 million at the end of this year by simply paying our suppliers when they're due, not before and not late. And we had, had in the past, when the invoice would come in, some of our folks would -- and it was due, say, on January 10, they would just do 1 transaction, authorize that and we pay it in December. What we do now is, we put it in the record that we're going to pay it in January and we don't pay in December, we pay it when it's due. Not late and not early. So that was a good chunk. We had some money out with other people on deposits that were due to come back to us in January and February, and our operational team was able to work with those folks and just say, \"Could we get that cash back?\" Since everything that was needed to be complied with was done in 2014. So we just have lots of things like that where everyday -- it's all part of continuous improvement. How do we make our promise to make our customers better off, treat our suppliers just perfectly, take care of our employees, do all those things and be more productive? And that's what was flowing through some of these working capital improvements.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And you guys expect those to continue?","Thomas J. Webb","Absolutely.","Operator","Your next question is from Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Can you remind us how big DIG is? And how much energy and capacity is contracted out for the next few years and what's open?","Thomas J. Webb","Yes. So if you take DIG and a couple of small peakers [ph] that go with it, it's 852 megawatts of capacity. And in this year, there's not a lot of left to contract. We're down to having about 50 megawatts open. In 2016, we're presently at 477 megawatts available and then in 2017, it's a little over 600 megawatts. Does that help you?","Paul T.

This call is being recorded. Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at noon, Eastern Time, running through August 1. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Glenn Barba, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. Please go ahead.","Glenn P. Barba","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. With me are John Russell, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Webb, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Our earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on our website. This presentation is made as of the date hereof and contains forward-looking statements as defined in Rule 3b-6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Rule 175 of the Securities Act of 1933 and relevant legal decisions.","The forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements should be considered in the context of the risk and other factors detailed from time to time in CMS Energy's and Consumers Energy's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with the Forward-looking Statements and Information and Risk Factors sections of CMS Energy's and Consumers Energy's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, and as updated in subsequent 10-Qs.","CMS Energy's and Consumers Energy's Forward-looking Statements and Information and Risk Factors sections are incorporated herein by a reference and discuss important factors that could cause CMS Energy's and Consumers Energy's results to differ materially from those anticipated in such statements.

A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in the Appendix and posted in the Investors section of our website.","CMS Energy provides historical financial results on both the reported Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and adjusted or non-GAAP basis, and provides forward-looking guidance on an adjusted basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company's present operating financial performance, unaffected by discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, regulatory items from prior years or other items. These items have the potential to impact favorably or unfavorably the company's reported earnings in future periods. Because the company is not able to estimate the impact of these matters, the company is not providing a reconciliation to the comparable future period reported earnings.","Now I will turn the call over to John.","John G. Russell","Thanks, Glenn, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our second quarter earnings call.","We have several announcements to share with you this morning, which Tom and I will cover in detail throughout the call. I'll begin the presentation with a few brief comments about the quarter before I turn the call over to Tom to discuss the financial results and the outlook for 2013. Then we'll close, as we typically do, with Q&A.","In the first half of the year, adjusted earnings were $0.83. That's up $0.06 from last year or 8%. The strong first half keeps us on track for our full year plan and we're reaffirming guidance of $1.63 to $1.66 per share.","Sally Talberg was appointed to the MPSC earlier this month, replacing Commissioner Isiogu, and we look forward to working with her.","Cost cutting and holding base rate increases below 2% continues to be a strategic focus for us. Today, I am announcing a number of new cost-reduction initiatives that will allow us to avoid our next planned electric and gas base rate increases. These self-initiated cost reductions allow us to dedicate more resources to improving customer service and reliability, while maintaining our current capital investment plan and our long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7%. More on this in just a minute.","As you know, we have filed a certificate of necessity seeking approval for the full recovery of our new base load gas plant. In June, MISO approved our application to delay the mothballing of our 7 small coal plants until April of 2016. After these plants are mothballed, market purchases will fill the capacity gap in the short term. We believe that the right decision is to build a new combined cycle baseload natural gas plant to come online in 2017. Given today's environment, this is the right fuel choice and the right technology to serve our customers.","As I've mentioned, we have filed the CON and expect approval within 9 months. Approval of the CON provides a certainty to recovery of our investments. This safeguard is a provision of the 2008 Energy Law. This new 700-megawatt gas plant, if needed for Michigan's energy future, and locally, will provide 600 construction jobs and other economic benefits.","Michigan's regulatory environment has been constructive under the former Chairman and now outgoing Commissioner Isiogu. We want to thank him for his commitment to Michigan. The new commissioner's prior experience included the 2008 Energy Law, and she has been involved in the Appendix A process, which you know is a data-driven discovery process kicked off by the governor last fall.","Recently, there have been a number of constructive regulatory outcomes that benefit our customers and our business. Settling the electric rate case for $89 million was a first for us. Our industrial customers will benefit from lower rates as a result of the elimination of rate skewing.","In June, the commission issued an order on Smart Energy. The proposed opt-out fee was approved. In addition, the commission stated, once again, their approval for full deployment of our Smart Energy program.","Our company has been a leader in cost control initiatives for many years. Since the 2008 Energy Law, we have filed annual rate cases to recover our capital investments and pass along the O&M cost reductions to our customers. Avoiding the next planned electric and gas base rate increases is good for our customers and still allows us to continue to invest in needed capital projects. Cost-cutting initiatives that were implemented several years ago are having a better-than-planned impact. Capital investments are reducing O&M, and we are taking additional steps to reduce costs even further. Minimizing the impact on customers will allow us to continue our investment program and deliver consistent financial performance in the future.","Even with pushing out the base rate increases, our 10-year $15 billion capital investment plan is unchanged. Our clean power investments will continue to reduce NOx, SO2, mercury and carbon emissions, while maintaining our balanced energy initiative.","Our capital investments are generally incremental and secure. We have many investment opportunities to improve customer service and reliability, but none of them are bet-the-company major investments.","For example, our 2 largest are the $750 million, 700-megawatt gas plant and a $750 million Smart Energy program. We've just received approval to recover our Smart Energy investment cost and the approval of the CON will ensure the same for the gas plant. Should any of these projects encounter delays, we have a backlog of other customer projects that can be accelerated.","As you can see on this slide, our O&M cost would be up 21% over a decade if we maintained costs at the rate of inflation. Prior to our announcement today, we projected our cost to be down at 9%, a good bit below inflation.","As you can see by the green line, we have been able to accelerate and increase the size of our cost reductions, resulting in a cumulative decline of 15% through 2015, a substantial improvement compared with inflation.","Now before I turn the call over to Tom, I want to invite all of you to attend the Investor Day -- our Investor Day in Grand Rapids, Michigan. It is planned for October 24 of this year, and it should be a great event. Now, let me turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas J. Webb","Thanks, John. The investments that you just described deliver important services for our customers and predictable, continued growth for our investors. Our planned cost reductions are working even better than we anticipated just a few months ago. These savings have permitted us to avoid our present gas rate case and our next planned electric rate case. This provides for improved customer rates and reduced investor risk.","Now for the first half, our earnings were $0.83 a share on both a reported and an adjusted basis. This is $0.06 or 8% better than last year. Cooler-than-normal weather in the winter and accelerated cost performance in the first quarter provided us with an opportunity to invest in incremental customer reliability and service already in the second quarter. Actual and projected costs are better than planned. While recent sales are stronger, we continue to forecast a little conservatively.","We're maintaining EPS guidance at 5% to 7% growth or $1.63 to $1.66 a share. As is our past practice, we're reinvesting that stronger-than-planned performance in customer reliability improvements. So despite some onetime benefits a year ago that did not repeat this year, including recovery of coal plant investments, we've been able to continue our healthy pace of earnings growth. Now please recall our work last year when we offset fully the adverse implications of unusually mild weather in 2012. Otherwise, this would've reduced 2012 earnings by $0.13 a share.","Later in the year, we benefited from a hotter-than-normal summer and put this upside to use by investing substantially more in tree trimming, generating plant maintenance and system hardening.","The benefits are showing up in our present reliability performance during prolonged hot and humid weather. We also were able to make important contributions to low income funds and our charitable foundation at the end of last year. None of these jeopardized delivering another strong year of earnings growth, up 7% from the prior year, the top end of our guidance range.","During the first quarter of this year, favorable to plan weather sales and cost performance provided room to begin more investment in customer reliability. Continued strong cost performance in the second quarter and recent hot weather are creating even more opportunity. The good news, better-than-planned sales weather and cost adds up to $0.14 a share. Hot weather in July may add another $0.04 or a favorable profit. We're already making good use of this strong performance in the second quarter and will do more in the second half to improve reliability. This also helps avoid both gas and electric base rate increases for at least a year.","One big boost, as you can see here, is the Michigan economy. It continues to perform well relative to other states. GDP growth from 2010 to 2012 was 11% in Michigan, the fifth best of any state and substantially higher than the U.S. growth rate at just under 7%. Several firms have announced that they are shifting manufacturing operations back to the U.S., mainly to be closer to their customer base and avoid high energy cost overseas. For the period year-end 2009 through March 2013, Michigan has added 88,000 new workers, topping the list of states, including Texas, Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin. Since June 2009, the Michigan Economic Index is up 74%. That also compares favorably with other states.","Overall, our industrial customers have had a good recovery, resulting in electric sales at a pace better than surrounding states. For the period 2010 through 2012, weather normalized industrial sales, and our service territory have improved 18%, that's substantially higher than the average of U.S. utilities at 7%. Overall, electric sales for that same period are up 4% for us compared with 1% for the average of U.S. utilities.","U.S. electric sales growth has slowed over the last year, and we, too, have seen slower growth, but still at a pace that we think is a little stronger than most. Electric sales in the first quarter, without leap year anomalies, were up 1.7%. The second quarter was down 1.5%, but we witnessed some really odd weather adjustments, particularly in May and June when the temperatures were high. But customers in Michigan typically would not yet make use of their air-conditioning. Although sales was slower in the second quarter, we believe our full-year outlook at a growth of about 0.5% is still reasonable and, perhaps, just a little conservative. Please also recall that excluding energy optimization, underlying total sales would be up 1.5%. And for industrial, those sales would be up 2.5%.","Now John mentioned several areas where investment is focused over the next 10 years. We're fortunate to be able to report a large variety of important smaller programs rather than a few bet-the-company projects, recognizing our work to keep the overall size of our total investment programs at a pace where base rate increases are still less than inflation. We are pleased to report that even with our new gas plant, we'll be able to keep investment over the next 5 years under $7 billion. This provides resources for important customer improvements and a consistent, predictable pace of earnings growth.","Here's a chart we showed you in our last call. You can see here how our O&M cost reductions compare with our peers. Specific examples of how we've accomplished this are shown on the right. You'll note that in 2013, we expected our O&M cost to be down 6%, and that's 8% below inflation. And we projected that over the next 5 years, cost would be down another 1%. Well, we were wrong. We now target that our cost in 2013 will be down 8% or 10% below the level of inflation. We project that we'll be able to reduce our cost an average of 2% a year over the next 5 years.","Now as John announced today and as shown on the left, this improved cost performance has permitted us to provide -- or to avoid our 2013 gas rate case.","And as you can see on the right side of this slide, the impact's even bigger. We've been able to avoid our next annual electric rate case planned for 2014.","The benefit changes that we made over the last 10 years are now bearing substantial fruit. For example, all new hires, both salary and union, have been participating in a defined contribution pension program, rather than a defined benefit program.","We've also increased productivity and reduced our workforce by 500 people over the last 3 years and more than 1,000 over the last 6. All this, while employee engagement levels still remain substantially high in the first quartile.","We've identified further tax savings and we've been able to accelerate our second wind farm called Cross Winds to enable us to participate in the federal production tax credit program. Also our employees have been sharing in the cost of health care for some time. Similar sharing in our retiree health-care program adds to cost savings.","Just the improvements in these few areas have fully covered rates that would've been required to support our new electric and gas capital investments for 2014, eliminating the need to ask for new base rate -- case base rate increases and cases. We do not anticipate needing additional recovery until a 2015 test year. As you can see here, instead of increasing our electric base rates by something less than 2%, we now expect to hold them flat through 2014.","We don't anticipate any change in our return on equity at 10.3%, and we do not expect any risk that would jeopardize future earnings and cash flow growth at 5% to 7% a year. We are asking our Public Service Commission to help us enable some of these cost and rate savings, including the certificate of necessity to build a new low-cost gas plant to replace higher-cost small coal plants. We will request an accounting letter to permit sharing of tax benefits associated with older vintage assets. We'll also request authorization to securitize remaining costs associated with the small coal plants that will be retired.","There may be even more opportunities as Michigan reviews its 2008 Energy Law. We worked hard to sustain continuous improvements to our cost structure and the quality of our balance sheet, which recently resulted in upgrades by both S&P and Moody's for CMS and Consumers. Even these improvements provided new cost savings, including $2 million this year associated with financing cost and revolver fees. And we expect this annual savings to grow to about $8 million a year.","Now as always, here's our earnings and cash flow sensitivities chart to help you assess the outlook. We believe our projections are well-balanced and that they minimize risk. We're on track to meet all of our financial targets for 2013. And as mentioned in our last quarterly call, fortunate to have a little room to move. This should be our 11th year in a row of industry-leading profit cash flow and dividend growth.","We do hope you will be able to join us on October 24 for the Investor Day in Grand Rapids, Michigan. We've arranged to have our Public Service Commissioners available to chat with you; a chance to visit our 2-gigawatt pump storage operation in Ludington, where substantial upgrades are underway; and to meet our team to talk about the capital investment programs ahead over the next 10 years.","So thank you for your attention today on what we know is usually a very busy day of earnings calls. We appreciate and deeply value your interest and your support. And John and I would be delighted to take your questions at this time. So operator, would you please open the call for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Kevin Cole, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just to dig into, I guess, the moving pieces a little bit. So on Slide 20, am I reading it correctly that you expect O&M to fall through 2017? And so the 2015 rate case would just be capital-driven?","John G. Russell","I think the simple answer to that is yes. In fact, there's other pieces. Obviously, there's revenue pieces to the rate case. There could be ROE pieces to the rate case, although we don't expect that. But as we drive our O&M down, we will have our new capital investment requirements, and we suspect that whatever they are, we'll be able to offset that a little bit in our request for rate relief.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then, Tom, is it possible during the stay-out between now and 2015 or during the 2015 U.S. legislature review that you can seek either capital trackers on environmental CapEx or on the new gas plant that could enable you to stay out even further?","Thomas J. Webb","Well, to get a tracker mechanism in place, as you've described it, would require a rate case. So that's the sort of thing that we'll talk about with the next rate case. But I'm sure there'll be lots of dialogue around things like that over the course of the next year as people look at what's the right legislative model and what's the right regulatory model. So there'll be lots of discussion, lots of progress, but the implementation would be through a rate case.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, then last question just so I have the timing right, so with the stay-out are you expecting to file in mid-'14 with self-implementation 1115 or to file in '15?","John G. Russell","Now, we haven't actually announced what those dates would be, but if you'd let me characterize it just a little loosely, and gas and electric could be slightly different, but I would expect we do something in the summer of '14, self-implementation would certainly be towards the very back-end of 2014, if not the early part of 2015. But I must say, the progress that we're making on the cost side of the ledger is so strong we'll be looking at that carefully, but we wouldn't want to tell you that we could wait beyond the 2015 test year.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. So one last question. What are your volumes assumptions for 2014?","Thomas J. Webb","We -- what we show is our growth kind of at a modest level. We'll plan over the period about 0.5% to 1% for electric weather-adjusted rate growth. And I think if you see something like that in '14, you shouldn't be surprised.","Operator","The next question comes from Jonathan Arnold, Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Quick question on the cost saving. John, you mentioned that you had -- that some of this was kind of outperformance on -- when you talked to Slide 10 this is where you showed the kind of 9% reduction on the prior plan, and now you think it's more like 15%. You said some of this is outperformance on existing programs, and some of it is new initiatives. I was wondering if you could just give a bit more color on how much you've -- how much of this -- how much you're counting on for the new reductions, and how much of those are things that actually basically in the bag and how much do you still have to implement?","John G. Russell","Yes. I think Tom showed you in his slide the detail behind it, Jonathan. One of the things that, I guess, surprised us -- pleasantly surprised us a little bit is we've been aggressively cutting costs for many years now. And many of these legacy costs changes that we made, particularly with the union in 2 contracts ago are paying dividends today. I mean, we're seeing the benefit of that. But also several years ago, we started initiative, which -- and just if you can bear with me a minute, I'll tell you how we've really gotten here. We're focused on improving safety, which we thought safety was the root of getting to the end and making us a successful company. We can't do it safe, we shouldn't be doing it. We've been able to move from fourth to first quartile in safety. After we did safety, the other focus we had is to ensure we have higher productivity. So we've been able to move from productivity of about, when we started measuring it up, about 40% or 50% over the past 5 years. And as Tom mentioned in his comments, which I think is important, our employee engagement is also now first quartile. So what we've been able to do is reduce cost, capture the productivity, the safety and the performance of our employees with the engagement. And what it's helping us do is reduce cost and serve customers better than what we expected by this time frame. So that's what's really driving this piece of it. But I tell you the one thing that surprised us most is how the continuation of the employees who are retiring with the legacy benefits compared to the new hires that we have that have some of the pay-as-you-go benefits, which has helped us substantially.","Thomas J. Webb","And if I might just add, I'd say that to your question about what's in the bag, we never like to say that the hard work we're doing is all in the bag. I mean, the operating guys would hang me if I said that. But I am going to go ahead and say it anyhow because what we're doing, a lot of it is already behind us, the way John just described it. And a lot of what's in front of us, we control it. It's things that we do. So from that sense, they're in the bag. There are a couple of things we do need help on, so one of the savings will be the securitization, so we will request the commission's help on the securitization, and we'll make that request in September. So we need their support on that. And we do have the CON in place, which is good economics for our customers, so we need their support on that. And then lastly, we do need an accounting order. It's almost a technicality, but it saves money for customers, so we're hopeful that they'll see that as a very positive thing as well. So there's a few things that we need some support on that aren't completely in our control, but most of this, we control it, we're doing it, so a CFO calls it in the bag even though there's a lot of work to do.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can you just -- can you put a number around the securitization, perhaps?","Thomas J. Webb","Yes. That savings will be about $20 million to customers, and that won't kick in until probably around 2015. And the reason for that is, this is all provided for in laws put in place 10 years ago. And it takes about 90 days for the commission to review if they think it's the right thing to do, and then we provide time for appeal. So all parties can participate in something like this and ask questions. We assume that process could take as long as into 2014. And if it does, therefore, we plan the benefits for our customers in 2015. If it happens earlier, that's great. But that's our plan.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","The $20 million would be the savings, then how much would you have be securitizing?","Thomas J. Webb","We'd be securitizing in round numbers. $400 million, and the annual savings would be about $20 million.","Operator","The next question comes from Greg Gordon, ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","A question on your nonregulated businesses. I know you still have an ownership interest in the DIG gas plant. Can you talk about some of the actions you took over the course of the first half to try to increase profitability of that plant? My understanding is that you actually bid some of that plant into the PJM auction?","Thomas J. Webb","Yes, it's a good question. We're actually being very patient with our operation at the Dearborn Industrial Generation facility. They run well, they do a good job. But as you know in the capacity market that we have in MISO, if you want to call it that, the capacity prices are very low. We believe they will come back up. Lots of debate over the pace and the magnitude, but what we don't want to do is lock in for the long-term lower prices. So what we are doing is short-term contracts. And we're looking at things like, to your point, PJM. We looked at taking one of our units there and bidding that into PJM. And I think that most people were disappointed with the prices that came out of that bid for 3 years from now for everybody. But they're still better than what we are getting in MISO today. So we'll have some decisions ahead as to whether we stay with that market for 3 years from now or whether we sell that off to a counter party. We'll have opportunities on that decision. But the way to think about our plant there, short-term contracts, well run, as prices start to come back up, we'll start to layer in, like a cake, different contracts to take this us out over a period of time. And we'll do longer periods, as the prices are a little bit better. DIG's been a good contributor to us in the past. It's still a small but good contributor today. I think it'll be a larger contributor in the future.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great. One last question. I know it's not your service territory, but do you see any knock-on effects in terms of economic impacts of the Detroit bankruptcy in your service territory?","John G. Russell","No, I don't, Greg. I mean, that's something -- we don't serve that area, but it's a very important for Michigan as the state to have Detroit issues settled. So from that standpoint alone, certainly been a lot of media attention related to it. But I think they're on the path, albeit difficult, for success to move through some of the difficult things. So I see it in the long-term as a benefit. In the short term, it doesn't affect us.","Thomas J. Webb","I think you'll get some good insights tomorrow, I believe, when DTE does their call. They clearly are closer to it and do a lot of good work there.","Operator","The next question comes from Paul Patterson, Glenrock.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just to circle back on Page 20. I mean, were all these -- I mean, how much of this had to do with any new initiatives that you actually took in place, versus, I mean, they were just better-than-expected?","Thomas J. Webb","Well, Page 20 is a good one to look at. If you look at what's up in the top of that page, those are all things we'd plan to do, and they either are well underway or you could consider them like good plans. If you look at what's called additional cost controls, that's where you'll see some of the things that we're able to do to avoid our rate cases coming up, and therefore, keep our base rates flat. And so when you look at that, I'll just quickly highlight them, the low-cost financing I talked about, well it was kind of in the plan, but we didn't expect it to bear as much fruit. The Cross Winds was -- and the way you should think about that, there's a lot of advantages in what we did here. But the simple one is we moved quicker to make sure we get the PTC. If we'd gone a little slower, we might have risked getting the PTC. So that's a little extra plus that we picked up in our plan. Tax benefits, those are just simply doing some things that we hadn't intended to do before to pass on some tax benefits to our customers and we didn't have them in our plan before. So that's where we're going to add...","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Can you give me -- is that the $70 million? Could you give me an idea what kind of stuff that would be?","Thomas J. Webb","Yes. It's really -- well, it's actually extremely complicated. And I'll make it very simple. It has to do with cost of removal. And since 1993, we've been doing a form of accounting that just flowed all of the benefits through to our customers. Prior to that, so all the plants that were in place prior to that have cost of removal being collected overtime, which we still collect, the tax benefit hasn't been flowing through to our customers, and we're proposing to do that. That's just doing the accounting a little bit differently and helping our customers out for what we call those vintage plants. So that's a really good idea. Probably...","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","So you're collecting the money now, but you're passing the tax benefit on to customers, does that have an impact on earnings? Or I mean...","Thomas J. Webb","Well, no. Technically, that gives us an earnings benefit that was hung up on the balance sheet, which helps you offset the earnings impact of giving this money back to customers on a faster pace. And then on a cash flow standpoint, it's a negative cash flow for the company. It's positive for the customers, but we have other cash flow items that have offset all of that. So they neatly tuck together. And then the last one which is -- no, go ahead, I'm sorry.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","The health care benefits?","Thomas J. Webb","Yes. I was going to go to that. The retiree health -- go ahead.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Well, is that one of the things where you're going to be changing the health care benefits that are currently -- in the current plan, you're going to be changing them, and therefore, there's going to be an accounting benefit recognizing the net present value benefit of the long-term impact?","Thomas J. Webb","Exactly. But what I will add to that, because you described it quite well, we have a nice program today that we've been doing over a decade of sharing our active premiums between employees pay a little bit and the company pays a little bit. We were not fully doing that kind of thing for our retiree health care. So we're just easing into that in a very gradual way. But you described it, by thinking about the benefit to the company of that into our customers of that over the long period of retirement, it adds up to quite a big number that you see here. So you described it correctly. I just want to color it to understand it. We're just sort of feathering that in slowly in a way that, just like our active employees' share in the premiums today, they'll share in the retiree health care wraparound of Medicare.","Operator","The next question comes from Ali Agha, SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to be clear on a point you made about the delay in the rate case and the help that you need from the regulators or securitization, tax benefit sharing, et cetera. Just to be clear, if for whatever reason, that does not come through, does that cause you to accelerate the timing of the rate case? Or I just want to understand the link between that and the timing.","Thomas J. Webb","Let me take the 3 pieces individually so that -- because they're not all the same. On securitization, we assume the benefits in 2015, so we think that is a pretty standard process and that will work fine. If it didn't, that would not impact what we've just told you about rate cases for 2014. It would not. And then on the certificate of need for our new plant, the way you should think about that, we're very optimistic that we have the right proposal that it will be approved. But let's assume it weren't. If for some reason we're turned down, then we wouldn't build that plant. But as you know, John described it pretty well this morning, we have so much investment that's sitting out beyond this period, we'll be able to pull some of that customer investment in and replace that. So what I would say is that from an earnings and cash flow standpoint, that wouldn't really have a big impact, but it would be disappointing because it wouldn't provide the best operations for our customers. Then I would say on the tax case, if on that one -- we believe that's a pretty easy one to do, but I don't want to speak for the commission. It's an opportunity to reduce rates as we go forward for our customers. So to get that accounting order should be fairly simple to do, but if for some reason it was concluded that it would not be done, then we would relook at our rate cases, and we probably would file an electric and a gas rate case sooner than we described today. I don't anticipate that. I've kind of gone way over to the negative weeds to describe to you what would happen. I think we're on a good course. I believe the commission will, I don't want to speak for them, but I believe they will see the large benefits of these things and support the company's proposal. We'll see how that plays out. We'll know that one over the next month or 2 at most. And if we do fail, we'll revise our plan to file for rate cases, but I'm optimistic that we won't fail.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay, and also related to that, I believe you have -- you mentioned electric load growth weather normalized 0.5% to 1% is what you would look at. For some reason, if it again slowed down, was flat to even perhaps negative, will that also cause you to rethink the timing?","Thomas J. Webb","No.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then last question on the CON. Some folks have suggested that there may be excessive [indiscernible] out there, IBP [ph] capacity that would be used. Any sense on how strong of a case that is?","John G. Russell","Yes, Ali, I think what you're going to see is that there'll be people that'll intervene in the case, and there's some excess capacity in Michigan that you know of today. And I think what you're going to see is other people will try to make a case that their plants are better to be purchased by us or are a long-term contract from us than what the Thetford plant that we're proposing is. I tell you, from my standpoint, right now, the plant that we're proposing has the best technology, has the best site. It currently has all the infrastructure in place to move forward. It creates the jobs in a rather depressed area. I think that's a benefit for everybody from that standpoint. But I will tell you the one thing that we will not do, if the CON is not approved, we will not go forward. And the second issue is we will not move forward with a long-term power purchase agreement. I mean, that's not in the best interest of our customers. Our customers are paying for those long-term PPAs that we have today. And the reason they're paying for it is that we don't have any flexibility with these long-term contracts, while market prices decline or capacity prices are low. So you may -- I expect this to be a pretty hotly-debated CON process, and what we'll end up at the end of the day is doing what's best for our customers. And I think that I'm glad you asked the question. That's something that we -- I want to make sure everybody understood.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Got it. And so if not long-term PPAs, then you'd look for short-term options in that scenario?","John G. Russell","Exactly. Yes, short-term would be the case or a purchase if somebody if the plants out there that's potentially better than our plant, which I can't imagine that. But if it is, we would certainly look at that from a purchase standpoint.","Operator","The next question comes from Leslie Wit [ph], JPMorgan.","Unknown Analyst","I wondered if you could just comment on the decline in residential and commercial sales on a weather-adjusted basis. What you're seeing there?","Thomas J. Webb","Yes, I think we are still seeing what I would call the recovery pattern. So the industrials had a nice resurgence, and now is building on really tough comps because they have completely recovered from the recession. And so -- and they're doing pretty well. And we follow that carefully because that, to us, is our leading indicator for residential and commercial. So just like they followed industrial down into the recession, they still are following slowly the industrial growth out of the recession. So there's 2 things to consider there. I think the residential will come back first and then the commercial will follow. We're seeing lots of seeds of people who are living together, either families, kids with their families, or adult kids or whatever. We're seeing them begin to branch out, and you see that through the housing stock. People are now moving into homes that were vacant, and people are now building and people are now moving upmarket a little bit. All those are good signs. So I think we're going to see residential do better as we go through time. And then commercial will follow. The commercial folks are very sensitive to the recession, and they're even more cautious than industrial in doubling down. The second point that I want to make sure is clear is that to see the real economic difference, take on an annual basis, those numbers, and add just a touch over 1% for energy optimization. We're tracking that information very carefully because we're actually helping people get there. And so both the residential and the commercial are doing a pretty good job. So if you add that back, you see the real economic growth, even though you do need to look at the net number, obviously. So that's pretty much what we see, and I just don't want to be overly optimistic about the pace of their recovery. But the industrial side is what drives it. That's what brings the jobs in, adds the confidence back and then you see the housing stock. I suppose I should say one other thing. As is typical with every long recession that I haven't heard people talk about much, but we're going to see it in Michigan, and other people may see it as well. Resurgence in housing gets delayed because the people that worked in housing retired for good or went off and did other things, and it's amazing. You'd think that with unemployment, you'd fill those holes right away. You don't. The talented trades and people that are needed to bring the housing industry back take a while to retrain and obtain, so I think we're also seeing that lag in Michigan. I'm not sure about the rest of the country. As people begin to come back into that, the right kind of talent, the right kind of plumbers and carpenters and electricians. The people that can't just walk into it from doing an unrelated job. So that's impacting it a little bit too. So we're cautious, and we think things are going to stay -- they're going to improve very gradually.","Operator","The last question in the queue at the moment comes from Ashok Khan [ph], VCM.","Unknown Analyst","Tom, if I -- based on your comments in terms of certainty through an accounting order in a month or 2 months, and without now having rate cases next year, can we expect that when we come down to Grand Rapids in the fall that we could get guidance for next year?","Thomas J. Webb","Well, I wouldn't project what we're going to say on October 24 at this point. But I'll tell you what I can do today. I can tell you that our long-term guidance continues to be 5% to 7%. But yes, I don't want to tell you we're going to give new guidance for '14. But I can tell you I think you're going to see a lot of nice eye-opener things about the sorts of investments we're doing for our customers and how the team manages that. And why we're so confident in what we're doing. You're also going to see a lot about our O&M programs, the new ones we just did. And you can see again there -- judge for yourselves, why we're so confident that we can offset these rate cases and actually limit the size of future rate cases because our O&M is funding a lot of the capital side. So you'll get to see a lot of the detail there, and I hope a lot of people can make it because those that haven't seen a big pump storage station, I think will be tickled to see the size and the beauty of the operation that's there, as well as the major upgrade that's underway. So that'd be pretty exciting. And the other nice thing when you come to this, and I hope everyone does, we hope to have all 3 commissioners there so that you can independently ask them of us, your questions, about Appendix A and about our ability to push off these rate cases and why that makes sense or not to them. And they'll give you their own opinions and their own views, which, I think, is a really healthy thing to do. So there'll be a lot going on, and I hope you can make it.","Operator","There are no further questions. I would now like to hand the call over to Mr. Russell for closing remarks.","John G. Russell","All right, thank you. Let me close today by saying the first half of the year has us on track to deliver our 11th year of consecutive financial performance. And as Tom was just mentioning, we appreciate your interest in CMS Energy, and we really hope you can join us in Grand Rapids. A couple of comments, just in addition to what Tom said. The Ludington Pumped Storage facility, as we know it right now, is the fourth largest in the world. So it is something to really see if you have the opportunity. And one of the questions came up about the city of Detroit and the bankruptcy, if you've never been to Grand Rapids, which is the largest city we serve, it'll be good opportunity to see that city and kind of the vibrant nature of that city compared to the east side of the state. Seeing the commissioners, I think, would be a great opportunity for you. And I also want you to be able to interact with the management team, which we'll have the full management team there. So a good opportunity to ask questions of us, ask questions to the regulators and see how we make this operation run. So with that, I appreciate your interest, and thank you for joining us today.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section.","This call is being recorded. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions]. Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12 PM Eastern Time running through May 2. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Sri Maddipati","Thanks, Rocco. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Patti Poppe, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially.","This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the Appendix and posted on our website.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Patti.","Patti Poppe","Thanks, Sri. Thanks everyone for joining us for our first quarter earnings call.","Now, this morning, I will share our first quarter financial and operating results and review our regulatory calendar. Rejji will add more details on our financial results and outlook and as always we will close with Q&A.","Despite two large storms, and an unprecedented Polar Vortex, which challenged our electric and gas systems, we were able to deliver solid first quarter earnings of $0.75 per share which are better than our plan. Regardless of changing weather, economy, political or regulatory conditions, we pride ourselves in our adaptability which enables the delivery of consistent financial results on which you come to rely year after year after year.","We're pleased to reaffirm our full-year guidance of 6% to 8% EPS growth based on last year's actual results and are biased towards the mid. We're also reaffirming our plans to grow dividends in line with earnings.","Our predictability is enabled by our focus and commitment to our triple bottom-line of people, planet, and process, underpinned by financial and operating performance which remains a low risk and sustainable business approach and it continues to deliver for our customers and our investors. Every dollar of our capital plan is invested with the triple bottom-line in mind and we've seen solid support for this thought process over the years but most recently with the settlement of our gas and electric rate cases as well as our integrated resource plan.","Our continued focus on needed investments in the safety and reliability of our gas and electric systems and our approach for the cleaner generation fleet with the modular build out of renewable energy has been reinforced by these positive regulatory outcomes.","The settlement agreement of the integrated resource plan is a great example of how we work with all stakeholders at Michigan. We're excited to report that our clean energy plan reflected in our IRP received a broad coalition of support including the public service commission staff, Attorney General, our Customer Advocacy Groups, and environmental advocates.","Considering the complexity of this case, the parties involved, and the long-term planning of our generation systems this was no easy seek which is why I'm so proud of all the work our team has put into creating a breakthrough outcomes for our company, our customers, and our state.","The settlement lays the groundwork for our clean and lean energy future and includes the early retirement of our coal unit Karn 1&2 and the scheduled expiration of our Palisades PPA. The agreement also calls for accelerated energy efficiency, demand response program, and a 1,100 megawatt to solar through 2024 of which half will be owned in rate base and the other half will be contracted with a financial compensation mechanism. The settlement also includes competitive bidding for future solar so we can have the lowest cost and cleanest energy to the People of Michigan.","Longer-term the plan calls for a total of 6,000 megawatt to solar and looks at battery storage in the next decade. The modular and low-risk approach coupled with the iterative nature of the IRP filing process provides flexibility and will allow us to take advantage of declining cost and potential technology breakthroughs. We expect the commission decision on the settlement by mid-June.","Looking at our calendar for the year, you'll see another successful quarter on the regulatory front. This included the approval of 525 megawatts of wind in our renewable energy plan, a final settlement agreement for our IRP, and the Commission order in our electric rate case settlement and where we've agreed to stay out of an electric rate case until 2020. This quarter was just another demonstration of the strength in our regulatory environment in Michigan.","While we're on top of recent regulatory developments, we'd like to take this opportunity to congratulate Dan Scripps in his recent appointment to the commission. We really look forward to working with Commissioner Scripps moving forward.","Our gas rate case is also moving along. The staff having filed their position earlier this month for an additional $146 million of revenue with support for nearly all of the investments and the O&M we have requested. We'll continue to work with the staff and stakeholders in this case and expect the final order from the commission by September 30th.","With the continued support of the MPSC staff, and other stakeholders, our electric rate case settlement allows for increased investment in electric reliability of $200 million. The case was completed in just eight months after filing and marked only the second time in our history where we settled an electric rate case. The settlement also included deferred accounting for emergent work which enables us to better plan and manage our electric distribution related capital investment.","One of those reliability projects was a circuit upgrade outside of Grand Rapids. As part of that project, we needed to disconnect a customer for a few hours during the week. It was the home of an elderly couple and the husband had voiced their concerns to one of our co-workers. His wife was sick and he was worried about keeping her comfortable while the power was out. One of our field leaders Jimmy Brady reached out to the customer to understand his concerns better. What Jimmy found was that they just needed somewhere warm to stay during this planned outage. Jimmy purchased gift cards for gas and dinner and took the extra step to put the gift card in a get well card and delivered it to the customer, so he could care for his wife.","Now I make calls to customers every week to get direct sense of what they're experiencing with our team. And I heard this story for the first time on one of those calls. Our customer was so touched by Jimmy's kindness as he shared this story with me, he broke down in tears. He was overwhelmed because he had been working so hard to care for his wife and Jimmy's simple act of kindness hit the spot.","And by the way, we completed the maintenance work on time too continuing to improve our customer's reliability. We don't have a procedure 42 backed dash fee that told Jimmy how to live our purpose. We just have people serving people that is world-class performance delivering home comfort.","Another great example of our purpose at work is our simple but perhaps unique business model. Now this is not new and it has lots of runway. At the core of our business model is our ability to self-fund the majority of our needed no big backed capital investments. These needed capital investments are demonstrated by the settlements of our recent gas and electric cases and the approval of our renewable energy plan with 525 megawatts of new wind, the settlement agreement for IRP which includes 1,100 megawatts of solar in the near-term, and staff support for the capital investments in our pending gas rate case. In fact less than 15% of projects in our $11 billion capital plan are over $200 million and half of those are renewable projects that have already been approved.","While we continue to grow rate case, we remain focused on customer affordability. One of our key strength is our ability to manage costs. And while we continue to focus on waste elimination across all of our cost drivers by executing the CE Way, we also see significant cost reduction opportunities as we retire coal and allow high priced PPAs higher over time. Rejji will cover some of that in more detail.","Sales enable us to manage customer prices as our economic development efforts allow us to spread our costs over greater volume. In addition to this, our energy efficiency programs help our customers reduce their usage and ultimately lower their bill. We earned $34 million through our energy efficiency incentive in 2018 and we forecast it going to $44 million as we implement our IRP energy waste reduction plans.","We're also able to true-up our sales through our forward-looking rate making process.","Finally, we've put a tax planning and modest contributions from our non-utility businesses further support our ability to deliver consistent premier growth. In fact despite investing $11 billion of capital into our system over the next five years, we expect customer prices to remain flat after inflation. Our model has proven durable over the last decade and we're confident in continued durability over the next. This simple model and our ability to adapt to changing conditions enables us to continuously deliver regardless of whether the economy or other external factors.","Just look at our track. 10 years of 7-plus-percent EPS growth. We provide consistent premium results supported by strong operations.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rejji.","Rejji Hayes","Thank you, Patti, and good morning everyone.","As Patti highlighted, we're pleased to report our first quarter results for 2019. We're just slightly ahead of plan despite severe weather experienced during the quarter. We delivered net income of $213 million which translates into earnings per share of $0.75 per quarter. Our first quarter earnings per share for 2019 were $0.11 lower Q1 2018 results largely due to heavy ice storms experienced in our electric service territory in February. Like always, we plan conservatively manage the work and continue to be ahead of plan.","Despite the storm activity, utility was the key driver of our financial performance in Q1 contributing $0.80 per share largely due to our electric rate case settlement and relatively cold winter in Michigan which benefited our gas volumetric sales [indiscernible]. The Utility strong performance was modestly offset by expected underperformance in enterprises versus Q1 of 2018 with lower capacity sales at DIG contributable to the residual effects of the 2018 MISO planning resource auction, and a planned outage of our Filer City plan, both of which were reflected in our full-year EPS guidance. All-in, we started 2019 right on track and we are confident in our ability to deliver another year of consistent industry-leading financial performance.","On Slide 12, you can see the key factors impacting our financial performance relative to 2018 in our waterfall chart. Favorable weather provided $0.08 per share positive variance versus Q1 of 2018 and rate relief net of investments contributed another $0.03. These sources of financial upside more than offset by the substantial storm activity which negatively impacts earnings by $0.10 a share, the aforementioned underperformance in enterprises and the higher effective tax rate. The latter two of which in line with our expectations and as mentioned are already incorporated in our full-year estimates.","As we look ahead to the remainder of 2019, and encouraged by the glide path to give our full-year 2019 EPS guidance. As illustrated in the chart, the absence of favorable weather pass-through is largely offset by the numerous cost pull-aheads we executed in the second half of 2018. The remaining nine months also included additional rate relief net of investments in the previously settled gas and electric rate cases and the expectation of a constructive outcome in our pending gas case.","Lastly, we expect to realize cost savings across the organization in line with historical trends, enterprise's EPS contribution weighted toward the second half of the year. Needless to say, we'll continue to manage the business with a focus on executing our capital plan and identifying additional cost savings, mitigate future risk of plan, the benefit for customers and investors.","To that end Slide 13 best illustrates our historical track record of managing the work during periods of uncertainty to meet our operational and financial objectives. As noted in the past, the periods of unfavorable weather or other sources of downside we rely on our ability to reflect operating and non-operating levers to meet our financial objectives without compromising customer service.","Conversely during strong period, we focus on reinvestment in the business to derisk future years and achieve longer-term benefits for customers and investors. Every year is different but we manage to deliver for all stakeholders year in and year out not excuses based on our ability to adapt to changing circumstances in any given year by self-funding the vast majority of our rate-based growth over the long-term to minimize the cost bill impact as Patti discussed earlier.","To elaborate on the core elements of our business model, we have an extensive inventory of capital investment projects in utility into our large and aging electric gas systems as noted on Slide 14. As we highlighted on our Q4 call in January and our five-year capital investment program is approximately $11 billion and is largely comprised of gas and electric infrastructure upgrades and investments in multiple generation. The latter of which was supported by the Commission's recent approval by 525 megawatts of one generation investment to meet the 15% renewable portfolio standard emission.","Our robust capital plan will further improve the safety and reliability of our electric and gas systems and benefit customers of all of our generation portfolio to benefit of the plan and extend the runway for EPS growth benefit of investors. It is also worth noting that our capital investment needs remain significant beyond five-year period as well. As we work through regulatory proceedings most notably the IRP, and our financial planning cycle, we expect that longer-term capital mix will continue to evolve and we look forward to providing you an update to our 10-year capital plan in the second half of the year.","As discussed in the past, we invest in our electric and gas systems at a measured pace given customer affordability constraints in order to execute on capital investments of this magnitude, while maintaining affordable bills, our funding strategy is heavily reliant on the identification of cost reduction opportunities and we are confident that we can continue to deliver in this regard.","Historically we have emphasized our substantial focus on reducing operating and maintenance expenses. And we have been successful there in the past to coal plant retirements, capital enabled savings like our smart meter installations, and attrition management to name a few. We'll continue to realize cost savings and O&M through those historical measures as well as waste eliminations required by the CE Way amongst other initiatives. However we do not discriminate when it comes to cost savings and we view every component of our cost structure as an opportunity.","As we look ahead, there were highly visible cost reduction opportunities in our power supply cost through the expiration of the Palisades and MCB power purchase agreements both priced on average around $55 to $60 per megawatt hour for roughly two times the market cost of power and license which collectively should deliver approximately $150 million of savings per year over time. In the interim, we will continue to realize benefits modernizing our gas and electric distribution systems through reduced service respiration, gas leak repair costs among other opportunities. These opportunities coupled with our perpetual search for non-operating cost savings offer sustainable funding strategy for our capital plan which will keep customer bills low on an absolute basis and relative to other household staples in Michigan as depicted in the chart.","From our perspective paying roughly $5 a day combined for safe and reliable electric and gas delivery in the residential home is an extraordinary value proposition. The importance this service to today's standard of living and the substantial costs required to own and operate these things.","In addition to our emphasis on strong cost controls, our self-funding strategy also benefits economic development. Slide 16 highlights our success to attract new industrial activity in our service territory over the past two years which has supplemented modest organic growth in our residential and commercial segments. 2018 we expected over 100 megawatts new load which is up from 69 megawatts in 2017. And we're targeting another 100 megawatts in 2019 and are right on track with over 25 megawatts in Q1. Our load growth from these efforts will collectively offer roughly 5,500 jobs, $2 billion of investment in Michigan, and included companies ranging Internet-based retailers, food manufacturers among other industries.","This level of secular diversity in our new load is indicative of our electric service territory which represents about two-thirds of our revenue is often misperceived as highly cyclical. In fact in 2018 approximately 2% of our customer contributions came from the Auto as noted in the pie chart on the right hand side of the page.","Our proactive efforts on the economic development and a strong track record of realizing cost savings to fund our growth not only enable us to perpetuate our successful long run but also derisk our financial plan in the short-term and the overachievement in the year. And overachievement has become a habit which is a nice segway to our 2019 financing plan.","On Slide 17, you'll see that our financing plans with larger derisk for 2019 via opportunistic transactions in 2018 and year-to-date. In the first quarter, we completed just under $1 billion of debt financing to parent including a $630 million six-year hybrid issuance which garners up to 50% equity credit in S&P at an attractive rate 5.875% pre-tax. We've also completed roughly $250 million toward equity issuance through our ATM program over the past 12 months which eliminates pricing risk for planned equity issuance needs through 2020.","As we evaluate potential sources of volatility through the remainder of the year, the accelerated execution of the majority of our financing plan, the early settlement of our electric rate case, and the aforementioned 2018 pull ahead, that reduce the probability of large variances in our plan. There will always be sources of volatility in this business be the weather, low cost, regulatory outfits, or otherwise. In every year we view it as our mandate to do the worrying for you and mitigate the risk component.","And with that, turn it back to Patti for some closing remarks before Q&A.","Patti Poppe","Thanks, Rejji.","With our unique self-funding model, enhanced by the CE Way, a large and aging system in need of capital investments, a constructive regulatory framework, and a healthy balance sheet to fund our plan cost effectively, we believe our financial performance is sustainable over the long-term.","With that, Rocco, please open the lines for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much, Patti. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions].","And today's first question comes from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Greg Gordon","So I mean I think it goes without saying because you've been very clear but you had a very rare modest miss versus Street consensus in the quarter because you had such a extraordinary storm activity. But given your historic ability to manage the business, you don't have any concerns about being able to bring in the earnings expectation as you articulated for the year just because the first quarter was challenging correct?","Patti Poppe","That's correct, Greg. We always adapt, and as we mentioned, we're ahead of our own plan, and so we're very confident in our ability to continue to deliver as always.","Greg Gordon","Thanks. And then I'm sure there'll be a lot of questions on the regulatory activity. So I'll leave that for other people. I had a sort of an esoteric question on the DTE call yesterday, you talked about why they don't have and I don't think you guys have either a large amount of lithium ion battery storage built into your expectations for future infrastructure needs and they pointed to the fact that because you guys have the Ludington storage facility and it's such a large and unique asset that it really creates the balancing capacity you need so that battery storage may not other than in very unique circumstances necessarily be a big part of Michigan's future needs. Is that a fair assessment or not?","Patti Poppe","Well first of all, yes, Ludington is storage and it's 2,200 megawatts of storage. So yes we love that. In fact, as you've been there, Greg, I know you visited the site. We have six of the world's largest motors at that location six 500,000 horsepower motors. It is a sight to be seen. So anyone who hasn't been there, open invitation. But yes, so obviously we have a lot of experience actually pricing in storage on a daily basis. What we're waiting for and I think we do see more storage and in fact in our IRP, we have storage towards the latter half of the plan.","What we're waiting for is the price curve. And I'm very confident that price curve will materialize. And with all the research that's underway with lithium ion for vehicles today, but maybe there will be a breakthrough in solid state. I look forward to that. I think storage is going to be important on the grid to balance voltage and do voltage control for our solar installations that are going to be distributed across the state. So we are hopeful for storage and a technological breakthrough in that but we don't need it to execute our IRP plan until the last part of the 20-year plan.","Rejji Hayes","Greg, the only point I would add is in addition to Ludington, as you likely know, we also have peaking capacity in the form of our Karn 3&4 facilities which is over a gigawatt. So that also supports us as we flush out the renewable plant.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Arnold","Good morning guys. Yes, just had a question on enterprises and that segment came in at nothing for the first quarter and you said it's going to be more weighted to the second half. Is that really going to be mostly a Q3 segment now with the shift to more of an energy contract, so is it more sort of linear through the second half. Can you just give us a bit more sense on the timing there?","Rejji Hayes","Yes, I would say it's certainly more backend weighted and I would say it's more weighted towards Q3 and Q4, you'll get a little bit of pickup in Q2 but mostly Q3 and Q4. And the reason why that is, Jonathan, is we had lower capacity sales and that had to do with the fact that we had to basically sell about 400 megawatts of capacity at dig in the planning reserve auction in MISO in mid-2018. And as you know the planning year runs from basically May of the prior year to June of the subsequent year and so we've got about two quarters of exposure in 2019 of those lower capacity sales. And the reason why, as you may recall, we had to subject ourselves MISO planning reserve auction is that we held 400 megawatts of capacity in escrow effectively at gas part of the potential Palisades early termination in 2017. And so we'll wear that for a couple of quarters. It's in our plan and so we would expect that that would recover over time, we've already sold through capacity through 2020. And so we feel pick up some in Q2 but most of it in Q3 and Q4.","Jonathan Arnold","And so by extension then Q1 of next year should prove to be more positive than Q1 of this year?","Rejji Hayes","Yes, you would think because again we've sold capacity through 2020 around $2 to $3 per kilowatt month. And so we would expect to get a more favorable comp in Q1 of 2020 certainly versus Q1 of 2019.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay, great. And then just one other sort of item you talked about expecting energy efficiency earnings to increase from $34 million to $44 million or so and as you implement the IRP. What's the timing on getting to that higher level, is it -- it's not for a year or two or was it sooner than that?","Patti Poppe","Yes, Jonathan, great question. We're going to phase it and we're going from 1.5% in our electric business energy efficiency to 2% and it's when we get to that 2% that it takes it to $44 million and that'll be mid-2020.","Jonathan Arnold","Mid-2020, okay great. That's it, thank you.","Rejji Hayes","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Michael Weinstein of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Michael Weinstein","Hey question on the financial compensation mechanism. So I realize that I guess there's a continuing talks about this, but at 5.88% that's above short-term debt but the long probably below the overall cost of capital, weighted cost capital for the company. I'm just wondering if this is -- this 5.88% that was settled this is like kind of an opening bid like if things go well later on people might be more amenable to raising that number as long as the markets seem okay with it, the solar markets seem okay with it.","Rejji Hayes","Michael, it's good question. So just to be clear the 5.88% that does reflect our WACC or weighted average cost of capital and that was what was agreed to in the settlement. And so we think that's the appropriate level for an FCM particularly given the fact that we'll be able to own and rate base effectively half of the solar investment opportunity over the next few years. And so the 1,100 megawatts that we agreed to effectively through 2024 will get 550 megawatts of that.","And then, as you know, the filing and the IRP itself is an iterative process per the statute. And so we've agreed put a settlement to file again in June of 2021, so we'll see what the fact pattern is at that point. Obviously cost of capital moves all the time and so it makes sense to adjust it at that point and suggest something else we'll look to do that at that point.","Patti Poppe","To be clear, we're really excited about that FCM it gives us optionality in the best way to have the lowest cost energy, delivery, and supply. We're very happy with the outcome of the IRP. We think it really reflects our values and we think it reflects our business model and it just allows our business model of ample CapEx backed up by our ability to do it at the lowest cost to protect customers from affordability constraints. It really fits right into our plan.","Michael Weinstein","Right. Could you I mean could you characterize kind of what the discussions are surrounding at this point over the next month or two? What are the solar advocates want out of this process at this point?","Patti Poppe","Well to be clear there's a range of solar advocates. We had the Sierra Club, the NRDC sign on to our settlement and certainly their solar advocates. I guess I would consider as solar advocates. We all agree that solar has an important role to play here in Michigan matches our load profile extremely well and combined with things like Ludington and Karn, as Rejji mentioned, we've got a really nice mix of supply. So the conversation has been how to do that at the lowest cost possible. And we feel very excited about the competitive bidding process for the supply resources. We think that's an important stand to take on behalf of the people of Michigan that we want to make sure we have the lowest cost resources on the system and have optionality around the CapEx surrounds that, so that we can invest the next best dollar where it needs to be invested in the entire system.","I would say some of the large out-of-state kind of profit maximizing solar developers don't love the outcome because they're going to have to compete on price and not lean on PREPA. And that PREPA loophole doesn't work. And it saddles the Michigan customers with unnecessary high priced solar. And so I would suggest that our commitment to competitive bidding really change the nature of the discussion here in Michigan that we're going to stand for the lowest cost and cleanest energy resources for the people that we serve.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So perhaps just to reconcile this, I mean just at a high-level, the IRP obviously you've got just about over a gig of potential opportunity here split between rate base and PPA. How does that reconcile with your current CapEx budget at the end of the day? And then maybe a second but related question is how do you think about updating the needs for generation over time here. What would that timeline look like and how could that reconcile against what you all have here in the IRP today? And I know that's somewhat of a transient question, right. It'll change over time.","Rejji Hayes","Yes. So, Julien, good question. I would say as it pertains to the five year plan, we don't see a great deal of, I will say, capital investment impact in our five year plan. So, as you know, we're at about just over a $11 billion most of which is wires and pipes capital investment, we've got $1 billion of renewables in our plan but that's largely attributable to wind build out basically to get to the 15% RPS. And so a lot of the capital investment opportunity that's coming out of this settlement agreement is really beyond this five-year plan.","So you'll see some of it. We'll take ownership of some of it kind of in the 2022, 2023 period but not a great deal. It's also worth noting that you're going to have Karn 1&2 in the outer years of our plan come out, if we succeed in retiring that plant in 2023 as promised. And so when you think about the puts and takes, you'll see probably a net neutral impact, I'd say in the next five to six years now.","The bigger opportunity going forward is, as you look, at the incremental five gigawatts that will build out over the next decade plus I think in year's six to 10 of a potential 10 year plan, you'll see more significant capital investments on the solar side. And so there could be upside there and again we've talked about in the back half of this year offering a new 10-year plan which likely reflects some of that.","And then if you think about the capacity build out, I'll say a couple of decades from now in our capacity plan, we're going to be losing over time about four gigawatts of capacity. So you're going to see two gigawatts come out in the form of the MCV and Palisades PPAs and then another two gigawatts come off over the next 20 years retire -- as we retire the coal fleet and so substantial capital investment opportunity on the solar side over time. And we think that offers potentially around $3 billion of capital investment opportunities to think about the spend on the capital side through 2030. So quite a bit of opportunity but early days of course.","Patti Poppe","I would also offer that the capital opportunities on our entire system are not -- we don't require all of our investment to go into supply. It's not; I would say the investment mix of the past. The opportunity to have distributed resources is going to require a significant amount of grid investment as well to make sure that we can integrate those distributed resources into the grid and make sure that our reliability is high.","So the mix between distribution and supply is going to shift to distribution as well as in our gas system. And so when I talk about looking for the next best place to put a capital dollar, everyone can remember and always remember that this is not a question of building up rate base. This is a question of how best to affordably deliver the capital that delivers the customer value and customer service, the reliability; all of those things are driven by how much capital is required in the system. So the system needs are driving the CapEx. We're not trying to backfill CapEx and searching for CapEx and using supply as a means of doing that. We're trying to figure out the best way to deliver the services for customers with all the CapEx that needs to be done and to be able to do that affordably.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it, excellent. And just to clarify this, I know you have got billion-ish in the plan today for renewables. When you talk down the materiality of 2022, 2023 solar, it's more because it's something of a rounding within the wider plan contemplated?","Rejji Hayes","Yes, that's -- that's right. So you basically in the outer years of plan, you'll start to take ownership of some of that 550 megawatts. But again as we always talk about the constraint on our capital is really affordability and so we think based on the five-year plan, we rolled on our Q4 call that little over $11 billion of aggregate capital investment is what our customers can comfortably afford as well as our balance sheet I might add. And so the composition of that capital investment program may change a touch as we look at the outer years of the plan. But I would say for now it's primarily wires and pipes. Again you may get additional solar but we think $11 billion is right at this point in time.","Operator","And today's next question comes from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Stephen Byrd","Wanted to go back to everyone's favorite topic, the financial compensation mechanism really interesting and really innovative approach. I guess the mechanics that ultimately got used here is a bit different than what you had proposed but it strikes me that the result is broadly in line with the approach that you had initially proposed, is that a fair characterization?","Patti Poppe","That's a fair characterization. At the end of the day, we wanted to first of all be toward agnostic around who builds and who owns these assets. We wanted to make sure that we had the proper alignment that we have the lowest cost supply resources on the system. And so conceptually, what we're talking about is making sure that the reflection on our balance sheet of our being this high quality off-taker for any kind of contract there's no way a developer gets that contract or the financing approved without us being the off-taker that that's reflected and there's an impact on our balance sheet at least the way S&P calculates. And so conceptually that's what the FCM is intended to represent. And so we're very happy with this outcome. We think it's a new standard and it really gives us a position to advocate for customers fully.","Stephen Byrd","That makes sense. And then my next question is really longer-term when you think about renewables in your discussion with the variety of parties in the state, this concept of basically splitting ownership versus PPA a 50\/50 split beyond the 1,100 megawatts in there kind of near to medium-term. Is that an approach you think that has buy in, in the longer run within the state?","Patti Poppe","Well it is and it worked for the 2008 Energy Law as we filed subsequent IRPs. We could revisit it. We actually didn't go in asking for the opportunity that our original filing did not include an opportunity for us to be guaranteed, the right to own. But through the discussions and that's what's healthy about a settlement process you can have really in-depth discussions with the parties to come to a conclusion that everyone really can live with. And so the settlement process has served, I think the people of Michigan very well in this scenario and certainly you, our investors, are equally well served through the outcome of this IRP.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Praful Mehta of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Praful Mehta","Hi, so maybe just firstly on the quarter on the storm cost, this is something we've seen across the space where companies have utilities have had challenges with storm costs. What is the threshold we should be thinking about as it relates to CMS in terms of what size storms are recoverable, what size storms are not. And how does this, how do you see this going forward as an impact to your earnings?","Rejji Hayes","Yes, it\u2019s a good question, Praful. So recoverable, I will go about that in a couple of ways. So there's recoverable in the form of what's in rates and then there's recoverable in the form of we do have transmission and distribution insurance which also offers a little bit of risk mitigation.","And so in terms of what's in rates, the amount of storms that we realized over the course of Q1 is already in excess of what's currently incorporated in rates. And so we do plan conservatively and so in our budget we did assume that there would be service restoration needs in excess of what's in rates.","And then as you think about the insurance programs we have in place then it's a function of the deductibles you have and whether a particular storm exceeds that deductibles. And that's what allows you to get recovery and so as you may recall, when had the significant storm activity in March of 2017, we actually got quite a bit of claims back our way because of the level deductible at that point. And admittedly deductibles have gone up a bit. And so I would say that you need a pretty substantial storm activity to get insurance recovery but we did get some recovery of the storms we saw in early February in the Grand Rapids area. Is that helpful?","Praful Mehta","Yes, that's super helpful color. Appreciate that. And maybe for the second question, you guys talked about the runway of the plan where the cost management clearly is something that you guys have executed successfully and one important part of that is PPAs ruling off. I guess as these PPAs do roll off, do you see limited scope going beyond that or do you see this horizon of the ability to kind of manage costs and keep rates low while you build out on CapEx even beyond that PPA roll off?","Patti Poppe","Praful, the cost savings as far as I can see and it's certainly the PPAs, I like to call those are well -- I call them our cash for clunkers because those PPAs are out of market. They're high priced and when we replace those with fuel free energy, it really is an amazing combination to grow earnings while we're reducing costs for customers. So certainly we've got in the five-year plan ample cost savings but beyond that our abilities that we are creating to our consumers energy way to see and eliminate waste on demand are still in their early stages.","I'm just watching the team really develop the skills to see and eliminate waste that reduces the human struggle for our co-workers as they're attempting to serve customers and at the same time reduces costs and improves the customer experience. And so rest assured there is our simple, unique business model has lots of runway. This model lives; we've got ample CapEx, lots of costs yet to be reduced. And then that just protects our customers from affordability constraints and enables positive regulatory outcomes and improves service to customers every single day. So rest easy the model live.","Praful Mehta","Great story guys. Really appreciate it. Thank you.","Patti Poppe","Thanks Praful.","Rejji Hayes","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Andrew Weisel of Scotia Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Andrew Weisel","Hey good morning everyone. Just another question on the SCM, the WACC I believe is as you previously discussed a little bit. It's relatively low as 5.88% but I believe that's because of the deferred taxes in your capital structure right. So can you remind us what percent of the cap structure is deferred taxes and over how many years you expect to work that down to zero?","Rejji Hayes","Yes. So you're right, Andrew, and so the 5.88% WACC that we agreed to as part of the financial compensation mechanism that is on an after-tax basis, it does take into account what I'll call about 20% or just under that of deferred federal income taxes that are a component of a rate making capital structure. I can't tell you exactly when that will amortize down to zero. But I can say directionally if you think about the glide path for refunding customers effectively, the deferred income taxes that we collected over the last several years as part of normalization and then also as part of the settlement for unprotected assets and liabilities at some point will be returned to customers.","I would say you'd have a gradual somewhere between $35 million to $45 million reduction in that deferred federal income tax component of a rate making capital structure over the next several years. So probably 35 to 45 years depending on the asset class, electric amortizes a little faster because it has a shorter useful life than the gas assets. And so my sense is about 35 to 45 years that ticks down.","Andrew Weisel","I certainly hope to not following your stock when that happens.","Rejji Hayes","As you like.","Andrew Weisel","You previously said you don't expect the cash taxpayer payer until 2023. Is that still the case given the solar plants?","Rejji Hayes","That's right. And I would just qualify it a little bit. We expect it to be about a partial cash taxpayer at that point and more closely to a fully -- a full cash taxpayer by about 2024.","Andrew Weisel","Okay, great. Then lastly, what do you think about, I know the plan for the next three years is just solar and beyond that you talked about solar and batteries. What would it take for your wind to become a part of that plan going forward?","Patti Poppe","Well we do have 525 megawatts of additional wind that we're going to be adding to achieve our renewable portfolio standard in the near-term so that's underway. What we see about wind is it's getting harder and harder to site. And so as we did the analysis for the long-term, distributed solar really matches the load curve here in Michigan combined with we do have 1,200 megawatts of base load gas plus the Ludington pump storage.","We have our base load power really available. And so solar because it's distributed, because it's modular, because we can build it fast, and because that cost curve is occurring so fast that we really do see that combined with the current one we have the 525 additional megawatts of wind is the right mix.","Operator","And our next question today comes from David Fishman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","David Fishman","Just following on I think with Stephen's IRP question, is there an expectation or goal that when you re-file in 2021 or at some other point for the larger six to 10-year option you said that CMS can show effectively that utility owned renewables is more economic than some of the third-parties prices that you expect to see or you haven't seen as a result may be easier in the future to get a guarantee higher than 50% for owning?","Patti Poppe","I think I would say that because of the way the law was written and then we do these ongoing filings, it does mean the plan is adaptable and can change over time. If we do demonstrate that we're the most cost effective then I think that will be compelling. What I would suggest is that being able to build 50% is a really great position to be in and being able to then deploy our capital elsewhere in other parts of our system that are in high demand really works for our model because again I can't overemphasize the amount of capital that the system demands relative to customers ability to pay and the balance sheet to be able to afford, it's a constant internal battle for where the next best capital dollar is.","And so having some optionality on the supply side actually really works for us especially with the SCM. It really is a great mix for us in our opinion and as we do future filings of course the plan can adapt and change as conditions change and that's really the secret, one of the secrets I would say at CMS.","There's no big bet strategy. Modular, adaptable, changing conditions, whether it's weather or politics or the economy this is what's special about us. We adapt to those changing conditions because we can because we don't have big bets. As I mentioned only 15% of our $11 billion CapEx plan are projects over $200 million and half of those are preapproved renewable projects. So the fact that our plan has so much flexibility in it going forward is part of our strength and part of the secret that we can continue to deliver year after year after year that premium growth six to eight reliably.","David Fishman","Okay. Thank you for the very thorough explanation. So that makes sense helps to provide you a good bit of balance and flexibility. One small follow-up just more a housekeeping item. I think there was a small outage for TS Filer because it's no longer going to be repowered. I was just wondering does that spill over at all into the second quarter.","Rejji Hayes","There may be a touch of it spills in the second quarter but I wouldn't say it's a material amount. And it's also important to note that Filer yes, it's a contributor to enterprises performance but it's not a significant contributor, dig really dictates the vast majority of the financial performance of enterprises.","David Fishman","Right. Okay. I think as I said before the dig, you all have one more quarter of material headwind that should kind of go back to being the bilateral market second half?","Rejji Hayes","That's right. Given just the timing of the planning year versus the calendar year.","Operator","And our next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Hello Shahriar your line is open, perhaps you're muted.","Constantine Lednev","Oh sorry about that. It\u2019s actually Constantine for Shahriar here. Yes, I was on mute. A lot of great disclosure and a lot of the questions have been answered. One kind of high-level on the IRP and the 6,000 kind of megawatts of long-term solar. Are you thinking about kind of a timing or a shape to how I guess the point I know you talked about the 1,100 megawatts are being a little bit more tailwind in the five-year plan. But beyond that kind of how linear is deployment?","Patti Poppe","Yes, it's ahead of the retirements because obviously we don't want to wait for the retirement date and then start to build the solar, so we front feet, I would say the plan and then it spreads across the time horizon up to the point that our last coal unit Campbell 3 retires. And so it really is a relatively smooth across the 20-year time horizon. But just again as conditions change, load materializes more or less that's the strength of this plan that it's modular and we can adapt.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Patti Poppe for any closing remarks.","Patti Poppe","Thanks, Rocco, and thanks everyone for joining us this morning and we certainly look forward to seeing you all out on the road.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference. We thank everyone for their participation. Have a great day."],"5776":["CMS Energy Corp.

The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12:00 PM Eastern Time running through November 1. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Srikanth Maddipati - CMS Energy Corp.","Thanks, Rocco. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Patti Poppe, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website.","Now I'll turn the call over to Patti.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Thanks, Sri, and thank you everyone for joining us on our call today. We're looking forward to Halloween next week but there are no tricks here, only treats, our predictable financial results. With that I'll begin with an overview and a focus on our triple bottom line and Rejji will follow up with more details on our financial results and outlook. With another great quarter behind us, we're pleased to report adjusted earnings of $1.93 per share through the first nine months of the year, which are up 16% from our 2017 results. We're also pleased to announce that we're raising the bottom end of our full year guidance by $0.01 with 2018 adjusted earnings guidance now at $2.31 to $2.34 per share, which further demonstrates our confidence in our ability to deliver again this year, giving us our 16th year of consistent industry-leading financial performance.","Now as I've stated previously, when we moved to 6% to 8% growth from 5% to 7%, we were signaling that we raised the midpoint of our range from 6% to 7%, showing our confidence in continuing to deliver 7% as we have for 15 years in a row. Last year, we delivered a strong 7% which was towards the high end of our 6% to 8% 2017 guidance, so we would be disappointed if we did not deliver towards the high end of our guidance again this year. We're also initiating 2019 adjusted earnings guidance at $2.46 to $2.50 per share which reflects 6% to 8% growth, no resets or surprises here. As we typically do, we'll revisit our guidance based on our actual results during our fourth quarter earnings call. And we're reaffirming our long-term growth of 6% to 8% with a bias towards the midpoint.","Slide 5 is a great reminder of how much work we're doing day-to-day, quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year to provide the consistent financial results you've come to expect. We focus on prioritizing reinvestment opportunities in periods where we experienced better than expected cost performance or weather benefits like we've seen throughout this year. In times like we saw last year with poor weather and significant storm activity, we'll rely on our lean operating system and our ability to optimize work to maximize safety and reliability for the benefit of our customers. Since 2013 we've reinvested millions of dollars at the utility, such as low income support of $24 million that helps our most vulnerable customers catch up on energy bills during hard times and reduces risk in our uncollectible accounts for all of our other customers.","Right now we remain focused on the work that can be done this year to de-risk next year while providing immediate benefits to customers such as tree trimming in the electric business where we expect to spend $54 million and our gas pipeline integrity and reliability program where we'll spend around $37 million this year. This strategy allows us to deliver on our financial results this year while providing a longer runway for us to deliver the growth you have all come to expect in the coming years. The blue line that you see on slide 5 represents the volatility that we manage year after year to ensure that you continue to experience consistent financial results shown by that straight as an arrow green line. In short, we ride the rollercoaster so you don't have to.","Our gas business is a perfect example of our triple bottom line thinking. We commit to a safe and reliable gas system, one of the largest in the country with over 28,000 miles of distribution mains and nearly 1,700 miles of transmission lines, to serve our 1.8 million gas customers. We protect our customers and the planet with every dollar we invest in our system. Our investment in the gas system will be about half of our total capital plan over the next five years. That's the triple bottom line in action. The skilled workforce serving our gas customers is a critical enabler to our ability to execute our plan.","Not that long ago, we couldn't find qualified candidates for many of the positions we needed to fill, so we started our veteran boot camp in 2016. To date, Consumers Energy has hired 116 gas workers from the program with a 94% retention rate. It's a three-week training program followed by a 90-day internship and then full time job offers. The program accounts for 47% of the talent hired into that role over the last three years. This program is far more successful than the previous hiring plans, where we typically saw a 50% failure rates for the physical dig assessment which eliminated the candidate from further consideration. In fact, earlier this month, I was at our new employee orientation and I asked for all the veterans in the room to stand. I was overwhelmed to see that over half the room was filled with those who have served our country. I am so proud to have these veterans on our team and putting their skills and knowledge to work for our company and our customers.","My coworkers are enhancing the safety of our system by replacing older services and mains that are a source of gas leaks. These necessary replacements not only improve the safety of our system, but also reduce potential methane emissions. We're proud to have reduced our methane emissions by over 15% in the last 10 years, but we are never satisfied and we have an internal methane reduction task force dedicated to improving our performance. All of this needed work requires capital at a time when the commodity price of natural gas has never been more stable or affordable. Now is the time for us to invest in our system in a way that customers can afford. Ultimately these affordable investments lead to attractive returns for you, our investors. And we're thankful for your support in enabling this work and for making Michigan safer.","Our consistency and predictability are the hallmark of our financial results every year. Part of what makes us consistent is our ability to adapt to changing external conditions. With the gubernatorial elections next month, I know many of you may wonder what will change in Michigan and for CMS Energy. Regardless of who is in office we have proven that we are able to work with everyone. When we stand for Michigan, people want to stand with us. While we can't predict the results, I can tell you we know the candidates well and look forward to working with the new governor to serve the citizens of Michigan.","As slide 7 shows, over the years we've seen governors from both parties and the makeup of our Commission change and have experienced varying economic and weather impacts as well, but regardless of all those factors we have an ability to deliver consistent financial performance year after year after year after year.","With that I'll turn the call over to Rejji.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Thank you, Patti. And good morning, everyone. As Patti mentioned we're pleased to announce our strong results for the first nine months of the year with adjusted earnings per share of $1.93, up 16% from the comparable period in 2017. On a weather-normalized basis earnings per share for the first nine months were down 6% versus the same period in 2017, largely due to the execution of operating pull-aheads over the past two quarters, given the weather-driven and cost savings upside realized to-date. Patti touched on a couple of examples already, such as tree trimming and our pipeline integrity program which deliver safety and reliability benefits to our customers.","We've also pulled ahead additional gas pipeline maintenance work, to improve the reliability of our system and minimize gas leaks while opportunistically re-financing select bonds at the parent, among other customer and employee initiatives to de-risk 2019. For the third quarter we reported earnings per share of $0.59 this year compared to $0.62 per share for the third quarter of 2017.","As noted, given our solid performance to-date, we have raised the low end of our 2018 adjusted EPS guidance range and our revised range is now $2.31 to $2.34 per share. All-in, we are well ahead of plan and we'll continue to look for reinvestment opportunities in the fourth quarter including both operating and non-operating pull-aheads to improve our likelihood of success in 2019 and beyond.","As you can see on the waterfall chart on slide 9, weather has positively impacted our year-to-date results by $0.42 per share, with more than half of that coming from last year's poor weather rolling off. As you'll note, the cost savings bucket has shrunk from $0.10 per share of positive variance through the second quarter to $0.03 per share for the first nine months due to the aforementioned reinvestment strategy and heavy storm activity. But we continue to see lower benefits expense and other operational efficiencies. The weather and cost performance related upside have also been supported by $0.06 of higher rate relief net of investment costs relative to 2017. These sources of positive variance have been partially offset by the absence of favorable tax benefits realized in the third quarter of 2017 and by lower non-weather sales, largely driven by our expanded energy efficiency programs. It is worth noting that reductions in customer usage attributable to our energy efficiency programs are trued up in rate cases through updates to our sales forecast.","Given our sizable reinvestment opportunities this year, we have highlighted some of those levers that we have already pulled and some that are in process in the table on the right-hand side of the chart. But needless to say, we always proceed with caution in this regard particularly late in the year in the event we have mild weather and\/or unforeseen storm activity, among other risks. As we look ahead to the balance of the year, we are not awaiting any further regulatory outcomes in 2018 given the recent uncontested settlement of our gas case in August with an $11 million revenue increase and a 10% ROE. So, as mentioned, we will be acutely focused on operating and non-operating pull-aheads for the balance of the year to the benefit of customers and investors.","As we turn the page on the regulatory calendar for 2018, we continue to parallel-path three major items. There is our pending electric case where we filed a revised revenue request of $44 million as part of rebuttal, down from $58 million largely due to a decrease in contingency estimates for select capital investments and lower realized debt financing costs. As always, we are eager to pass on these savings to customers to minimize the amount of our rate requests. We expect a proposal for a decision or PFD from the administrative law judge in late December, and a final order from the Commission in March of next year absent a settlement.","In regards to the IRP, we're in the evidentiary phase of the process. The MPSC staff and other intervenors recently filed their testimony in mid-October, which we found largely constructive. And we expect the final order from the Commission around the second quarter of next year.","Lastly, we'll look to file our next gas case with a revenue request of about $245 million which reflects our continued prioritization on safety and upgrading our gas system while we remain in an environment of historically low natural gas prices.","Slide 11 highlights some of our key gas infrastructure projects and the significant investments we will continue to make to improve the safety and reliability of our gas distribution system. We have steadily ramped up our focus and spend in this area by building a skilled and dedicated workforce as Patti noted by identifying and prioritizing key areas on our system that are in need of upgrading and by finding ways to offset much of the bill impact to customers by capitalizing on low natural gas prices and through other cost reduction initiatives. As part of our pending gas rate case filing we plan to replace approximately 25,000 vintage service lines and roughly 140 miles of distribution mains, among other programs. We're also planning to inspect and remediate as necessary over 950 miles of pipeline. It is worth noting that many of these maintenance and inspection programs that we have in place are routine annual activities and have been incorporated in previous investment recovery mechanisms or trackers approved by the Commission. Lastly, we'll be extending our capacity to deliver gas on our system to accommodate customer requests and future load growth.","Slide 12 illustrates our emphasis on gas as evidenced by our five-year capital plan of $10 billion, roughly half of which is comprised of gas infrastructure investments. We continue to focus on the needs of our aging gas system as reflected in the forecasted material increase in gas as a percentage of total rate base to 40% from 30% over the next five years, as highlighted in the chart on the right-hand side of the page. The balance of our five-year capital plan consists of substantial electric distribution investments in accordance with our five-year electric distribution plan filed in March and increased investments in renewable generation as per our Integrated Resource Plan or IRP.","Our capital investment needs remain significant beyond the five-year period as well. As we work through regulatory proceedings and our financial planning cycle, we expect that the longer term capital mix will continue to evolve and we look forward to providing an update to our 10-year capital plan in 2019 once we have better visibility on our long term capacity plan.","As we've highlighted in the past, the primary constraint on the pace at which we invest capital is customer affordability and we are confident that we can continue to deliver cost reductions to minimize customer bill increases. On the gas side, our numerous capital investment programs will enable reduced maintenance costs on items such as leak repair among other benefits. Reduced gas, O&M costs coupled with our expectation of relatively flat natural gas prices that are minimized through our purchase and storage strategy, among other cost reduction initiatives should keep customer bills affordable. We've experienced such success in the past as evidenced in the chart on the lower right-hand side of slide 13. Since 2013, our gas bills have declined by over 25% relative to inflation, despite approximately $4 billion of aggregate investment over that period. In the electric business, we will benefit from high priced, power purchase agreements rolling off over time while also realizing fuel and O&M expense savings as we retire our coal fleet.","Our power supply related savings will be supplemented with continued electric system upgrades, which will reduce service restoration expenses, among other benefits. For the consolidated entity, our efforts on waste elimination through the CE Way continue to bear fruit across the organization and we continue to benefit from attrition management and non-operating savings from opportunistic re-financing and tax planning. Speaking of taxes, on October 1, we filed a proposal to return approximately $1.6 billion of deferred taxes from utility customers over the next several decades, in accordance with the federal tax code.","As a reminder, the total impact of federal tax reform will deliver an estimated 4% rate reduction opportunity, and every 1% reduction in customer rates generates about $400 million of incremental capital investment capacity for the benefit of customers and investors. As we look prospectively at the consolidated business, unsurprisingly, our growth continues to be driven by our utility with its robust capital needs on both the gas and electric systems, and forward-looking filings such as the IRP and our five-year electric distribution plan provides long-term transparency for the MPSC and other key stakeholders, which should provide more visibility regarding regulatory outcomes in the future.","Outside of the utility, we'll continue to operate our existing Enterprises fleet with a low-risk mindset and take advantage of attractive, contracted renewable opportunities like the recent wind PPA with valued customers like GM. When we couple our utility earnings contribution with contracted non-utility growth and prudent financial planning, you can see why we have confidence in our ability to continue to grow at 6% to 8% over the long term.","And with that I'll turn the call back over to Patti.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Thanks, Rejji. In summary, our investment thesis is driven by a large and aging system in need of capital investments, a growing and diverse service territory, a constructive regulatory statute, a unique self-funding model that is enhanced by the CE Way and tax reform and a healthy balance sheet to fund our plan cost effectively. We are confident in our ability to deliver consistent industry-leading growth and superior total shareholder return over the long term as we do the worrying for you and adapt to changing conditions.","With that, Rocco, please open the lines for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much, Patti. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. And our first question today comes from Michael Weinstein of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Hi, Michael.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Good morning, Michael.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey. What's the \u2013 sorry if I missed this. But what's the base that the 6% to 8% for 2019 is based off of?","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah. So, Michael, we at this time of the year, when we give guidance in Q3 it's always predicated effectively on the midpoint of our revised guidance, and so as Patti noted our revised 2018 guidance is $2.31 to $2.34 per share and so that's what it's driven off of, but as you know as we get actuals over the course of the fourth quarter and provide our fourth quarter earnings call we'll likely revise that number.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got it, got it. That's off the midpoint now of the end in other words, right?","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Precisely.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Right. And then can you just give us kind of an overview of what you intend to update at the EEI this year? What are the categories of things that will be updated at that point?","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah. It should be more of the same, Michael. I mean, we generally try to avoid surprises and so if I could characterize some of the topics that will likely come up, we'll talk a bit more about the progression of some of our regulatory items. So there is the pending gas case which should be filed at that point. There's the electric case which continues to progress, and then there is the IRP which is in the evidentiary phase, so we look forward to providing updates on that.","Always happy to talk about the capital mix and what we're seeing there and then opportunities to continue to save costs and reduce our cost structure to perpetuate the self-funding strategy. So those are I think the variety of topics we'll cover and we'll have visibility at that point as well on the electoral front and what's taking place on the political side in Michigan. So I think all of those will be things we'll cover, but I don't expect a whole lot new beyond that.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Are there any significant impacts that you perceive from the election, that goes one way or the other or do you expect you'll work well with no matter who wins at this point? And one thing I've heard is that the property tax might become an issue in the Legislature during the potential lame duck session, is that something that you understand?","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah. So there's is a couple of things. First on the elections themselves, as we said, we're very comfortable with either gubernatorial candidate. We do have term limits in Michigan, so it does result in a lot of turnover in the House and the Senate. But the good news is we passed that statute in 2016 and with large bipartisan support, so the idea of revisiting that would be a pretty long thought, I would suggest. But the new governor will obviously be able to appoint a new commissioner when Norm Saari's term ends mid-year next year. And the way the statute is written that establishes our Commission and our commissioners and their term really prevents what I would describe as shenanigans as a result of elections. We are very comfortable with the terms in statute, the number of parties represented on the Commission is in statute, so the idea that the new governor would replace Norm is very predictable. And they are six months into their new term and so we'll have an opportunity to help understand what the requirements and needs are of that new commissioner.","So we're just not too concerned with any effect of the elections. On the property tax....","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Property tax? Yeah.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","We \u2013 yeah, we've been working with the Senate, they passed a bill proposed on what's called PPT, personal property tax. And in Michigan, when the Michigan tax reform happened I think back in 2012 the utilities were exempted from the reform on PPT. And so we're suggesting that future increases would be capped. And so we're working on that. I think it will be good for customers. When we think about the cost stack for customers, taxes are in there. So any time that we can reduce the tax liability actually for our customers, it's good for Michigan. So that's why we're working on that. I wouldn't hazard to guess of whether it will or won't pass, but it is something that we think will be good for customers so we're for it.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got you. Okay, thank you very much.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Good morning, Jonathan.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Good morning, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good to know that you're riding the rollercoaster for us, so just thank you.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","That's right. Rest easy, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","A question, Rejji, you mentioned that you would potentially \u2013 I forgot the exact word you used but you would perhaps update the 10-year capital plan next year once you have some of the regulatory proceedings further along. Are you talking about sort of rolling it forward because it will be further out in time, sort of fleshing it out or potentially that might change in some quantitative fashion?","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah. So it's a little of both. It would be a roll-forward of the timeframe but also we would likely increase the capital plan. And we just don't know the extent to which we'll increase it. We talked about in the past the benefits of tax reform and how it's created incremental capital investment capacity to the tune of about $1.6 billion but we also think that the IRP as well as other capital investment opportunities across the gas and electric distributions create opportunities as well. And so we know that there's a nice backlog of capital investment, but as I said in the Q2 call, we want to make sure that we can afford, and I say we, meaning our customers as well as our investors on the balance sheet, can afford to accommodate capital investments. Let's say something in excess of $18 billion which was the old plan. And so we want to make sure we get the math right and also get visibility on some of the regulatory proceedings that I covered. So that's really the gating item and what we'll effectively cover with the new capital plan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That was really all I had. Thank you.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Thanks, Jonathan.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning and congratulations on continued good results.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Thanks, Stephen.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Thanks, Stephen.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","We've had a \u2013 we had a terrible explosion in the Northeast earlier this year and I was just curious if there were any lessons learned or any changes in thinking in terms of gas safety spending or any other sort of operational adjustments you would make or updates you'd make based on lessons that may have been learned from those explosions?","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah. Thanks for asking, Stephen. Obviously that was a serious situation and we've been very closely linked. In fact, we have about 30 folks who are out in Massachusetts right now assisting. I understand they're going to be coming home safely to us today, so we're wishing them a safe trip home, but we've looked closely. Our system configuration has one distinct difference between medium and standard pressure. We have relief valves that would prevent in an over-pressurized situation over-pressurizing that low pressure system. And so we do think that is an important feature that we have designed into our system.","I would say from an investment standpoint, however, it is the enhanced infrastructure replacement program, which is our investment recovery mechanism for gas investment for our mains and now our vintage services is critical to this part of the system. And so we would \u2013 in fact a couple of years ago, we established our own public safety goal, a breakthrough goal that we've been working to replace more vintage services. And we do more inspections than are required by PHMSA on both high consequence and non-high consequence areas just because we know the safety of this system is so important. And given the commodity prices now, customers more now than ever can afford these investments to make the system safe.","And it's really a unique point in time where we can do the right thing for the system and we don't have to trade off affordability for the magnitude of investment that we're doing. And so again we're thankful for our investors who make it possible to do that work here in Michigan.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's really helpful color. And Patti, is it your sense that the gas utility industry as a whole is going to respond with a number of proposed changes that could sort of result in a wave of updates of spending or is this more sort of each utility is going to approach this based on their own sort of unique circumstances. How broad I guess is my question in terms of updates or changes that you see from the industry as a result of these explosions?","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","I think there could be revised regulations, particularly as it relates to PHMSA and remotely controlled valve configurations. Right now, a lot of times on our distribution systems across the country, it's not remotely controlled. We might have monitoring in place, but we can't control. And so there might be some potential regulations that would result in added investment across the country and across the system.","I think for us when we think about our 6% to 8%, it will fit into our existing capital plan. I don't think it changes anything about our outlook. We would be prioritizing obviously safety as always number one in investment prioritization and meeting all regulatory requirements. So I think, again, it all hinges on the fact that safety is the overriding priority and potentially new regulations I think are possible, Stephen.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's really helpful. And if I could, maybe just one last one on electric vehicle infrastructure. Patti, I was just curious if you would mind giving us your latest thinking on the pace of that spend, the sort of the regulatory steps or any other sort of thoughts you might have about how you're going to roll out EV charging infrastructure?","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah. And so, you know this is a near and dear subject to my heart, Stephen, as the co-chair on the EEI Electric Transportation Committee. I have been obviously paying close attention nationally, but here at home we filed for $7.5 million infrastructure for EV in our latest electric rate case. The Commission did a great job of convening parties ahead of that filing so we could have some alignment about it. And so I'm thankful for their hard work on that and the conversations that occurred ahead of our filing. We feel good about it.","But as I've shared with you, Stephen, and with others, the idea that electric vehicle infrastructure is a huge capital play, I don't necessarily agree with that. I do think that it's an important component of the electrification strategy and as long as EVs are not charged on peak then it net and net reduces the unit cost of energy for all citizens. And so, there is benefit for all for enabling the EV infrastructure. But I'll tell you, in the Detroit Free Press, there was an editorial this week or maybe it was Crain's in Detroit, there was an editorial of a guy who bought an electric car and all his angst of getting around Metro Detroit to get charged and in fact he had his wife following him in his car so he didn't run out of charge. So there's infrastructure required for sure. It hit the press this week. And so I'm sure we'll have continued support to get that infrastructure built out. And faster is better, emission-free vehicles fueled by emission-free power is really our long-term vision.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Very good, thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Greg Gordon of Evercore. Please go ahead.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Hi, Patti.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Good morning, Greg.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Most of the \u2013 I think that the hugely salient questions have been answered. At EEI are we going to get a 2019 visibility on what you're thinking about DIG?","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Greg, this is... So, you mean in terms of whether it would be in the utility or just performance, I want to be clear...","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","No. I mean, slide 22 has the 2018 guidance and then the aspirational guidance.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","(00:31:57)","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","But it doesn't give us insight into what you're actually seeing and how it's contracted or what you expect market revenues to look like for 2019?","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah. So we generally have pretty conservative assumptions around capacity sales of DIG which do make up a decent portion of its revenue. But I'll say that the majority of its revenue is already locked in through energy sales forward through 2023. And so we tend to believe that there will continue to be a little bit of softening on the front end of the bilateral capacity mark and so we have pretty conservative assumptions around kilowatt per month assumptions.","And then generally, because of the pace at which I'll say the decision around the local clearing requirement in Michigan is progressing where we're now filing an appeal from the Court of Appeals decision that the Commission didn't have an authority to set the local clearing requirement, we think it's going to be a while before you see outcomes like we're highlighting on the right-hand side of that chart where you're seeing $4.50, $7.50 per kilowatt month.","And so I'll say our expectations are tempered, but as you think about our 2019 EPS guidance of $2.46 to $2.50 per share, we generally \u2013 I think we'll get about $0.01 of contribution from enterprises that supports that growth. And so, we do still expect decent growth from enterprises, but we're pretty tempered in expectations around capacity sales. Is that helpful?","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Yes. Thank you very much. And then the economic conditions and market conditions, interest rates, etcetera. Obviously they don't really have a direct impact on how you plan for the utility, but can you tell us what's going on EnerBank and whether \u2013 I know it's also a very small contributor. But the bank stocks have been behaving, like economic conditions for their business have worsened. I just wonder what you're seeing there.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah, I'd say in general EnerBank continues to perform well. And so we assumed in our guidance for 2018 about $0.15 of contribution from EnerBank. We think they are in that zip code. I will admit that the competitive environment has intensified a bit in that sector. And so we are feeling a little bit of pressure associated with that. But if you look at the quality of their portfolio in terms of average FICO scores, the annual growth and then our expectations going forward we still think the business will continue to perform as it has in a variety of different cycles and so EnerBank continues to trend along nicely and we haven't seen much erosion in terms of the portfolio FICO scores or any of that stuff you see when competition intensifies.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thank you. Have a good day. See you at EEI.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Thanks. See you.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Andrew Weisel of Scotia Horward Weil. Please go ahead.","Andrew Weisel - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Hi, Andrew.","Andrew Weisel - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.","Question for you on the reinvestment. There is a lot of detail and a lot of impressive numbers here with the $0.24 that you flagged down the waterfall chart on page 9. My question is when I think about reinvestments relative to weather it looks like versus normal the weather year-to-date impact has been around $0.20 benefit. So maybe you could talk a little bit about the budget perspective there of where those extra $0.04 are coming from and I believe that's outside of cost savings, maybe you could just elaborate a bit more on some of those reinvestments and how that might impact 2019?","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah. So a couple of things I'd say. So we're obviously at this point of the year we're well ahead of plan. I'd say we're over $0.20 ahead of plan and so we have been busy putting a lot of dollars to work as we have, really starting in Q2 once we had a very nice winter for the gas business earlier in the year and then a very early start to the summer. And so with that upside, we've put quite a bit to work and so that $0.24 that you see on the right-hand side of slide 9, it represents spend that we put to work in some regard and then spend to come and so we expect by the fourth quarter you'll see a pretty significant expansion of operations and maintenance spend attributable to those pull-aheads and so that offers a couple of benefits.","So one, obviously it reduced potential costs in 2019. That's the definition of pull-ahead. You're spending money now that you won't have to spend next year, so there's risk mitigation in that. But also if you think about the bridge, that allows us to grow another, let's say, $0.16 or thereabouts. When you think about our guidance in 2018 versus our guidance in 2019, those are now all sort of discretionary, I'll say items that we're pulling ahead this year that we may not have to go and do next year. And so when you think about the path to delivering another year of 6% to 8%, you're going to lose the benefit of $0.20 of good weather that we had in 2018 and we plan for normal weather, but that will be offset by rate relief net of investments which should give us about $0.10 to $0.14 of upside based on our expectations. You'll get about as mentioned about $0.01 from enterprise, about another $0.01 from EnerBank for growth and then you're going to have about $0.24 of discretionary activities you took on in 2018 that you don't need to take on in 2019 and so all of that should bridge us very nicely to a very good glide path of 6% to 8% growth.","Andrew Weisel - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.","Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Andrew Weisel - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.","This might overlap with that question, but the same waterfall chart, usage, enterprises and other year-to-date is down $0.24 year-over-year, but when I look at the reconciliation at the end, it looks it looks like enterprises are kind of flat and corporate and others kind of flat, so I can't imagine $0.24 of usage impact. Maybe you could elaborate what else is going on in there?","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah, there's quite a bit and it's a bit of a catch-all, but I will say that $0.24, about half of that is usage, so call it $0.13 and that's because we have seen at least a little bit of softening in our non-weather sales performance. But it's interesting. I think the data that we highlighted are \u2013 effectively the last page of our supporting financial document is a touch misleading because it's weather-normalized, which is an imperfect science. And so just to go through the numbers, when it comes to non-weather sales we're about 0.5% down year-to-date, but remember not only is that math weather-normalized but it's also shown net of energy efficiency.","And so if you think about the programs we have in place for energy efficiency, we're compensated to reduce customer usage about 1.5% from the prior year. And so if you gross up that 0.5% for the effects of energy efficiency, we're actually up about 1% percent. And then within the customer classes we actually see pretty favorable mix which has been the trend we've seen over the course of the first three quarters. So residential is up about 0.5%, again weather-normalized net of energy efficiency. And so when you gross that up, we're actually up about 2% year-to-date, and that's higher margin of course of our customer classes.","Commercial is flat year-to-date and so if you gross that up, again we're up about 1.5%. And then admittedly the laggard has been industrial which is our lowest margin portion of customers and that's down over 2%, but grossing that up it's down about 0.5%. So I'd say industrial is the one place where we've underperformed and that's what you're seeing, and some of that customer usage, that's flowing through that $0.24. But even within that I think the key question you ask on the industrial side is, are underlying economic conditions in our service territory softening, and the quick answer to that is we don't believe so. We continue to see good economic factors in the Grand Rapids area which is in the heart of our service territory and I always look at the cycle billed sales particularly in our most energy intensive segments within again our electric service territory. So food manufacturing is up year-to-date about 9%, so that's trending quite well. Transportation equipment is up approximately 6% and then fabricated metal products is up over 4%. And so again some of our most energy intensive sectors within our service territory continuing to trend quite well and so I still think the economic conditions are quite good and so even though we've been a little disappointed in non-weather sales I think there's a nice comeback story and so we continue to do well and we expect the future will look quite bright as well.","The other thing that's in that $0.24 and then I'll pause and breathe is that we have the absence of a tax benefit that we realized in Q3 of last year. That was about $0.07 and so that is obviously no longer flowing through and that's what's impacting the comp. So if you take the absence of the tax benefit coupled with non-weather sales, those two really represent the vast majority of that $0.24.","Andrew Weisel - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.","Great breakout and certainly good from a mix perspective when you talk about the different customer classes. My last question is the rate case filing coming up early next year. I believe you set a $245 million rate increase but with a bunch of offsets. Can you maybe elaborate a little bit of maybe what the total impact to customer bills might look like and how much of that comes from the lower commodity versus cost cuts versus whatever else might be in the plan?","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah, so we're still finalizing the case but we do think obviously on a base rate perspective before you take into account the commodity costs you are going to see an increase in base rates. We're still working through that math. But when you do take the commodity costs into account we do think that you'll probably see a customer bill impact that may be a little higher than inflation case relative \u2013 for this case relative to the last case. But at the end of the day the impact on customers' bills particularly the residential level is about $2 per month or something of that zip code. So at the end of the day, not material increases for customers.","And when you think about the benefits of those capital investments, as Patti highlighted we prioritize safety and reliability and so we do think it's certainly worth the cost to make sure that we're being very proactive in our pipeline maintenance as well as our vintage service programs and enhanced infrastructure replacement program. So we think the cost is certainly worth \u2013 first, we don't think the cost is a great deal, but we think the benefits certainly exceed the cost.","Andrew Weisel - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.","Sounds great. Thank you.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of BoA Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Good morning, Julien.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. So I wanted to follow back up on the IRP filing here and I know we've chatted about it a little bit. Just wanted to talk a little bit more with respect to, A, just logistically the timing of when you think in 2019 you'll come up with the next update. If I look, right, like the second quarter 2019 with an order there you would imagine you'd be in a position by third quarter to get an update there?","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Julien, we'll see. I mean, obviously we expect to get a decision, we're going to get a decision within 10 months. So that will be in the April timeframe and then we get an opportunity to react to that and so we should get a resolution on the IRP in June of next year, but we'll also get some visibility prior to that. And so I don't want to sit and represent that we'll provide guidance on a new capital plan in Q3, maybe sooner than that and then we'll also have to see how things are progressing with our pending cases. And so I think it's a variety of things we'll have to see on the regulatory front that will dictate the timing. I would like to think it's Q3 at the latest, but it may be sooner than that. So we'll see.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent. And can you elaborate a little bit more about some of the nuances of the IRP doc a little bit, maybe some of the changes and how you think about the needs assessment moving around. And I suppose, if you will, like any of the nuances that you'd be paying attention to there?","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Well, we're very excited about the IRP, Julien. It's a great construct the way it's designed. So we filed the IRP this fall where, and as Rejji mentioned 10 months out we'll get early indicators from the Commission on the record and then we have 60 days to respond and we could make adjustments. What we filed in our IRP has very little financial impact in the first three years of the IRP. But it does include an important resolution to PURPA here in Michigan and setting of avoided costs per PURPA is important across the country. But the Commission has stated clearly and reiterated most recently that the IRP is the vehicle that they will use to establish a mechanism for setting avoided costs for PURPA qualifying facilities and for establishing whether a utility has a need, therefore qualifying facilities would be added to the system.","And so our competitive bidding proposal combined with the financial compensation mechanism or earning on a PPA will get concrete feedback from the Commission through this filing and so we're looking forward to hearing that. The staff's position recently published shows support for the thinking. Of course there's a range in the financial compensation mechanism between the staff's position and our own, but that's not unlike a range in an ROE between the staff position and the company. There's a process and potentially a settlement on the table to be able to come to resolution on that issue. So we're excited about what it holds for Michigan and we're excited about the future because of what we've been able to publish through that IRP.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Right. And so I think I just heard it from you, you think you could settle that issue?","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","It's possible. You know settlements are hard sometimes, particularly in this IRP there is a lot of parties, there is a lot of people engaged. I think we have a proven track record on settlements. But this one would be complicated, and frankly the 10-month time clock is just fine with us. And so I would say I wouldn't put in over or under on that. I would just suggest that we'll work toward a settlement, but if we can't get one we're very comfortable going to a Commission order on the IRP.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, excellent, all right. All the best, guys.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Thanks a lot, Julien.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Thanks, Julien.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Praful Mehta of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks so much. Hi, guys.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Hi, Praful.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Good morning, Praful.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning. So again lots of questions answered which is great. I guess I wanted to touch on the weather impact and weather-normalized, clearly there is like on slide 8 I see $0.47 versus the $0.59 that you had with the weather benefit. I guess given the rising temperatures and the impact of just some form of continuous increase in heat, is the definition of weather-normalized something that will change, you think, over time and does that impact you guys at all if the assumption of load just changes given weather. Is that something you think about?","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Well, certainly I have been critical in the past of just the calculation itself. I think as I've said before it's a very imperfect science to weather-normalize, but I don't think the work we do to weather-normalize our performance or across the sector will change anytime soon and obviously when it comes to planning we do plan for normal weather and when we say that, we look at the last 15 years and so we don't just take a couple of years, we look 15 years, over a decade, around a decade and a half of weather trends to make sure we're thinking the right way about our plans for the future and so you know, yes, we've been wrong and we've outperformed in some cases. In some cases, we've underperformed and that's what averages represent. And so, again, we feel like we have a pretty long-term point of view when it comes to weather normalization. And we'll try to be mindful of the near-term trends, but not overreact to them. Is that helpful, Praful?","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah, no, that is. But I guess what I'm also thinking about is if the definition changes as and if the weather-normalized number just goes up over time, is that an impact to you guys from an earning potential perspective given the denominator that the regulators use to kind of define rates just goes up?","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Praful, I would suggest that if you look back, you don't even have to go back as far as 2015 or 2014. You see dramatic weather differences, the opposite direction. So it really is not \u2013 I wouldn't suggest that average temperatures are rising. I would suggest that there is temperature variation and we can see that in our actual results over the last couple of years. You don't have to go far back to see a mild winter and a hot summer or a mild summer and a hot winter because we're gas and electric. Weather has a longer-term effect on us and sometimes evens itself out between the two commodities.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","And the only other thing I'd mention, Praful, is remember when we file our rate cases we do take into account sales forecasts and because of the nature or pace at which we file, which is really on a serial or annual basis, we do reflect our latest sales forecast. And so you just have that natural true-up or correcting mechanism every time we file rates and get rate orders.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah. No, that's a great point. Thanks for that. And I guess just quickly, it won't be complete without a question on EnerBank. You already mentioned EnerBank is performing pretty well even through this at least uncertain time for banks. I guess, is there any view that if CapEx plans increase and the opportunity to grow the utility side increases, again, I'm just asking the strategic question, the fit on EnerBank and if that is something that would be considered at some point?","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah. As we've said before, Praful, EnerBank, nothing has changed with our point of view on EnerBank. It is in the same place that it has been. We don't put additional dollars into EnerBank itself growing and it plays its role in the system. Someone would have to pay the right price for us to sell EnerBank.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Fair enough. Well, I appreciate it. Thank you, guys.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Praful.","Operator","And our next question comes from Travis Miller of Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Travis Miller - Morningstar","Good morning. Thank you.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Good morning, Travis.","Travis Miller - Morningstar","I was wondering on the electric case, you talked about the settlement and possibility of IRP. What about a settlement possibility in the electric case and how far apart do you think you are in terms of reaching a middle point for a possible settlement.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","So we have been having, in fact I think we have another iteration today and so we've had very productive settlement discussions to date. And when we think about the numbers where we are right now, as I mentioned in my remarks, we're at $44 million of deficiency. That presupposes a 10.75% ROE, the staff's at almost a $100 million difference at $44 million sufficiency. And so when you think about that delta of $100 million, it seems like you could drive a truck through it. But if you normalize for ROE and just go to the current ROE and I'm not conceding that 10.75% is not what we think the ROE should be, but let's just say you hypothetically do that math, you close the gap about $60 million. And then if you take capital structure into account, we're at 52.5%, I think the staff is just under 52% and kind of normalize that to where it is currently across gas and electric, that gives you another almost $10 million.","And so you normalize for current ROEs and current capital structures, you close the gap pretty materially and so because of that, we are cautiously optimistic that there could -- that we could settle but as Patti highlighted in the context of the IRP, any of the electric-related proceedings are quite complicated, there are a lot of moving pieces and there are a lot of interveners and so we are cautiously optimistic but much too early to spike the football at this point so we'll see where we go.","Travis Miller - Morningstar","Okay. Great. And then you talked a little bit here about regulatory outcomes in the near term could impact your capital spend outlook. What is that kind of if you get a good decision, what does that mean? If you get a bad decision, what does that mean just in terms of range of potential capital plans over the 5-year or 10-year period?","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah. So I think the absolute amount of capital investments we have whether it's 5 or 10 years, I think that we'll certainly on a five-year basis remain consistent and so right now we're kind of just over $10 billion across the next 5 years. What will change as a result of regulatory outcomes is potentially the composition of that quantum of capital that we plan to invest over the timeframe and so for example if we see \u2013 I don't foresee this, but let's say we get a gas outcome that we view as suboptimal, well then that may increase our emphasis on some of our renewable investments or potential electric distribution investments and vice versa.","And so it really is a function of how we're trending on the various regulatory fronts which could change the composition of the capital investment program but not so much the quantum. And then as I think longer term, then obviously the quantum could expand as I highlighted earlier and so we think we'll certainly be above the $18 billion, 10-year plan that we proposed in our September of 2017 investor conference and so that number will come up, will go up, but again it's a function of how we trend in the longer-term items such as trackers, the IRP and so on.","Travis Miller - Morningstar","Okay, great. Appreciate it.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Vedula Murti of Avon Capital. Please go ahead.","Vedula Murti - Avon Capital","Good morning.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Vedula Murti - Avon Capital","I apologize if you addressed this. You may have, I think, in your discussion with Julien, but what's your current feeling about the prospects within the IRP process to achieve the type of tracker that you've been seeking? As I recall, I think the initial staff testimony was not particularly supportive of what you were requesting if I'm correct about that? If you could please address that?","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","So, Vedula, are you referring to a tracker or is it \u2013 because we don't really have a tracker embedded in our IRP, is it some other aspect of the IRP (00:53:51)?","Vedula Murti - Avon Capital","Oh, then, I apologize if it is outside the IRP, I was referring specifically to the tracker, capital tracker.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","The five-year....","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Maybe you're describing the five-year distribution tracker we filed for in our electric rate case?","Vedula Murti - Avon Capital","Yes.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","So, again as Rejji was just describing, we're working towards a settlement on that. There is \u2013 we've had a lot of regulatory filings in Michigan as a result of the energy law in 2016, not necessarily rate filings, but regulatory proceedings and so there has been a desire to find a way to go in less often. And so we offered to stay out of rate cases for a couple of years with the implementation of this long-term tracker on our distribution system.","It's a $3 billion proposal. That's a pretty big ask for the Commission to approve all of that spending. So we're not, I wouldn't put my bets on getting that full tracker approved. The staff has expressed our concerns about that full tracker, but perhaps a portion of it much like our gas, in our gas cases, we have an enhanced infrastructure replacement program tracking mechanism and that has worked out very well. It allows us to do longer term contracts with our contract providers. We're able to do a work plan that's more robust and reliable.","We can eliminate waste in the system because we can plan ahead more effectively. So we're a fan of that kind of tracking mechanism. And we think that the detail provided in our five-year distribution plan was sufficient to support and maybe a portion, maybe it would be substation maintenance or maybe pole replacements or something like that as a first step toward longer term getting to a full capital tracker. But certainly we support the idea of the full capital tracker, but I wouldn't expect that it will fully be approved.","But just keep in mind that just means that we continue to come in annually like we do. We have good outcomes from our regulatory filings and we're continuously improving our quality of those filings and we've seen good outcomes, and we feel good about going in annually if we need to, to make sure that we can make the necessary investments on behalf of our customers, and pass along cost savings that we realize throughout the year.","Vedula Murti - Avon Capital","So you seem to be expecting that you could achieve a portion of this, but that it would still entail probably coming in annually as you have been?","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Yes.","Vedula Murti - Avon Capital","Okay. Thank you.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","And this includes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mrs. Patti for any closing remarks.","Patricia K.

The earnings news release issued early today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website, in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded.","After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12:00 PM Eastern Time running through May 3rd. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Srikanth Maddipati - CMS Energy Corp.","Thank you, Francesca. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Patti Poppe, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","This presentation contains forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Patti.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Thanks, Sri, and thank you, everyone for joining us for our first quarter earnings call. This morning, I'll share our strong first quarter financial and operating results, and review our regulatory calendar. Rejji will add more details on our financial results and outlook, and then we'll close with Q&A.","We picked up right where we left off, at the end of last year where we're at, we are now delivering solid first quarter earnings of $0.86 per share, up 21% year-over-year or up 5% on a weather-normalized basis.","The year-over-year comparison was largely driven by weather, given the unusually warm first quarter in 2017, as well as cost savings achieved already this year. Our solid start to the year gives us confidence in our ability to deliver the results you come to expect, regardless of weather or other changing conditions around us.","Our strength is our agility and ability to flex. While it's early in the year, we continue to reaffirm our year-end guidance of 6% to 8% off of last year's actual results. And we reiterate that we'd be disappointed not to be towards the high end of our range again this year.","Our focus and commitment to our triple bottom line people, planet and profit, underpinned by financial and operating performance is a low risk and sustainable business approach, and it continues to deliver. My story for this month starts at our Campbell Generating Station, I was able to join my co-workers as we celebrated a record run on Unit 3, prior to entering our planned periodic maintenance outage. We're proud of the maintenance work we've done and the environmental upgrades made over the years to protect the land, air and water for Michigan residents. We were excited to celebrate this record run, knowing that the power we generate at the Campbell plant is not only more reliable, but it's also cleaner than it's ever been. Yet, we are still dissatisfied.","Longer term, we know that to reach our Clean Energy Breakthrough Goal that we announced in February, there will come a time when these plants will need to be retired. Some of these plants have served our customers for over 60 years. This decision has a real impact on the lives of the people and the communities surrounding our remaining plants, and my co-workers who are employed there.","For that reason, like our handling of the Classic Seven retirements in 2016, we plan to work with these communities and our co-workers to ensure a smooth transition. Our previous coal retirements involved partnerships with developers to decommission these plants and then redevelop them for the good of the local community, which would all done at a lower cost for customers and perfectly exemplifies our triple bottom line.","I'm excited to share some of the details of our Clean Energy Breakthrough Goal that we announced in February. As you know, we've already taken a leadership position in the sector by reducing our carbon emissions by 38% from 2005 with the closure of approximately 1 gigawatt of coal at our Classic Seven plants in 2016, which exceeds the requirements outlined by the Clean Power Plan. We've committed to cutting our carbon emissions by 80% and retiring all of our coal plants by 2040, which is a decade ahead of the targets in the Paris climate accord. In that timeframe, we anticipate that more than 40% of our energy will come from clean sources, such as wind and solar and from energy storage.","Our goal doesn't end there. Over the next five years, we plan to save 1 billion gallons of water, reduce waste going to landfills by 35% and protect 5,000 acres of land in Michigan. These industry-leading results and commitments along with our social and governance practices have made us the number one U.S. utility in the Annual Sustainalytics Rankings for the second year in a row, all while continuing to deliver top tier financial results.","On the regulatory front, you may recall that we filed our five-year electric distribution plan in the first quarter. We believe the five-year plan will provide a visible road map of our electric investments on needed infrastructure, and our upcoming electric rate filing in the second quarter will align nicely with that five-year plan.","We received an order in our Electric Rate Case in late March, which authorized a 10% ROE, and a $66 million in revenue. We view this outcome as constructive and a confirmation of the robust design of Michigan's Regulatory Statute. We have one additional rate case yet to be determined this year. We expect an order in our Gas Rate Case at the end of August. As a reminder, we initially requested $178 million of rate relief and a 10.5% ROE, which excluded the impacts of tax reform.","Just to walk you through the math, we've revised our request down by $33 million, largely related to cost savings already achieved, such as benefit savings, as well as capital and other O&M that were pushed beyond the test year.","We're reducing our requests even further by including the impact of tax reform, which results in a revised request of $83 million, and reflects a 10.75% ROE, given the implications of tax reform and current economic conditions. Given tax reform and low commodity prices, this is a great opportunity to make significant safety and infrastructure upgrades to our system, while still protecting customers from bills they can't effort.","Finally, in June, we plan to file our long awaited IRP. The new energy law requires us to file the IRP, which will provide more insight to our future generation (07:36), and allows the commission to go on the record with their view of our plan. The IRP will also provide investments certainty ahead of capital expenditures and will align with our clean and lean philosophy.","We are at a unique moment in time. As we are retiring our traditional coal assets, and out of market PPAs, we have choices about how to replace that energy and capacity. We're opting to leverage this moment, and we don't plan to replace that capacity on a megawatt per megawatt basis right away. Instead, we'll primarily use a modular build out of renewable sources of power coupled with energy waste reduction through energy efficiency and demand response.","Our incentive mechanism for energy efficiency and investment in renewables make these choices good for customers and for investors. This is the essence of our clean and lean investment philosophy, which allows us to eliminate energy waste, rightsize our energy supply and distribution system, and minimize exposure to high price PPAs, fuel, O&M and future stranded costs through big bets.","We can then deploy that capital into renewable investments in other areas of the business that provide additional benefits to our customers, including electric distribution and gas infrastructure, which improves safety and reliability, while executing on our commitment to the planet.","As we focus on the road ahead, it's important to note that we continue to deliver regardless of weather or any other external factors, just look at our track record. We provide consistent results supported by strong operations performance and no resets. Our agility and conservative planning are our strengths.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rejji.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Thank you, Patti and good morning, everyone. As Patti highlighted, we are pleased to report that we've kicked off 2018 with a strong first quarter, achieving earnings per share of $0.86, up $0.15 from the first quarter 2017, which implies 21% period-over-period growth, largely driven by weather and cost savings.","Weather-normalized earnings were up 5% from the prior year, which reflects colder winter weather to the benefit of the gas business, and a lack of significant storm activity relative to Q1 of 2017.","As a result of this strong start, we're ahead of plan, which is always helpful prior to storm season. That said, it is still early in the year, so we'll continue to plan conservatively and manage the business with a focus on executing on our capital plan and identifying cost savings to mitigate future risk to the plan and to perpetuate our self-funding strategy for the benefit of customers and investors.","On slide 10, on the left hand side of the waterfall chart, you can see the favorable comparison of the first quarter 2018 results versus Q1 of 2017. Favorable weather provided $0.14 of positive variance and cost savings including reduced benefits, expenses and minimal storm activity contributed $0.07. Also, rate relief net of investments provided a $0.01 of EPS upside relative to the comparable period in 2017.","These sources of positive variance were partially offset by lower non-weather sales, largely due to our energy efficiency program. As we look ahead to the remainder of 2018, we are encouraged by the path required to achieve our 2018 EPS guidance range, which includes modest pick up later in the year from our already approved electric rate increase, a constructive outcome in our pending gas case, and normal weather.","However, as mentioned before, we'll continue to plan conservatively with a keen eye on risk mitigation, given the inherent variability that we have experienced in our business over the years.","To that end, slide 11 best illustrates said variability, but more important highlights of resilience of our business model. During periods of unfavorable weather or other sources of downside, we rely on our ability to flex operating and non-operating levers to meet our financial objectives without compromising customer service.","During strong periods, we focus on reinvestment into the business to achieve longer term benefits for customers and investors. Every year is different, but we always expect to meet our financial and operational objectives year-in and year-out.","On slide 12, we highlight as a reminder, the model that facilitates our ability to deliver consistent industry-leading financial performance. With our extensive backlog of capital investments which drives earnings growth, significant cost reduction opportunities and a diverse economy in our service territory, we are confident that we can maintain our success for many years to come. The multifaceted nature of the self-funding strategy, which is comprised of cost reductions, tax planning, sales and non-utility earnings contribution facilitates risk mitigation.","In fact, our ability to self-fund the vast majority of our capital investments enables us to meet our financial and operational targets, while minimizing the customer price impact every year.","To elaborate on the magnitude of our organic growth opportunity, as noted on slide 13, that we have an extensive inventory of capital investment projects at the utility due to our large and aging electric and gas systems. As we have historically invested in our system at a measured pace given customer affordability constraints.","As highlighted on our fourth quarter call, given the substantial rate reduction opportunity presented by tax reform in addition to the other aspects of our self-funding strategy, we have forecasted a five-year capital investment program of approximately $10 billion, which extends our runway for growth without compromising our annual price increase target of at or below inflation.","The expected composition of this plan will be weighted towards improving our gas infrastructure, as well as upgrading our electric distribution system and investing in more renewable generation. This level investment further improves the safety and reliability of our electric and gas systems to the benefit of customers, evolves our generation portfolio to the benefit of the planet, and extends the runway for EPS growth to the benefit of investors.","Our capital investment needs remain significant beyond the five-year period as evidenced in the circular chart on the left. As we work through the aforementioned regulatory proceedings and our ordinary course financial planning cycle, we expect that the longer term capital mix will continue to evolve, and we look forward to providing an update on our 10-year capital plan in due time.","As mentioned, our model is successful, because we largely self-fund our capital plans through cost savings to minimize customer bill impact. Now, historically, we have emphasized our substantial focus and achievements on reducing operation and maintenance expense, and rightfully I might add, since we have reduced those costs by 11% since 2013, we also foresee sustainable process improvements through waste elimination and Lean Principles embodied by the CE Way, which can lead to future savings within and beyond O&M.","To that end, it is important to note that we do not discriminate when it comes to cost savings, and we view literally every component of our cost structure as an opportunity. In fact, the non-O&M portion of our cost structure represents a pool of approximately $4.5 billion, which is roughly 80% of our costs.","Needless to say that pool won't go to zero, but it offers a significant cost savings opportunity, which creates headroom to invest capital to improve the safety and reliability of our gas and electric systems, while minimizing customer bills.","The expiration of our large PPAs will create substantial cost reduction opportunities in the future, and in the interim, we'll continue our efforts to reduce fuel and power supply cost, interest expense, and property and income taxes.","As for the latter, over the course of the next several months, we'll provide bill credits to customers through a three-step process, which will ultimately equate to a rate reduction of up to 4%. I'll refer you to slide 21 in the appendix of our presentation for additional detail. And as noted in the past, every 1% reduction in customer rates equates to $400 million of incremental capital investment capacity.","The benefits of our cost reduction efforts and financial discipline over the years are illustrated on the right hand side of the slide. As you'll note, residential electric and gas bills have declined relative to inflation over the past five years, despite the fact that we have invested approximately $8.5 billion in aggregate into those systems over that period. And we expect that trend of maintaining customer bills, at or below inflation while continuing to make substantial investments into the system to continue for the foreseeable future.","Our capital investment program and self-funding strategy is complemented by an investment grade balance sheet, which is underpinned by solid cash flow generation and a conservative financing strategy. Our financial discipline has led to strong credit metrics in numerous ratings upgrades over the years as highlighted on slide 15.","This prudent balance sheet management had enabled us to absorb the effects of tax reform, while extending our capital plan without issuing substantial amounts of equity.","As a reminder, our FFO to debt ratio is projected to be approximately 18% by year-end, which includes the effects of federal tax reform and is in line with our targeted range.","On slide 16, we've provided the sensitivities to our plan for your modeling assumptions. As you'll note, upon receipt of the Electric Rate Case order in March, with no further electric order scheduled in 2018, we have struck that sensitivity for the balance of the year. So, suffice it to say with reasonable planning assumptions and robust risk mitigation, the probability of large variances from our plan are minimized. So we feel quite good about our ability to meet our financial targets this year.","Slide 17 summarizes the low risk nature of our business mix, with significant utility earnings contribution coupled with largely contracted non-utility growth and prudent financial planning, we believe our historical success can be perpetuated in the long-term with no big bets.","And with that, I would like to thank you again on behalf of CMS for joining us this morning, and I'll hand it back to Patti for some closing remarks.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Thanks, Rejji. With our unique self-funding model enhanced by the Consumers Energy Way and tax reform, a constructive regulatory statute, a large and aging system in need of capital investments and a healthy balance sheet to fund our plan cost effectively, we believe our financial performance is sustainable over the long-term.","With that, Francesca please open the lines for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you all. Good morning. Congratulations on the results.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Good morning Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. So perhaps just first quick question here, with some preliminary guidance out of IRS on interest deductibility, how are you thinking about your relationship with EnerBank ultimately, I'll leave it broad here?","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Well, I'll just start with \u2013 as we've always said, EnerBank is a small part of the big picture. It certainly provides a nice buffer in light of tax reform. Given that, however, we still think that in the long run EnerBank might have more value to someone else. And so we'll keep our eyes open, but while it's still in the family, we're going to definitely leverage it for its full potential, but again it's a small part of the total picture. But Rejji might want to touch on some of the tax benefits of EnerBank more specifically.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah, I'd echo that Julien. I mean we have said for some time clearly it's a non-core business, but historically it has not provided any sort of drag on the consolidated return on equity of the business nor has it offered up a drag with respect to growth, and the business has been largely self-sufficient for some time now, and so we haven't equitize it for a while.","So provided it continues to do that, we view it as a nice contributor to the total pie. And as mentioned in the context of tax reform, it does provide a shield, and we still believe that it does in light of the new bill. And so, we'll keep an eye on the IRS guidance, but at the end of the day we're fiduciaries, and at the right valuation we're certainly obligated to take a look at it as a potential disposition. But for now, we'll continue to leave it chugging along, and we'll continue to enjoy the tax shield that it creates.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent. Just moving on to the latest MISO auction, if I'm reading between the lines a little bit, it seems like you're saying for DIG on 2018 guidance below $3 versus kind of roughly $3 before, I mean is that kind of an appropriate sort of teasing a part of your updated guidance here?","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah, I think that's fair, Julien. So, we have \u2013 as mentioned on the Q4 call, we had over 400 megawatts of capacity held up, effectively in escrow as part of the Palisades transaction, because one of the I'll say interim or short-term buyer replacement plans as a part of that transaction was to sell a capacity to the utility.","And so while that 400 or so megawatts was held in abeyance, we missed a pretty good opportunity to sell down that capacities we often like to do in advance. And so we were left with a significant amount of open capacity in 2018. The economic impact is de minimis, and we were able to offload a good portion of that in the auction. But obviously at $0.30 a kilowatt month which is where the auction ended up, that wasn't in line with our plan. So there was a little bit of downside associated with that, but again the impact on 2018 is de minimis.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","And I'll just add that we had made some upgrades at the plant at DIG, and that has turned out to be a nice offset. We're actually getting a couple additional megawatts that's above plan, and so that's been a nice offset. So all-in-all, enterprise is in line with plan for the year.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah, and the other point I would add is that, obviously given its unregulated status, the tax savings associated with federal tax reform, they get to keep on that side of the business.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right. But ultimately, you wouldn't necessarily say that it's \u2013 that bilateral pricing has come off, meaningfully as we kind of think beyond 2018 here?","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","No, I don't think the market has softened all that much, and in fact, we've said in the past, the context of the state reliability mechanism process and the charge that was established by the commission last year, I think we'll get visibility probably in the next few months as to whether or not there'll be a local clearing requirement beyond 2021. And so, that to me should materially tighten the bilateral market in which case there could be significant opportunities in the capacity side for DIG.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent. And then, lastly the \u2013 basically the cost savings year-to-date, I think it's like $0.06 to $0.02, it's basically to say that you've got some room in the plan to hit the numbers, basically is that kind of a fair way to describe that, as you think about that waterfall through the year?","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah. That's right. I mean that last column or that last component of the chart has always effectively been the plug. And if you look at the opportunities we have within our plan, if you look at some of the activities that we've moved forward on in Q4, some of the reinvestment opportunities, the bond tender, those what I'll call discretionary activities, needless to say, we don't need to move forward on those this year, so we feel like we have a lot of optionality going into the last three quarters of the year.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Well, thank you all.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Thank you, Julien.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Thanks, Julien.","Operator","Next question is from Michael Weinstein of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, good morning, guys.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Good morning, Michael.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Good morning, Michael.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, can you discuss how the state reliability mechanism is kicking in at this point, and what impact that might have or it might be having already on collection of revenues for future capacity?","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","So, right now, we had to declare what our ability to serve our own load was, which we did back in December of 2016, and then in February, the AESs had indicate their ability to serve, and at this time it looks like they are able to serve their load, and so the state reliability mechanism is fulfilled. Sorry, we \u2013 in 2017 we declared our ability to serve our load.","But, bottom line the AESs have demonstrated that they can serve their load and we have a capacity charge then that is assigned to customers, only in the event that they cannot. And so that's not yet materialized. But we expect that given the local clearing requirements that will be established later this year, that will be what forces, I think, more transparency about local load being provided to serve AES customers.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","And Michael, this is Rejji, just to be clear here, I think you may have described it as a revenue opportunity, if I heard you correctly. Needless to say, in the event you do have a situation in which these alternative electric suppliers and the choice customers that they have do not demonstrate that they have the requisite capacity going forward, and they are in fact levied a charge that they would pay back to us, that would go directly to customers. So that's really \u2013 we don't view it as an upside opportunity from the utility per se, but obviously it's a cost savings related opportunity which can create headroom.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah, we think of it as more accurately reflecting cost of service, and cost allocation, if you will, to the appropriate parties who are utilizing the energy should be paying for it. And so, it's a cost savings for customers. But as Rejji articulated, it's not a definitely revenue upside if you will.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","I see, sothose revenues really are just \u2013 it's the pressure on the customers to go ahead and do something about choosing some kind of capacity requirement, right -or capacity contract?","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Correct.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Not really \u2013 yeah. And just one last question. Just to clarify on EnerBank, you're still offsetting the parent interest expense, right, with the interest income there. Are you saying that might not be necessary, and that's why it's being considered for a possible disposition at this point?","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","No, no. There's certainly value that we ascribe to that tax shield, but we're just saying as a non-core asset, and as fiduciaries if there is a third-party that has an interest in buying the property we would have to evaluate it. And so we believe that that tax shield is certainly of a great value and it does provide a nice shield to the interest expense to the parent. But as a fiduciary, if somebody comes along with the right price, we have to have a discussion.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","So, it's probably fair to say that its value did increase given its role that it plays for the company. And so, certainly, we'll leverage that until there's a better offer.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Very good. It's fair to say that you're getting inbound calls from it or \u2013 at this point?","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","We don't discuss M&A opportunities.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got you. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Good morning, guys.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Good morning, Shar.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Hey Shar.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Could we just real quick touch on stakeholder feedback so far that you're getting around the five-year distribution plan. How's dialog going? But really more importantly, could we touch on the timing and scope for a rider or tracker request?","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Sure. A couple of things, first of all on stakeholder engagement we've had I would say a great amount of discussions, and it's been really good for us to have conversations with key environmental interveners, customer groups, customer types, as well as policymakers on both our distribution and our Integrated Resource Plan, that involvement from stakeholders, I think goes a long way to having positive outcomes of regulatory filings.","Now, keep in mind that distribution plan, actually doesn't result in any kind of order if you will accepting the plan, it just creates transparency to the plan. And so the stakeholder involvement, I think just bodes well to say that we have thought of everything, and we're considering all the appropriate alternatives for our investments in the distribution system as well as the IRP. And the IRP, we're excited to publish that, we'll publish that in June. It will provide a great integrated look between the electric distribution and the supply plan.","And so we look forward to getting those documents public, and that will them provide an opportunity \u2013 a window into really what the capital plan is more specifically on the distribution side.","One other clarification on the IRP itself, it's going to be a 20-year look, but the first three years of it are really what provides some of the economic certainty for investments in the first three years of the IRP.","So, it's obviously been a busy regulatory season for our regulators, and their staff, a nod to them all the hard work they've been doing to implement the 2016 Energy Law. It's been a heavy lift, but I think what we're putting in place then provides the framework for potentially tracking mechanisms, because you've got multiple years of look of an investment strategy. But, even without tracking mechanisms, I think it provides some more visibility and alignment around the infrastructure investment upgrades required in Michigan.","I'll just add one last thought here that the amount of investment magnitude is driven by our aging system. And so, as we've reiterated multiple times, it's not a shortage of investments, it's just deciding the best investments. So, these proceedings really do provide an opportunity to align and have more regulatory certainty going into the filings.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Got it. And is there any specific timing we should think about as far as a tracker request? What would be the right (29:53)?","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Those were always hard \u2013 yeah, it will be part of any of our rate case filings. So, we have one tracking mechanism in our gas system right now for Enhanced Infrastructure Replacement Program, that's our mains and our service lines, we're looking at increasing that, we've got a current Gas Rate Case, it's under review right now, that expands it even further. We received an expansion of that tracking mechanism in our last order. So, we think we're developing a good track record of doing what we say we're going to do, and that's important when establishing a pattern for approval for these tracking mechanisms.","So, in a gas case, we'd look for additional components to be included in that specific tracking mechanism or a parallel one for example on vintage services. And then, on the electric system, we would expect in our Electric Rate Case to file for a tracking mechanism that would align for example with that five-year electric distribution plan, and that would be resolved through a final order on that rate case.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay, perfect answer. And then...","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","So, we plan to file that rate case in second quarter. So, that's a 10 months from the filing date.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay, perfect. And then just one last question. Just thinking more long term on the back end of your 10-year plan, and potential upside around capital programs in the IRP and replacing above market PPAs. How should we sort of think about more specifically around renewables, mainly are you seeing sort of a same strong wind economics is one of your Michigan peers. And is there any sort of opportunities pull forward more of that spend, maybe because of incremental customer demand for it?","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah, you bet. In fact, we've already done some of that. We actually have the green renewable tariff approved and fully subscribed for our largest customers to have access to additional renewables, our Cross Winds, wind park, one of our expansions was dedicated to that tariff and serving load beyond our renewable portfolio standard.","We are obviously also working to achieve the 15% renewable portfolio standard that was part of the 2016 Energy Law, and that will be about 500 additional megawatts, we have about $700 million in our plan to achieve that additional renewables. And then any of the incremental renewables either to fulfill our IRP or to serve additional C&I, specifically the industrial customers who have renewable energy targets, will be incremental to that.","And so, again our IRP that we're going to file in June will be very reflective of what we see as that plan going forward, and renewable energy plays a very, very important part of our future.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","And Shar, this is Rejji, just to provide some additional context around the magnitude of the potential, I'd say a supply replacement opportunity, we have \u2013 as we've highlighted about 4 gigawatts of power coming offline over the next two decades. So, if you look at the 2040 you've got Palisades, in the next decade, you got MCV, those two alone are 2 gigawatts...","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Correct.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","...if you look at. The coal units, that's another 2 gigawatts up to 2040, and so as we rolled out our Clean Energy Breakthrough Goal, we did highlight that if you did backfill a good portion of that energy and capacity with renewable, it could be up to about 40% of our fleet over time.","And so, you think about the magnitude and size of that potential opportunity, it really is quite robust, and we're seeing \u2013 continue to see attractive capacity factors, we talked about the opportunities we've got in the context of RFP, and we're seeing capacity factors in the high-30s, which implies kind of mid-40s on a megawatt hour basis. And so we think Michigan and renewable opportunities here will continue to be competitive, and we think the cost curve will continue to trend in the right way.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah, particularly as we look at the 10-year, 15-year plan, solar will play an increasing role, because we expect prices to continue to drop for solar just as technology advances plus its capacity factor at peak is like 50%. And so we can play a really important role in planning for capacity for the future. So, again our IRP, I think will be very reflective of the plan, and so we look forward to making that public in June.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Terrific, guys. That's all I had. Congrats on the results.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Thanks, Shar.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Thanks, Shar.","Operator","The next question comes from Praful Mehta of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks so much. Hi guys.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Good morning, Praful.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Hey, good morning.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning. So just staying on the EnerBank theme for a minute. You've talked about non-core asset, but wanted to understand, if there is an opportunity to sell, is there a tax bases or tax leakage that you see on this kind of transaction, would this be like a cash sale. And if it were a cash sale, what kind of tax leakage do you see in such a transaction?","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","It's just a function as I see it, Praful, as the timing of a transaction, so we've owned the business for some time. So you can assume that basis is low. But remember, we're not scheduled to be a federal tax payer until the early 2020s. And so in the event it was a \u2013 it were a sale \u2013 if a sale or disposition were to take place in the near-term, you can assume you get a deferral on that gain for a few years, if there is \u2013 if it's to take place, say five, six years from now, you can assume there will be economic leakage.","But needless to say, we would take all of that into account in the context of a potential transaction. And I don't want to set expectations too much. I mean, we're going to be thoughtful about this, the business contributes quite a bit, and obviously it has an enhanced strategic value in the context of tax reform. And so, we would take all of that into account if any inbounds were to occur, and again we won't talk about whether there are any M&A opportunities in play.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Fair enough. That's helpful. And then slide 17 is full too. Just wanted to understand on that, the parent growth rate where you have plus to minus 1%, I guess. Just wanted to understand what are the factors that could drive it both upwards and downwards from the midpoint?","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah, so embedded in that, I'll call it just corporate bucket, you have EnerBank within that. And so EnerBank is a component of that, you've got interest expense at the parent, which is non-recoverable. And so in the event you get economic refinancing opportunities, that could drive some potential upside there. And so it's a combination of EnerBank, interest expense, savings, those are really the core drivers as I see it.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Thanks. And then finally just, I know, you didn't want to talk M&A, but just broader corporate M&A. I don't know if you want to touch on that, given your strong financial position right now; is there more activity you see in terms of conversations around broad corporate M&A, and how would you see yourselves both as buyers and sellers right now?","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","You know our plan has so much organic potential, we really are not looking at M&A as a necessary part of our planning. We feel great about our plan. And if somebody \u2013 again as fiduciaries if a great offer came to us, it would have to be a great offer, because our plan is solid, and we feel good about the direction that we're taking. So certainly not on the front page of any of our planning is \u2013 M&A does not play a front page role of any of our planning.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","And Praful, this is Rejji. Just to circle back to your prior question about opportunities or the key drivers within the sort of corporate bucket, I would be remiss, particularly if I spend a lot of time with our head of tax to not mention the good work we've done on the tax planning side over the years, and so that also is a key driver of the corporate business. So, I would say tax planning, interest expense as well as the EnerBank contribution, those are all material drivers of the performance of that segment.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","All right. Great. Thanks, guys. All super helpful. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Travis Miller of Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Travis Miller - Morningstar","Good morning. Thank you.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Hey, morning, Travis.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Travis Miller - Morningstar","Hi. Just a quick clarification. On that cost savings at $0.07, was that more pull forward or was that more overachieving or \u2013 and achieving in line? Just clarify that cost savings number relative to the rest of the year?","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah, I would say a small portion of it it's a pull-forward. So, we did a bond or a partial bond take out in Q4 of last year. We had some 8.75% senior notes, where it's a $300 million tranche, we took out two-thirds of it, and so that led to some savings. Obviously, you could do a little better than 8.75% in this market. So that was a small source of savings.","The biggest component of it that was relative or was related I should say to benefits related savings, and that was due to changes we made in both our OPEB and pension plans which led to real cash and significant pension-related savings that we were delighted to pass onto the customers in our pending gas case, and so that's really the primary source. It's a combination of benefits and interest expense savings.","Travis Miller - Morningstar","Okay. And those were part of your plan?","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","So, they were not embedded in the plan at least in terms of the interest expense savings, so that created some upside. And then the pension, I would say, yeah, largely that was accounted for. So, don't believe that that's going to be a significant tailwind for what we deliver at the end of the year, if that's what you're thinking.","Travis Miller - Morningstar","Okay. Okay.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","And keep in mind our model is all about deploying cost savings, finding them, implementing them, achieving them, and then redeploying operating and maintenance dollars back into the business to prepare for next year. So, when we are doing planning, we are looking at execution this year for sure, but we're also looking about execution in 2019, and building a plan and reinvesting those O&M dollars back into the business for the benefit of more predictable outcomes at the end of this year and next year, which is what really is our strength, our ability to flex throughout a year, put to work those cost savings to the benefits of \u2013 to the benefit of customers and investors. That's what makes us so predictable year after year after year after year.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","And Travis, sorry just to clarify, so both the interest expense savings as well as the benefit savings were embedded in our 2018 plan, but I was thinking about in the context of relative to the comp of Q1 of 2017, they create positive variance, because they weren't in [Technical Difficulty] (41:01) 2017. So, I just want to be perfectly clear about that.","Travis Miller - Morningstar","Okay. Okay. Great. And then on longer term where does energy storage play a role? Either in what we'll see in IRP or just in your plan already?","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah, I think you'll see energy storage also as a part of our IRP. We've been doing work to learn more. We've got some demonstration pilots, we had an opportunity to visit with Tesla and Stamm (41:27) out in California on a benchmarking and learning trip, if you will. We see the opportunity for storage to fit into the plan nicely.","Now, it's not economic today, but we think that those cost curves will continue to occur, and we think there are places both on the grid side and in residential applications for storage to play an important piece in maximizing the dispatchability of renewables, as well as providing more control and options on the grid.","So, we're excited about that technology. But like all things, we're not making any big bets, we're not going long in new untested technology, we'll do our homework and apply it appropriately.","Travis Miller - Morningstar","Okay, great. Thanks so much.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Good morning, Paul.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Hey, good morning, Paul.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning. Slide 10 on the waterfall, just the first quarter negative $0.07, one of the drivers there is cited as economy, can you just touch on that?","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah, sure. It's interesting. On the surface, if you look at the supporting slides or pages that we provide publicly, you'll see across electric we saw a little bit of softness, at least in the data around residential, commercial and industrial sales trends. And so just to give some specifics on that, residential was down between 1% to 1.5%; commercial down 1% to 1.5% and this is on a weather-normalized basis and net of energy efficiency, and then industrial was down about 3%.","And so all of that was, again, on the surface a bit surprising, because we still see very good economic conditions within the state, particularly in the heart of our service territory. So, we're probing that. But I think over time, if you look back at our history, if past is prologue, we never get too excited good or bad about Q1, because it certainly is not indicative of the full year.","So, just to go back to recent memory last year, in Q1 of 2017, we started out of the gate at about 1% to 1.5% up, we ended the year just under 0.5%. In 2016, we started the year out flat, and then ended up at about 0.5%. And so, Q1 does not a year make, but I'll also just point you to the EPS curve that we've highlighted in the past, it just shows the inherent variability in the business. And so, we never rely upon one driver to help us deliver our financial performance. And so, sales is a sort of one small component of the self-funding strategy. And we usually overachieve on the cost side, as well as some of the other drivers or levers to manage the work and make sure we deliver.","The only other thing I'd mention again, because it's to me a little surprising, we did really peel the onion on just these data points I highlighted around commercial, residential, and industrial performance, and cycle billed sales in our service territory for the quarter were actually up quite a bit. And so, I'll just quote for you a couple of sectors that we dug into. As you know our service territory is pretty well-diversified. And so, we saw chemicals up 6%, fabricated metal products up 2%, we saw also transportation equipment up 5%, and then food manufacturing up 13%, and this is Q1 of 2018 versus Q1 of 2017.","We have again many sectors within our service territory, but I'm not cherry-picking here, those are the most energy-intensive sectors within our service territory. And so, we actually think that suggests that there's actually a pretty good underlying economic story within our service territory. And the last two, transportation equipment as well as food manufacturing are actually pretty good leading indicators, because that suggests both for transportation equipment that the industrial side of the state is doing pretty well. And then with respect to food manufacturing, that usually suggests that commercial, retail activity, diners, restaurants, grocery stores are all still humming along. And so, again, I don't think it really tells the full story, but that's the data that we have at the moment.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","As I recall \u2013 I mean you had an extremely mild quarter last year and you showed outsized strength on the economy. Is this just the weather norm model breaking down on extremes?","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah, so that's an imperfect science, as you know, and so given that it was an incredibly mild winter from a weather perspective in Q1 of 2017, I also \u2013 we're going to have to dig in a bit more into that Q1 2017 comp, because I do think the weather normalization trends may also be leading to a little bit of the vagaries in the math we're seeing right now, because I do not believe that the statistics that I read off around residential, commercial and industrial performance in Q1 are indicative of what we're seeing again economically in the state.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And then, obviously Governor Snyder is termed out, any candidates out there leaning towards energy as a policy to platform on?","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah, Paul, I don't see them leaning toward energy as a key issue, because of the law that was passed in 2016. I think a lot of \u2013 all of the candidates are aware and were in some cases involved in the passage of that law. And so I think, there's a lot of people who with a strong point of view that it's a good construct, it's a good statute that was passed with bipartisan support. And so to tackle that again it would be a big issue. But I will say all the leading candidates have good track records, and we as you know have always worked with whoever is in office to make sure that we're serving Michigan well. And so no worry be it on the election front.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","The next question is from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. So, I hate to go back to the Bank question, but so is the Bank a big contributor to your operating cash flows? I mean, I understand the earnings impact, but given the tax reform, I would have thought that this is actually a pretty important asset, because it's likely supporting your cash flows now?","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Not a material one. So, we generally get a run rate of about call it $45 million to $50 million pre-tax from that business. And so if you tax effect that, that gives you a pretty good proxy for the cash flow generation. We did $1.7 billion of operating cash flow last year, and the target this year is $1.65 billion. So, it's not a material contributor from an OCF perspective.","And again, it's a self-funding model, and so we're not equitizing that business, we're not getting dividends out of that business. And so, at the end of the day we don't rely on it for any of our liquidity needs.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","And remember it's an industrial loan corporation, so it doesn't have deposits if you will, it's \u2013 it does loans for home improvements.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Changing topics to the renewables, and growing investments in renewables. So, I mean initially to be honest, I thought that if you continue to add especially wind to your systems, then you will run your coal plants or gas plants less, and that will actually help your O&M expenses. But the more we're looking at it, it seems like the cycling of the conventional power assets actually increases O&M expenses, at least initially unless the addition of a wind farm coincides with over time and over coal plant. Is this a fair assessment? And also you know that you've always managed to beat all of your expectations regarding O&M efficiencies, but does it make it more difficult for you to hit your O&M target as you increase your renewable power penetration?","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","I think it's a great question. The coal plants in particular were not designed for cycling. So the things that you observe are true, but there's an interesting asset in our Ludington Pumped Storage, which is basically the fourth largest battery in the world, it's a pump storage that allows for dispatching at peak times. And so it serves as a great complement to our renewable assets. And so that configuration for us combined at consumers are gas plants, really do, I'd say perform very well in concert with renewables, and therefore the O&M expenses associated with the gas plant and the Ludington Pumped Storage plant combined with renewables is actually quite favorable for our operating system.","Now, I will \u2013 I agree that coal is harder to cycle like that which is why we retired a 1 gigawatt of coal, and is good economically and good for the planet. So, that definitely improves our operating expense profile with the transition to more renewables in that way.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Rejji P.

The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy\u2019s website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12:00 PM Eastern Time running through October 31. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy\u2019s website in the Investor Relations section.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Sri Maddipati","Thanks, Rocco. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Patti Poppe, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Patti.","Patti Poppe","Thank you, Sri. And thank you, everyone, for joining us on our third quarter earnings call. This morning I\u2019ll share our financial results and outlook for the first nine months of the year, I\u2019ll introduce our 2020 guidance and review our new 10-year capital plan. Rejji will add more details on our financial results, and of course as always, we\u2019ll close with Q&A.","Through the first nine months of the year, we reported adjusted earnings of $1.81 per share. This keeps us on track to meet our year-end guidance of $2.47 to $2.51 per share with a bias to the midpoint. We\u2019ll continue to manage the work and adapt to changing conditions in the final quarter of this year as we do every year to deliver the results you expect. We\u2019re also introducing our 2020 guidance of $2.53 to $2.68, which is up 6% to 8% from the midpoint of this year\u2019s guidance range. As always, we\u2019ll update this initial guidance on our year-end call from our 2019 actual results.","We continue to reiterate our long-term adjusted EPS and dividend growth of 6% to 8%. I\u2019m excited to introduce our new $25 billion 10-year capital plan. We\u2019ve also revised our five-year plan, which reflects our forecasted capital investments from 2019 to 2023 to introduce to include the addition of approximately $600 million of solar investments over this period as approved in our IRP.","This new 10-year plan is the result of a lot of hard work from our teams to come up with the real operating plans that we can execute, including identifying the investments that will drive the highest value for our customers, in both safety and reliability as well as cost. We\u2019ve identified not only the system needs, but the pacing of the needed engineering, equipment and the personnel to deliver a system that can meet the energy needs of our customers. There is no question that our electric and gas systems need upgrades well beyond normal maintenance, including accelerated electric reliability investments and enhanced infrastructure replacements for gas.","Even though we\u2019re planning to invest $25 billion, we know there are more investment opportunities. We continue to plan conservatively based on customer affordability, the level of workforce will need to complete the work and balance sheet constraints. As we execute our plan, we\u2019ll look to incorporate more of these opportunities over time. The extent cost management allows, you could see some of that upside rolling into the plan and that $25 billion looking something more like $28 billion to $29 billion of total capital investment. That is what you see on the right side of this slide.","These items are additive to the plan depending on future rate case approvals. Our new 10-year capital plan will help us deliver safe and reliable energy to our customers for years to come, and it couldn\u2019t be done without the capital that you all provide. This plan supports our long-term growth objectives and reflects our commitment to deliver for our customers and our investors.","2019 has been a productive and successful year on the regulatory front. The gas rate order demonstrates a high level of alignment with our commission on the amount of investment required to keep our systems safe and reliable. We received over 98% of our requests, which resulted in $6.4 billion of rate base. We plan to file our next gas rate case by the end of this year and our electric rate case in the early part of next year. We\u2019ll expect an order in both cases 10 months following those filings as is required by the 2016 energy law.","And now my favorite slide, the story of the month. Our triple bottom line is being noticed by our customers and the communities we serve. There\u2019s nothing more gratifying than having our customers recognize our efforts by awarding us the number one JD Power Ranking for residential gas in the Midwest. Our increased investments in the safety and reliability of our gas system, the rollout of our automated gas meter reading to improve the accuracy of our bills, and our application of the CE Way to dramatically improve our first time quality and on time delivery of customer requested service, have all contributed to our movement from the fourth quartile to number one in 2019. It\u2019s also worth noting that we have managed to reduce our residential gas bills by over 30% in the five years while making these significant investments.","I was in Battle Creek last week at the Sunrise Rotary Club meeting. And over scrambled eggs and a cup of coffee, I had a chance to chat with the leaders of the Michigan Home Builders Association. They shared with me that they are experiencing the progress our team has made in meeting increasing demand for new services. I\u2019m embarrassed to admit that there was a time just a couple of years ago when we didn\u2019t even measure on time delivery, and when we started we were only on time 9% of the time. Now we are up to 95% on time for our three-hour windows. That\u2019s not lucky. That\u2019s hard work and the application of our CE Way to improve performance that much.","The home builders told me that our timing could not have been better with continuously rising new home service. We\u2019re fueling Michigan\u2019s prosperity with our delivery of hometown service. It was heartwarming to hear from such an important organization that they noticed and we\u2019re thankful for our improvements. We\u2019ve come a long way and yet so far left to go, but we are proud to be on the top of the Midwest ranking for our gas customers. We are still dissatisfied. We know our customers expect great service and we\u2019ll do our part to continually improve their experience.","In addition to our focus on people, we\u2019re equally committed to the second leg of our triple bottom line, the planet. To that end, we are proud to announce today that we\u2019ve established a voluntary net zero methane emissions goal by 2030 for our gas distribution system. To achieve our goal, we\u2019ll continue to accelerate the replacement programs we already have in place, protect our assets with increased damage prevention and apply new technologies to identify and eliminate fugitive methane emissions. With these efforts, we can get an 80% methane reduction and to get to net zero by 2030, we\u2019re planning to use renewable natural gas as part of our total gas supply.","When we make capital investments in our system, we fully demonstrate our triple bottom line. We serve people, our planet and profit. It is the best long-term business philosophy to fulfill our purpose, world-class performance, delivering hometown service. This triple bottom line has served our model well, and allows us to perform consistently regardless of weather conditions, the economy or other external factors. Our track record demonstrates our ability to deliver consistent, premium results year after year after year. And this year, you can expect the same.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rejji.","Rejji Hayes","Thank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. As posted earlier this morning, we reported third quarter net income of $207 million, which translates to $0.73 per share. Our results for the quarter compared favorably to the third quarter of 2018 by $0.14, and as Patti highlighted, keep us on track to meet our financial objectives for the year.","On a year-to-date basis, we have delivered $514 million of adjusted net income, or $1 81 per share. We\u2019re just $0.12 per share lower in our financial results over the same period in 2018. This is largely driven by the absence of the favorable weather we experienced in 2018, and the substantial storm activity we experienced throughout the year. As we\u2019ve been highlighting all year, we planned for back-end loaded 2019, given the timing of our gas rate case and last year\u2019s cost flag among other factors. And we remain on track with our plan to achieve our full year EPS guidance. As always, we\u2019ll continue to plan conservatively and manage the work to meet our operational and financial objectives, as we have done every year for the past several years.","On Slide 10, you could see that most of the negative variance year-over-year has come from last year\u2019s favorable weather rolling off and higher service restoration costs incurred in 2019 attributable to storm. These headwinds have been partially offset by rate relief, net of investments, favorable sales mix, and strong cost performance to achieve your ongoing and planned initiatives such as attrition management, improve productivity via the CE Way and supply chain optimization to name a few.","These anticipated cost control measures have also been supplemented with opportunities, which reflects during the year, such as the deferral of discretionary projects, strong tax planning, timely refinancing in opportunistic assets sales. As always, we adapt to the changing circumstances required and make sure we have adequate levels of risk mitigation in our plan to meet our financial objectives year in-and year-out. As you\u2019ll note, our catchall bar in the middle of the page labeled usage, enterprises, taxes and other, highlights $0.02 per share, of favorable variance versus the comparable period in 2018.","During our second quarter call, this bar should $0.15 per share of negative variance to net $0.17 swing has largely been driven by the affirmation factors, which exemplifies our strengths in managing the business as we match unexpected and at times and uncontrollable headlines with positive option. As we look to the fourth quarter, much of the tailwinds we anticipate in the second half of the year will come to fruition, and we remain confident in our ability to meet our EPS guidance for the year.","Our Q4 glide path assumes that the absence of favorable weather in 2018 would more than offset by the substantial reinvestments or pull ahead, that we made in Q4 2018, which equates to $0.15 of net positive variance in 2019. We also anticipate additional $0.13 for rate relief driven favorability with our gas rate case now in the rearview mirror and some modest growth from a non utility businesses. That said, we\u2019ll take none of this for granted and we\u2019ll approach these last two months of the year with the usual degree of paranoia, by continuing to maintain our cost discipline and flex additional opportunities as needed to deliver the consistent financial results you\u2019ll come to expect.","Slide 11 is a great reminder of how we manage the work and capitalize on flex opportunities during the year to deliver for our customers and investors. We\u2019ve been able to maintain this consistency by being agile and constantly scrubbing our plans for risk and opportunities. In the years, where we have had favor ability, we prioritize reinvestment opportunities in year such as this or you\u2019ve seen suboptimal weather and higher storm costs. We lean on our ability to manage the work and identify and execute on risk mitigation opportunities into year. At times these opportunities can be episodic like some of the savings we have achieved the past on benefits and tax rate items, and this year is really no different.","We\u2019ve been using this slide now for the past several years because it epitomizes what we do here at CMS. We anticipate the volatility, which is represented by the curvy blue line and manage that volatility every year to ensure that you, our investors continue to experience the consistent industry leading financial performance, illustrated by the upward sloping linear green line has been our trademark for over a decade now. In short, we do the worrying so you don\u2019t have to. This is all made possible by self-funding strategy to pick it on Slide 12. Our focus on cost controls, and proactive risk management to fund our capital investments and mitigate in three year volatility, underpin our simple but unique business model enables us to meet our financial objectives every year.","With a robust backlog of capital investments, we can improve the safety and reliability of our electric and gas systems for our customers while driving earnings growth for our investors. And this growth is largely funded through cost cutting, tax planning, economic development, and modest nonutility contribution, all efforts, which meeting sustainable long run. As such, we are confident that we can continue to improve customers experience to capital investments, while meeting our affordability and environmental targets for many years to come.","As we plan for the future. One of the primary constraints of our long-term capital investment plan will be customer portability, and we have taken this into account in the formulation of our new 10 year capital plan. As we\u2019ve highlighted in the past, we have substantial cost reduction opportunities throughout our $5 billion plus cost structure through the expiration of high priced power purchase agreements, the gradual retirement of our full fleet, capital enabled savings as we modernize our electric and gas distribution systems.","And lastly, the CE Way which will serve as the key pillar of our cost reduction strategy over time as we eliminate waste throughout the organization. These efforts will provide a sustainable funding strategy for our five and 10 year capital plans which will keep customer bills low on an absolute basis and relative to other household staples in Michigan as depicted in the chart on the right-hand side of Slide 15. But we don\u2019t limit our efforts to cost reduction initiatives. Economic development, which is another key element of our self-funding strategy, has proven to be quite fruitful in our service territory largely due to the active nature of our plan.","Over the past three years, we\u2019ve seen substantial increases in new load commitments in our electric service territory pressing in 2018 with over a 100 megawatts exceed as indicated in the bar chart on Slide 14. This year we\u2019re targeting another 100 megawatts and are on track to meet this objective. It is also worth noting that our electric service territory is supported by a diverse customer mix as shown on the right hand side of the slide. And you\u2019ll note that the auto industry represents about 2% of our customer rate mix, which we use as a proxy for margin.","Although the strike at GM is top of mind, is worth reminding you that we\u2019re not overly exposed to auto manufacturers or their suppliers in our electric service territory. However, we are watching closely for any spillover effects that can impact our residential and commercial customers. At the moment, we\u2019re not seeing any notable pullback in key economic indicators. In fact, unemployment in Grand Rapids, the heart of our electric service territory remains well below the national average, and we continue to see robust new construction activity in Western Michigan.","We feel the diversity of our service territory is key to minimizing some of the earnings and operating cash flow often associated with weakening economic conditions. Slide 15 highlights the impact of such sensitivities among others on an annual basis, which most have been mitigated in 2019 given our recent gas order, the accelerated execution of our financing plan, any aforementioned risk mitigation activities which you\u2019ve reduced the probability of large variances in our plan. Rest assured, we\u2019ll continue to monitor these sensitivities as we come down the stretch in 2019, we\u2019ll manage the risk accordingly as we do year-in and year-out.","And with that, I\u2019ll pass it back to Patti for some concluding remarks before Q&A.","Patti Poppe","Thanks, Rejji. Our investment thesis is compelling and we\u2019ll serve our customers, our planet, and our investors for years to come. And with that, Rocco, please open the lines for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much, Patti. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Andrew Weisel of Scotia Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Andrew Weisel","Hey, good morning, everybody.","Rejji Hayes","Good morning, Andrew.","Patti Poppe","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Weisel","My first question is, you talked about the future long-term annual growth of 6% to 8%, obviously nothing new there. But is that meant to be apples to apples with the 10-year CapEx plan? In other words, does that mean to go through 2028?","Patti Poppe","We don\u2019t give 10-year guidance. We do that on an annual basis and give you a good window looking forward in the near-term. But the 10-year capital plan certainly supports directionally 6% to 8%. And so that\u2019s really part of what we\u2019re trying to share today, that we\u2019ve got not just kind of a holding number, but an actual plan for capital investments across the system that will \u2013 should lead to our continued performance.","Andrew Weisel","Okay, got it. Next question is in the list of potential sources of upside on Page 5, you don\u2019t include renewables there. Is that more a function of demand forecast and not seeing a need? Or is it related to customer bills and affordability? Or is there some other factor there?","Patti Poppe","Well, it\u2019s in the base plan. So we know based on our IRP what our 20-year renewable strategy is. We know that we\u2019ll own half and purchase half of the new solar 6,000 megawatts in the 20 years, 5,000 megawatts in the 10 years. So that\u2019s built into the base plan.","Rejji Hayes","And Andrew, it\u2019s also worth reminding that as we\u2019ve said in our IRP filing, it\u2019s going to be about 68 gigawatts per estimate of solar over the next sort of decade plus and we\u2019ll own half of that. And so that $4 billion you\u2019re seeing attributable through renewables over the 10-year period is a combination of the wind investments we\u2019re making for the IRPs, as well as the assumption of owning about half of that solar investment opportunity over the next several years.","Andrew Weisel","It makes sense. Then one last one, this is going to be a little bit of a curve ball question. I noticed you posted a slide that called retail outreach a few weeks ago. Can you please talk about what drove that and maybe what you\u2019re trying to accomplish? And then round numbers, what percent of your stock is currently held by retail investors?","Rejji Hayes","Yes. So that was a part of an effort that we did with one of your competitors, Andrew, in the interest of full disclosure. But in essence retail holdings are quite small relative to other utilities. I would say we\u2019re about 90-10 versus about 70 to 30 for the sector, institutional versus retail. And the large reason why that is, is as you may recall quite some time ago we suspended our dividend as we were pulling back from sins of the past. And so that really turned over our ownership to skew much more heavily towards the institutional side. And so over time as the fundamentals of the business have improved, we\u2019ve started to increase our exposure to retail investors and we\u2019ll look to do that more going forward.","Andrew Weisel","Very good. Thank you.","Rejji Hayes","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Constantine Lednev","Hi. Good morning, guys, it\u2019s actually Constantine here for Shar.","Patti Poppe","Hey, Constantine.","Constantine Lednev","Hey, guys, good morning. Congratulations on a great quarter and meeting all the estimates. So one quick question on the legislature. There was a set of bills that powering Michigan forward that was introduced, and that\u2019s kind of looking at kind of redoing I guess some of the things that were outlined in 2016. Just wanted to get your insight on kind of how does that impact your current IRP and potentially kind of any future IRP planning processes?","Patti Poppe","Well, so there\u2019s a couple of good things to know that. Number one, our energy law that we did pass in 2016 was solid, and it created a framework that led to the IRP. The IRP gives three-year forward look for approval. So we have a three-year approval on the elements of the integrated resource plan and our renewable plans in particular. And it was so well received that we think some of these smaller proposals that are part of that package really aren\u2019t necessary because we\u2019ve created this framework for competitive bidding for solar. I think some of the proposals that are on the table are trying to do an end around and they\u2019re not getting much traction.","So the good news is the energy law was \u2013 had a wide bipartisan support, our integrated resource plan had a wide spectrum of supporters from the Sierra Club to our largest business customers. So there\u2019s pretty good alignment with the committee leadership in the house and the Senate that we\u2019ve got \u2013 we\u2019ve done our work on the legislation on renewables and the energy law that was completed in 2016.","Constantine Lednev","Perfect. That definitely helps out. One kind of small housekeeping item, you started presenting kind of the upside and capital case with this presentation. Just curious, kind of how does that contemplate the long-term kind of equity needs for the business? You mentioned the $150 million per year. There\u2019s \u2013 does some of these opportunities kind of give a little bit of variability for the $150 million number?","Rejji Hayes","Yes. So what I would suggest, Constantine, is that, we always provide our estimate for equity needs on a rolling annual basis with the update of our five-year plan in Q1 of every year. And so we\u2019ll provide any revised thinking around that at least over five-year period in Q1 of next year. But I think there are a lot of variables that go into that math and that\u2019s why it\u2019s difficult for us to give you a sort of a direct number at this moment. So think about the timing of one will be a federal tax payer, that\u2019s a big variable. Obviously, regulatory outcomes over time that will dictate the cost of capital, run rate, CapEx, et cetera, and then customer bill affordability and where that is relative to inflation.","So all of those variables will impact our needs from an equity issuance perspective. Like I\u2019d say, direction, my senses will probably be up a little bit, but we\u2019ll see as we continue to flush out our operating plan, our financial plan over the next several years.","Constantine Lednev","Okay, that makes sense. Thanks. I\u2019ll come back in queue.","Rejji Hayes","Thanks.","Patti Poppe","Thanks, Constantine.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Michael Weinstein of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Michael Weinstein","Hi, guys.","Patti Poppe","Good morning.","Michael Weinstein","Good morning. Just following up on the last question. Just noticing on the cash flow Slide 23 that your NOLs are increasing over the five-year period and cash flow is up. Is that because \u2013 the NOLs, are those increasing or the credits increasing because of the, I guess, higher number or higher amount of renewables in the system? Is that what\u2019s driving that?","Rejji Hayes","Hey, Michael, it\u2019s more the latter. So we don\u2019t see a real increase in the NOLs. And in fact, they were \u2013 the NOLs themselves were re-measured upon tax reform going into effect when the bill was enacted in the late 2017. But we do see some accretion in the credits that we have because of the renewable investments we\u2019ve been making, both for the RPS. And over time we may see a little bit more increase in credits as well as we take on solar investments. So there\u2019s more to do with the renewable efforts than any accretion in NOLs.","Michael Weinstein","And does that accrue to the benefit more as a customer or I mean, does this offset equity needs going forward? Just curious.","Rejji Hayes","I would say based on what\u2019s on the page, it\u2019s more the latter, it offsets equity needs. But keep in mind, just based on the way in which we\u2019ve structured the RFPs for the sole investments, we\u2019ll actually see, because we\u2019re doing build and transfers as well as competitively bid out PPAs for the 6 gigawatts over time, we\u2019ll see the benefits of tax credits incorporated into the cost we have to pay for the investments as well as the contracts we\u2019ll take on and that will directly benefit the customers. So you\u2019ll see it benefit for both sort of a cash flow capital raising needs as well as customer benefits.","Michael Weinstein","Okay, great. Thank you.","Rejji Hayes","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Greg Gordon","Hey, thanks. Good morning.","Rejji Hayes","Good morning, Greg.","Patti Poppe","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon","So \u2013 if my memory serves me correctly, the integrated resource plan, the $25 billion in capital, there\u2019s no capital in there for any additional fossil fuel generation, correct?","Patti Poppe","Correct.","Greg Gordon","So, on the margin, all your investment in power generation will be renewables. And as I also recall, I think I asked you this on the last quarterly call, battery storage is not a significant portion of that because you have such a big position in Ludington.","Patti Poppe","Yes. A couple of things, in the future plan, we will obviously be maintaining our current fossil plan. So we\u2019ll still have gas plants. Our two gas plants will still be on the system up through 2040. They don\u2019t have ongoing capital maintenance plans. Campbell 3 will be in operation until 2039 and that has obvious ongoing capital plan. So there\u2019s capital associated with fossil, just no new fossil generation plants as we described.","The other point on battery storage, Greg, I think it\u2019s really interesting our first IRP that we filed had 450 megawatts of storage in the latter part of the plan. But as we\u2019re preparing to file again as we\u2019ll re-file our IRP every three to five years, we\u2019re filing again here in 2021, we\u2019ll file another IRP, we\u2019re seeing that storage prices are dropping enough that we\u2019ll probably see more storage and the mix in our next IRP, which I think is exciting.","When you combine the amount of solar and wind that we\u2019ll have on our system, it\u2019s going to be very beneficial to have cost-effective solar both from people talk about storage as a means of dispatching those renewables, but think about all those distributed solar panels. They\u2019re going to need voltage control, and so we\u2019re going to need storage associated with those just specifically for grid stability and reliability, not just for dispatchability. So I do see that more and more storage will be part of our plan, especially as our price drops. And that\u2019s all captured, those additional storage dollars will be captured in the electric ops portion of the CapEx plan.","Greg Gordon","Fantastic. When you look at the amount of money that you plan on spending in the gas utility, when you think about the migration away from fossil fuels, I mean, are we seeing \u2013 it\u2019s sort of \u2013 there\u2019s some dissonance a little bit, right? I mean, you\u2019re seeing cities like Los Angeles and other cities out in Los \u2013 in California has started to move to actually try to eliminate incremental use of natural gas for any type of infrastructure. So as you look at your 10-year plan and you talked to the policy makers in Michigan, are you \u2013 is there a potential for a similar trend in gas infrastructure over time?","Patti Poppe","Well, I would say this. Natural gas has been a big part of Michigan\u2019s heating seasons. I think these \u2013 a lot of the cities that you\u2019re seeing with moratoriums on natural gas don\u2019t have natural gas penetration for home heating and water heating like Michigan does. And so given that when we\u2019re looking at the cost comparison for electrifying all the home heating needs, the cost to customers would be significant. And so, given that cost impact, we don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be a big market push or demand from customers to make that switch to electrification. So in our gas planning, we assume that our \u2013 we have modest assumptions about growth, we have more assumptions just about replacing like for like systems, making sure our systems are safe, making sure that that aging infrastructure can deliver the volume of natural gas that we move today on the coldest winter day. So that\u2019s really how we see the role of natural gas.","I will also say though that to your point about the pressure from environmental community in general on gas, it is in what\u2019s in the spirit of our methane net zero plan for 2030 and why we were excited to announce that today. We can see the use of RNG in the natural gas system to minimize the kind of emissions and help to mitigate the environmental pressures. Our triple bottom line doesn\u2019t just apply to the electric side of the business. It applies to the gas part of the business too.","Greg Gordon","Thanks, Patti. Have a great day.","Patti Poppe","Yes, thanks, Greg.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, good morning, team.","Rejji Hayes","Good morning.","Patti Poppe","Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, howdy. So perhaps just to go back, if I can rehash a little bit of the 5-year versus 10-year update here, seems like the five-year piece is pretty hit there with the renewable piece. The three quarters is equal to the $600 million in the RFP. Just not to be pedantic about it, but it seems like it\u2019s the same. And then separately, can you give us a little bit more about the 25 to the 29 delta that you talk about in the upside opportunities? What would drive those if you \u2013 if that might be the best way to ask it?","Patti Poppe","Yes. So first on your first question\u2026","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","What are those?","Patti Poppe","Yes. The five-year plan is exactly as you\u2019ve described, the incremental capital is for the renewables associated with the IRP, which we had indicated we would add when we had approval. And then \u2013 and the 10-year plan, those upsides, we\u2019ve said it over and over again, there\u2019s so much work to be done on this system. We are trying to make sure that all factors are considered before we build out that capital plan. And that\u2019s what, I mean, I think some people, you could argue it\u2019s easy to throw a number out on a 10-year capital plan. I want you to understand that our capital plan that we are presenting today is a real plan. We actually have a 10-year gas plan drawn up that shows the needs for the system and what year we would do what. And so the basis for this capital plan effect is affected by our ability to complete the work, our balance sheet capacity and customer affordability. That 10-year plan, the $25 billion as described affects customers\u2019 bills by about 2.2% over per year.","We\u2019re going to be looking for additional improvements and when we find additional headroom that can fund additional capital debts, what will be the trigger to add these additional capital investments. But all three of those factors matter a lot. And so we\u2019re always optimizing around them. Does that help? Is that what you\u2019re asking?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Yes. Well, maybe if I can push a little bit further, I suppose the electric reliability or gas description, is that triggered by, maybe to go back to Greg\u2019s question a little bit more, is that triggered by a customer side of the equation or is it just generally, again, the ability to have a customer headroom that continue to push forward on just broadly upgrading the company?","Patti Poppe","I\u2019d say headroom is our biggest constraint, customer affordability, of course, balance sheet and ability to fund that plan is important to us too. We \u2013 look, the needs of the system far exceed our customer\u2019s ability to pay. And so we are constantly looking for ways that we can do more for less. So we apply the CE Way to our capital work as well as our O&M work and try and get lower our unit costs or more volume of work can be done. We\u2019re also looking obviously at workforce constraints and making sure that we\u2019ve got adequate people plans to do all this work. So there\u2019s a variety of factors that that mitigate adding in the additional capital, but trust me, the needs of the system demands those dollars and so we\u2019re constantly working for ways to get those included in the plan. Fortunately, we have time window to get that done.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Yes, indeed. All right, good luck. See you soon.","Patti Poppe","Thanks, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And our next question today comes from Stephen Byrne of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Stephen Byrne","Good morning, and congrats on the JD Power results.","Patti Poppe","Thanks, Stephen.","Rejji Hayes","Thanks, Stephen.","Stephen Byrne","Most of my questions have been addressed. I just wanted to go back to the upside opportunities that you\u2019ve laid out on Slide 5. In terms of just regulatory construct or other dynamics, I just want to make sure I\u2019m not missing anything incremental or sort of different that you would need from a regulatory perspective. In your remarks, Patti, you mentioned, it\u2019s really just dependent on rate case approvals, but was there anything else in terms of from a regulatory or design point of view, from a regulatory point of view that you would \u2013 that you would need to achieve?","Patti Poppe","No, I mean, I think we have to remain aligned with our commission and the staff. They have a job to do. Their job is to make sure that we are prudently investing in the system to provide the service that customers expect. Now, hopefully it helps them do their job when we are \u2013 when our customers are satisfied with our performance as indicated in the JD Power results. We\u2019ve got the lowest complaints to the Public Service Commission ever. As a result of many of the improvements we made on the system. We try and make it easy for the Commission to say yes, but they really have \u2013 they\u2019re important check and balance in the process to make sure that the dollars that we are investing in this system are invested prudently and that they are in the best interest of customers.","And I think in our most recent gas case, we got a good indicator from the Commission that they agree with our plan. They agree with the amount of infrastructure that we\u2019re putting on the system and they agree the importance of keeping certainly our gas systems safe and reliable and our electric system to be modernized and reducing our carbon emissions and increasing reliability for customers every day. So it is a partnership with the Commission to make sure that we\u2019re doing everything we can do in these capital investments. And so that takes annual rate proceedings as we file and we get a routine feedback from the commission about our plans.","Rejji Hayes","So Steven, the one thing I would add is that, needless to say, we plan conservatively and so we presuppose the existing rate construct. But needless to say, if we could get more traction on tractors, investment recovery mechanisms and vehicles like that. It could certainly increase the likelihood that we could take on more of these upside opportunities. So clearly we\u2019ll continue that dialogue with the commission and staff over time.","Stephen Byrne","That all makes sense. And then just shifting over to renewables, we discussed the IRP and just generally a plan. I want it to just drill in a little bit more on regulatory approval to rate base half of the investments. Could you just remind us sort of where we stand from a regulatory approval process in terms of just solidifying that capability over many years to come?","Patti Poppe","Yes. So again, we \u2013 the IRP has a three year forward-looking formal approval, but the settlement that we had signed with all those parties that the commission approved really gave a good indication of the construct for making determinations for new additional capacity, specifically renewables. So the 50-50 ownership construct was agreed to buy a wide group of parties, which to me gives indication that will likely continue over time. However, as we file the each IRP, obviously there\u2019ll be discussion about extending that framework. What our fundamental belief is, that having competitively bid solar on an annual RFP, we set the lowest cost possible for our customers for new renewables.","That creates, in some cases where the ownership lies with someone else. And we earn our financial compensation mechanism on top of that PPA. We still then create headroom for investments in the distribution system, which I believe in the long run is where our greatest demand for capital is going to be. Modernizing our electric distribution system is going to be the cause of the next decade. Both just replacing poles and conductor to new resiliency standards, but also modernizing and making that grid so much smarter to handle distributed resources and demand management tools. So I would suggest that the construct is in place so will be re-reviewed. Obviously every time we do a new IRP filing.","Stephen Byrne","That makes sense. Thanks so much.","Rejji Hayes","Yes. You\u2019re welcome. Thanks, Stephen. See you soon.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Travis Miller of Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Travis Miller","Good morning. Thank you.","Rejji Hayes","Good morning, Travis.","Patti Poppe","Good morning, Travis.","Travis Miller","Wondering just real quick on the 2020 EPS. It looks like you\u2019ve got a lot of the regulatory uncertainty locked in or at least not there anymore for the year. What are some of the sensitivities there? Is it weather and O&M typical like that? Or is there something else in the regulatory wise?","Rejji Hayes","Yes, I would say it was a fairly straightforward glide path for 2020 EPS, Travis. I think you highlighted the key driver, which will be rate relief, net of investments. And so if you think about the gas rate order we just received, about two-thirds of that will flow into 2020. And so if you just think about the math to that, there\u2019s about a $100 million of revenue increase that flows into 2020, and the tax effect that and we\u2019ve been doing all that puts and takes on investment-related cost. You ended with about net $0.14 or so, and that basically gets your right to the low end of guidance for next year. And so then you and puts and takes, we always assume normal weather and there will be variability we can count on that, good or bad and so we\u2019ll see where we\u2019ll end up. But I think that coupled with the usual contribution of the nonutility businesses should lead us to get to our 2020 EPS guidance range, without a lot of, I\u2019ll say additional items that are unforeseen.","Travis Miller","Okay, great. Yes. And then question on that Slide 20, where you have the five-year CapEx line, that new renewables line, that\u2019s just incremental, right? So there\u2019s still some renewables in the electric utility spending. Is that the correct way to read that?","Rejji Hayes","No. So that line item, new renewables, that\u2019s a combination of the renewable spend to get to the 15% RPS by 2021. So you\u2019ve got the wind investments in there and then it starts to take on in the latter portion of that five -year period, some of the solar related investments to the IRP. So that is all the utility \u2013 that is all the renewable-related spend that the utility in that line item there. Just over this five-year period from 2019 to 2023.","Travis Miller","Okay. Okay. And that stuff would be in the rate base?","Rejji Hayes","Correct.","Travis Miller","Okay. And just real quick on the solar that you guys are talking about, six to eight gigawatts and the potential for growth there, what\u2019s your kind of split there between utility scale and distributed generation. Is that all utility scale or how do you see that potentially evolving between distributed generation or top solar and utility scale?","Patti Poppe","Yes. We think the economics of utility scale are in the best interest of all customers. Now we do have residential programs that are run by the utility. They\u2019re like community solar sorts of programs so if utility scale that a customer can buy a plot if he will. There will be some residential distributed solar that customers want to invest themselves in private power generation. And so we have a program within the state to allow that to happen. But our plan is built around utility scale because we know that\u2019s the best price and most cost effective means of transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy.","Travis Miller","Okay, great.","Rejji Hayes","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Angie Storozynski of Macquari. Please go ahead.","Angie Storozynski","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I really have only one bigger picture question. So do you have any near term plans what to do with the bank and DIG? I mean, Rejji, you mentioned that there could be some slight uptick in your equity needs? Would you look at these assets as a way to maybe fulfill those equity needs?","Patti Poppe","Yes. We have no news on EnerBank. There\u2019s nothing has changed as we\u2019ve said for the last several years. There\u2019s no change for EnerBank. It plays a particular role in our plan and continues to do.","Rejji Hayes","Angie, I would just say for the enterprise because you asked about DIG. We continue to do that business. It\u2019s heavily contracted not just DIG but all the other assets we have there. And it\u2019s a fairly de-risked business. And so we continue to count on it on our five-year plan to give us a pretty steady stream of earnings in cash flow contribution next four or five years so we don\u2019t anticipate any dispositions there either.","Patti Poppe","We\u2019ve done a couple small projects as you may be aware of enterprises for renewables, very customer driven, opportunistic for example, 100 plus megawatt wind farm for General Motors in Ohio. We have often customers come to us and say, can you help me make my renewable targets? And so in those cases, enterprises can play that role as well, both in Michigan and out of Michigan.","Angie Storozynski","Very good. That\u2019s all I have. Thank you.","Rejji Hayes","Great. Thanks, Angie.","Operator","And our next question today comes from David Fishman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","David Fishman","Hi, good morning.","Patti Poppe","Good morning, David.","Rejji Hayes","Hey, David.","David Fishman","Good morning. I just had a quick question on \u2013 just the detail maybe we\u2019ll be getting in the future on the 10-year plan. Back in 2017, at the Investor Day, you kind of outline a little more detail around the gas infrastructure, electric distribution and plan investments. Is that something that we can expect maybe over the next 12-months or so or maybe following a little bit more detail on the gas side once you have the infrastructure investment plan there filed?","Rejji Hayes","Yes. So I would say that, this level of detail which we actually think for a capital investment program, looking at 10 years is quite good. We don\u2019t intend to provide a great deal more granularity. But you can look for is that we will make some regulatory filings, I\u2019ll say in the coming months that do give pretty explicit guidelines around types of investment we\u2019ll make both in our gas business and over time our electric distribution business. And that\u2019s where you\u2019ll get the additional detail.","And so, currently the $25 billion, the split between the utility, electric and gas as well as the renewable investments and then specifics around, again, a 10-year glide path for capital investments for gas. Again, all of that will be provided to our regulators over time through voluntary filings. And so you\u2019ll get more details there, but we don\u2019t intend to provide nearly the same level of granularity on this 10-year program as we have on an annual basis in our five-year programs. And so I think as you look at the updates on an annual basis in our rolling five year plan, you\u2019ll get more color on the outer years of this 10-year plan over time. Does that make sense, David?","David Fishman","Yes, that does make sense. Thanks, Rejji. And I think earlier, you\u2019re asking a question or you\u2019re answering a question and you mentioned upside from trackers as one of the potential outcomes there. I know this has been talking about a 2020 outcome, but longer term along with more detailed filings that you\u2019re putting out is the expectation kind of file along with the IRP, there\u2019s opportunities there for incremental trackers?","Rejji Hayes","Yes. We\u2019d like to think that any event we can get more traction on those types of mechanisms that would facilitate our ability to start to take on some more of those upside opportunities because then you really get to minimize the lag between cost and currency and cost recovery. But we\u2019ve clearly demonstrated that, we\u2019re going to make sure that we call before we walk in Michigan in that regard. And so with each filing we\u2019ll look at whether it makes sense to apply those types of mechanisms to various programs and if we think it\u2019s applicable and can get a good alignment with the commission and staff, we\u2019ll look to do more of that over time. But I think it\u2019s going to be a measured pace.","Patti Poppe","Well. I\u2019ll just echo Rejji\u2019s point here, and say that our annual filing standard has worked pretty well for us. It actually allows us to be more adaptive to changing conditions around where our priorities around capital spend like vary from year-to-year. We do have forward-looking tests years, so we get good visibility and approval \u2013 preapproval for the capital that we spend. We do also benefit by passing our customers benefit by us being able to pass along annual savings that we realize to them in those annual rate cases.","So we don\u2019t object to the annual rate case methods, but certainly IRMs in long-term plans that the commission has requested in gas and electric, and our IRP does give all of us a better ability to plan, have alignment, have better visibility, long-term work and investment, which is a basis for our 10-year capital plan. And then that allows for us to plan, obviously for the workforce that will complete all of that work. So what\u2019s really important is that we have good alignment with the commission on the work that needs to be done. And then the regulatory mechanisms can work pretty well for us.","David Fishman","Great. Thanks. That makes lot of sense. Congratulations again, and congrats on the JD Power award.","Rejji Hayes","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Praful Mehta of Citi. Please go ahead.","Praful Mehta","Hi guys, thanks so much.","Rejji Hayes","Thanks, Praful.","Patti Poppe","Thanks, Praful.","Praful Mehta","Hi. So maybe first from storage. Actually, very interesting you mentioned the storage costs. If you could just give us a little bit more color on how you\u2019ve seen the storage costs come down and where it sits today. And secondly, what is the storage installation coming along with it? It\u2019s coming along with renewables on the utility scale side or DG or both. Some perspective on that will be very helpful?","Patti Poppe","Yes, Praful. A couple of things. We did our IRP and we did the modeling, we modeled battery storage at about a $1,000 a kilowatt, over that by the latter part of the IRP when we would be installing the 450 megawatts. However, I\u2019ll tell you current costs are as high as $2,000 a kilowatt. So that\u2019s still pretty high and out of the market. Now the ITC when storage is combined with solar, that obviously gives you that 30% kicker, which is nice and helps make storage prices lower combined with a solar. And I\u2019ve heard some rumblings in Washington DC that maybe they would do a storage only ITC. I think there\u2019s a lot of interest and appetite.","What I think is, going to be a bigger driver to the cost curves on storage are really the automakers commitment to emission free vehicles and the amount of R&D that is occurring and the dollars, the billions of dollars being spent by the automakers and consortiums and suppliers to them to crack the code on an electric vehicle or fuel cells. I think will bode well and provide benefits then to the electric industry to be able to utilize that storage technology in the R&D that\u2019s happening in that space. So I would expect that those prices will continue to drop. They\u2019re not in the market right now, but we\u2019re doing pilots and projects, so we can learn, so that we can be ready when that technology cost curve really starts to materialize.","Praful Mehta","Got you. That\u2019s super helpful. And is that installation as you planned in the IRP more with the DG, utility-scale or both?","Patti Poppe","Yes, mainly the utility-scale on the grid as a balancing resource. But I would suggest that our next IRP is going to have a different combination and we\u2019re not done with the modeling yet, but early indicators show that we\u2019ll have more distributed batteries as well as utility scale storage to make our renewables more dispatchable.","Praful Mehta","Got you. Thanks. And then Rejji, just from, cash and equity perspective, I know you mentioned that the equity number could move a little bit. I just wanted to clarify what you meant by that $150 million moving a little bit, what\u2019s the final driver and what timeframe are you thinking about for that move?","Rejji Hayes","Yes. If you look at the run rate capital investment we have now over our five-year plan, we\u2019re doing about $2.25 billion. And so that we think again, it can allow us to do that comfortably within our ATM program of about $150 million per year starting in 2020 through this five-year period. Now over time, as you think about the quantum of this 10-year plan, where we could be at a run rate of $2.5 billion, and if we start to dip into those upside opportunities, it could expand on an annual basis. And so it could go up directionally, but it\u2019s difficult to get more precise in that problem, because again, there are a number of factors that dictate your equity needs. And so when will be a federal cash tax payer? And so at the moment, we think 2024, but that could change, because we thought five years ago that would be a federal taxpayer down when we\u2019re not.","And so that\u2019s a big variable, regulatory outcomes is clearly a big variable. And then customer affordability and our trends there relative to inflation. And so all those variables will impact the amount of equity we need to issue per year. And so absent that visibility, it\u2019s tough to say how much more it will go up. But again, we\u2019ll obviously manage the balance sheet prudently as we have over time and we\u2019ll see, where the equity needs end up. But I don\u2019t think materially, you\u2019ll see a big rise in the sort of next couple of years if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking.","Praful Mehta","Yes. That\u2019s exactly what I was going. All right. That\u2019s super helpful. Really appreciate it guys and congrats again. Thanks.","Rejji Hayes","Thanks.","Patti Poppe","Thanks.","Operator","And then our next question from Sophie Karp of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Sophie Karp","Hi, good morning.","Rejji Hayes","Good morning.","Patti Poppe","Good morning.","Sophie Karp","Thank you for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter. So, my first question is you had that really strong quarter and you maintained your guidance, I guess. Is there anything specific that I\u2019m giving you guys some caution maybe in Q4 as it evolves or has it just been conservative?","Patti Poppe","Yes. We feel good about our year-end guidance has indicated bias to the midpoint as we have consistently said. And like every year, every quarter, there are changes that come at us and we \u2013 we pull back the curtain here and share a little bit on these calls about the kinds of things that we\u2019re managing the ups and downs, the goods with the bads, but we are on plan. We feel good about that plan and we ride that roller coaster and we enjoy it. We enjoy riding the roller coaster, so that you don\u2019t have to. We want to deliver that nice green line that Rejji mentioned in his prepared remarks that is our promise and that\u2019s what we continue to work to do every day. And that\u2019s what is so much fun about running this business is that we get to manage all those ups and downs and we feel real good about the plan and where we are for the rest of the year.","Sophie Karp","Great. And then maybe, a bigger picture question. You show on your slides that the customer bills decline and will stay in that maybe relatively flat versus the inflation over the long-term. And I guess if we look back, a lot of that has come from a lower commodity price and then the low interest rates and things like that, right. And so as you move in your fuel mix and your incremental generation is mostly renewables to where that\u2019s no longer going to be the case. How do you expect, I guess is it going to be a challenge to manage its customer bill with this new and evolving generation mix?","Patti Poppe","No. in fact, it\u2019s definitely in line with creating the headroom necessary, the replacement of fuel \u2013 the elimination of fuel expense is a huge benefit. And keep in mind; we\u2019re particularly and uniquely positioned, because of these large PPAs, on which we do not earn. We\u2019re going to be transitioning away from those PPAs, which are out of the market today. So, our customers are paying a high price for them. We\u2019re going to transition to renewable energies with no fuel costs and more competitive pricing on which we earn. And so it\u2019s the best combination for our commitment to the triple bottom line. We\u2019re excited about where the future takes us on all of that. It\u2019s directionally aligned with all of the savings we\u2019ve achieved to date.","Sophie Karp","Thank you.","Patti Poppe","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session.

We have made significant strides to improve safety over the last few years, and I'm proud to say we are now positioned in the first quartile among our peers. 2012 adjusted earnings per share were $1.55, up 7% over the prior year. Tom will provide further details in just a few minutes.","In January, the board approved a 6% dividend increase, the seventh consecutive increase in as many years. The new dividend of $1.02 per share results in a payout ratio of 62%, which is in line with our peers. We expect to continue to grow the dividend with earnings. Overall, 2012 was another strong year for CMS Energy.","For 10 years, CMS has delivered consistent financial performance. Our 7% compounded annual growth rate since 2003 and dividend growth since 2007 have delivered strong returns to our shareholders. Our capital investment plan drives our earnings and cash flow growth. Over the next 5 years, we plan to invest between $6.5 billion to $7 billion, which includes the new gas plant announced last December. We have lowered the high end of our previous range by $300 million from $7.3 billion to $7 billion, helping to keep our customer base rate increases at or below the rate of inflation. And we're still working to reduce it a little bit more.","If you look out another 5 years, we have $8 billion more of needed investment projects to enhance the reliability and safety of our gas and electric infrastructure systems. We are confident in our plan and our ability to execute it.","Last year, during our Investor Day at the New York Stock Exchange, I reported on a number of metrics we track very closely. We call these breakthrough goals, and they start with safety. Our company is committed to working safely every day, whether it's in the office, on the road or getting the light back on. We have seen a 75% reduction in the number of incidents since the goal was set in 2006. Through operational excellence, we deliver value to our customers who want affordable and reliable power. Focusing on reliability has helped us to continue running our generating plants at lower costs and improving our distribution performance.","Over the past few years, aggressive management of costs has enabled us to reduce our O&M and headcount, while improving productivity. We are doing more work with fewer resources. And our employee engagement scores are in the first quartile for the second year in a row.","Finally, the financial results speak for themselves. Our business continues to grow at 5% to 7%, with higher dividends and customer rate increases at or below the rate of inflation.","Our regulatory environment continues to improve, evident by some recent events. In December, the commission approved our DOE settlement, which returned $23 million to customers and $12 million to shareholders. In addition, the commission authorized accelerated recovery of $16 million for gas decoupling over 3 months to meet the deadline for accounting standards. On November 30, Governor Snyder delivered a special message on energy and the environment. The Governor made it clear that changes should not be made to the 2008 energy law until the law is given more time to work in order to allow for a fair evaluation on issues like the renewable energy portfolio standard, energy efficiency and the proper regulatory structure. The Governor called for 2003 to be the year of study on energy policy. The Governor wants to ensure that future energy policy will be made in a thoughtful process based on data developed over the next year or 2. The Governor directed the Chairman of the commission and the Director of Energy -- Director of Energy Office at the Michigan Economic Development Corporation to conduct a series of energy forums to gather the public's opinion on Michigan's energy framework. The commission and the economic development corporation have developed over 80 questions that they are seeking data-driven responses to. The facts will be collected in 2013 and then delivered to the Governor for his review.","Regarding regulatory process changes, we have recommended a few rate adjustment mechanisms in the latest electric and gas rate cases that we believe will be fair and beneficial to our customers and help to streamline the rate-making process, and we'll keep you advised of their success. Our regulatory calendar remains on schedule through this year.","Looking forward, 2014 provides an opportunity to stay out of the rate case process. This would require the approval of the proposed investment recovery mechanisms, which have been included in both the electric and gas rate cases. Our rate cases are heavily weighted with capital investment, requiring us to file regular and routine cases. An enhancement to this process would be the investment recovery mechanism that will allow the commission to review and approve capital expenditures planned subsequent to the test year. The proposed mechanism includes a true-up process to ensure the investments are made or a refund will be issued to customers. If approved as requested, we will increase electric revenue by $82 million and gas revenue by $70 million to cover future capital investments.","By aggressively controlling our cost, we hold down customer rate increases to less than 2%. One of the ways we have been able to do this is by increasing productivity. We have successfully completed 3 voluntary separation programs since the end of 2006, reducing the workforce by 10% over the past 6 years. In the coming years, we expect to continue to reduce O&M through our smart energy program, as well as the mothballing of our small coal-fired generating plants.","As we look to the future, our investment plan will continue to drive transparent, predictable annual earnings per share growth of 5% to 7%. Our investments for the next 5 years are up 40% from the last 5 years and about double what they were 10 years ago. We have grown our dividend payout ratio to a peer average of 62% and plan to continue growing it with earnings. We believe the Michigan economy will continue to grow at a pace slightly better than the rest of the United States. Our plan assumes our annual sales will grow at less than 1% over the next 5 years, and that number includes our energy efficiency programs.","By reducing O&M costs, we will lessen the increase in customer rate base increases and keep them at less than 2%, or as I refer to, the rate of inflation. And we believe Michigan regulation will continue for -- to provide fair and predictable outcomes.","Now let me turn the call over to Tom for a look at 2012 results and the 2013 outlook.","Thomas J. Webb","Thanks, John, and thank you all for joining us on the call today. We deeply appreciate your interest. Our 2012 results are our best performance in 10 years, and importantly, this represents strong, consistent, improving performance year after year. Our full year reported results were $1.42 a share or $1.55, excluding a decoupling write-off earlier in the year. Adjusted earnings were up $0.10 a share, that's a 7% increase on top -- on the top end of our guidance range at 5% to 7%. Our businesses operated well. The utility was up $0.07 with strong sales and constructive rate cases supporting capital investment and accelerated reliability work. Both enterprises and EnerBank achieved improved performance with enterprises and the parent up $0.03 from last year.","Now here's a slide that's become more popular than we ever expected. It's an update of the version we showed you in the first half of the year, as well as in the third quarter. As you can see, we fully offset the adverse implications of unusually mild weather earlier in the year and that was a tall order. Later, we put to use the earnings benefit from the hotter-than-normal summer by investing substantially more in tree trimming and generating plant maintenance, system hardening and so on. We also were able to make important contributions to low income funds and our foundation at the very end of the year. It's our desire not to over-earn or under-earn our authorized ROE. This allows us to deliver our earnings growth commitment to you, while maximizing every opportunity to improve conditions for our customers. Our approach is pretty simple: when our customers win and when you win as investors, then we're successful.","As we look forward into 2013, our top priorities continue to be improving safety and customer value, executing our investment plan, successfully processing the Certificate of Need for our new proposed gas plant, completing constructive electric and gas rate cases, as well as achieving our 11th year of consistent strong financial performance.","With a highly engaged workforce, these priorities focus us like a laser beam on our customers and on you, our owners. So here's our guidance for 2013. Earnings per share is up another 5% to 7% or $1.63 or $1.66 a share. This is accompanied with strong operating cash flow of $1.3 billion, continuing our cash flow growth of about $100 million each year. Importantly, and perhaps unique to only a few companies in our sector, our new year guidance is built on our actual results from the prior year rather than prior guidance or budget or something adjusted for weather. With minor exception, each year, we've accomplished an EPS at the top end of our guidance range or above our point estimate, and each year, we've established our new guidance based on that high-end performance. This provides a unique healthy growth pattern that maximizes earnings and dividend growth for a high-end total shareowner return.","As you can see in this waterfall slide, our growth will again come from our core businesses: our gas and electric utilities. Our investment program drives this growth and it provides for improved service and reliability to our customers. The enterprises and parent may be down with a slightly higher share count, bonus depreciation-related interest savings that's at the utility instead of at the parent and the state tax credit in 2012 that's not repeated in 2013.","Now we talk a lot about flexibility in our investment plan. Our 2013 to 2017 5-year plan calls for about $7 billion of investment. And as John showed you earlier, this includes addressing a future capacity shortfall with a new gas plant. We've offset a good portion of the new plant investment by prioritizing our plans for the next 5 years, with some investments deferred to a later time frame or done with even better technology than we thought possible before. We've reduced the range from prior discussions at $6.5 billion to $7.3 billion, down to a new range of $6.5 billion to $7 billion. This keeps customer base rate increases under inflation. Even though we could invest substantially more in the next 5 years, which would enhance earnings and cash flow growth, we do not. We do not because we believe it's our responsibility to keep our customer base rate increases below inflation and this makes for a sustainable plan for everyone.","Although retained earnings in our NOL are still sufficient to meet our need to maintain a strong equity level at the utility, we're examining options carefully to make sure they're in the best interest of investors and owners. For example, we may upsize a bit our small continuous equity program to take advantage of the accretive investment in the new gas plant, if approved. However, if we can find enough capital investment offsets, we may not even need to do that.","As shown on this slide, we've been catching up on necessary investments over the last few years. Since the need for investment continues to grow over the next 10 years, the pace of our growth may exceed some of our peers. During the last decade, many peers were able to put important programs in place, while we were in a tough period of restructuring. This catch-up provides us with an opportunity to fuel future growth on a consistent basis and for some time.","While we've accomplished a lot reducing our O&M costs in the past, there is still more we can do. We reduced our headcount 3% in 2012 and 10% since 2006. This is a major contributor to our plan that not only offsets inflation, but will reduce costs by a further 6% in 2013. And that's 8% below inflated levels. For the period 2013 to 2017, we project O&M costs to be down about 1% a year. Examples include continuous productivity improvements. We improved productivity 41% since 2006 and target another 25% over the next 5 years. Other examples include mothballing our small coal plants, thoughtful benefit changes and the rollout of smart meters. These savings flow to our customers and are enabled by our investment programs.","Now the Michigan -- in Michigan, it continues to rebound, with many examples of recovery over the last 3 years. Housing starts are up 75%, auto production in Michigan is up 97% and unemployment is down almost 5 points. As Michigan economic recovery continues, sales in our service territory have rebounded nicely.","Industrial sales reached prerecession levels 2 years ago, and as you can see on the left side of this slide, sales growth has continued at a strong pace. Recent growth is cloaked a bit by sales in one narrow customer class, what we call an E1 tariff. This is a unique economic development tariff that doesn't provide for any margin to our company in an effort to support solar-related sales. Sales are falling in this narrow class where we make no profit. For example, last year, our industrial sales growth of over 2% would have been 4%, excluding this E1 tariff. That builds nicely on prior year growth. As we look ahead, growth would be about 1%, including E1 tariff, 3% without it. In other words, sales from all of our industrial customers, save one, are expected to grow 3%. Sales growth for all customers, as shown on the right, has continued at about 1% a year. Also, we show growth, excluding energy optimization program. In 2012, we maximized energy efficiency, receiving an incentive of $17 million on top of our authorized ROEs. Your primary focus really should be on growth including energy optimization, but we thought it would be useful to see the underlying economic strength in our service area with sales up 2%, excluding these energy efficiencies.","As you can see here, electric sales continue to exceed the average growth at EEI companies. We plan for the future conservatively and the actual results speak well for themselves. Overall, our sales have been up 1% in each of 2011 and 2012, when peers were flat in '11 and down 1% in '12. While our industrial sales reached prerecession levels in 2011, the year-over-year effective increases of about 4% compare very favorably with peers, where sales were up only 2% in '11 and down 1% in '12.","With budget and tax reforms in place, as well as growth-oriented fiscal policies, Michigan's GDP growth was the sixth best among all 50 states in 2011. And this performance continued in 2012.","Planned cash flow for 2013 is strong, with operating cash flow at the utility exceeding $1.7 billion. At the parent, sources of cash easily covered equity infusions into the utility, as well as the cost of financing. The financing plan targeted for 2013 is in good shape. There are no maturities coming due in 2013. We will continue to look for opportunities, as we always do, to pre-fund our needs for future years.","Gross operating cash flow continues to grow at about $100 million each year, as does net operating cash flow, which includes interest payments, working capital and taxes. As we make use of our NOLs through 2016, a full 4 years away, we anticipate that we will begin paying some federal taxes in 2016. While a few years ago, our underlying operating cash flow was not as strong as many of our peers, our substantial customer investment program has turned the situation around to a healthy level. As you can see in the yellow banner at the bottom of the slide, NOLs and tax credits continue to be available through 2017.","Our credit ratings have improved a lot over the last few years, and we're pleased that Moody's and S&P have our credit ratings outlook on positive, and we have faith in their insights and look forward to their results.","As we provide in each earnings call, here's a table of profits and cash flow sensitivities to enable you to assess our projections, including changes in sales, gas prices and ROEs. The size of the sensitivities provide some reasonable indicators regarding the degree of change that could occur. Please recall, however, that it's our goal to deliver planned results for our customers and investors even if these conditions change.","Our best measure of confidence in our future is our earning guidance to you. Over the last decade, we've delivered an average EPS growth of 7% a year, a bit better than our peers. We believe we can continue growth this year and in the future at 5% to 7%, continuing performance, we hope, a bit better than our peers. This underlying goal will facilitate increases in our dividend and perhaps -- therefore, that pace might also be a bit better than some peers. So here's our final report card for 2012. All targets were met or exceeded.","And here's our metrics for 2013. They're tough, but they're realistic targets that provide for a strong level of performance for both our customers and our investors. We've included a dividend and a customer rate metric to enhance measuring progress in these important areas. We've continued the all-important earnings cash flow and capital structure metrics. We look forward to reporting on each of these and other important topics as we go through the year.","So thank you for your interest and your time today. We appreciate your faith in our company and in our management team. We're committed to your success and realize that we've got to earn your confidence every day. And on that note, John and I would be happy to respond to any questions you may have this morning.","So Frances, would you please open the call for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Kevin Cole from Credit Suisse.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Tom, just to make sure I got your comment clear on the equity. So you're maintaining your no block equity through the planning period but may opportunistically increase your DRIP from $30 million to $40 million or something small like that?","Thomas J. Webb","That's pretty close, and let me just add a little clarity to that. You remember our capital investment went up $750 million for the new plant that's yet to be approved. We're assuming that does get approved, so we're working at our base capital investment to see what things could push out a little bit or what things could we do smarter and just bring them down a little bit. To the extent we can get in the low end of that range that John gave you, we probably don't need to make any changes whatsoever. To the extent that we stay up around $7 billion or maybe a little bit more, we think we're in pretty good shape. But what we would look at is maybe take the continuous equity program up a notch and we haven't decided to do that. And let me remind you what those numbers are. We have a DRIP program that's about $15 million a year and a continuous equity program that's about $15 million for that total of $30 million, Kevin, that you mentioned. So our goal is to try to stay in that arena. But we realize this is a pretty accretive investment that we're doing and we might want to tip it up just a little bit, if we need to cover that new higher level of investment. But you can see our primary emphasis is to figure out how can we do it without putting people in a situation where we have the potential for dilution. We don't want to dilute anything here. So thanks for the question. We haven't made our final decisions on that, but as of today, I would tell you there's no plan for any new block equity issuances. The NOLs are good enough, along with our retained earnings, to put us in good shape. But we'll be evaluating just how far we can go in that capital investment as to whether we need just a tiny bit more of equity, maybe through our continuous equity program. Okay?","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And one last question, if I could. So I guess on the capital investment tracker, I guess given the ALJ's recent testimony stating that the commission lacks the legal authority to grant such a tracker, what is your updated view on the issue? And generally, do know what the root of the ALJ's issues really are given that -- it seems to me that the commission was clearly -- their authority was clearly affirmed by the Court of Appeals early last year? And, on the decoupling -- I mean, this tracking mechanism is good for all stakeholders.","Thomas J. Webb","Right. We're probably mixing a couple of things in there. I will just make it clear that -- let's use the decoupling appeals court order. The judge in that situation said that their -- by the letter of the law, the word electric was not mentioned in the 2008 energy law. So even though we continue gas decoupling, he did not see the authorization for electric decoupling. When he came out and said that, he said, \"But you know, the commission does have full authority to do things like trackers.\" So it can do -- it can get the effect, if it chooses, of decoupling in different ways. There have been lots of comments and things around this whole subject. But I would tell you it's our understanding that trackers in different words or forms are permitted for the Public Service Commission to do. And so we don't see any barriers to that and decisions they'll be making in the future about our electric and gas rate cases, when it comes to having the revenue mechanisms we proposed or the capital investment mechanisms that we proposed. They can put forms of trackers on that if they so choose, but those decisions are yet ahead for them.","John G. Russell","Kevin, the only thing I'd add to that is I think you're referring maybe to the ALJ case and the MichCon case?","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, exactly.","John G. Russell","Yes, they look for -- and right now, I think you know that the staff is supportive of the tracker. The issue there is that, I think, and you'll have to verify this with DTE, is that the DTE gas business in that case was requesting a 5-year duration. And I think that's what caused some angst on the ALJ. But the staff was supportive of it so -- and in our case, we're not looking for that duration. We're looking for a shorter duration, one year.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. So the staff testimony comes out Thursday, is that correct?","Thomas J. Webb","It does, today.","John G. Russell","Yes.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Two questions. Can you give some more color as to what's going to drive the 6% cost reduction? How much of that is related to kind of the accelerated spending you did last year? And the second question is, any latest thoughts on the strategic value of EnerBank?","Thomas J. Webb","Yes, I'll take those. First, on the cost side, that's the bigger, more important question, I think, of the 2. And I would tell you yes. This last year -- first of all, to get directly to your point, we had programmed to take our cost down 6%, and we didn't go all the way, because we were able to, in the fourth quarter, make some investments for customer reliability that we wouldn't other be able -- otherwise be able to make when we had the very warm summer. So of course, the net effect of making those investments in our business reduced the size of the year-to-year cost reductions, which were still substantial and maybe among the best in the sector. But this year, that made it a little bit easier than in '13 with those costs in place to not repeat those and be able to lower our cost even further. But I would tell you, take a look at our Slide 22 because we give you what I'll call is a handful of examples of what we've done and a handful of examples of what we are doing for the future. And there are many more beyond this. So on that slide, we remind you that we'll be mothballing our small coal plants. That will save some money. Our productivity commitment for the next 5 years is another 25%. That will save money each and every year. Our benefit plans, we have some smart things to do and partly what the federal government is doing where we'll be able to take some advantages to do our benefit programs more efficiently and economically than we do today, and you'll see some of that this year. The smart energy program at consumers, that's one that I think everybody's familiar with, not needing meter readers and so on and so on. We're really just rolling that out. We're a bit of a laggard. We are behind other companies, but by design, so that we could benefit from the latest technologies and the smartest things to do around security and the like. And so as that rolls out, we'll only start to see some of those benefits coming in. So there's a lot of things we can do. We have a good deal of confidence in where we are for reducing our cost by 6%. And you'll notice that we give you an estimate for the next 5 years, which we think we can do at about, on average, 1% a year. As we get closer to each of those years, we'll look at them a lot harder and that's when we'll see, \"Can we do a bit more?\" Sure, those cost reductions help us a little bit on our earnings when they're done, but it's temporary. We pass that right through to our customers because we make our money on the investments we're making, which help many of those enable these cost reductions. So from a cost reduction story, yes, we got a little bit of a helping hand this year with some monies that we put in place last year. But we've got a good plan with specific actions on how to get there. On EnerBank, it's a small part of our business and it has grown nicely. It's -- they've done a good job there. They, along with enterprise, make up about $0.11 of our earnings per share last year. I would tell you that we'd like to see the enterprise side grow a bit more. It's $0.05 of that number. And this isn't a great market to have IPPs, but it is one that we're doing okay in and we see some upside there. So we see some nice growth opportunity. We're proud of EnerBank, but it's a small piece of our business that, strategically, we need to keep in place, at least for now.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I think my question has just been answered.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ali Agha from SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Tom and John, the CapEx number that you are budgeting over the next 5 years, $6.5 billion to $7 billion, can you remind us of what underlying annual rate base growth that would support for you guys?","Thomas J. Webb","Yes, I think the way you should look at that is it's roughly in the 5% to 7% zone because that is the driving factor then, of course, for the earnings and the operating cash flow growth. So it's about in that arena.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So the point being...","Thomas J. Webb","It's different -- and it's different, Ali, from year to year, as you would expect, because it's not a perfect straight line. So where we might be around $1.4 billion this year and maybe similar the next year, you might see it come down a little bit for a year and then back up. So this -- the curved line that we gave you in our slides today was to give you a general trend, a smooth trend of that investment in the past and into the future.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And given the fact that the gas part is now in the equation as well, is it fair to say that it's more heavily skewed electric versus gas proportionately?","Thomas J. Webb","Well, for sure it is, but I would also tell you that probably because -- John, didn't mean to here -- that we, when we look at that, even though it is skewed more into the electric than it is to gas, we're looking for opportunities every day to put more money in the gas side of the business because there are good things that need to be done. And with gas pricing having come down so much, there's room in our -- for our customers to be able to absorb that smart investment. Suffice it to say though, we're critiquing everything on the electric side, but we're not putting anything on the gas side that doesn't make absolute good sense for our customers.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And John, recent commentary coming out from the Michigan legislature regarding a closer look at both self-implementation and again, retail open access as well. Can you just give us your context or give us a sense of where those 2 issues are and how you see that play out?","John G. Russell","Yes, as I mentioned earlier, Ali, you've got the Governor that's come out and said that the law, we like the law, he likes the law. The folks in the legislature, we've seen one bill that's been introduced in the Senate, which was a bill to open up the cap, which was similar to a bill that was introduced last year and no action was taken on it. There's not been any bill, as I know as of today, that's been introduced in the House. The House has -- or the Senate has already gone through hearings on changing the law. Senator Nofs, who runs the energy house -- or the Senate Energy Committee, is supportive of the law, and I think 8 of the 9, or 7 of the 9 committee members he has, which are bipartisan, have been supportive of the law and voted for it in 2008. So if there's work to be done, it's the work that I talked about this year with what the Chairman of the commission is doing, coupled with the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, to go out and seek opinions and thoughts about this in these public forums that are being conducted over the next several months. But in addition to that, and the point I want to make very clear is, they've also been very thoughtful about constructing a list of 80 questions that are going out to all parties for responses back, I think it's in the April time frame, April, May time frame. And what they're trying to do is collect data, not opinions necessarily, but also data-driven approaches about regulatory, renewable energy, energy efficiency, what works, what hasn't worked, what's the data behind it, and that's exactly what they're trying to do. We'll be actively involved in those. I expect there'll be some hearings I'll be involved with as we go forward on this. So the point is they're looking at it. We've always thought that a natural time to look at the 2008 law would be in 2015, and that's what the Governor really directed in his energy message because there are some natural fall-offs that occur in 2015. Do we keep doing energy optimization at the levels we have today? Do we keep the surcharge the same? Do we expand renewable energy from what it is today? And so that's kind of a natural process that we go through right now.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Got it. Last quick question, Tom, is it fair to say that in your '13 guidance, you assume the rate case outcome is similar to what you got last time?","Thomas J. Webb","I would say it this way, we've asked for what we needed, and we wouldn't want to be talking about other numbers in the middle of that process.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Andrew Weisel from Macquarie Capital.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","First question, I want to elaborate on the O&Ms. The 6% reduction for this year, if I remember correctly, that did not include the energy optimization spending. So can you remind us what that dollar amount will be and kind of what the appropriate base to apply that 6% is? Just trying to get a better sense of what the actual dollar O&M will look like in 2013.","Thomas J. Webb","Yes, we'll look up the EO number for you right now. I don't actually have it at my fingertip.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Okay. Well, I'll ask some other one in the meantime then. From the sales recovery slide, it looks like the actual revenue number will be kind of flattish year-over-year. First question is, I just want to affirm that is weather-adjusted, right? So the weak -- the actual number will look a little different than 0?","John G. Russell","Yes, that's true. This is John. Tom's working on your number. Yes, think of the sales for 2013 basically flat overall. And then if you add back the energy optimization, that's about a 1% and then E1 that Tom talked about is about another 1%. So in that range, that's what you should be looking at from that standpoint.","Thomas J. Webb","And then here's your answer on energy optimization. First of all, you're right assuming, as we told you before, we don't put that into the cost levels for which we then count our 6% reduction. That number is about $116.1 million. And it's the same number in '12 and '13, very tiny difference. So you won't see that as a differential for '12 to '13. Does that help you?","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Yes, it does.","Thomas J. Webb","Even as you go forward, you would see that in '14 it's a similar number. But you may recall, if you went back a year to '11, we were still ramping up, so it was a little bit smaller number.","John G. Russell","And Andrew, those are weather-adjusted numbers that I gave you.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Right. Okay. Great. Then longer term, when we think about the sales growth in '14 and beyond, should we think of it in kind of the same range of flattish growth after E1 and EO?","Thomas J. Webb","I think the way to -- again, weather-adjusted and -- oh, just straight up, about 0.5% to 1% is what you should look for in growth over the longer term. And no one can really precisely say like we do on our books that it's 0.x. So it's really about 0.5% to 1%. And then if you took EO out of that, add back about 1%. So think of -- if I round the number to 1% growth, then you'd be up to about 2% growth without EO.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Great, very helpful. Then one last one, just the timing of the rate case for gas. I guess I was a little bit surprised on the timing given that you have the electric case outstanding with a few unknowns as far as like the recovery mechanism and the decoupling or whatever flavor name they give it. And given that in April, we'll find out about DTE's infrastructure recovery mechanism, just a little curious on why the timing now as opposed to waiting until we have a bit more clarity from those other 2 data points.","Thomas J. Webb","For us, it's real simple. We kind of put blinders on, like a little horse that's just got oats in front of him, and we just look at the investment that we're making and determine what's the right time to go back to the commission, and that has been something approximately in annual rate cases. And the rate cases have all been about that investment. So we try not to be distracted for a variety of reasons that might happen that would cause you to go a little faster, a little slower. Do we think about those? Yes. Do we think about rates in winter seasons? Yes. Do we do all that? Ours is just plowing down a course that's steady, routine, regular cases. Now I do want to add, because I know you picked it up, but to make sure everybody else does, we've put some mechanisms in both the electric and gas cases that could permit us, if they're granted, around capital spending. For instance, recovery in future years, for at least a year or 1.5 years out, depending if it's electric or gas case, that could permit us not to have to come in for a regular rate case. Since our requests are all capital spending, if we had some form of a tracker that went out for, say 2 years, then we could stay out of rate cases for that period. And if we did one a little bit longer, probably stay out that little bit longer, too. That's one we're not presumptuous thinking that it's our decision. So we'll see what the commission chooses to do with that as to how they'd like to pace this recovery.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brian Russo from Ladenburg Thalmann.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I was just curious, if you get approval for the new gas plant, when would construction begin?","John G. Russell","We'd start -- 2 things we need, Brian, we need the air permit and then we need the Certificate of Need. So we'd start construction around '15 and be operational by the summer. Right now, '17 is what we're planning.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. So if there is any valuation of the continuous equity program and et cetera, would it be timed with when the gas plant construction starts? Or would you look to do something sooner than that?","Thomas J. Webb","We're going to -- again, we don't like to get out in front of people and their decisions. We're going to make certain that we have an air permit and a commission that believes we deserve a Certificate of Need and that's when we'll start making the decisions about what we would do that's related to the gas plant. So I think you'd see that out in the future a bit. We'll be looking at our total capital programs and what we need to do each day. But for the, this one, we want to get the decision so that we know we can talk to you about facts rather than just desires.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just your thoughts on the trend in your NOL balance. It looks like it winds down through '17 and less tax shields on your cash flows. And just your thoughts on your external kind of capital needs to fund kind of the latter half of that 5-year capital budget?","Thomas J. Webb","Yes, the NOLs are good, counting this year, through the next 4 years. But here's the thing that could change that. If we had another big bonus depreciation year, which we don't anticipate, but if that were to happen again this next year coming up, you know how that works. That gives us the tax shelter where the investments are made down at the utility, and then that allows us to take our NOLs and extend them out, use them later. They have long lives as they exist today. But we'd be able to take out the time with which they're used up and therefore, take out the time in which we would need to generate more cash through equity or something like that. So we updated this since we talked last third quarter earnings call. We put some new things in with some programs that help us on some tax shelters and the bonus depreciation. And we're clean through 2016. Now we do tell you, we have credits that go further than that, but those have to be looked at each and every year when you do your tax returns. Those are not always all usable right away. Some of those may get used later in time. So the way to think about this, good NOL coverage through 2016 and then we'll work hard to see if we can't do some other things.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I wanted to touch base with you on the weather-adjusted sales growth that you experienced in 2012 for gas. If we back out transportation, it looks like it was substantially down and pretty much across customer classes. First of all, on industrial, was there any fuel switching? And if there was, what would it be -- what would have caused that? And otherwise, how do you -- what do you think is actually driving such a decrease in demand?","John G. Russell","Yes, Paul, let me talk about that. One of the things, that we had a remarkably warm winter last year, so when you look at the weather adjustment models we use, I don't think they really have experienced a whole lot around that area because it was, what I would call, almost record-setting as far as warm weather. So I don't see that as a really good indicator for -- I mean, I wish we had better models. But when you get into that territory, as Tom said, that we were losing $8 million, $9 million to $11 million in the winter, ever since [ph], it was a big issue. As far as fuel switching, limited. The bigger thing we're doing in fuel switching in our territory is that we've got propane customers, about 400,000 propane customers that we can switch to natural gas. And we've got an aggressive program that we're working on that today. So -- but that requires pipes to be installed to be able to access those customers. So when you think about compared maybe to the East Coast and others that maybe you're thinking about, we don't have as much of that fuel switching as they do, but it's an opportunity for us to grow and be able to capitalize on the switch from propane to natural gas, which for our customers, is about a 2-year payback after they pay for the installation and all new appliances. So it's something we think has potential in the gas business.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Just industrial in general, I mean, would there be that big a weather impact on industrial for gas?","John G. Russell","I don't know. I mean, it's relatively small when you look at it. I guess it's down substantially. Most of our industrial customers, when you look at the base there, are large customers that take transport. So the mix that we focus on in our business is really the residential and the commercial because that's where the margin is. Most of the large customers are just paying us the throughput charge because most of them are on transportation rates and\/or buying from third parties.","Thomas J. Webb","You might be surprised in the gas business that there actually is more weather-related than you might think on industrial. People are heating greenhouses, which is a big thing up in Michigan. People are heating large buildings where they do pharmaceutical testing. So there's more of that than you might think, at least that's what I learned over time.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, that's helpful to know. Just on -- back to the electric side. I mean, why is E1 going down? And how should we think about this just in general? Just general -- I realize you don't make money from that, but just to get a sense here. I mean, there was almost no growth at all in residential and commercial and I assume that actually includes leap year. So I mean, I'm just trying to get a sense as to really, when you're mentioning 1% -- 0.5% to 1% growth, we've seen a big boost here in industrial and a rebound in the economy. But just where do you see that growth coming from?","Thomas J. Webb","Well, let me first help you on residential and commercial because we completely agree that that's a slow process in terms of the recovery. Industrial comes first when you're shooting down or up either way. That's just the way it happens in an economy. We're seeing the residential come back up. Remember residential, which we show as sort of flat year-to-year. When you take out the energy efficiency work, it's actually up 1%. So you're beginning to see residential usage come back around. Commercial's following, and I'm just going to tell you, commercial's flat. There are people who are still concerned about the economic conditions of the country and even the globe, I guess, when it gets down to that. So they're being very cautious on their recovery. What is encouraging is the industrial side where industrial customers, as a whole, were back to prerecession levels 2 years ago with great growth on top of that. So here we see our industrial customers, excluding this E1 tariff, up another -- over 3.5%, almost 4%, again this year and we see that as really a good encouraging progress with lots of evidence when we talk to our customers individually about what they're doing and they see we get some comfort. They have worries, like everybody does, in what's happening in Washington, for example, but they're growing their businesses nicely. On the E1 tariff, we're actually not permitted by contract to talk very much about the details that are in that, but I would ask you to accept this, if you don't mind, is that it was a tariff put in place to help start up some sales and boost a particular sector. We did mention around the solar side of the business. With whatever things that are happening worldwide and across the United States, they're struggling right now. And as they fall away sharply, that does ploke [ph] the overall growth that's happening for all of our customers absent that one tariff. So we thought -- and we don't like to call out any particular tariff or any particular customer. We're very loyal to all of them in helping them be successful. But in this case, we thought you needed to know that our growth at 2% would have been 3.5% without that.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then just finally, I'm sorry to be so slow on the O&M, but when you mentioned 6% decrease, I guess, adjusted -- relative to inflation, I guess, is what we're talking about and...","Thomas J. Webb","No, this is an absolute number and that's something we're very proud of. A lot of folks will tell you on phone calls, numbers versus inflation. If you assumed we have a -- would have a 2% inflation this year, our numbers will be down 8%. So no adjustments, nothing. Dollar to dollar, we are down 6% or will be. That's our plan for this year.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","And then when you give the 1% for 2013 through  2017, is that inclusive of the 6% or -- I mean, because that obviously is a huge number. I mean, in other words, I mean, when we think about you guys after this year, how should we think about -- do you follow what I'm saying?","Thomas J. Webb","The way to look at it -- the way we run our business here is we build like a 5-year plan where we try to put in some tough objectives. But we don't put things in our plan that we don't know how to do. So when you're out 4 and 5 years, it's a little more difficult to program exactly what all the O&M will be. So we've put in the things we know and we say we've got to, for our customers, at least keep our numbers flat. Then as we get close to each year, we look at what can we do that would be even better. So as you'll -- my guess is, and we don't have any such numbers right now, as we get close to 2014, we'll start to talk about what we can do to bring those numbers down, because we'll have real plans as we get closer to that year. So facts are 6% this year, flat beyond this year, but -- because when you work in the 6%, that will be about a 1% decline as you observed, and we'll look for ways to bring those numbers down as we get close to each and every year.","Operator","And gentlemen, at this time, there are no other questions in the queue.","John G. Russell","All right. Well, let me wrap up today just by saying that we've had a good year of financial and operating performance in 2012 thanks to the employees at CMS Energy and Consumers Energy. They're responsible for this, and we appreciate the work that they've done to help us get to where we are today. We're also well positioned, you heard today, to deliver another year of consistent financial performance in 2013.

The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded.","After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12:00 PM Eastern Time running through August 2. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations.","Srikanth Maddipati - CMS Energy Corp.","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Patti Poppe, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties.

They are a small tribute to our good friend and colleague, Phil McAndrews, who most of you know. I would like to take a moment before turning the call over to Patti to congratulate Phil on his retirement. Phil served as a steady hand in the IR department for 22 years, and we have all been fortunate to know and work with him. Phil, thank you for your dedication to the company. We're sad to see you go, but it's a well-deserved retirement. Taking Phil's place will be Travis Uphaus, our new Director of Investor Relations. Many of you know Travis well and you can expect to continue communicating with me and Travis going forward.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Patti.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Thanks, Sri. Phil's been a great contributor to our company's success and he will be greatly missed. Frankly, we haven't had enough of Phil just yet. So later tonight, we're throwing him a surprise party. If you're listening in, Phil, and we know you are, bring your dancing shoes and we'll bring the Motown.","Now, back to business. During this morning's call, I'll cover our financial results for the first half and recap the recently filed Integrated Resource Plan among other updates, and Rejji will provide more details on our financial results and outlook for the year. We continue to deliver solid results for the first six months of this year. Our adjusted earnings per share for the first half are $1.34 and that's up 29% from the prior year. We continue to guide toward a full year range of $2.30 to $2.34. We'd be disappointed if we didn't deliver it towards the high end of that guidance again this year, giving us our 16th year of consistent industry-leading financial performance. Longer term, we have confidence in our ability to continue to deliver the consistent results on which you've come to rely. We're reiterating our long-term guidance of 6% to 8% annual adjusted EPS growth and we continue to expect our dividend growth to align with earnings growth.","Our focus and commitment to our triple bottom line of people, planet and profit underpinned by financial and operating performance is a sustainable and low risk business approach that continues to deliver for you our investors and our customers. In fact, Market Strategies International recently named Consumers Energy as the most trusted brand in the Midwest for business customers. Our entire capital plan is designed with the triple bottom line in mind. For example, we currently have a gas pipeline project going on near Grand Rapids. The project itself will deliver additional capacity to help match the economic growth we're seeing in the heart of our service territory. It's really exciting. In fact, we're giving our board members a walking tour of this $47 million project next week to demonstrate the triple bottom line firsthand. As many of you know, there's no place I would rather be than out in the field with my team, with my hard hat and my boots on.","We're utilizing our own employees to do the work because we have the foresight to create a seasonal work crew for our Main Replacement Program and projects like this one. With the labor market tightening, this has actually proven to be a real competitive advantage for us. The environmental soundness of the project through our modern water reclamation process is reducing waste and saving money. In fact, we anticipate saving millions of gallons of water and millions of dollars on this project alone. From a safe distance, our board of directors and our team will watch along Interstate 96 as our team boards beneath the lanes of traffic and I can assure you there will be nothing boring about that.","The passage of the 2016 energy law provided us an opportunity to file a long-term generation plan. This key element of Michigan's legislative framework is forward-looking and enables us and the commission to align our long-term generation planning, providing greater certainty as we invest to transform Michigan's energy future. We're the first utility to file and our team has spent the better part of the year assembling our Integrated Resource Plan with the triple bottom line in mind. This plan follows our clean and lean generation strategy, which uses modular renewables and demand side resources to closely match supply with demand and avoid big bets.","What we love about our approach is that it's flexible. We are required by statute to file an updated IRP every five years and are allowed to do it sooner as the business environment changes and technologies evolve. At the same time, the financial approval portion of the statute gives three years of certainty in our supply investments. Since we don't have any big bets and given the timing of our planned retirements, we're able to space out investments allowing us to build a more modular generation fleet and a smoother investment plan.","The use of demand response and energy efficiency plays a prominent role in our near-term capacity planning and the 2016 energy law enables incentives for implementing these resources. It highlights the strength of Michigan's regulatory construct, which is directed by very strong legislation. From a timing perspective, the Commission will comment on our IRP within 10 months and then we'll have 60 days to address any feedback before a final order is issued. Because the IRP results in pre-approval of capital expenditures in the first three years, future IRPs with larger supply investment plans will provide more forward-looking certainty.","As I noted, the IRP has very little near-term impact to our five-year $10 billion capital plan. As we look beyond five years, there are $3 billion of potential capital investment opportunities, primarily for solar included in the IRP. However, the majority of our electric system investments, whether it be the next 5 years, 10 years or beyond, are focused on our distribution system. When you include our gas system needed investment, it yields at least $50 billion of system-wide opportunity. Our customers trust us to make prudent decisions to provide safe and reliable energy delivery. Our biggest constraint is balancing the needs of the system with customers' ability to pay. We wake up every day focused on tackling debt balance by relentlessly pursuing waste elimination and cost reduction in all areas of our business which Rejji will discuss in more detail.","Our IRP reflects a plan that exceeds our already announced clean energy breakthrough goals from earlier this year by reducing carbon emissions by over 90%. Over time, we'll focus on cleaner supply sources as we retire our remaining coal units and replace the Palisades and MCV PPAs with the build-out of modular renewables. Ultimately, more than 40% of our supply mix will come from cleaner renewable sources. Through these great efforts, my coworkers make me proud and remind me why we are ranked the number one U.S. utility by Sustainalytics for the past few years in a row.","To continue to achieve these goals and accomplishments, we know we have to walk the talk. In the second quarter of this year, we secured the purchase of Gratiot Farms Wind development for consumers. Once we complete construction in 2020, the project will add 150 megawatts of wind to our portfolio at the utility. We're doing more work at the utility to expand our renewable portfolio and support our customers' renewable efforts with our renewable tariffs. This program allows our large industrial customers to receive the renewable energy that they are demanding at competitive and affordable prices, while remaining fully bundled customers, no cost shift. We're delighted to help our customers like Switch and General Motors receive cleaner fuel sources as we devote about 70% of the energy from our cross-wind to wind farm to the program.","Beyond the utility, we're expanding our renewable portfolio at enterprises with a 15-year wind PPA with General Motors based in Ohio. This wind farm adds another 105 megawatts of clean power to our enterprises mix that will consist of zero coal by 2020 at the completion of the Filer City conversions to natural gas. We're pleased to highlight all of this great work we're doing at all levels of the business. Not only is it better for the environment, but we're supporting our triple bottom line by investing in customer-driven low risk opportunities.","Our growth will continue to be driven by our utility which has a robust backlog of needed system upgrades on both the gas and electric distribution systems. We have a solid portfolio of investments and our plan continues to be de-risked with forward-looking filings that enable alignment around strategic investments in the future and provide optionality across the business.","We'll continue to operate our existing enterprises fleet efficiently and take advantage of opportunities like we saw with the recent wind PPA where we can serve valued customers like GM and invest in projects with similar risk-adjusted returns as the utility. When we couple our utility earnings contribution with contracted non-utility growth and prudent financial planning, I think, you can see why we have confidence in our ability to continue to grow at 6% to 8% in the long-term.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rejji to cover our first half results in detail.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Thank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. Before jumping into the financials, I would also like to extend my gratitude to Phil for his wonderful service to our Investor Relations efforts over the past two decades plus. Phil, you'll certainly be missed and we hope you enjoy your well-deserved retirement. As Patti mentioned, we're pleased to announce our strong results for the first half of 2018 with adjusted earnings per share of $1.34, up 29% from the comparable period in 2017, mostly attributable to weather and cost savings.","On a weather normalized basis, earnings per share for the first half were up 5% versus the first half of 2017. For the second quarter, we had adjusted EPS of $0.48 which compares favorably to the $0.33 per share that we delivered in the second quarter of 2017. It is also worth noting that our adjusted earnings per share information for the quarter and year-to-date differs modestly from our GAAP earnings per share data given the exclusion of a $0.01 per share gain realized during the second quarter to the expiration of an indemnity obligation associated with a sale in 2007. Although we're proud of these results, we're only midway through the year, so we'll continue to plan conservatively and manage the business with a focus on executing on our operating plan and identifying cost savings to mitigate future risk to plan and to perpetuate our self-funding strategy to the benefit of customers and investors.","On our waterfall chart on slide 12, you can see the favorable comparison of our 2018 year-to-date results versus the first half of 2017. Favorable weather provided $0.28 of positive variance with two-thirds of that coming from mild weather experienced in the first half of 2017. And cost savings contributed $0.10, primarily from reduced benefits expenses and lower storm or service restoration costs. Also rate relief net of investments provided $0.04 of contribution to the EPS upside relative to the comparable period in 2017. These sources of positive variance were partially offset by lower non-weather electric and gas usage, largely driven by the successful implementation of our numerous energy efficiency programs.","As we look ahead to the second half of 2018, we remain cautiously optimistic about the glide path required to achieve our 2018 EPS guidance range of $2.30 to $2.34. This includes normal weather in the second half of the year, modest pickup from our already approved electric rate increase and a constructive outcome in our pending gas case. Given the weather and cost performance related tailwinds we have experienced in the first six months of the year, we'll be focused on identifying and implementing operational pull heads and other reinvestment opportunities to mitigate longer term risks.","Slide 13 serves as a good example of the variability that we can experience in any given year and more importantly highlights the sustainability of our business model. As a reminder, we reinvest in the business during strong periods to de-risk future years and to perpetuate our consistent industry-leading financial performance. At this point six months into 2018, we are currently $0.16 ahead of plan that we will look to pull ahead reliability improvement programs such as forestry and plant maintenance from an operational perspective and we're always scouring the balance sheet for sources of non-operating savings as evidenced by the early extinguishment of the remaining portion of our 8.75% new notes apparent in June. Conversely, during periods of mild weather, heavy storm activity and\/or other vagaries we manage to work and reduce operating and non-operating costs to meet our financial objectives without compromising customer service. In either scenario, both our customers and investors do well.","This approach is supported by our simple but unique business model depicted on slide 14 which enables us to deliver consistent industry-leading financial performance year-in and year-out. We have a robust backlog of capital investments which improves the safety and reliability of our electric and gas systems or customers and drives earnings growth for our investors. We fund this growth largely through cost cutting, tax planning, economic development and non-utility contribution, all efforts which we deem sustainable in the long run. As such, we are confident that we can continue to improve the safety and reliability of our electric and gas systems through capital investments while meeting our customer affordability and environmental targets for many years to come.","We're often asked whether we can sustain our track record of cost cutting given that we have already reduced our O&M cost by 11% since 2013 and also because it drives roughly half of our self-funding strategy. In response, I think slide 15 best illustrates our opportunities for future cost reductions. To provide some perspective, our cost structure is about $5 billion excluding depreciation, of which over 50% is represented by power and gas supply costs. Within these costs, we have numerous off-market power purchase agreements, two of which will offer material cost reduction opportunities within the next 10 years. In the near-term, our Palisades PPA is scheduled to terminate in 2022, which will replace with a cost efficient blend of demand and supply side resources as Patti noted. And in 2025, we'll have the contractual option to extend our MCV PPA at a materially lower price until 2030 as per recently filed Integrated Resource Plan.","With fairly conservative assumptions, these actions alone would generate approximately $160 million of annual cost savings over time, which equate to about a 3% rate reduction. As a reminder, every 1% reduction in customer rates generates about $400 million of incremental capital investment capacity. Further, we expect recurring savings in fuel costs and O&M as we retire our coal fleet over time, most notably Karn 1 and 2 in 2023.","Our power supply related savings will be supplemented with continued gas and electric system upgrades, which reduce service restoration and leak repair expenses among other benefits, our continued efforts on waste elimination through the CE Way and good business decisions of the past, such as our smart meter installation and attrition management, to name a couple.","Lastly, we will continue to seek out non-operating savings through opportunistic re-financings, tax planning or otherwise to meet our financial objectives. To that end, in July, we implemented a $49 million credit to our gas customers as part of federal tax reform, which reduced the rates by 3% on an annual basis. On August 1, we will implement a $113 million credit at the electric utility. These estimates are in line with our plan and create headroom for future capital investments for the benefit of customers and investors. The fruits of our cost reduction efforts and financial discipline over the years are illustrated on the right-hand side of the slide with both our residential electric and gas bills declined relative to inflation over the past five years, despite approximately $8.5 billion of cumulative spend in those systems over that period.","As we work hard to cut cost to fuel the self-funding strategy, we're also benefiting from solid economic conditions in our service territory. In fact, Grand Rapids and its surrounding areas, which represent Michigan's second largest population center behind Detroit and make it the heart of our electric service territory have experienced roughly double the building permit and GDP growth of the U.S. among other attractive economic factors as you'll note on slide 16. Year-to-date, we continue to see healthy weather normalized cycle build sales and food manufacturing, fabricated metal products and transportation equipment, three of the most energy-intensive sectors in our service territory. We've also done our share to generate economic development opportunities in Michigan, achieving roughly 70 megawatts of new business in 2017 and targeting 100 megawatts in 2018. A notable example is Amazon's recent decision to open the new fulfillment center in Grand Rapids. This win will add $150 million of private investment to the area and a 1,000 new jobs in Michigan. By actively sourcing incremental load growth opportunities, we can spread our cost over a wider volume of usage, which further reduces rates for customers.","Looking now to our cash flows on slide 17, we anticipate some potential upside in operating cash flow in 2018 due to the prescribed pace at which the benefits of federal tax reform are being incorporated into rates. We continue to target $1.65 billion of OCF this year, but we may overachieve largely due to timing. So, when we combine this year and next, we don't see a material change, the aggregate cash flow generated of about $3.3 billion and still anticipate a $100 million per annum increase beginning in 2020.","Our strong and predictable cash flow generation supports the investment grade balance sheets of the parent and the utility which is underpinned by conservative financing strategy. Our financial discipline as well as credit supportive policies in the state legislature and the commission has led to strong credit metrics and numerous ratings upgrades over the years. To that end, both Moody's and Fitch recently reaffirmed the solid investment grade ratings of the utility as part of their annual reviews.","As a reminder, our FFO to debt ratio is projected to be approximately 18% by yearend, which includes the effects of federal tax reform and is in line with our targeted range. As we look ahead, we believe the strength of our balance sheet coupled with our self-funding strategy will enable us to prolong our success for many years to come.","And with that, I'll turn the call back to Patti for some closing remarks and then Q&A.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Thanks, Rejji. To summarize, our investment thesis is driven by a large and aging system in need of capital investments, a growing and diverse territory, the constructive regulatory statute, a unique self-funding model that's enhanced by the CE Way and tax reform and a healthy balance sheet to fund our planned cost effectively. We are confident in our ability to deliver consistent industry-leading growth and superior total shareholder return over the long-term.","With that, Rocco, please open the lines for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much, Patti. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. And today's first question comes from Andrew Weisel of Scotia Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Andrew Weisel - Scotia Howard Weil","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. First of all, congratulations, Phil. It's been a pleasure working with you. And Patti, I don't think you're supposed to tell him about the surprise party 12 hours early, but I'll let you run your business as you see fit.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Andrew Weisel - Scotia Howard Weil","My first question...","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","I think it was planned, yeah. Thank you.","Andrew Weisel - Scotia Howard Weil","My first question, weather adjusted volumes have been a little soft year-to-date. Obviously, it's very hard to weather normalize the extremes we've had both years. So my real question is about energy efficiency. How should we think about the impact going forward? You mentioned in this slide that the incentive will be rising, your financial incentives, but how should we think about the impact on volumetric growth.","And then as a related question, if you're able to give any detail on numbers around potential incentives for demand response?","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah. Great questions, Andrew. Thank you. We do expect energy efficiency to continue to grow. We are at about 1.5% annually, we're going to 2% and we clearly identify that in the IRP. It is a key part of understanding our clean and lean strategy, reducing that energy waste is an important opportunity when we are at the same time reducing the structural costs associated with serving that load. And another important -- there's two important points about our energy efficiency program. First of all, the incentive which in the 2016 energy law was increased to 20% of cost to achieve. So currently, we're running at about $34 million incentive and that'll grow to the $45 million zone in \u2013 by 2022. But we also have with annual rate filings then we true up our sales annually. So that gets captured as we go forward.","On demand response, we've filed recently for a demand response incentive mechanism similar to our energy efficiency. We expect it will be in about the $20 million range by the 2022 timeframe as well, that is just \u2013 we don't have the final determination about that. But in the energy law of 2016, it was also directed that there should be an incentive mechanism for demand response, because all of this is about shaving that peak. Our system is overbuilt for the purposes of serving a peak and so through energy efficiency and demand response, we can shave the peak and that's really a very important aspect of our clean and lean strategy.","Andrew Weisel - Scotia Howard Weil","Sounds great. Thank you. My other question is, on page 9 you show that you're adding wind in those three buckets. What I'm wondering is about your appetite for wind outside of the utility rate case at enterprises. I see the new one in Ohio is to service GM. Is that more about customer service than the earnings contribution, or is it all of the above?","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Well, all of the above. It's always about the triple bottom line. And when we say people, plan and profit, people are our customers. And so, when a great customer like General Motors has an opportunity that we can serve elsewhere, we do it when it's opportunistic, we don't have a pipeline of projects, we're not trying to be aggressive in this part of the business, but when opportunities emerge whether it's with a customer like General Motors or perhaps a municipality like Lansing Board of Water & Light where we just did a solar project. The fact is we're good at this stuff. We have a core competence in building and operating renewable assets, and so when we can deploy that in a customer-centric way and grow earnings, we're not going to do it. We definitely want to grow earnings and have utility like returns with those projects and so it is the triple bottom line in action.","Andrew Weisel - Scotia Howard Weil","Very good to hear. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Oh. Good morning, guys.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Good morning, Jonathan.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Good morning, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And congratulations, Phil, and thank you as well for many years of help. My question, Patti, do you have any early sort of feeling on how the commission and stakeholders are reacting to the IRP? In particular, you obviously choosing not to include a gas plant and this vision of a future was more modular. Just any sense of where the pressure points may be in that proposal?","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah. We are getting a lot of feedback and it's all extremely positive, Jonathan, as you can imagine. I think surprise might be a word that people would use to say, wow, the utility is actually doing what they've been talking about and they've really put the pen to paper to model out how this really clean and lean future could be possible. And so, I will also say that we did a lot of work prior to filing the IRP with stakeholder engagement with the staff, with the commissioners, with the community groups, environmental groups, our big business customers, et cetera. And so I think all of that hard work that the team did to enroll others has made this so far so good.","It is a contested proceeding, so we will, over the next several months, get documented feedback from people who might want to intervene. I would suggest that the biggest challenge in the IRP is getting the pricing right for these new renewables, which is why in the context of the IRP we included competitive bidding and the potential to earn on PPAs where someone else has a better price to deliver the new renewables. That's an important aspect, and we made it really clear that this is a packaged deal. And there's not an opportunity to sort of cherry-pick pieces like, yes, do all the wind, and do all the solar, but don't do competitive bidding. That's not acceptable. We want to make sure that the price is right, and the model was built around having competitive prices. So we're pretty excited about it. I think we are definitely taking a position to put our walk where our talk is, and so far so good.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And just as a follow-up to that, it would \u2013 clearly, you're not proposing bringing DIG into the utility, which, you at one point had talked about. So can you talk to us about your plans for that facility assuming the IRP goes along as filed?","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah. We talk long and hard about that and considered it in the model and decided that DIG actually has more value outside of the utility than inside the utility, particularly the price that we would have to bring it into the utility to get an affiliate transaction approved. And so, we felt like having it outside the utility has more growth potential. And as more base load power plants close, there's going to be more demand in MISO for power. And so DIG has a good opportunity to continue to serve the market well and be accretive in the long run.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. And then, finally, Rejji, you mentioned the contractual obligation at MCV or the option to reduce the price. I think you said in 2025. Could you just remind us how that works? How much it can come down? How much headroom that creates, et cetera?","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah. So the current contract is around $55 to $60 per megawatt hour. And we have estimated that upon repricing and extending five years that there would be at a minimum about $55 million in reductions of fixed costs now. The equivalent dollar per megawatt hour I don't have those specifics, but we think about $55 million of fixed cost savings which make the contract certainly much more on market today versus where it is today rather.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Is that a annual number or is that the...","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Yes, annual. That's a run rate savings and again that's just fixed costs.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","And basically the contract price comes down in half for those five years.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And it sounds like that price is necessarily set. You're talking about needing to kind of rebid or something?","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","No, no, no. It's contractually \u2013 we'll revise and effectively, as Patti commented, cut in half.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you for that. I think that's it. Thank you.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Phil, congratulations. After the party if you don't mind calling me I wanted to dust off my old CMS oil and gas model on that Equatorial Guinea well that we used to do together. That's okay with you?","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah. You can have it, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks. Back in 2001 or whatever it was. You've been around a long time, Phil. You've been great at your job. Thank you very much. The question I have is with regard to the IRP. Forgive me, if I haven't read it fully but is there anything in there that utilizes that battery storage technologies for load shift in your market? Patti, I presume you've looked at this because the lithium-ion battery technology comes from your former story arc in the auto industry. Is there a place for battery storage given the remarkable declines we're seeing in the \u2013 what the future delivery costs are for that technology in your service territory?","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah. We included some battery but that's the neat thing about this IRP. We have assumptions and we used what we considered conservative assumptions with a 35% reduction in battery cost and in most of the scenarios. There was another scenario where the costs didn't come down as much, but it turned out that renewables still panned pretty favorably even without a lot of storage. So I expect in future filings that the storage component will increase because we expect technology to evolve.","We are very bullish that technology can change and \u2013 but we wanted to conservatively plan about the changes in the IRP itself. So we have some storage in it, particularly in the outer years, but I wouldn't be surprised in future filings if that number would grow and therefore reduce some of the renewable generation because as we can make these renewable assets more dispatchable, obviously, that's better. And I am a believer that even with the four-hour battery, with the nature of our peak in Michigan that could serve as a great complement to existing renewable assets.","And I'll just remind you. We have a lot of experience with storage with the Ludington Pumped Storage Plant. That is a great big battery and we dispatch it every day, so we're very familiar with how it complements to our existing renewables today and how to maximize the value of that storage, we're excited about the technology breakthroughs. The automakers are telling us that their batteries aren't going to be available for reuse for some time because they're not failing as fast as they expect. And some people are predicting that these EVs are going to have 500,000 mile lifespan which makes the batteries not available as soon as we'd like but certainly our relationship with GM puts us in a good position as they become available, we can get creative with grid and applications and seeing where we could deploy modular storage.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","So that's interesting there's a difference between deploying a battery off the assembly line and then deploying a battery that's been repurposed from a used electric vehicle. So you don't see the technology yet or at least in the story arc of your current IRP competing head-to-head with a gas peaker, the technology hasn't crossed over on a...","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Well, we didn't add gas peakers in our IRP, so about 300 megawatts of solar in the outer years of the IRP, or 300 megawatts of battery storage rather in the outer years of the IRP.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Got you. Thank you.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Michael Weinstein of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, guys.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Hey, Michael.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Just a follow-up on that, by the way, hey, Phil, congratulations and have a great retirement. Just to follow up on that last question if -- what kind of costs decline assumption are you making when you're forecasting $3 billion of opportunity in the latter part of the 10-year plan, that's pretty far out. We're seeing pretty steep cost declines. Does that mean we're going to see more megawatts of battery storage and renewables or is there going to be some other \u2013 would that lead -- could cost declines leave room for other types of projects?","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Yes. So we assume 35% cost reduction in solar throughout the life of the IRP. But I will tell you from the point that we started modeling and trust me we did hundreds of different scenarios and sensitivities. It might not have been in the capacity of like bitcoin mining and energy use, but if you might come close, we are modelers, we're running like crazy. But all the models that they ran in total had about a 35% price reduction for solar and for storage. Your prediction and my prediction are yet to materialize. There's a lot of discussion about that, but I will say from the point we started modeling to the point we filed our IRP, a lot of that 35% reduction in solar in particular actually had materialized and is showing up in some unsolicited bids for solar. And so we've recently done an RFP that we'll be reviewing and building in those cost savings to future filings, which is why it's so important that this IRP gets re-filed on a regular basis to make sure that all the assumptions are correct. But I would say if the prices drop more, it would leave room to execute the plan at a more cost effective method and allow us to do that gas distribution work and electric distribution work that is so important and we have such a backlog to do.","Not everyone will love the clean and lean, not every utility could really subscribe to the clean and lean approach that we have, but the demands for capital in our gas system and our electric distribution system enable us to be extremely cost effective in all \u2013 in fact demand that we are cost effective in all aspects of the business.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","That's great. And just another question about the local clearing requirement. My understanding is the courts rejected it and I'm just wondering what the next steps are at this point?","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah. This issue -- first of all, let's just be clear, it has no impact on earnings or guidance or there's no effect of that court order though we vehemently disagree with the court order. When the law was passed, and trust me, I was at the table. The intent was very clear that this local clearing requirement be a component, because it's -- Michigan has unique characteristics and that we're a peninsula and there's limited transmission import capacity. Therefore, what the local clearing requirement was designed to do was to establish that if anybody was selling power in Michigan, it had to be some portion of it needed to be in the Peninsula. And so given that, the fact that it was ordered that the commission doesn't have the authority, we completely disagree with. So we will be taking it most likely to the Supreme Court here in Michigan, there are others who are joining us including the commission. We fully support that the way that they indicated their authority -- or exercise their authority was absolutely legal and authorized by the statute.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning, and echo those thoughts on Phil. Thank you for all your help over close to 20 years now. Rejji, can you just review what you said about shifting cash flows between 2018 and 2019? What's behind that? And I assume that is earnings neutral because you'd \u2013 assuming those funds go to rate bears anyway?","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Yes. So to answer your last question first, yes, it's earnings neutral, no impact on earnings. The reason why we are anticipating a little bit of upside in OCF this calendar year is because the pace at which the tax related savings from tax reform getting returned to customers is a little slower than we had anticipated and that's because the process that was offered up by the commission suggests contested cases. So there's a little process and rightfully so because we need to make sure that we get the allocations right to the various customer classes and that's why it's taking a little longer than anticipated.","And so we still plan to return $165 million to our customers, we initially anticipated most of that or good portion almost all would be done in 2018. But it looks like that will essentially drip into 2019. And so, as you think about the cash flow forecast, we said we'd be flat on the heels of tax reform for 2018 and 2019 at $1.65 billion. And so, if we overachieve to some extent this year, we expect we'll feel some of that hurt in 2019. And so you really should think about the two years collectively. And so assume $3.3 billion over those two years. And again we may be a little bit up this year and a little bit down next year. And all-in over the five-year period, more importantly, we expect to generate an aggregate $9 billion of cash flow and we should be back on that trajectory of about $100 million per year increase starting in 2020. Is that helpful?","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Very much so. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Praful Mehta of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks so much. Hi, guys.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Hi, Praful.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. So just another quick question on the IRP, I know you've taken plenty on those. But just to understand given you've run so many sensitivities on it, where are the pressure points and then are there any areas that you feel either gas prices go up or anything else that could spike up that could lead to either pushback or any responses from the commission or anybody else who kind of responds to the IRP? How do you see that playing out?","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah. The purpose for running all those scenarios and sensitivities is to choose and our preferred plan is the most resilient to changing conditions, whether it'd be gas prices or maybe the technology does not evolve as fast or maybe load doesn't materialize. An important part of our clean and lean strategy here is, as we add modular resources we can more quickly build out supply to match demand as we know it's materializing. It is so much more dynamic, flexible and adaptable which is the secret, frankly, to our financial success. Our whole business model hinges on our ability to be adaptable and be flexible under changing conditions no matter what they are. And so this IRP is reflective of our tradition of no big bet being able to have a plan that's both cost effective for customers but flexible if conditions change and so we really think the preferred plan is definitely the most resilient over a variety of changing -- potential changing factors. And then we get to re-file at a -- we're required to file every five years and if something material changed earlier than that, then we could file sooner.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Fair enough. That's super helpful. And then secondly, on the operating cash flow point, and for 2018 and 2019, Rejji, it's fair enough to look at it on a combined basis, but just wanted to confirm does that include the refunds for deferred income taxes or is that separate from that $1.65 billion?","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah. That $1.65 billion does not include the deferred income tax give-back. Now what we have highlighted is that we think the total aided that will be returned to customers over time is $1.6 billion. And that's largely the protected class of accumulated deferred income tax associated with property. And so, we think that if you add that to the $1.65 billion, that's probably another, if you take it over the average life of the assets, another $50 million to $60 million. So it's not included in that calculation, but rightfully so because the initial filing to decide how and the pace at which that money gets paid back, that has yet to be filed, that's scheduled for October 1, and then they'll be contested case or a process beyond then. So I think it's not until about 2019, and we will have a resolution as to exactly how much and when and at what pace. Is that helpful?","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah. That's super helpful. And on the unprotected side, is that the same kind of concept where you kind of wait to see how it plays out first?","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah. That will be part of that calculation C-filing that we'll provide in October. And there we do have actually a pretty decent amount of both unprotected liabilities and assets that we'll have to think through, and there isn't the same level of clarity that you have run the protected class where it effectively follows the principles of normalization. There is a lot more ambiguity in the code as to how you treat the unprotected classes.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Fair enough. And then I guess from last call just to follow up, if there's anything incremental on EnerBank from a strategic perspective that we should be aware of?","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Nothing has changed on EnerBank.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","All right (44:29). Thanks so much.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of BoA. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Good morning, Julien.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. And congratulations, Phil. Congratulations, Travis, everyone is moving on up here. I like it. So perhaps just to follow up on a quick question here. I suppose first with regards to the IRP, can we just quickly discuss the $3 billion incremental in the timeline to see some of that reflected in the program. I suppose given the fact that that's predominantly oriented at least in your words towards solar, how do you actually see commence construction safe harbor drive some of the decision in time making, and could you actually see some CapEx dollars even flow out as soon as next year just to try to qualify some of the assets given just how solar oriented the incremental generation might be.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","So, a big part of when we will do solar is when we need the additional capacity on the system and we don't show in the near-term requiring new large capital investments around new solar to be added to the system. So the model definitely shows it in the outer years and we factored in the ITC ramp-down. And so the extension of it will affect the modeling in some of those years. We do have an RFP out for some small amount of solar in the near-term but the big bulk of it really comes in the outer years and again tax treatment is one of the sensitivities and we assumed the current tax treatment and solar still tend because keep in mind, Julien, in Michigan, our peak is in the summer and MISO gives a 53% capacity factor to solar on peak. And so it has a higher capacity factor than wind because it is available when we need it which is on those hot summer days in Michigan. So, it lines up very nicely and when combined with demand response, that is a very good combination and mix for us.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Understood. Okay. And then a little bit perhaps turning back to the last series of questions on perhaps the equity ratio, I know there's a variety of different pieces that contribute to rate base growth relative to earnings power growth of the core utility. Can you comment a little bit about the potential for higher authorized equity ratio and how that might mesh into your financial plan? And I know that the deferred tax balance has also kind of mesh into this as kind of previously described too, so.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah. Julien, I think you characterized it appropriately. I mean, there's a lot that would go into that equation. And as you know, we plan conservatively. And so, you have really a few sources of inputs that would impact the equity thickness. Now, at the end of the day, it's ultimately the commission's decision, but you have the aided return that I had talked about earlier. And so, at a minimum, if you assume $50 million to $60 million will do return to customers over, say, a 25-year to 30-year period, that's going to by definition as you reduce that zero cost of capital, that represents about 20% of the rate making capital structure. You're going to have some level of equity thickness accretion over time and so that would create upward pressure on the equity thickness.","At the same time, the commission has asked us to glide path down to a level closer to 50%\/50% over the next, I'd say, five or six years. Now, that perspective from the commission was offered up prior to tax reform. And so, once the law was enacted in December of last year, we have made the point in subsequent filings both in our gas case as well as our electric case that we filed in May that that has obviously balance sheet implications. And so the glide path should be reconsidered. And so, I think you put all that in a Veg-O-Matic. My sense is, we ultimately would like to see the equity thickness kind of level out and stay fairly consistent with where it is today, but it all remains to be seen. But suffice it to say, we'll plan it conservatively. Is that helpful?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Absolutely. And the timeline just getting that clarity, I mean, I imagine this is probably in tandem with the same 19 dockets that you alluded to just now with the taxes?","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","We'll find out around where we end up, I'd say, on a case by case basis. In our recent electric case in March, we were at 52.5% and in the gas case, it's currently pending. I think we're ending up around there, call it, 52.5% equity relative to debt based on the staff position and the ALJ's position. So, we'll see where we're at on a case by case basis, but so far trending good as I see it, trending well I would say.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent. All right. Perfect. And just to be clear about this is the last little detail in the IRP. The less than 225 megawatts qualification here, I presume almost the entirety of what you're talking about in terms of incremental generation given the modularity element would just not require the same kind of approval process, right? It would all fall under that threshold?","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Correct. And so we put that in the no big bets category. The modular plan can match supply and demand more quickly and then we can have faster turnaround when we add new supply.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks for the clarity. All the best.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Thanks, Julien.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Ali Agha of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Good morning, Ali.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Good morning, Ali.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning. First question, I wanted to \u2013 the point you all make when you look at your CapEx plans is the big constraint you put is that customer rates should be at or below inflation in terms of growth rate. So when you apply that I just wanted to find out how much capacity do you have over your 10-year plan to increase CapEx if you needed? I'm assuming that entire $3 billion can be absorbed if it comes to fruition, but do you have even more capacity than that? How should we be thinking about that?","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Ali, I would just start by saying, as you know, we really do our detailed modeling on a five-year basis. And so, as you know, on the heels of tax reform when we provided our five-year plan that was revised to take tax reform into account we increased it from $9 billion to $10 billion. And we believe that we have \u2013 with that sort of capital investment program we can comfortably keep rates on a total basis when you include the commodity costs at or below inflation. So we feel good about that on a five-year basis.","We have not yet provided a new 10-year plan, but we have noted in the IRP it does create $3 billion of incremental supply opportunities. And so it's too premature at this point to tell whether you take the $3 billion plus our prior plan of $18 billion and that we can comfortably afford. And so there's more modeling to come on that. But I would say at this point, we are certainly going to stick to our principles as we think about the next five-year tranche and we're going to try to make sure that we can afford to spend that as well as a CapEx on an annual basis and make sure that we don't again compromise our principles around customer affordability or balance sheet strength, I might add.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Right. So, but fair to say that at a minimum if it comes to that the $3 billion increment can be absorbed on a preliminary basis?","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","We will certainly make sure that we can absorb it if we're going to offer up a plan that includes that for sure.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Right. And then separately as you alluded to this as well, so you still have some high cost debt at the holding company at the parent level. Can you just remind us what the earnings opportunity is from either paying that off or refinancing that just from a big picture perspective and is that all built into the 6% to 8% growth rate targets that you have out there?","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah. So, refinancing opportunities are not baked into the plan, or at least I'll say premature refinancing opportunities are not baked in the plan. And whether as it pertains to EPS accretion and upside, that's all a function of obviously the cost of debt that you get for the new money and so it remains to be seen the levels of accretion that we'll potentially get. We did get about a $0.01 or $0.02 of upside on the remaining tranche of our 8.75% notes that we took out which we'll realize next year but we still have, I think, at least one or two six handles at the parent coming due. I'd say the next big tranche is in Q1 of 2020 from a maturity perspective. So we'll keep an eye on it. But I think it's too premature at this point to talk about accretion, dilution and we haven't thought about what the cost of debt will be that we'll take it out and also what the tenure will be. So there are a lot of variables that go into that math, as you know.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","But that's a cushion that you still retain as you track your 6% to 8% target?","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","It's certainly an opportunity and so we always think about sources or levers that we can pull either up or down to make sure that we can continue to prolong this path of 6% to 8% growth over the long-term.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Chris Morgan of Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi. It's actually Angie Storozynski from Macquarie. So just two quick follow-ups. So one is you mentioned that the IRP would allow you to actually potentially earn on PPAs which I've never seen and so I was just wondering how that's going to be structured. And secondly, given that more and more Midwestern utilities seem to be stepping away from adding gas-fired generation, does it change your views how your semi-merchant assets will be perceived as far as contracting and then demand for these assets going forward? Thank you.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Great questions, Angie. First of all, earning on the PPA is a part of our competitive pricing expectations associated with adding new renewables. So obviously, we are biased toward owning the assets and that would be our preference. We've learned over time that long-term PPAs no matter how competitive they are when you sign them are inflexible over time and can lock our customers into paying more than they should. And so when we own the assets, we have more flexibility about how and how long they are operated. And so it definitely is a preference. However, we're also very committed to competitive pricing for customers. And so in the event that somebody with \u2013 if we do a solicitation for new solar and new solar bids come that are competitive, that are supplied by someone else, well then, we would want to make sure that our balance sheet and our investors are rewarded for being able to back up their financing for those new assets.","So, there's no doubt that they would be leveraging our balance sheet and we think that investors should be rewarded for that. So, we have a commitment or we have a proposal that would allow for that. There will be lots of discussion. And as I mentioned, the IRP is a contested proceeding and so I think that that definitely will be a point of discussion with interveners and with the commission and how that shakes out.","In terms of the role that base load gas plays, I will say we at CMS are uniquely positioned because we do have two utility base load plants or gas plants, Zeeland and Jackson as well as our Ludington Pumped Storage. When you ask about \u2013 so they provide a nice base load combination to our renewables and incremental renewables. When we talk about then DIG, you bet, DIG plays a role in the future to provide that base load continuity and dispatchability that's a benefit to Michigan to their potential customers as well as to MISO. So, they definitely -- like I mentioned earlier, we see more value for DIG outside the utility than in at this stage for that reason.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Just on the PPAs, I mean I understand that you're trying to minimize the cost to your ratepayers, but PPA does embed a certain return and so a return on the PPA plus a return equivalent to the rate base value of that PPA, wouldn't that be actually earning a return twice on the same project?","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","No. No, because if the asset was owned by someone else, you're not earning the return on twice. What's happening is, the only way that that developer can get financing for a large capital investment like that is to have quality off-taker like us and to be able to leverage our balance sheet with credit capability to show that they can then have a quality off-taker. So it's just giving recognition to the fact that we are the backstop and therefore, our investors should be recognized for that.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Andrew Levi of ExodusPoint. Please go ahead.","Andrew Stuart Levi - ExodusPoint Capital Management LP","Hey, sorry about that. Actually I think I'm all set. I mean, the only other question I have \u2013 the markets are developing \u2013 is just looking at the auto industry yesterday and the last couple days talking about steel and that cutting into their margins, obviously, you get it back through rate recovery, but just are you seeing the same thing as far as where there is pipe replacement or whatever other type of construction that you guys are doing?","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","We're not seeing it yet, but I'm sure we will. It's impossible that all the prices of commodities are going up. We're longer term purchasers. We're not buying on a daily basis like the automakers are. And so, when we sign fixed contracts for supplies for construction projects, we're more forward. And so, again, this modular build-out of renewables actually protects us from some of that too because we can build in time and adapt the plan if prices change and they become more expensive, we can adapt to different plan. So, I would say that we definitely don't have the same kind of exposures that the autos have.","Andrew Stuart Levi - ExodusPoint Capital Management LP","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Hey. Congratulations, Phil. Can you hear me?","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Good morning, Paul.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Yes. Thanks.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","So, a lot of my questions have been answered. Just back to the Michigan Court of Appeals on Greg's question, you mentioned that it doesn't impact earnings. What impact does it have, if in fact the Michigan Court of Appeals ruling holds?","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","So, the reason why we were fighting to get that corrected is because currently AES has leveraged excess capacity on the market and pass along to their customers -- to our retail open access customers basically for free and that's a cost shift to all utility customers. So, without correcting this, local clearing requirement of new generation sources, then our customers continued to pick up the tab for alternative energy suppliers customers, the retail open access customers. And so, it's all about price competitiveness. And we've gone through the math on this because we think it's wrong and we think there's two issues. One, we have to have visibility where the power is going to be supplied and because of the constraints of the Peninsula. It really does need to be -- some portion of it really does need to be located in Michigan. And in the absence of having a local clearing requirements and alternative energy supplier, then we have to build it and our customers have to pay for it even though it's benefiting retail open access customers, it's a big cost shift, it's complicated, it's not transparent and I can see how the appellate court was confused about it because it is complicated and that's why we spent so much time on the legislation, and that's why the commission plays such an important role sifting through complex issues like this. That's why we supported our commission and we think that they're absolutely in the right place on this issue.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Do you think it impacts the value of merchant capacity in Michigan?","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Well, yes, because if a local clearing requirement was instituted, DIG would be more valuable because it is in Michigan. But that really is not factored into our plans. We definitely didn't build the LCR into DIG's forward-looking earnings. What we really are talking about here is price competitiveness and standing for our utility customers.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Fair enough. And then with respect to the PPA proposal, the making -- making the impact of a PPA be reflected in the regulatory proceeding with respect to the sort of parasitic -- sort of addressing the parasitic issue of somebody having a PPA with you guys, would you guys be indifferent, I guess, is what I mean I apologize too, I haven't read the full IRP. But I mean if it was a contract versus, A, I guess, if you could just elaborate a little bit more on how you guys stand with respect to some somebody winning a PPA versus you guys building the solar facility would have the debottleneck?","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah, I do, Paul. Paul, it's a good question. Indifferent is not the right word. We're not indifferent. We would definitely prefer to own the asset. There's no doubt about that. However, we also recognize that we want price competitiveness in Michigan, and so if a PPA with our earning on it is more competitive for customers, then that would be an alternative we would entertain on behalf of customers and we have so much CapEx required in the rest of the business that it actually frees up capital to be deployed to other critical assets. So that's really how we think about. We've just had all this experience with PPAs and we talk about them all the time that when we signed the PPAs, they were great prices. 20 years later, it feels like golly, why do we have these PPAs. We'd like to be -- we'd like to have more flexibility. And so we've just learned over time that a PPA sound good on paper, you can make the numbers pen, but then in reality conditions change and you'd like to have the kind of flexibility that can better serve customers.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, awesome. And then just finally one clarification with a question Julien was asking and your answer on capital structure, you guys said that you were being conservative. Did you mean conservative being that you guys were modeling in a lower equity ratio or did you mean more conservative in that like you -- could you just elaborate a little bit, is that what you meant?","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah. When we say conservative, like I said, ultimately, we'd like to see at the current levels of about 52.5% equity relative to debt. We'd like to think given the implications of tax reform, given the realities of that aided being paid out over time and having that natural equity thickness accretion. We'd like to stay where we are today, but we'll model with some assumption that things may change over time. And so when I say conservative, it means that we're not going to take too bullish a position on where the commission may end up here.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Is that helpful?","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","That is helpful, because sometimes you might think equity's ratio being higher is more conservative, but...","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Yeah.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And that's it, and once again thanks a lot and congratulations, Phil.","Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.","Thanks, Paul.","Rejji P. Hayes - CMS Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session.

[Operator Instructions].","Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 1 PM Eastern time running through November 3. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the investor relations section. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations. ","Sri Maddipati","Good morning and thank you for joining us today. With me are Patti Poppe, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Webb, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. ","This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these measures to most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Patti. ","Patti Poppe","Thanks, Sri. Good morning, everyone, thanks for joining us on our third quarter earnings call. For those of you who have not yet met Sri, he is our new Treasurer and Vice President of IR. Sri has been with CMS for a couple years and we're excited to have him in his new role. ","I'll begin the presentation with an update to earnings and describe our simple but powerful model. Tom will then provide the detailed financial results and outlook and we'll finish with some Q&A. ","We're happy to report adjusted earnings for the first three quarters are up $0.22 and we have narrowed our guidance to the high end of our forecasted range of $2 to $2.02 or 6% to 7% over last year's performance. As a reminder, we previously announced our long term adjusted EPS guidance of 6% to 8% and we're introducing today specific 2017 earnings guidance of $2.13 to $2.17 a share. It was a strong quarter and that sets us up for a strong finish to 2016. That strong finish will be led by our continued implementation of the Consumers Energy way. We're proud of our consistent financial performance.","My coworkers are motivated to serve our families, friends and neighbors. There are many times, however, when those same coworkers, in spite of their best efforts, are unable to serve our customers to our desired standard. Many of our processes are burdened with waste that goes unchecked and the CE way is simply a lean operations model focused squarely on business results through customer-focused standards, implemented by enabled employees working within well-designed and standard processes in a mindset that every day there's an opportunity for continuous improvement. Completing our work safely with high quality, low cost and on time will deliver the same consistent results for customers and investors that we have had for over a decade.","As a result of our efforts, I am more confident than ever in our ability to deliver our simple but powerful model. We have depth in our organic capital plan. I have yet to attend a meeting where we have trouble identifying opportunities to invest. We have a long shopping list with lots of investments that improve safety, reliability, affordability and our customer's experience. Nothing new here. We will tackle the structural costs with these smart investments, good business decision-making and continuous process improvement. We plan conservatively for sales growth and we don't dilute our earnings black equity. All of this adds up to a sustainable model that enables investment while keeping our rates affordable. Like I said, our shopping list is long and we're not making any big bets to fill out the plan.","We have a large electric distribution system. It's made up of over 70,000 miles of conductor, 1200 substations that all need to be upgrade and maintained. And we have a lot of work to do just to modernize our grid, starting with completing our electric smart meter installations in 2017. We continue to increase our gas investments. I'd like to remind people that we have a great gas business, where smart investments have real return for our customers. We still have to say no to projects because we can't spend more than our customers can afford. Our generation fleet continues to evolve in small bites, incremental renewables, capacity upgrades, coal to gas conversions.","These are all small bets that add real value and cost savings, cleaner energy and reliability for our customers. And future PPA replacements could even potentially allow for additional investment without affecting customers' bills. The ability to pay is always our limiting factor which is why we're so focused on sustainable and structural cost reductions. It is not easy to be the leader of the pack on cost reduction year over year over year, however that is our ambition. ","Let me remind you that many of our previous decisions were structural, permanent and have many years of favorable impact. For example our conversion to defined contribution plans that significantly reduced our long term liabilities. Each year as my coworkers retire and replaced by a new workforce, we save about 1.6% of the previous year's O&M before we tackle a single work process improvement with the CE way. We have a lot more gas pedal in waste elimination that results in real cost savings. Those cost savings then allow us to be focused on making our prices competitive so that we can continue to be part of the Michigan growth story. We're seeing positive momentum, cooperation and success stories related to our customers' growth and economic development in our service territory. We're bullish on Michigan.","The more we improve our business model, the more companies and their employees will choose Michigan as a place to locate or grow their businesses. And the stats don't lie. Michigan is growing faster than the U.S. average. And Grand Rapids, the heart of our electric territory, is going faster than the Michigan average. We feel great about being part of that success today and into the future. And still, we plan conservatively for load growth. As we continue to maximize customer value with a strong investment portfolio, to drive waste out of our operations and to let customer affordability be our throttle, we will continue to deliver high-end and quality earnings growth.","Our constructive relationships with our state policymakers, legislators and regulators is based on keeping our promise to perform and to care for our customers and communities. And performance is power. When we perform at best-in-class levels, we can earn the trust and admiration and deliver hometown service for our customers. Day in and day out, you and our customers can count on us.","Now I'll turn the call over to Tom. ","Tom Webb","Thanks, Patti. Third quarter results, at $0.67, were up $0.14 compared with a year ago. Adjusted to exclude the cost of our voluntary separation program, results were $0.70 or up $0.17. In either case, this is substantially better than our original plan even as it reflects meaningful O&M reinvestment, permitted by cost reductions ahead of plan and the warm muggy summer. Now for the first nine months overall, our GAAP earnings were $1.70 per share, up $0.19 from last year. Adjusted for the VSP cost, results were $1.73, up $0.22 or 23% on a weather-normalized basis. As you can see here again, our performance in the first nine months is $0.22 better than last year.","Adverse weather hurt $0.10. We blew away our 5% to 7% EPS growth target, growing more than 10%, including the mild winter weather. Improvements included benefit savings, lower uncollectible accounts, cold plant closures, hole-top hardening, higher demand and productivity at dig, to name just a few of the areas. Looking ahead into the fourth quarter, if weather is just normal, we will accomplish a nice uptick of $0.13 compared with 2015. And as you know, we already have a head start on the fourth quarter, with cost reductions well ahead of plan. We also have an electric rate case underway and that was self-implemented at $170 million on September 1. We filed a gas rate case last August which will support 2017.","We have plenty of room for reinvesting O&M for our customers this year and we raised our 2016 guidance to the high end of our 5% to 7% range. This has become an investor-favorite slide, where we show our projected earnings per share growth for the full year. And this is as the year progresses. During the first quarter mild winter weather and abnormal storms reduced earnings per share by $0.13, but in a very short period of time we were right back on track for our adjusted earnings growth at 5% to 7%. You can see the improvements that offset the abnormal weather with no impact on customers. We're well ahead of our guidance and as always, are putting the upside to work for customers improving reliability, pulling ahead work from next year, as well as pre-funding debt maturities. And we will deliver consistent peer-leading earnings per share growth. We beat guidance and delivered 7% adjusted earnings growth for almost 15 years. Here is a picture of that track record.","It shows how we consistently offset bad news and put good news to use for our customers without compromising predictable earnings growth of 7% each and every year. Over the last three years favorable weather and cost reductions in excess of our plan generated room to reinvest $0.25 billion for our customers. $0.25 billion. Half of that came from favorable weather and half from cost productivity better than planned. That is a big number. We put these savings to work in many beneficial ways. So by this year we're 20% ahead of our plan. Our customers and investors really will benefit. In addition to our cost performance, our conservative view of sales growth and our ability to avoid diluted equities, we still have other attractive upsides.","As you can see in this slide, continued layering in of energy and capacity sales could enable us to increase our profitability by $20 million to $40 million at our Dearborn industrial generation operations. Recent capacity sales have exceeded $4 a kilowatt month. This is a nice insurance policy for our utility, if it needs more capacity and a catalyst for new growth. And to help you with your own assessment of our future performance, here is our standard profit and cash flow sensitivity slide. Recall the impacts from many legislative changes are not in our plan. Interest rate shifts up or down largely offset at our Company as changes in debt cost offset changes in discount rates on our pension plans. We believe in no big bets and strong risk mitigation. And here is our report card. For 2016, we're right on course to achieve our plans for capital investment, a high-quality balance sheet, competitive customer prices, a robust dividend payout and strong operating cash flow.","We're well ahead of our adjusted earnings per share growth in the 5% to 7% range, therefore we raised guidance to the high end. We have introduced specific guidance for 2017 at $2.13 to $2.17, up 6% to 8% for this year. Count on another strong year, our 15th in a row, with high-end predictable earnings, cash flow and dividend growth. This is my 57th CMS quarterly call in a row, maybe my voice is wearing out and has been sharing with you the results of a great team delivering consistent industry-leading earnings per share growth for over 14 years. We intend to continue this next year and for a long time. ","Our earnings and dividend growth continue at a predictable high pace every year, no matter what is happening in the economy, the weather, politics or succession planning. And I think all of you who have met Patti can certainly attest to that. Thank you for your interest and your support. Patti and I would be delighted to take your questions.","So Tracy, would you be kind enough to open the telephone lines? Thank you. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from the line of [indiscernible] with UBS. Your line is open.","Julien Dumoulin ","It's Julien. Just a couple of questions, can you go over a little bit of what the pull forward poor opportunities for the $0.15 you kind of delayed here. Just give us a little bit of the flavor of each one of those in terms of what they mean in terms of the timing perspective recognition in '17 onward and then I have a follow-up in some policies. ","Tom Webb","Absolutely. What Julian is talking to if you have all the slides handy it was slide number 12. The slide I called an investor favorite, I know it's my. I just got that curve in it with the little blue box in it, that blue box in terms of what are some of the pull ahead. What are some choices that we have, with all this favorable performance from better cost reductions and we have actually planned and we have a nice toasty summer here at the end with a nice humidity that we don't always get in lovely Michigan which helped us a bit. But in that box you will see a few different items. First one is pull aheads, those are traditional things that we do, if we can take work from next year and pull it into this year it makes the job we have to do next year easier and so some examples are there are some small outages that we are able to pull ahead, a little bit of tree trimming got pulled ahead during the course of the year, things that improve reliability, things that help us be a better company for our customers and make our job a little easier as we go into 2017.","The next item that\u2019s listed there is called debt pre-funding. I think everybody knows we're such chickens that we go out and pre-fund our parent debt at least two years in advance to ensure that if there was a nightmarish scenario of 2007 or 2008 proportions we would not have any exposure in the capital markets. This is some of that, this is simply pulling ahead some debt that will mature calling that potentially when it's economic and doing a little more financing for that. It's a little bit of bad news for this year, so it's one of those choices that helps you in the next year or two, that\u2019s a nice one.","There is a list at the bottom there that talks about operations and quality. There are so many things that we can do to be better for our customers that aren't necessarily in our rate cases and not necessarily in our basic plans, but we will do those. I will just give you one example, Patti has talked and I have talked about the consumers energy way. Well sometimes it takes a little bit of money to bring in the talent to help you make these changes in your processes to the better ways of doing things. ","So this gives us a little more resource to do some of that work even sooner than we plan to do so that we can get ahead of the game that improves on our quality, it improves on our delivery, improves on our cost and makes us a healthier better company for you but importantly for our customers and then the reason I picked the third one last it's sort of what happens towards the end of the year. We get a choice of how much money can we put into our company foundation and to low income funds to help customers, to help the people of Michigan, to help our hometown team quite candidly and in some years even though we have been strained where we have a very big storm at the end of the year and maybe we don't have as many resources to put towards that, but in other years we have an opportunity to catch up a little bit and put some more money into the foundation and those are the choices we get to make towards the end of the year.","So that gives you a little bit of sense on what the things are -- the categories and how they can help you next year ensure that your growth in 6% to 8% zone which is an important commitment for us becomes easier to do or more difficult to do as far as that goes but in this case it makes it a little bit easier. Julian, I hope that helps. We will go to your next question. ","Julien Dumoulin","Absolutely just real quickly, can you elaborate a little bit on what your thoughts and expectations coming out of this [indiscernible] Michigan deal are? Certainly we heard from your peers yesterday but we want to get your view and specifically can you comment on what kind of rate, what's the ballpark and to the extent that the rate may be higher than what you are seeing out there in MISO capacity. Would that also bode well for your pricing on your big assets at least the ones folks might want to contract with local merchant assets instead of paying the capacity charge under that construct? ","Patti Poppe","There are a lot of things in-flight with the MISO filing and what the implications are. So I'll try and break it down a little bit and then answer completely your question. So first of all MISO is filing for somewhere around November 1. This opportunity for a three year forward-looking auction and we think that\u2019s important addition to Michigan for all of MISO but it's definitely important to Michigan given our hybrid regulatory construct.","Therefore their filing has a provision for what's called prevailing state compensation mechanism which the State works with MISO to establish in order for the state to have an alternative in the event that forward showing auction and our forward-looking statements looking capacity shows shortfall so in the event of a shortfall typically the option would go simply to cone [ph] and that would set the price. So to your question on prices yes the capacity prices would go up just with the auction, but if Michigan sees a look at short fall then they implement prevailing state compensation mechanism which requires them the alternative energy suppliers to show that they have owned or contractor capacity for the subsequent three planning years and then their customers pay a capacity charge that the NPS fee will have the authority to set","So obviously that charge has an impact on the alternative energy supplier customers but what we think is fair about that is that if additional capacity is required, then the people who are requiring are actually paying for it versus our bundled customers, so it protects our full bundle customers because we know that we will have adequate supply to serve our customers.","Now from a DIG perspective I will let Tom address what the implications for DIG might be if that MISO auction. ","Tom Webb","Naturally, the more people have to turn to find those resources. Now they can't get -- I will call it a free ride that I mean that in a very constructive and complementary way, but they can't get a free ride. They got to go secure their capacity, well there is only so many places to go to get capacity in zone seven and nearby zones. So obviously that could help in and that fits in with why we set this layering in strategy. We try not to be too greedy thinking that we stay out of the capacity markets all of sudden we can get everything at some peak price. We're trying to layer it and just recently we layered in, I mentioned it in the tax, a little more good news we did a little more capacity sales above $4 a kilowatt month, so that\u2019s an opportunity that could help but don't forget DIG can also be just an excellent backup to our own utility if there is a need for that capacity and that\u2019s another reason why we haven't committed all of it so far. ","Patti Poppe","And then Julien I guess I would just add one more implication then for the utility in the event of this implementation. If the alternative energy supplier can't secure additional capacity, then it defaults to and then the NPS can direct the utility to build out that capacity and that then those charges will be assigned to those alternative energy suppliers so that is definitely a potential. Now the timing of all this, the filing for MISO is November of this year. We think there won't be a final ruling from FERC until 2017 and that implies then that it won't be available at -- the earliest it would be available would be in the 2018 auction which is actually for the 20\/21\/22 planning years.","So there's a lot of time and a lot of things that can change between here and there but we know why MISO is motivated because they are concerned about reliability, long term and transparency of the supply and we agree with their concerns. I will reiterate though that our plan and our CapEx forward plans do not require that this MISO provision be in place. We do not require that the energy lobby be past, we really are in a position that our plans is solid with or without either the energy law or the MISO tariff approval. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore. Your line is now open. ","Greg Gordon","So just to be clear, your base plan and the growth rate don\u2019t necessarily rely on or expect significant improvement in financial performance as DIG. So when I look at slide 14, and you\u2019ve said this before so I just want to make sure it's still the case, did that expand potential theoretical expansion in revenues is not necessarily for you to achieve your growth targets, correct?","Tom Webb","It definitely is not. What you see in yellow on that slide is all the ability to create more headroom. We do not need any of that to meet our growth targets starting next year at 6% to 8%. ","Greg Gordon","Great. Can I go a little bit further afield and ask a question with regard to the Palisades nuclear contract? It strikes me that when that contract was initially signed, power prices were at a totally different planet than they are today. And it looks like that MISO power prices are significantly lower than what you're going to be paying over time for the power coming from that asset. When you think about both the energy and the capacity that you are getting from Palisades, is there a theoretical construct where it would be in the best interest of the customers to restructure or buy out that contract? ","Tom Webb","You are always very good at your analysis, but this is a subject that we actually can't talk about today and I hope you will appreciate that. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Your line is now open. ","Ali Agha","Looking at the weather-normalized electrics sales through the nine months, it appears that they are up 0.5%. Does the 1% target for the year still look good? Or what should we be assuming now for the year? Real good, it really does look good. I know you can see the pieces there. When you look at the pieces, I call residential up 0.5 point, commercial down 0.5 point for the year to date September. I call that flat. I just wash those out. Even though net, those numbers were positive to earnings. ","You'll see the industrial side is up about 2%. We see some good information that is flowing through production plans that people have for the rest of the year. And we are quite comfortable with assuming that residential and commercial will still be flattish. We're not going to try to predict 0.1 or 0.2 or 0.3 up or down, either way. And we still think the industrial side is going to be up about 2.5%, giving us a good 1% growth. ","Let me give you little color. We have seen some pipelines and other utilities, not us but other utilities, doing pretty well. And we have watched the manufacturing side in chemicals and plastics doing very well. Duh, nice oil prices and gas prices, so they are able to do good business here from Michigan. And even the automotive side continues to be robust. ","Now, on the negative side we have seen some of the steel fabrication businesses and companies struggling a little bit. So some of that mineral side and steel fabrication, not doing as well. But net-net, some nice upticks in the sector. And when we get a chance to look at where people are scheduling their production for the rest of the year and the things they are going to do, we feel pretty comfortable about where we are. And Tom, remind me, is that the run rate you use when going forward, roughly 1% annual growth? ","Tom Webb","We probably wouldn't say that. We are so doggone conservative that we like to tell you just think somewhere between flat to 1% growth, that's about how we plan the future, because that's how we look at our business. We try to get a sense that, plan it low. You've heard my story many times about my experiences back at Ford and why that pays out because if you are wrong and it is a little higher than you think, that is a helpful thing as you go through a given year.","If you are wrong and it is lower, then that is a struggle and you got to do things that you might not have planned to do to make your commitment to your customers and your commitment to your investors. So we would rather be on that conservative side. So off the top of my head, I would like to think when we run numbers we run them from flat to 1% and anywhere in that zone we feel pretty good. ","Ali Agha","Separately, when you benchmark your costs versus your peer group, right now where do you think you are? Are you in the top quartile, the second quartile? Where are we in terms of benchmarking what all you have done so far? ","Patti Poppe","Yes, I would say, Ali, total costs were in the top quartile. Those structural changes that we've made, the long-term cost savings that we've put in place, puts us in total. However, where we see the big opportunity is in our distribution operations, both gas and electric are still middle of the pack. And so our pursuit of both the great customer experience and low cost structure, really, we feel like that's where a lot of our headroom lives. That's why we're working so hard on our process improvements. ","Ali Agha","I see. Last question. I know in both the rate cases you get asked for the investment recovery mechanism. Previously the staff and the Commission has not been very supportive of that. Any sign that this time around they're thinking differently? Or anything you can point to? ","Patti Poppe","We have had good luck with our gas-enhanced infrastructure replacement program, which is essentially an investment recovery mechanism on our gas business. And so I think that has earned some trust and respect with the commission. I think they are more open to it. Their bigger concern is infrastructure reliability in the state. Post Flint, our Commission is very adamant that not on our watch will we have another infrastructure crisis related to the utilities. So it makes the conditions more amenable to these investment recovery mechanisms. ","Though they do want to -- and they have gone on the record saying they like having annual rate cases where they can see and we can pass on cost savings. So I think it is an opportunity to continue to grow those investment recovery mechanisms, but not necessarily get a flat rider on capital where we don't have to go in for rate cases. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar. Your line is now open.","Travis Miller","I was wondering, when you talk about the play between the cost savings that you guys are realizing in a big way and being able to keep customer bills either low or from rising faster. I wonder if you could give a sense for how much of that cost savings you are seeing right now, that $0.32 from the nine months or even the future cost savings would go back to that customer, i.e., through lower bills or through slower rising bills? ","Tom Webb","100%, here is the point behind that. In the short period of time where we might have a cost reduction this year that clearly will have an impact on our business and our results, right? We look for those annual rate cases that Patti just talked about, and it is one of the key features of the annual rate case. ","Primarily it is to collect on the capital investment that we are making for our customers, but it's also our mechanism to give back that money to our customers with our O&M cost reductions. The lag is just from the period that there is to the next rate case. So we will share that with them and we set as a goal on our base rates to try to keep that growth at or below the rate of inflation. So pick your number, everyone has a different real inflation number, but let's just say it is 2%. If we can stay under that 2% then that means those base rates are going up -- they're going down negatively on a real basis. ","So that is our goal and we are constantly doing that work to share with them. Now, I grant you, it gives us more headroom so that we can do more of that capital investment which does then grow the business for earnings. Does that get at your question? ","Travis Miller","Yes, absolutely. ","Tom Webb","Thank you. ","Travis Miller","Thank you very much. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Your line is now open. ","Paul Ridzon","Can you give your view of what is happening in the legislature and what we can expect before year end? ","Patti Poppe","You bet. As I am sure you have seen a little bit of the press that's been out in the last week or so, the Michigan Chamber has now endorsed the bill package. And that is allowing for some more momentum and there has been a compromise on the renewable portfolio standard at 15% for 2021 that's bringing some more Democrats on board. Therefore, there seems to be quite a bit of momentum. However, we have seen momentum before, so we really are cautiously optimistic. ","Arlan Meekhof, the Majority Senate Leader, and Mike Nofs, the Energy Chair out of the Senate, are working hard toward a vote post election. With the proper momentum and a good vote count, they will take that vote and potentially move it then into the House. So there's a lot of things that would have to come to fruition to get it to pass in the House. But with the right momentum and bipartisan support and the support of the Michigan Chamber, it is more likely, I would say, than ever, but I still put odds around 50-50 that it gets done before year end. ","And as you know, Paul, we continue to reiterate our plan doesn't require the law but we think it is good policy for Michigan. We think it is important that energy resource supply be transparent and that the cost allocations be fair for new and additional capacities. This suite of Bills does that work and does a good job of it, so we are supportive of it. But again, our plan doesn't count on it and it doesn't require it. ","Paul Ridzon","And none of the compromises that have been made -- or I should say all the compromises have vetted with the governor and he's still okay with it? ","Patti Poppe","Yes. The administration has been very supportive. They have concern about resource adequacy in Michigan, particularly for the power provided by the alternative energy suppliers. They have real frustration that it is not transparent where that power is coming from. And the administration and the Commission and the utilities have been very clear that we want to make sure that it is transparent, that we have adequate supply for the whole state. We know we have adequate supply for our customers. We want to make sure that the alternative energy suppliers also have adequate supply one way or another for their customers. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Russo with Ladenberg Thalmann. Your line is now open. ","Brian Russo","Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But I am just curious that the Senate Bill 437 that was just referenced, will that change your capital budget, either by size or mix of investments? ","Patti Poppe","We don't think so. Our CapEx plan and as you saw in our slides, our generation strategy is smaller and smaller bets. We want to make sure that we build for necessary load, that we are focused on a diverse portfolio that can adjust as load shifts and so that we can make quicker, smaller bets rather than long, long-term big bets. So there is nothing in the provisions of the law that would change that strategy. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital Advisors. Your line is now open.","Andy Levi","What was the reason you can't discuss Palisades? ","Tom Webb","Usually when you make a no comment answer, that's it. Actually it is because my voice is cracking up. I have got nothing left. Truthfully, this just is one of those subjects that we are not able to talk about and you can imagine why. ","Andy Levi","And then on a bigger picture, if the Palisades contract was ceased, we will just leave it like that, how many megawatts, remind us how many megawatts that would be. ","Tom Webb","I think about 800 megawatts. ","Andy Levi","800 megawatts. Obviously number one, it could either be restructured, that could be a way you could also get out of it. One of the opportunities would be to you to replace that power with your own generation? Or with a DIG or what would be the strategy and opportunity for CMS? ","Tom Webb","It's something that we really can't get into. So we appreciate the question and your patience. ","Patti Poppe","But I will say this. Generally, about our capacity planning strategy, we have alternative options. When PPAs do come off and we have a couple -- we have many PPAs, and as they retire and we decide whether we're going to renegotiate those PPAs or replace them, we do have options to bring in -- to do more bilaterals with other energy suppliers, or to build new capacity, incremental renewables, more demand response and energy efficiency. We are doing a lot of, obviously, capacity planning to make sure that we have adequate supply for all of our customers for all the years to come. ","It is an exciting time because we have a lot of smaller bet options that can provide for a very diverse portfolio for serving our customers. And that frees up, then, investment room in our electric distribution system and our gas business where we have significant investment requirements. So we really have a good balanced approach right now. ","Andy Levi","Really the bottom line is whether it is this contract or any contract PPAs that are dropping off, one of the opportunities is to replace it with basically a self-build or some type of capacity that you would be the owner of. ","Patti Poppe","Sure. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Your line is now open. ","Paul Patterson","I just wanted to follow up on the MISO capacity team, or scheme. What I am wondering is that, if an alternative energy provider doesn't buy capacity on his own, he would be assessed the capacity charge, is my understanding, for buying it from you guys or other utilities. Is that correct? ","Patti Poppe","It actually would work as a charge to the customer of the alternative energy supplier, not the energy supplier themselves. ","Paul Patterson","Okay. That actually answers my question. Thank you. And then the second question that I have is, there is this transmission discussion with MISO and the governor about bringing in Canadian power to Michigan as a means of lowering prices. I was wondering if you had any color on that, if you guys might participate in something like -- it's a project or something like that. Or any thoughts you guys had on that. ","Patti Poppe","So the MISO study that the state requested really has several components. One is the feasibility of connecting the Upper Peninsula, which is not our service territory. Zone 2 in the MISO zone to Sault Ste. Marie and between Sault Ste. Marie and Ontario. Then looking at connecting the UP and the Lower Peninsula to an existing transmission project in Gaylord. Or starting a large gas plant constructed up north somewhere up in the UP. ","So it's a variety of studies and they are all pointing to one situation as trying to be correct, and that is the resource adequacy issue. Because of our regulatory construct in Michigan, there is this loophole in the UP that has caused a major cost shift up there. So they are trying to figure out a way to better serve the people of the Upper Peninsula. ","We participate to the extent that we are energy experts and the governor relies on us for our input and insights, but the study that they requested from MISO really will help frame up the situation, I would say. And when it is complete, we will certainly obviously take a look and see what the options are. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Your line is open. ","Paul Ridzon","I recently saw someone's planning a large gas plant in Michigan right on the Indiana border. Do you have any thoughts on that? I don't know if you have seen it or not. I don't remember the name of the plant, unfortunately. ","Tom Webb","I don't know who you are talking about that's doing that. But people are constantly looking at should we built here, build there? When you are down in that general area, you might be talking about Illinois solutions. And you are probably aware that, for instance, Covert, one of the larger IPPs that is left, is hooked up to PJM, but they are in the process, potentially, of selling their plant. ","So these things are dynamic but I don't have a lot of specifics on that particular question. But I will tell you what I will do, I will double-check after I am off the call and if there is something of substance we know about, we will share that. ","Operator","There are no further questions. I turn the call back over to the presenters. ","Patti Poppe","Great, thank you. And thanks for listening to our call today, everybody. We appreciate your interest and definitely appreciate your ownership. Tom and I look forward to seeing many of you at EEI in just a couple weeks. ","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

With me are Patti Poppe, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website.","Now I will turn the call over to Patti.","Patti Poppe","Thank you, Sri. Good morning, everyone. We are happy to have you with us. I know that we saw many of your at our Investor Day on September 25th and we'll see many of you at EEI, so I'll be brief this morning. But we do have a few updates to share, including our results for the quarter, and not to worry, we have another exciting story of the month. Rejji will walk you through the financial results and our outlook.","We're happy to announce that for the first nine months of 2017 we reported $1.66 of adjusted EPS. On a weather normalized basis, this is up 8% from last year. Despite challenging weather and storms through the year, we are well on track to meet our guidance, and we're raising our bottom end of our top -- of our full year guidance from $2.14 to $2.15 per share. Our top end remains unchanged at $2.18 per share.","We're also introducing 2018 full year guidance of $2.29 to $2.33 per share, which implies another year of 6% to 8% annual growth. Now this is a good opportunity for me to remind you what we mean when we say 6% to 8%.","For 14 years in a row, we have delivered 7%, so it would be easy to assume that we when moved from 5% to 7% to 6% to 8% we meant to imply 8%. What we actually signalled is our confidence in 7%, and frankly, we took 5% off the table.","Our self funding model and our adaptability under a variety of changing conditions each year puts us in a unique position to deliver sustainable 6% to 8% annual growth. This is why we have confidence in the midpoint of our range.","In years where we have particularly strong performance and don't have higher priorities for reinvestment, we could go to the high end. However, our bias is to reinvest in the business and to stack the deck for next year and deliver our growth trajectory for longer. We know it is both our growth rate and the consistency of it that is valued.","To that end, we remain unwavering in our commitment to the triple bottom line. Our focus on people, planet and profit underpinned by our performance will deliver the consistent and sustainable results that you have come to expect.","When we say people, we are referring to our customers, our co-workers, our communities, and of course, our investors. Driving economic development in Michigan is a great way to enable growth and to serve the people of Michigan. We know that when Michigan wins, our business wins. It's a competitive environment and these large site selection efforts and Michigan is winning.","In part, due to the speed of our in-house economic development team which has identified 23 energy ready sites so that when a company wants to locate here we can quickly help them find a site that's available and best suited to their needs.","For example, we were pleased that when Lear Corporation, a large auto supplier was looking for a place to locate a new manufacturing facility, we were ready. As a result, Lear recently announced plans to invest in a new plant in Flint, a community we are proud to serve. This is another win for Michigan creating approximately 450 new jobs.","Turning to the planet, we're thrilled with the response to our renewable tariff. This program allows us to partner with our large business customers to meet their commitment to renewable energy at a very competitive price. We're already looking for ways to expand this program to keep up with our customers demand and partner with them to protect the planet.","Finally, our commitment to people and the planet can't be fulfilled without the critical capital that you have all provided. We know that pensioners, retirees and moms and pops have entrusted you with their life savings to invest in safe and reliable places. We want you to count on us to be just that sort of place. Therefore, we are equally committed to delivering consistent and predictable financial results.","We continue to progress on the regulatory agenda and look for ways to support longer-term planning. The 2016 energy law creates a framework for the governor's long-term energy plan and our commission has been systematically implementing the different elements of it.","For example, we'll be filing our integrated resource plan required by the new law next year. Combined with the commissions ordered 5-year electric distribution plan, we'll be providing a vivid picture of the future replacements, upgrades and enhancements to our large and aging electric supply and distribution system in partnership with the commission and its staff, yielding more transparency and regulatory certainty going forward.","Our rate cases remain on track. Our gas rate case was approved at $29 million and it included and expanded $18 million capital tracking mechanism. We plan to file our upcoming gas case in the next couple of weeks.","Our new electric rates were self implemented at $130 million on October 1st. We expect a final order in March of 2018. These rate cases enable the infrastructure improvement that deliver real value to our customers and reflect the cost savings that help reduce the price of that infrastructure.","One way we are driving our ongoing cost savings is through the implementation of the Consumers Energy Way, our lean operating system. Most of the coverage about the Consumers Energy Way has been about the benefits of those cost savings. My story for this month however, demonstrates the power of the CE Way to not only reduce cost through waste elimination but also to enable better system performance and areas like electric reliability to the benefit of our customers.","You know we've been in business for 130 years, and yet, we still find things we can improve every single day. About a year ago, we realized that our approach to improving reliability was just not working as fast as we wanted, so we stepped back and leveraging our CE Way playbook, we tackled the systemic issue in a whole new way. The result speaks for themselves.","In spite of challenging weather and storm activity, we had our best system reliability ever recorded this quarter. Our talented team tackled the problem through the use of data and applied problem solving techniques, and as a result, we improved the prioritization of capital investments on our worst-performing circuits, we actually call those our Dirty Thirty.","We had more targeted tree trimming and we realized that we could effectively engineer animal mitigation at our substations. Yes, the CE Way even helps us protect our local critters. This coordinated effort resulted in a 40% improvement in reliability for this quarter versus our last 10 year average. Every dollar we spend is more effective. The waste is eliminated, and our customers have a better experience.","I am sure this sounds simplistic, but when we apply the CE Way every day all across our system in big and small ways, we fuel our simple but powerful business model, higher value at lower cost built on our consistent past and yields a sustainable future that you and your clients can count on.","Now I'll turn the call over to Rejji.","Rejji Hayes","Thank you, Patti, and good morning everyone. We know how busy, this time of the year is for the investment community, and as such, we greatly appreciate your interest in our company.","As posted earlier this morning, we reported $0.61 earnings per share on a GAAP basis for the third quarter and $0.62 per share on an adjusted basis. Our third quarter results are down $0.08 from last year, largely due to continued mild weather, however, on a weather-normalized basis, adjusted EPS for the quarter was up 7% year-over-year.","Year-to-date, we reported per-share earnings per share of $1.65 on a GAAP basis and $1.66 on an adjusted basis, which is down $0.07 from the prior year due to mild weather and significant storm activity, but up 8% year-over-year on a weather-normalized basis.","We remain quite pleased with our performance to-date, which is $0.16 per share, ahead of plan, largely due to favorable sales mix and strong cost performance. We're well on track to meet our annual financial objectives, and as a result, as Patti highlighted, we decided to raise the low end of our 2017 EPS guidance range so our revised range is now $2.15 to $2.18 per share.","As you can see on the waterfall chart on Slide eight, weather and storms have negatively impacted our year-to-date results by $0.24 per share. As noted, we have largely offset those impacts through strong cost performance and favorable sales mix, coupled with rate relief and our performance at enterprises which positions us well for the fourth quarter.","As we look ahead to the remainder of the year, you'll note that the regulatory outcomes achieved this year, including the aforementioned electric rate case self implementation of $130 million provided $0.08 of pickup relative to last year, which gets us over a third of the way home.","As we've discussed in the past, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we took on a number of discretionary reinvestment activities which equated to $0.14 per share on aggregate that we do not need to replicate this year. But some of those two factors alone put us within the implied range for required EPS outperformance versus Q4 of 2016 to meet our revised 2017 EPS guidance range.","Consequently, we have a great deal of optionality in the final months of the year to manage weather uncertainty and\/or to reinvestment business to support our future financial and operational objectives.","Our 2017 EPS outlook curve on Slide nine embodies our efforts to date, and the goods financial flexibility that we have going into the fourth quarter. As you'll note, weather and storms have hurt us in every quarter this year. And every quarter, we've responded with sound operational and financial planning to stay on course to meet our financial objectives while delivering world-class customer experience.","As mentioned, favorable sales mix has been helpful to date, and we have supplemented that with strong cost performance, including lower than planned financing cost, higher energy efficiency incentives and strong property and income tax planned. As always, every year offers varying levels of uncertainty such as weather and storm activity, but we have always managed to work and driven cost savings to position ourselves well to deliver another year of consistent financial performance.","As Patti noticed -- as Patti noted, our bias is to reinvest in the business, to stack the deck for the next year, and we are cautiously optimistic about our ability to do so again this year.","In order to stay on this path over the long term, we remain focused on executing on our capital planet utility going forward while self funding roughly, 70% of that rate-based growth. This approach minimizes customer rate impact and allows us to grow at 6% to 8% annually. This simple, but unique, business model has driven our historical success and offers a sustainable plan to deliver the triple bottom line in the years to come.","At our Investor Day, we highlighted the current customer investment plan at $18 billion over 10 years. We also reiterated the incremental $7 billion of customer investment opportunities which is evenly split between infrastructure and supply investments. We have a relatively large and old system and our proposed investments would improve system reliability and safety to the benefit of our customers and investors.","We will look to execute on these incremental opportunities overtime, assuming we can continue to identify cost savings opportunities to fund such investments. As we've said in the past, our key constraint is customer affordability and we do not intend to compromise that principal going forward.","To that end, in order to fund our robust capital plan, we will continue to [Indiscernible] our cost structure for savings opportunities. We've emphasized O&M as a key component of our cost reduction strategy in the past and we'll continue to do so. But O&M only represents about $1 billion of roughly $5 billion cost structure, so we don't limit our thinking to just O&M.","For example, future expirations of above market PPAs will reduce fuel and power supply cost and our clean and lean capital investment philosophy will prioritize modular investments to reduce cost and allow us to adapt to changing load patterns.","Through the CE Way, we will identify process improvements and efficiencies to eliminate waste and we'll couple that with good business decisions such as attrition management to reduce future O&M cost and we'll always seek opportunistic, non operating savings on our balance sheet or through good tax planning to supplement our operational efforts as we've done for the past several years. These are just a few examples that would enable us to reduce cost well into the future for our customers and create headroom for future investments.","Moving to operating cash flow, we have generated approximately $1.2 billion year-to-date and we feel good about our ability to deliver approximately $1.65 billion for the full year with steady growth thereafter.","As a reminder, our cash flow generation coupled with strong tax planning will enable us to fund our capital plan cost efficiently by avoiding black equity issuances.","On Slide 14, we show our historical EPS trajectory for the past few years and where we're headed. And it should come as no surprise that our guidance is consistent with the past and reflects our long-term growth aspirations.","As we've done the past, we've raised the bottom end of this year's guidance and initiated next year's base in the midpoint. As you know, we grow up our actual results without adjusting for things like weather, or rebasing off a prior midpoint. Needless to say, we've been on the steady climb for more than a decade and we plan to continue to deliver well into the future.","In closing, as we look ahead, we see a number of customer investments and cost reduction opportunities that will enable us to continue to deliver the triple bottom line of people, planet and profit underpinned by performance.","And with that, we would like to open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much Mr. Hayes.[Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey good morning. Congrats on a impressive results given the weather and everything.","Patti Poppe","Good morning, Julien.","Rejji Hayes","Good morning.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. So a quick question, perhaps starting a little bit bigger picture here. You talked about the IRP coming up here, you also have in your slides talk of a kind of a gradual coal evolution in the plan and ops of 21% to 15%. Can you talk about how the IRP might reconcile against the Slide 15 here and what you talked about in terms of future coal capacity in the portfolio?","Patti Poppe","Yes, it actually will provide a lot of visibility to that, Julien. We're really excited about having the IRP available to us. It provides a framework and the certainly so as we make those long-term transitions, we are able to have alignment with our commissions and make good decisions together about balancing a variety of factors; fuel diversity, cost for customers, how we want to fulfill the RPS standards, how much energy efficiency and demand response we want, in fact, our IRP, looks like it's going to have 47 different model runs that we're undertaking right now, as we speak.","And so it's a complex set of variables and we're excited about what the opportunities will be provided and the transparency and frankly regulatory certainty that will be a result of it.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. If I can delve...oh sorry, please go for it Rejji.","Rejji Hayes","Julien, this is Rejji. The only thing I would add is, as you look at Slide 15 and that coal capacity from 21% to 15%, one of the underlying assumption is the conversion of the Filer City plant at enterprises. And so we're planning to convert that from coal to natural gas, so basically going from 60 megawatts of coal to about 225 megawatts of natural gas. That is in the regulatory process and it's trending well. So that is one component of the road to get from 21% to 15%.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. Can you elaborate a little bit just on what the timing of that transition is as well, and how you think about that. And maybe perhaps, So you can tell what may not necessarily be finalized, what the key variable you all are thinking about in that transition there?","Patti Poppe","Yes, I would say, the timing is over this 10 year time horizon that we're looking at, making these transitions. We have -- at 22% coal we're already one of the lowest in the country. We feel good about that. The fuel diversity of having our sites remaining is an important part of the mix. And so, we'll build that into the plan. And frankly, we look forward to the results of the model because they'll be informing to us about when the best time is to utilize those -- or to transition those plants. The reality is, we've done some environmental upgrades at those facilities, so they're best-in-class environmental controls currently. And so to rush any -- any additional retirements probably isn't necessary but they do have a natural end-of-life within that cycle. So we'll be thinking through that the -- through the IRP, and frankly, with all of our critical stakeholders, internal and outside the company.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And just a quick one on the numbers here, obviously, you've done very well on cost management and some of the recovery factors on slide 9 there again this year. Since you've launched 2018 guidance, you might you be able to elaborate a little bit on some of the key factors we should we thinking about in the year-over-year comparison in that range? What are perhaps some of the known variables that you might be thinking about or leveraged as we say, in cost management next year? Is there anything that you can kind of say today that we should we paying attention to as we think about that plan?","Rejji Hayes","Yes, so we offer a couple of thoughts. And so when we talk about, particularly, O&M cost-reduction opportunities, we've talked in the past about the very nice annuity that we\u2019ve gotten through attrition management over the years. And so that has been something that we've said has been a benefit in the past, and should be an ongoing benefit in the years to come. So specifically on average, we've got about 350 to 400 employees who turn over, who are on defined benefit plans, which obviously are not as cost-effective as defined contribution plans and we froze those plans in their early thoughts.","And so now when we have new employees come in, by definition they are on defined contribution plans. We generally save about $40,000 per FTE when we have turnover between defined benefit plan employees and then defined contribution plans employees coming in. And so if you have $40,000 of savings per FTE and you turnover about $400 per year, that generates about $16 million of savings per year. And you think about our cost structure and the O&M side of about $1 billion, that's got about 1.5% savings. And so that gets us a good portion of the way there.","Obviously, we always look to do opportunistic refinancings and so we do have some high coupon bonds in our portfolio that we may look to be opportunistic around. And so that introduces opportunities for savings. And clearly, as mentioned before, we are always looking at tax planning opportunities on the property tax or income tax side. So there's a variety of opportunities we look for. And then also as I mentioned, because we're in reinvestment mode for the fourth quarter, this is the time of the year where we look for pull-aheads and if there are operational-related expenses that we have currently forecasted in 2018 that we can pull forward because we're trending well this year, we'll look to do that as well. So that's a small list of the opportunities that we have before us, Julian.","Patti Poppe","And Julian, I'll add just a couple more, just to reinforce at there's plenty. We've got -- the CE Way is just taking shape and so we're finding operational savings across the board, around the organization. Our technology adoption, so going from our traditional phone calls to our digital channels is a fundamental cost savings and cost reduction, and so part of what you're hearing from Rejji and I here and for everyone on the phone is that we have the luxury of focus. Our business model is not complex. We don't have big bets, we're not betting on big outcomes. We've got a series of small, focused efforts that allow us to deliver consistently. And the consistency is what we know you've come to expect and we're pretty excited about the breadth and depth of opportunities that are in front of us.","Rejji Hayes","Julien, the only other thing I would note and this is not related to the cost savings but it is worth noting that for the first 9 months of the year, storms have hurt us to the tune of -- sorry, weather and storms have hurt us to the tune of about $0.24. And so we don't plan for that type of extreme or mild weather and that type of extreme storm activity. And so in a normalized year, we'd like to think that, that offers a tailwind going into 2018.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. Just a quick clarification, since you mentioned the tax item just not for 2018. Anything about describing the $0.05 benefit here in the -- I suppose it would've been the third quarter here on this Slide 2?","Rejji Hayes","Yes, happy to provide some color on that. So the $0.05 benefit realized in Q3, that's largely attributable to a reduction in deferred income taxes associated with electric sales into MISO.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. Okay. Fair enough. Thank you very much for the detail.","Rejji Hayes","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Weinstein of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Michael Weinstein","Hi, guys.","Rejji Hayes","Hey, Michael, how are you?","Michael Weinstein","Hey, just a follow-up on some of Julian's questions. When you think about the $7 billion of opportunity for CapEx, how do you say -- I know that half you said is from distribution transmission that were have been supply. Understood the supply is probably going to be dealt within the IRP. But on the T&D side, how do you think about pacing of when you can possibly move that into the official $18 billion side of the forecast, the one that's not an opportunity, but actually part of the plan going forward?","Patti Poppe","I'll start and then as Rejji wants to add some additional comments. We have this -- the commission has requested a five-year distribution plan and we will -- we filed an initial version in August, we're receiving comments and having working sessions with the staff at the commission right now. We'll be submitting a final plan in January. And as through that plan -- and this is what I think is really a great part of what the commission is leading right now, these longer-term viewpoints of where the right investments in infrastructure exist.","And so what will -- filling in our IRP in the spring of next year in conjunction with this T&D distribution, in particular, five-year modernization plan, we'll have a really good picture about where the investment opportunities are and have some real alignment with the commission and agreement about what those investments will be. And frankly, because of the age and the size and scope of our system, we have internal competition with trying to decide where best to put the dollars because there's so many parts of the distribution system and the supply system that require investment.","And then when you layer in our gas, our large gas system, we've got -- our constraint is not \u2018Do we have capital we can do?\u2019 The constraint is customer's ability to pay, which is why we put so much emphasis on reducing the cost of that infrastructure in any way possible, so that we can provide more value for every dollar that we invest. And so that's where been working on. And so with the five-year distribution plan and the IRP combined, we'll be able to build out that five-year investment strategy in much more detail and with a lot more certainty.","Michael Weinstein","Do you think there is a possibility that the $7 billion on opportunities can also be expanded as you work your way through, both this plan and the IRP?","Patti Poppe","Yes, we do. And again, it's only constrained by customers' ability to pay, so that in the 10-year time horizon, in particular, when we have these PPAs that do peel off and are at the end of their contractual life, that creates some real headroom to make additional investments without raising customers' prices beyond what they can afford. And so that definitely is a key ingredient in our 10-year plan.","Rejji Hayes","Michael, this is Rejji. The only thing I would add to that's all 100% for right. And just to give you some specifics, as you may recall from Investor Day, Garrick went into great detail on the volume of capital investment opportunities that we have, just given the age of our system. And so on the electric side, we talked about the average age of the system, I think 75% to our assets were constructed before 1970 and the industry average about 65%, we also just have a very old gas distribution mains, most of which -- a good portion of which were constructed around World War II.","And so there's a lot of opportunities there, if you extrapolate on that math, there well in excess of the $25 billion that we've highlighted in our $18 billion 10-year plan plus $7 billion of upside opportunity. So there's a lot of capital investment opportunities. And as Patti noted, the key constraint is, obviously, affordability, so if we can accelerate the cost reduction or savings and that will allow us to execute on the upside opportunities as well.","Michael Weinstein","Right. Make sense. Thank you very much.","Patti Poppe","Thanks Mike.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Arnold","Good morning, guys.","Rejji Hayes","Good morning, Jonathan.","Patti Poppe","Good morning, Jonathan.","Jonathan Arnold","I was just curious, so again this tax item in the quarter sounds like it was largely to do with cross period, so probably a one-timer, is that fair?","Rejji Hayes","Yes, largely one-timer, there could be a little bit of upside to the tune of about $0.01 in 2018, but largely one-timer.","Jonathan Arnold","Rejji, my question is, is there something that you sort of anticipated going into this year or was it the timing or fortuitous or had it not -- had you not got this, how would you be feeling around the range? What are the other things you could've done, et cetera?","Rejji Hayes","I'll answer the last question first and then I'll get to your initial part of your question. But we would feel good about our ability to hit our fourth quarter full year, and then going forward, feel good about hitting our financial objectives, irrespective of whether this tax opportunity came about. The reality is, we're $0.16 ahead of plan and the tax savings that we realized in this quarter would have -- absent that, would have still be about $0.10 ahead of plan. And so it was helpful but it's not what we\u2019re hanging our hat on.","And as always, we managed to work accordingly in the event we have unexpected variances like weather, like storms and this is just yet another example of us identifying cost savings opportunities. So that's sort of quick answer to the last part of the questions. As for the initial part, we've actually been evaluating this deferred income tax reduction opportunity for some time and what allowed us to take advantage of it this quarter was that there were couple legal precedents that emerged that allowed us -- and there will be more disclosure around this in the queue but allowed us to revisit our methodology for portioning electric sales into MISO and that's really the gist of why we took advantage of this opportunity now.","Jonathan Arnold","Thank you.","Rejji Hayes","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ali Agha of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ali Agha","Thank you. Good morning.","Rejji Hayes","Good morning, Ali.","Patti Poppe","Good morning, Ali.","Ali Agha","Good morning. Looking at the data, year-to-date weather normalized electric sales were running behind your full year target, any insight into that? And does that change your long-term planning for weather normalized sales going forward?","Rejji Hayes","The quick answer, Ali, and we've -- this has been kind of recurring theme for the first couple of quarters of the year and now the third quarter. We actually feel like we're trending quite well on a weather normalized basis. And so as you may recall on our fourth quarter earnings call, we forecasted about 0.5% growth on the weather normalized electric sales. And that's net of energy efficiency programs. And if you look at the data on Page 13 of our pack, we're about, call it, 40 basis points.","And what has been really in excess of our expectations has been the performance on the commercial side. And so you can see from a commercial perspective, we are about 1.5% up year-over-year. Industrial, which was down 1% in the first half of the year is now, basically, flat and so that's starting to turn around, so we're seeing good industrial activity. And residential was strong for the first half of the year, up about 50 basis points or 0.5% and it's now about flat. But I think what the residential trends do not pick up in the third quarter is that, like most of the country, we had very nice weather and the latter part of September, which effectively is not picked up in our performance but will be picked up in October.","So effectively, those sales are still on the meter. And so we're trending not only on target to get to about 0.5% to 1% of growth year-over-year by the end of the year, but also the sales mix has been quite favorable over the first half of the year and it continues on to this Q3. So we're very pleased, actually, with the performance to-date. Is that helpful?","Ali Agha","Yes, yes. It is, thank you. And secondly, the last 12 months earned ROEs weather normalized both electric and gas are above your authorized, any concerns with that as you're going through the rate cases or do you think that gets reduced by the future CapEx opportunities?","Rejji Hayes","Yes. That should normalize over time. I think we're, maybe 10 to 20 basis points on the electric side above the authorized ROE, and so that's probably has to do a little bit of lag attributable to some of the cost savings, and just not having the opportunity to pass this on as soon as we'd like. But we obviously, as we always do, we pass this on as quickly as we can through the annual rate filings.","And on the gas side, I'm sure you noted that we are well below the authorized ROE and that's because of the loss of self implementation attributable to the new energy law that was implemented in April of this year. And so again, we expect those to normalize over time and 10 to 20 basis points above the authorized level, we think, again, that will get back to authorized levels fairly very soon.","Ali Agha","Thank you.","Rejji Hayes","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Travis Miller of Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Travis Miller","Good morning. Thank you.","Patti Poppe","Good morning, Travis.","Travis Miller","I was thinking about the regulatory activities. One short-term question, one long-term question, just wondering if you could point out one of the key 2018 regulatory decisions or filings or other activities that might change that guidance range or put you at the top-end or the low end?","Patti Poppe","Well, okay, so we do have some significant regulatory outcomes in 2018 planned. But as it relates to our guidance, our 6% to 8%, that's -- as I mentioned, we work every year under a variety of changing conditions, whether regulatory outcomes, politics et cetera, we always work to make sure that we can adapt to those changing conditions, and that's the strength of this business model. So I think, as you're thinking about our 2018 guidance, I would stay anchored in that point that our strength comes from our simple but powerful business model. It has strong CapEx underpinned by cost savings, ongoing throughout the year.","And then a real core competence and adaptability. A lot of people do point to our business model and I love it and it's straightforward and I can see why we would. But one of the core strengths of this company, and Rejji highlighted it in his remarks, is the fact that no matter what comes we managed to work it out because we don't have big bets, because we're not waiting on one big regulatory outcome because we're not waiting on one big project to get approved, we can adapt to make those changes throughout the year and manage to deliver for all of you.","And for 14 years in a row, delivering 7% EPS growth. We feel pretty good about our track record and what we're trying to share is that we have plenty of visibility and to being able to deliver it to again going forward.","Travis Miller","Okay, and then the long term question was how sensitive is that long-term growth number to that IRP filing and whatever outcome plus or minus that might come about?","Patti Poppe","I think, if anything, the IRP provides more certainty to the performance because we'll have more visibility into longer-term planning and be able to do more cost effective investments and cost effective generation, which is how our model works. The heart of our model is that our system is large and aging and we have significant infrastructure replacement upgrades enhancements required. And so any certainty we can have going forward allows us to most cost effectively do those upgrades and make the changes necessary. We have a large and aging system between the gas and electric. And so really we look forward to certainty that the IRP can provide so that we can do really even better planning than we've been able to do in the past.","Rejji Hayes","The only other point I would add is, obviously, the utility drives a good portion, the lion share of our earnings on an annual basis. But we still have the unregulated businesses as both enterprises and other banks that provide additional levers to risk mitigate our annual plan, and then obviously, we will seek out cost reduction opportunities, either operating our non-operating to make sure that we can again risk mitigate any unfavorable regulatory outcomes.","Travis Miller","Great. Thanks. I appreciate it.","Rejji Hayes","Thank you.","Patti Poppe","Thanks, Travis.","Operator","And our next question comes from Andrew Levi of Avon Capital. Please go ahead.","Andrew Levi","Hi. Good morning.","Patti Poppe","Hey, Andrew.","Andrew Levi","Just real quick, because I've been off and on. Just on this deferred tax item, I don't know if I heard it correctly, but is it what potential that there could be upside to this year's number if you deem to book more of that? Is that...","Rejji Hayes","No, no. We would say the $0.05 of realized benefit in this quarter, that respectively it for 2017 and there may be $0.01 of upside next year as I highlight. But I wouldn't expect anything further beyond that in this fiscal year. Is that helpful?","Andrew Levi","Okay, okay, because I thought -- first I heard there would be higher 2017, obviously this rate can change your 2017 a little bit. And then you'd have a higher base to grow off of, and that would change 2018, 2019, whatever. But that's not the case so I missed -- I misheard. Thank you.","Rejji Hayes","Thank you.","Patti Poppe","Thanks, Andy.","Operator","And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Poppe for any closing remarks.","Patti Poppe","Well, thanks everyone for joining us and we do look forward to seeing you at EEI, right around the corner.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

This call is being recorded.","Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today, beginning at noon Eastern Time, running through May 1. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Glenn Barba, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. Please go ahead.","Glenn Barba","Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. With me are John Russell, President, Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Webb, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Our earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on our website.","Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings including our 10-K for the fiscal year 2013 identified some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Our SEC filings are available on our website. This presentation also include non-GAAP measures, reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures are included in the Appendix to the presentation and posted in the Investor Relations section of our website.","With that I'll turn the call over to John.","John Russell","Thanks, Glenn and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us on our first quarter earnings call. I'll begin the presentation with a few brief comments about the quarter. Before I turn the call over to Tom to discuss the financial results and the outlook for the remainder of 2014, then we will close with Q&A.","We are off to a good start in 2014. For the first quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.75. This is up $0.22 from last year primarily due to the winter weather and strong cost performance. First quarter results keep us on track to meet our full year guidance of $1.74 to $1.78 per share. Tom will provide the details in a few minutes. You can see from this graph how this winter compared to those of the last 100 years. It was consistently cold from November through March. The winter put our gas system to the test and I am pleased to report it performed very well. Total gas deliveries were up nearly 25% due to the weather. And there were no major service interruptions. Here you can see where we are putting our gas investments to work. The $175 million upgrade at the Ray Compressor Station increased reliability to meet peak demand. And the $120 million Southwest Michigan Pipeline currently under construction will increase the transmission system capacity and reliability. Our gas system is the fourth largest in the United States. During the first quarter, we delivered almost 160 billion cubic feet of natural gas to our 1.7 million customers. About half of the deliveries come from our storage fields. Consumers have one of the largest storage systems in the country and the highest level of deliverability at 4 billion cubic feet a day. Our storage field help protect customers from volatile price spikes, which many experienced during this past winter specially in March. Over the last -- over the next 10 years we plan to invest $5 billion in gas transmission, distribution and storage systems. ","In 2013, strong cost performance and favorable weather allowed us to reinvest back into the business for our customers. This model allows continuing to focus on cost performance and reinvestment within the year. We have been doing this now for several years which are unique in the industry. We believe this improves performance for our customers and our investors. The result of our model is sustainable growth. Each year our growth builds on the previous year's performance without weather adjustments. Within the year, we pull-aheads work to accelerate the pace of improvement for our customers. And the yearend results are delivered for investors with predictable and consistent growth. ","Again this year we plan to take advantage of the cold weather to reinvest for our customers. In the first quarter, we benefited from favorable weather of $0.20 and strong cost performance of $0.04, allowing us to begin our reinvestment plan earlier than last year. Tom will go through the numbers with you in more detail. But I want to make the point again about sustainable, consistent growth strategy. In the first quarter, our cost savings alone allowed us to beat our 5% to 7% growth rate. Our strategy differentiates us from our peers. ","The Michigan Energy Law is working well. But there is an opportunity to make the law even better in 2015. The governor has developed a set of no regrets principles shown in the green circle. We support his vision and work closely with his administration and legislators. Near term, the House Energy and Technology Committee held hearings on electric deregulation. There was strong opposition to the bill. And the committee took no action. The administration is looking at options to establish a tariff for energy intensive customers. And a legislature may take action on that. In the gas business, I expect the House will propose legislation to expand gas mains. We will support this effort because it works -- it will accelerate convergence from propane to natural gas. ","Looking into 2015, we see the possibility of an increase in renewable energy portfolio standard, continuation of energy efficiency goals, regulatory improvements and the potential elimination of retail open access. We look forward to working with the governor and the legislators to make Michigan a more attractive state for business.","Next, Tom will take you through the details for the quarter. ","Tom Webb","Well, thanks John. And let me add my welcome to everybody on the call today. It's always good to have you. For the first quarter, our earnings were $0.75 a share on both a reported and we are pleased to say an adjusted basis is. This is $0.22 better than last year, normalized for weather as John mentioned this is up $0.05 or 10% from last year. This reflects strong cost performance and investment driven growth nicely above are 5% to 7% earnings growth pattern. Avoiding gas rate cases for both the gas and the electric businesses this year, it was made possible through $150 million of cost reductions initiated last year. As we just discussed weather normalized results were up $0.05 or 10% in the first quarter alone. For the nine months ahead you can see with yellow arrow that cold weather up $0.17 has provided considerable space to pull-aheads work from 2015 to 2014. You can also see on the dotted circle the cost savings this year, fully funded our planned investments. Here is a recap of cost performance before and after reinvestment. Our underlying cost reduction shown in green was 8% last year and we expect the 8% this year. The savings are offset by about 5% of work pull-ahead from the next year: Pull-aheads permitted primarily by favorable weather in 2013 and so far in 2014 as well. The pull-aheads includes actions like incremental tree trimming for reliability, faster pole and pipe maintenance as well as accelerated plant maintenance outage. Cost reductions cover a variety of items including actions like plan benefit savings, faster installation, smart meters and more productivity. Even after reinvestment, our costs are down about 3% a year. Our cost reduction track record is better than most peers and shown in orange. At present, we plan future cost reduction at about 2% a year, reducing our O&M from a $1.055 billion last year to $930 million by 2018. This is a net reduction of $125 million which is down 12% and a bit more than 2% a year. This may well be conservative because we do not believe in our count on black boxes. We plan on cost savings that we know about including actions like gas in place of coal generation, reforming our benefit programs and implementing specific plans for productivity. We are confident in substantial cost savings ahead making headroom for more capital investment. But perhaps there's little more upside. ","Let's switch to revenue. Our electric sales have been better than many others as Michigan continues to grow particularly in our service territory. As shown in the top left of this slide, key economic indicators like building permits and GDP growth and population and unemployment in our major service area are meaningfully stronger than Michigan as well as the U.S. overall. For example, during the latest reported 12 months to February, building permits were up 16% in the U.S., they are 25% in Michigan and 39% in Grand Rapids. For the first quarter weather normalized electric sales were up 1.7%. For the full-year, we anticipate a similar growth rate. Over the next several years, we plan conservatively in a bit over 0.5%. ","We prefer upside opportunities not downside risk. Our EPS growth over the next five years is not however dependent on strong load growth. Our growth is based on needed investment and solid productivity. Low growth over and above are conservative estimates could be another catalyst. We've not factor this into our plan and perhaps this is another upside.","We are not however without need to improve. We do have substantial investment ahead to catch up on. This investment allows us to meet environmental requirements, add more renewable, improve reliability and enhance productivity. Our bills are competitive for our residential customers but rates are not competitive for many of our industrial customers. In many circumstances these rates are higher than rates in other Midwestern states. We're working hard to correct this through our own substantial cost performance and improve rate design. And this could make us more like our Midwest peers. Also, possible policy changes could eliminate or reduce existing penalties that all our customers pay to subsidize a few customers on retail open access. While we have the lowest overhead in our business and among the very best O&M cost performance and advantages like procuring low cost gas to our huge storage fields. We still have disadvantages including our geographic location on a peninsula remote from fuel supplies. Our goal is to work with our customers, our regulators and policymakers to provide fully competitive prices and reliability, exactly what our customers should expect from us.","So a great deal of our capital investment focuses on more productivity, the improved reliability, completing environmental projects in a major reduction in carbon output to levels below the president's goal. Our investment in plants using gas and renewable fuels helps to make this possible. Even as we limit the level of capital investment to keep base rate growth below inflation, this investment catch up provides resources to make necessary improvements. We have opportunities to spend more than $20 billion over the next 10 years and all nice bite-size no bet the planet projects. We've included $15 billion in our plans and limited only by that passion to keep customer rates and bills down. Even after recently pulling ahead $545 million of investment, investment and gas infrastructure, smart energy and electric reliability as well reinvesting almost $390 million in the gas business associated with securitizing coal plants, we have $5 billion of investment opportunity not in our plans perhaps more upside. ","Here is just one example of capital investment growth opportunities not in our plan. We likely will need to build or secure over 2500 megawatts of capacity just to replace expiring PPAs and coal plant closures. We already have secured 540 megawatts with the acquisition of the combined cycle gas plant in Jackson. With conservative load growth estimates and the possibility of customers returning to bundled service, and need for secure capacity may be even larger. And we are confident that we can fill those needs.","So here's the map for this additional capacity, it is attractive for both customers and investors. If for example we build just a thousand megawatts of new capacity is good at $0.05 of EPS growth or about two points of headroom to our long-term guidance. And that's without increasing customer bills. The rate impact of adding a new capacity is likely to be equal to or less than the cost associated with expiring PPAs. Customers and investors win again. We are not however raising long-term guidance. These capacity additions, need additions are not in our plan yet. This investment opportunity will allow us to redeploy resources in a manner that further strengthen the likelihood of consistent 5% to 7% growth.","Our investment driven model is not so unique but we work it well enough to improve our gross operating cash flow by about by about $100 million each year, and in some years we've exceeded that substantially. We self fund our growth with no need for block equity on the five year horizon. As a percent of market cap today, our spending levels now exceed peers with strong additional growth ahead. As a risk adverse company, our operating cash flow and liquidity are higher too. And this is a nice place to be. ","You can see our liquidity here with over $2 billion available in a robust financing plan. Our liquidity as percent market cap shown at the bottom right exceeds peer levels. Moody's upgraded both CMS and Consumers just two months ago; Fitch upgraded the CMS Energy parent's unsecured rating to BBB- and revised the outlook to stable. And in last month S&P change their outlook from stable to positive.","And here is our sensitivity chart. This will help you assess our prospects. And here's our report card for 2014. Obviously, the Arctic blast -- with that Arctic blast we'd be well ahead of earnings guidance. We will however work to put this surplus to good use with even more reliability improvements for our customers. You'll note we graded ourselves with an orange check on operating cash flow. Although we anticipate achieving our target, we had not planned on the high price of gas transportation for incremental gas purchase beyond what we had contracted and what we had in our storage fields.","As shown on the earlier sensitivity slide, each increase or decrease in the price of gas by about a $1 impact our cash flow by $100 million in the opposite direction. This is a pass through but some of this may be recovered in 2015 rather than 2014. So we are on course to meet all of our financial targets with substantial upside and earnings. We are actively redeploying some of the surplus to improve the lot of our customers with no adverse consequences for you our investors. ","The mindset for customers and investors has worked and we hope you agree. We are in our 12 year of premier earnings and dividend growth, and we plan to continue this performance for some time. ","So thank you again for joining us on our call today and we would be pleased to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","(Operator Instructions).","And our first question comes from the line of Dan Eggers, Credit Suisee. Please proceed. ","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for the update on Slide 16 on the capacity your resource opportunity. Can you just maybe talk a little about you where you guys sit from a functional reserve margin between what you guys own what you haven't a contract and then how much you having to buy out the market right now on a spot or normalized base over the course of the year?","John Russell","Yeah, Dan, we have got enough capacity now for our customer load. That's not an issue for us as far as that. Next few years we'll probably be in the market for a few hundred but very small from that standpoint. So I think Tom was showing in the chart which is important pieces, we are shutting down coal which were beginning to replace, we'll buy more from the market and as the PPA expire will need to have replacement capacity, will makes us a bit unique here I think very unique is the fact that we do -- we are heavily dependent on PPAs compared to other utilities. So as those expire allows us to do the development here and raise our capital investment without raising the cost to our customers. ","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities LLC","And I guess, John, there is a couple of contingencies out there obviously what happens with choice in the 780 megawatt and then the survivability I suppose of Palisades as it gets older and the prospects for a PPA beyond your PPA or probably harder to find, how are you guessing about contingency planning for both these issues and if choice does get eliminated early next year, is that -- would that accelerate the need maybe to revisit Thetford? ","John Russell","Yes, exactly. You hit it. I mean that the issue we have a great site Thetford, we are ready to move ahead with it, the opportunity presented itself with the plan here in Jackson, it was best for us and for our customers we took advantage of it. The Thetford site is ready to go, we do have expandability and be changing out some of our simple cycle to combined cycle, it is even plan Thetford can begin at the simple cycle moved to combined cycle, so we are well positioned to be able to move. I'd say quickly but again building plans nothing is quick, but having the sites and having all that work already behind us really would help us move quickly as retail open access returns, as coal plants are shutdown and as some of these PPAs expire.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities LLC","And with choice being replaced it with your own generation, would that prospectively be added to the growth rate because presumably the revenues coming back and to pay for that generation, would you mitigate the concerns you guys always have about your bill versus your customer? ","","John Russell"," ","Absolutely, absolutely and the fact that ROA customers would come back also means that the wall was it as far as coal being reduced, the capacity markets increasing to the normal levels, we are more competitive and we will be in a very good position to be able to build with that pretty substantial that you saw there, it is almost 800 megawatts of load if it did return.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold, Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.","Yes, good morning. Could I ask you just talk a little bit about where you are on days of coal supply of deliverability and if weather being constrained, is got a changing dispatch and then how you expect the summer to play out? ","John Russell","Yes, we fell below our normal levels this winter and I think it's what the industry is experience with some of the real disruptions primarily due to the cold weather. We've been able to make up about seven days of inventory over the past few weeks, so we been making up ground and we would be putting some more railcars to work, we do have a couple scheduled outages especially at Campbell 3, our biggest plant which is helped us get back on track so we are little bit below normal levels today, but I do feel good that there's finally most of the ice is gone out of the Great Lakes so we do have the opportunity different than other utilities to bring in coal with barge, through barges and we are also making progress as I said with a seven day increase over the last several weeks.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.","John, can you just kind of frame -- so how low did you go and where are you now with that seven delta?","John Russell","What would I say lowest we ever hit was about 14 days that was the lowest and what we did as a result of that as we began to conserve our western coal which is cheaper for our customers by working for minimum dispatch on weekends and doing some different things like that? So that did help increase it. And keep in mind we have still have the ability to burn Eastern coal which we have those coal piles too but we chose to use Western because of the environmental and customer benefits. So moving up from 14 we are up to and above 21 days right now. We like to be in the 25 to 35 days going into summer, and I expect we will be there especially now that lakes have opened up. ","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ali Agha, SunTrust. Please proceed.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you, good morning. First off on the 2014 guidance by the segments Slide 25 I believe enterprise you are assuming will contribute about $0.11 or so to earnings in 2014 which is significantly higher than what they being running for the last several years. Can you just remind us what's causing that pickup this year?","Tom Webb","It is about the same and what you are reading there members Enterprises and EnerBank combined, so you need to split that between those two.","","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, Tom and so how should we think of that split?","Tom Webb"," ","Okay and EnerBank would be about $0.07 or $0.08 and Enterprises would be about $0.03 or $0.04, it kind of round in there. So Enterprises is running what we call a little low on its earnings contribution today because this is not a great market for the IPPs but what we see-- we have kept ourselves open for the year after next and into the future for capacity contracts, and energy contracts, and if you remember John's presentation from some while ago, we have the opportunity for plants like DIG to be little bit like a Ferrari in a garage. And so that guy can come out when we need to for utility if needed to, if it was the best deal or it can be out there with a higher capacity prices we anticipate will occur over the next couple of three years.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay and EnerBank is that something going on there to add $0.07 to $0.08 again I maybe I just don't recall it contributing that level historically.","Tom Webb","No, nothing special just their consistent growth that they have year-over-year, nice performing little bank. ","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And John, on retail open access and you're thinking there and the prospect that you think that load may come back, how much of that is driven by your outlook for say commodity prices? Are you assuming high commodity prices is what is bringing those customers back or what is the scenario in your mind that you see that as an incremental load opportunity for you?","John Russell","I think that let's start now. The load projections really don't do it although I will tell you I think we are going to see more normal capacity prices after some of the EPA rules kick into effect for the Midwest. So that's one area, I really think the driver behind it, Ali, will be legislative changes, I mean really today our customers, we have got about 400 customers on retail open access and our -- the rest of our customers the 98.98% of our customers pay $140 million more per year to take care of those 400 customers, that's not fair. And what we are trying to do as I mentioned earlier is work on some industrial, they are call industrial or heavy energy intense customers to provide them some savings and some discounts which reflect true cost to savings with the type of across the service with the type of plants, the type of customers that they are. So I think say that's going to be the driver. I mean we are out of step in Michigan with having a hybrid market and we are the only one maybe one other state in the country that has this. And the trend is pretty clear, people are moving away from deregulation despite what you saw in Ohio that started before Michigan deregulated, and it was kind of interesting to see the governor talk about what he thinks about that as he's moving forward with it. And while I'm on this little soapbox I think it's pretty important to look around this country and see what happened in March of this year with gas prices, electric prices for those customers that are deregulated and don't have the protection of the utility.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Right. Got it. Last question. Just to again to frame up that 1,000 megawatt capacity potential that you have for owning. Again could you just remind us what timeframe -- if I heard you right that was beyond the next five years, but it wasn't clear? When do you see that opportunity?","Tom Webb","If you look at Slide 16, you can see on we have opportunity to put in another 400 or so megawatts today if the Palisades PPA contract did not renew, it expires in 2022 who knows something can happen earlier there but we are not projecting that. And then the MCV PPA expires in 2025. ","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please proceed.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc","Good morning. Can we just talk about what happened on the industrial side? Weather-normalized sales were up pretty sharply?","Tom Webb","","Yes, what we're seeing and that's why we gave you the slide and showing this sort of the hookups in the building permits and all that sort of thing, we're seeing a turned back up on the industrial site, if you could think back some of you are able to do this to a year ago, we also softening across the country and we were kind of scratching our heads, everybody had ideas for what was causing it. We are seeing a reverse of that in the first quarter of this year. We are seeing things firm up in our particular area there's a couple of customers that are doing particularly well and driving that growth in the first quarter. But we are also seeing a lot of others doing things with their building and preparing for additions, so that's why we're pretty confident with the projections that we have through the rest of the year and we are calling it about the same level of growth. So from an industrial standpoint inside of that 1.7% first quarter growth, it was about 5.8% and we are forecasting and probably continue just a little bit better than 5% for the rest of the year.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc","And just back to Thetford with that current shortfall will you plan currently just to lean on the markets or could we see tight recovery in a couple of years?","John Russell","Yes, I think we could Paul. Right now I think the markets are the best way to go for us to fill that shortfall which is small, I mean let's put in perspective, in our peak load is over 8000 megawatt and we are talking about capacity only not really energy for less than 400 megawatts, so it is not a big deal to go the market for 400 megawatts but when we start seeing that increase to near thousand I think in that ramp up we will be looking at Thetford because I think that's kind of a critical stage and we see that and it could change relatively quickly based on the change in retail open access or as Tom said some of the contracts that in the future will move off. So I mean we are very well positioned, the sites ready, the sites ready to go as we said before we've got gas, we've got electric transmission, we've got some older units on site, it's in a remote relatively remote area but it's on the east side of the state near Flint, Michigan and they would really like us to build their plant. So it's a pretty good set up for us. ","Tom Webb","","So I would just add the purchase we did of the plant in Jackson was at a price that's lower than anything I have seen across the country, and so it was a great thing to do for our customers. The John's point here is that we are going to have to add new capacity for the state as well as our service territory at some point.","John Russell","","You bet.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc","Are there other plants out there like the Jackson plant that you could buy?","Tom Webb"," ","There are but there's still, I think three significant IPPs out there, one is ours and so yes there are still opportunities that way too.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc","But either way it's a rate based opportunity?","Tom Webb","Yes, it is. ","John Russell","Absolutely","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andy Levi, Avon Capital Advisor. Please proceed","Andy Levi -- Avon Capital Advisor","Hi, good morning. Just two quick questions. Just on the verbiage on the upsize as far as the growth rate so that's what we're talking about, right, upsize to the growth rate? Longer term 5% to 7% right. ","Tom Webb","Yes, so when you're -- we're talking about the earnings per share growth rate but when we do that you notice we have been cautious each time whether it was upside because we may be conservative on revenue or upside because we maybe a little conservative on our cost or all these different things. That upside we talk about gives us the opportunity and then put more capital investment in place. And then be able to do more work for our customers. So we anticipate certainly in a short-term that this is what kind of gives us chance to give you a very sustainable, very predictable growth at 5% to 7% pace. What we're not trying to signal here is that you are going to see some new sustainable level at a pace higher than that and maybe a year or two when something happens but just our plan is to continue to deliver that 5% to 7% and our point is we probably have some upsides to make that even easier. ","Andy Levi -- Avon Capital Advisor","Okay, okay. I thought you were talking about upside to the 5% to 7% and again it could be lumpy or there's a year that you surpass the 5% to 7% but when you talked about upside we should just continue to upside to inflexibility I guess?","Tom Webb","That well said, thank you. ","Andy Levi -- Avon Capital Advisor","Okay. And then at the same time some of us are thinking that maybe you may need to file for or may choose to file for a rate case on the electric side that rates would take effect, I don't know mid 2015. So I guess some of this upside could help alleviate or eliminate that potential for 2015 or not at this point?","Tom Webb","Well, here is the way I would think about that to put in perspective. For 2014, we didn't need to have a rate case for gas or electric either of those businesses and that's because we found ways to reduce our cost by $150 million that funded if you will the investment. We do plan to do rate cases as we get toward the middle and the end of the year particularly on the electric side. The magnitude of that case will depend upon the size and scale of our O&M cost productions and of course our revenue growth. So we will watch that carefully, we do not anticipate being able to avoid a rate case for an additional year. But it may be able to allow us to tamper the size of the case that we asked for.","Andy Levi -- Avon Capital Advisor","Great. And then one last question. Any commentary or information you can give us on the -- I don't know if you want to call it strategy but this thinking as far as we approach the PJM auction what you are thinking there?","Tom Webb","Yes, we are not prepared today to announce what we're going to do but you know our opportunity to participate varies to our IPP that we call DIG, Dearborn Industrial Generation. We did participate in the market a year ago for the three year dance period. We are looking at that again but you know PJM is doing I think a good job trying to ensure that the people that participate have hard assets and they plan to be there each and every year. We've got to play that off against what we see the needs are in MISO and make a decision that's the most economic for you as investors, but also the most practical in terms of serving customers in the State of Michigan. So we haven't made that decision yet and I know there are a lot of people out there sharpening their pencils trying to figure out what they will do to be an interesting option.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Russo, - Ladenburg Thalmann. Please proceed","Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co.","Hi, good morning. Most of my questions have been asked and answered but just curious on the opportunities to reinvest the surplus margins reported in the first quarter. Does that all get reinvested in the second quarter or do you kind of spread it out for the remaining three quarters and how important is summer weather to that reinvestment?","Tom Webb","Well, let me start on that and I think both John and I might have some thoughts we would like to share with you to be helpful. We've already started, so I don't want you to think that we have an impact to get a chance to see that on John's Slide 7 which shows the reinvestment curve and he noted that the weather was favorable $0.20 and that we had cost savings that were higher than we expected by another $0.04. So we really had good news of $0.24 in the quarter. You'll note there that we also showed $0.06 of reinvestment and some things that are associated with the cold weather. We always tell you when it's really good news or really bad news, there are things that come with it on the other side. So being very cold, our UAs may creep up a little bit more, our lost gas might be little bit more, so there are some natural offsets. But we've already started the reinvestment in the first quarter, and although we give you a curve that little dotted line, I would caution you not to make that too predictive. We will take on the things that need advanced notice like forestry, tree trimming, we have to plan those things ahead to line up our crews and treat people fairly, and make sure we're doing that in a very safe way, so the earlier we start that the more that we can get done for our customers. We look at outage pull-aheads, those you can't just say I want to do it tomorrow or I want to do it two months from now. So some of those sorts of decisions we can make in this timeframe but than is a lot of other things that can be decided later as we get into the summer and towards the end of the summer and you know hold back on those decisions until we see what mother nature has in store for us over the summer months and if she is favorable again then we have more opportunity, but if she is not and we can't predict that. We only plan on normal weather. We will adjust accordingly so we phase in the reinvestments over time. I don't know John if you want to add anything.","John Russell","No, I think it is great response. So, Brian, one thing too, if I understood your question correctly, the reinvestment we started in the first quarter but that's just beginning and as Tom said there is a lot of work to be done to be able to spend the money to get the resources in place to be able to make it effective, so you expect that spend to occur throughout the rest of the year.","Operator","","And your next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson, Glenrock Associates. Please proceed. ","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Hi, how are you? Just wanted to follow up on a few things. I apologize if I misheard them but just on the RPS standards I think you suggested that they might get --that there may be changes to them to make them more aggressive, is that right?","John Russell","Well, I just think there will be changes, 2015 as a natural sunset for the law, I don't expect any changes around 2014 but in 2015 I do when I think yes I wouldn't surprised if the targets that we have today which is 10% by 2015 which we will achieve wouldn't be raised or put in context with the energy policy of some sort, so yes I would expect that to happen. And then driver just for you-- the driver is a lot of interest in renewable energy, we like to build renewable energy, the ones that we done, we completed one wind park, we are building another, it is going very well and the costs are coming down, I mean that's the nice thing compared to several years ago when the law was first put into place that wind power was not that competitive, today it's pretty competitive, I mean it is just natural gas is the only one that really beats it in our mind. So the wind regime here is good in Michigan I think we can do some more and would like to build it.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Going back to this issue of the competitive, the shopping and closing that sort of loophole up, I understand the logic behind, I think I understand the logic that you were just discussing with Ali, but what is the political dynamic that might cause that? Because I mean assume that these guys have been getting the subsidy for some time, they probably won't want to see it go away if you follow me so I'm just wondering what leaves the legislature to sort of plug that hole.","John Russell","Good question, couple of things. One is the customers these 400 customers -- the main reason to fix it is that it doesn't make sense to have 400 customers subsidized by 1.8 million particularly knowing that some of these 400 customers are not big energy users the way the law work they just happened to get in line earlier back in 2008 and some of them are commercial accounts that prepare fast food, and those really are not driven by energy rates, they are driven more for the success of their business on location, so that's something that really, it's benefiting some customers that quite frankly today probably shouldn't be benefited $440 million a year. The second issue that I think is important here is that there are some people that believe that competition is the right thing to do. I mean regardless of the industry, it is the right thing to do. The message we continue to tell them as they we are pretty unique industry. We are the second highest capital intensive industry in the world. We make electricity, it moves at the speed of light, therefore it's the -- and you can't store it which means it's the most volatile commodity in the world. And I think this winter really proved to a lot of customers that have ventured out in either on the gas side of deregulation or the electric side of deregulation, how volatile that commodity can be, and you seen the lawsuit, you seen claims that people are gouging others and so forth. That's not what this is all about. Our large customers particularly want to have competitive rates and they want predictability and they want certainty. They don't want volatility and bringing them back would allow us to have savings that we could allocate as Tom showed on his slide, may be to that class of customers that uses more energy and ought to have a true cost to service of that approach. So that's that kind of the whole message that's going on today, and I think in the future those customers are probably paying less than buying their electricity from us today. I think in the future -- we have talked about earlier today when you see some of these coal plants retire I'd expect you are going to see that gap narrow quite a bit. ","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay and then just on the -- ","Tom Webb","I just go to add one little comment there. It is clear this team, this management team is driven to be competitive whether it's reliability or the prices, rates, bills for our customers, and so the more we succeed on that the less reason there is to have a choice program, so we will be pushing hard for the success of our customers that's the bottom line.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","When do you think that this legislation might be introduced? ","John Russell","2015, I expect sometime 2015, as I mentioned that we are hearing that the house about the regulation expanding it beyond 10% so allowing more customers to go to retail open access and the opposition was very strong, is not even getting out of committee, I mean there was no interest in that so it's really I would say 2015 would be the time to look at all of these things, renewable energy, energy efficiency standards, retail open access, maybe some regulatory changes all in about 2015. As I said earlier Paul, I think we have a good opportunity to improve what we have today which think we got a pretty good law here in Michigan today with good regulation. I think there is an opportunity to even it gets better.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. I hear you all that. Let me ask you just on the rate design regulatory on that Slide 14, that's also one of the elements that you want to achieve to get your industrial, rates more in step so to speak. How much money are we talking about there? Or how should we think about that? How does that work? Is that just residential or commercial to pay that or how do we think about that?","Tom Webb","Well, look at that slide; I think it is written the three pieces that we show. One is just our cost reductions to the extent that we can keep our cost out of the pace faster than our peers then we can keep our bills and keeps our rates down relatively. The second one is rate design and the whole effort there, there is a workgroup going on led by gentlemen appointed by the governor and he is working with the regulators, the legislature, with our customers, with everybody and what they are seeking to do is simply get rate design, it is a little more like the rest of the Midwest and not so skewed one direction or the other. That will help a lot of these industrial customers and then lastly it is the whole discussion that John just had about the retail open access so I won't repeat that. If those three things were to happen in the scale that we expect they could happen then our industrial customers would be very competitive compared to the rest of the Midwest and remember our residential customers already have competitive bills compared to all the utilities across the nation and which not our goal to push this money around and have somebody paying a lot more and somebody pay a lot less. We just try to get the rate design and structure that we don't have artificial subsidies for some customers over others. So all those things together may -- they are certainly get discussed, they may get acted on in this way through now into 2015, but we can't predict that maybe it will be part of this, may be it will be more than this. But we will see it and we will certainly be an active party in it.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, understood, but just on that second point, the rate design one, is that a generic proceeding or is that going to be part of a rate case?","Tom Webb","Well, that's not decided exactly how it will go yet, the study group will make a recommend -- and remembers that study groups got customers and everybody involved in right. They will make a recommendation to the governor. And the governor will share that with the legislature and the legislature may decide to take some action or they may not. This will be completely their choice. If they choose not to on the rate design piece then I think will be a recommendation to the commission to look at this rate design and put something in place and perhaps it could yet be this summer. So that for future rate cases when we file our rate or another utility files rate case, we would be obligated to use that design so putting the rate design and place it first doesn't change your rates until you have a rate case. And then those rate cases will follow that but customers will like that because again John mentioned they don't like volatility, they do like predictability, and if they do know they got something that's coming that's better and it is clear that's very helpful for their own planning.","Operator","","And your next question comes from the line of Steven Fleishman, Wolfe Research. Please proceed. ","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Yes, good morning. Just curious if any of the Michigan law issues have come up in the governor election process so far or has it been pretty quiet?","John Russell","Very quite, haven't been raised at all.","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Okay. Also wanted to ask to the degree that bonus depreciation is extended by Congress how would that impact your financing plan or growth rate if at all?","Tom Webb","No real impact to us, I know most utilities would probably answer that question with no, no, no like Amy Winehouse but in our case we are happy to have it because what it does as you are laughing at Amy Winehouse, you don't even know, she is passed away, sure I am (inaudible) I guess, what will happen is that will be good shelter as you know Steve for the utility and that will help us to be more productive and that's good news. But then when we won't have the opportunity to use it as our NOLs up at the parent so they will actually get pushed out further and that's why we are happy. We will take the good news at 95% of our business for our utility customers and have those NOLs shelter us even longer because we won't need to use those near term. And you also know there is the downside. It is off the point that we can push down our parent that quicker though. That's a negative side of all that good news.","Operator","At this time, we have no further questions. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Russell for closing remarks.

Our customers awarded us our highest JD Power customer satisfaction scores ever and named us number one in the Midwest residential gas.","Those satisfied customers were served by a highly engaged and diverse workforce. Our accomplishments on the planet include reaching a settlement in our integrated resource plan, the announcement of our net zero methane emissions goal by 2030 for our gas delivery system, and restoring over 1500 acres of land in our home state.","Our ability to meet our triple bottom line is underpinned by World Class performance. And we delivered our best ever customer on time delivery metric, eliminated more than $20 million of waste to the implementation of the CE Way, settled our electric rate case for only the second time in our history and received a gas rate case order that allows us to invest significantly in the safety and reliability of our large and aging gas system.","Although 2019 has been another excellent year of solid performance and record achievements, we are still dissatisfied. We'll continue to keep improving as we work to deliver our financial and operational commitments year after year.","Now every year you'll see the ups and downs that come our way as illustrated on slide six. And every year our unique capability of adapting to changing conditions enables us to deliver the results you expect year in and year out.","In 2019, we were met with challenge after challenge of storm restoration costs, surpassed our full year budget to six months into the year. But we don't make excuses for storms or other weather related impacts on revenue. This is what I love about our model, where we ride the roller coaster for you so you can enjoy a smooth and predictable outcomes highlighted by the green line.","This model has served our customers and you over the last decade plus and will continue to utilize it going forward. I feel compelled to give a shout out to the entire CMS Energy team for the tenacity and the agility they demonstrated in 2019.","Given the headwinds we faced and challenges we overcame, I could not be more proud of the results, and thankful for the efforts of my coworkers. Like we do every year, we're celebrating on the run and moving on to our next set of priorities and setting new goals.","With 2019 behind us and as we prepare to deliver in 2020, we'll continue to make progress on ensuring the safety of our gas system, driving customer satisfaction and delivering on our clean energy plan.","The goals we set for ourselves in 2020 are ambitious. And as always, they're fueled by the continuing maturity of our lean operating system the CE Way. Our ability to execute on our capital plan, and make the investments our system need will depend on our ability to see and eliminate waste wherever it is.","As we continue to mature in the CE Way we are creating a culture where our all of our coworkers are both motivated and able to fulfill our purpose; world class performance, delivering hometown service. These simple words mean a lot to us.","Our system's capital demand that the utility continue to grow. And to that end, we're rolling our capital plan free cash flow and additional year, which will increase the spend over the next five years to about $12.25 billion and supports rate base growth of 7% over that period.","This increase reflects a continued ramp up in annual capital investments in our electric and gas infrastructure to improve the safety and reliability of our systems, as well as increased investments in solar generation assets agreed to in our IRP, which was approved by the Commission last year.","It's worth noting that only about 15% of these projects over the next five years are above $200 million. And about 75% of those projects are addressed in multiyear commission orders such as the IRP which mitigates risk and provides more certainty around execution and regulatory outcomes.","We will also remind you that our five year customer investment plan is limited not by the needs of our system as that stretches vast and wide across the great state of Michigan, but instead by balance sheet constraints, workforce capacity and customer affordability.","Looking now towards regulatory matters, with the 2016 energy law fully implemented, and with the benefits of tax reform address and recent Commission orders, our regulatory calendar for 2020 is much lighter than in recent years.","Last year, we agreed to stay out of an electric rate case and the strategy served us well as we were able to capitalize on some of the cost performance efforts by leveraging the CE Way. Now we'll have the opportunity to funnel some of those cost savings back to our customers and offset some of the capital investment needs.","Coupled with our efforts to ramp our energy efficiency savings to 2% by 2021, we will keep customers' bills affordable. We anticipate filing our next electric rate case by the end of this quarter. In December 2019, we filed a request in our gas rate case for $245 million of incremental revenue, including a 10.5% ROE, and an equity ratio of 52.5% relative to debt, as we continue to focus on the safety and reliability of our gas delivery system.","This case builds on the order in our last gas case where nearly all the capital investments were approved, because you would expect the needs of our system haven't changed that much in just one year.","In conjunction with our gas case we also filed our 10 year natural gas delivery plan, which provides a detailed look into the long term needs of our gas delivery system and supports our 10 year capital plan.","We're thankful for the constructive regulatory environment in Michigan that allows for timely rate orders and forward planning and the Commission's commitment to working with us to continuously improve the safety and reliability of our system.","I'll remind you regardless of changing conditions around us our triple bottom line and simple business model has served our customers and investors well and allows us to perform consistently year in and year out. ","As highlighted on slide 10, our track record demonstrates our ability to deliver the consistent premium results you've come to expect year after year after year. And this year, you can expect the same.","With that I'll turn the call over to Rejji. ","A - Rejji Hayes","Thank you Patti and good morning everyone. Before I get into the details, I'd like to share the wonderful news that Travis Uphaus from our IR team and his wife Marilyn welcomed their seventh child, Mark Christine Uphaus on Tuesday morning. So we are wishing me Uphaus family our very best from our headquarters in Jackson, Michigan.","As Patti highlighted we're pleased to report our 2019 adjusted net income of $708 million or $2.49 per share up 7% year-over-year. Our adjusted EPS excludes select non-recurring items, including estimated severance and retention costs from our co-workers at our current coal facilities were just scheduled to be retired in 2023 as well as a recognition of an expense related to the potential settlement of legacy legal matters.","2019 results of the utility were largely driven by constructive outcomes in our electric rate case settlement in January 2019 and the gas rate order we received in September, which were partially offset by heavy storm activity, particularly in the first three quarters of the year. Our non-utility segment's raised [ph] guidance by $0.02 in aggregate, largely due to low cost financings at CMS Energy and solid performance from EnerBank.","As we review our full suite of financial and customer portability targets for 2019 on slide 12, you'll note that in addition to achieving 7% annual adjusted EPS growth, we grew our dividend commensurately and generated approximately $1.8 billion of operating cash flow.","Our steady cash flow generation and conservative financing strategy over the years continue to fortify our balance sheet, as evidenced by our strong FFO to debt ratio, which is approximately 17.5% at year-end and required no equity issuances in 2019.","Lastly, in accordance with our self-funding model, we effectively met our customer affordability targets by keeping bills at or below inflation for both the gas and electric businesses, all while investing a record level of capital of approximately $2.3 billion at the utilities.","Moving on to 2020, as Patti noted, we are raising our 2020 adjusted earnings guidance from $2.64 to $2.68 per share, which implies 6% to 8% annual growth off of our 2019 actuals. Unsurprisingly, we expect utility to drive vast majority of our consolidated financial performance with the usual steady contribution from the non-utility business segments.","One item to note is that enterprises EPS guidance is slightly down from their 2019 results given the absence of a gain on the sale of collect assets in the second quarter 2019. All in we will continue to target the midpoint of our consolidated EPS growth range at yearend.","To elaborate on the glide path to achieve our 2020 EPS guidance range, as you'll note on the waterfall chart on slide 14, we plan for normal weather, which in this case amounts to an estimated $0.06, a negative year-over-year variance given the colder than normal weather experienced in 2019 in the benefit of our gas business.","We anticipate the cost reduction initiatives, largely driven by the CE Way and other expected sources of year-over-year favorability, such as lower storm restoration expenses after an unprecedented level of storm activity last year, will fully offset the absence of favorable weather in 2019.","It is also worth noting, that we capitalized on an opportunity to fully fund our defined benefit pension plan earlier this month, which provides additional non-operating cost savings and EPS risk mitigation.","Moving on to rate relief, we anticipate approximately $0.17 of EPS pickup in 2020. As mentioned during our Q3 call about two-thirds of this pickup has already been approved by the Commission, and the gas rate order we received in September and the approval of our renewable energy plan, in the first quarter of 2019.","We will expect a final order in our pending gas case in October of this year, which effectively makes up the balance of our expected rate relief driven EPS contribution in 2020. While we plan to file an electric case in Q1 of this year, the test year for that case will start in 2021.","Lastly, we apply our usual conservative assumptions around sales, financings and other variables. As always, we will adapt to new conditions and circumstances throughout the year, to mitigate risk and increase the likelihood of meeting our financial and operational objectives to the benefit of customers and investors.","As we work toward delivering our 2020 EPS target, we remain focused on cost reduction opportunities, within our entire $5.5 billion cost structure, the core components of which are illustrated on slide 15. For well over a decade, we have managed to achieve planned and unplanned cost savings to mitigate interior risk and create long-term headroom in our electric and gas bills to support our substantial customer investments at the utility.","As we looked at 2020 and beyond, we continue to believe there are numerous cost reduction opportunities throughout our cost structure. These opportunities include but are not limited to the exploration of high price PPAs, the retirement of our coal fleet, capital enabled savings as we modernize our electric and gas distribution systems, and the continued maturation of our lean operating system the CE Way.","These opportunities will provide sources of interior risk mitigation, as well as a sustainable funding strategy for our long-term customer investment plan, which will keep customers' bills low on an absolute basis, and relative to other household staples in Michigan as depicted in the chart on the right hand side of the page.","Moving on to, weather normalized sales. As we've discussed in the past, economic conditions in Michigan remained positive, particularly in our electric service territory, which is anchored by Grand Rapids, one of the fastest growing cities in the country, as evidenced by the statistics on the upper left hand corner of slide 16.","And when it comes to Michigan's economy, we are not passive participants. In fact, in addition to directly investing billions of dollars throughout the state annually, we collaborate with key stakeholders across the state to drive industrial activity through our economic development efforts. These efforts have attracted nearly 300 megawatts of new electric load in our service territory since 2016.","And in 2019 alone, the contracts we signed will support over 3600 jobs, and bring in more than $1.5 billion of investment to Michigan. A prosperous Michigan, supported by our economic development efforts, offers multiple benefits to our business model.","In the near term, it drives volumetric sales, which support our financial objectives and longer-term it creates headroom in customer bills by reducing our rates. As mentioned in the past, we also continue to see a positive spillover effect of Fed industrial activity on our higher margin, residential and commercial segments overtime in the form of steady customer count growth and favorable load trends.","As you'll note in the chart on the right hand side of the slide, we've seen average residential load growth of 1% and 1.5% for the electric and gas businesses respectively, over the past five years when normalized for weather and our energy efficiency programs.","To summarize our financial and customer affordability targets for 2020 and beyond, we expect another solid year of 6% to 8% adjusted EPS growth, solid operating cash flow growth, exclusive of the aforementioned discretionary pension contribution, and customer prices at or below inflation.","From a balance sheet perspective, we continue to target solid investment grade credit metrics. And as you'll note, our equity needs are approximately $250 million in 2022 due to the previously noted deferral of our equity issuance means in 2019. We expect our equity needs to be roughly $150 million per year in 2021.","And beyond, which can be completed through our ATM equity issuance program, which will likely file along with our shelf during the first half of this year. Our model has served our stakeholders well in the past as customers received safe, reliable and clean electric and gas on affordable prices and our investors benefit from consistent industry leading financial performance.","On slide 18, we have refreshed our sensitivity analysis on key variables for your modeling assumptions. As you'll note with reasonable planning assumptions and robust risk mitigation, the probability of large variances from our plan are minimized.","There will always be sources of volatility in this business, be they weather, fuel cost, regulatory outcomes or otherwise. And every year we view it as our mandate due to the warning for you and mitigate the risk accordingly.","And with that, I'll hand it back to Patti for her concluding remarks before q&a.","Patti Poppe","Thank you, Rejji. Our investment thesis is compelling and will serve our customers, our planet and our investors for years to come.","And with that, Chad, would you please open the line for q&a?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly, thank you very much Patti. The question and answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator instructions] The First question will come from Greg Gordon was Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. ","Greg Gordon","Hey, good morning Patti, Rejji.","Patti Poppe","Morning, Greg.","Rejji Hayes","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon","Couple questions on the year. So did you -- Rejji, did you say that small asset sale gain from enterprises was in the second quarter? Is that correct? ","Rejji Hayes","Yes. That's right.","Greg Gordon","Can you can you just give us a little more description of what asset it was and what you saw, the rational for that?","Rejji Hayes","Absolutely. So enterprises specifically dig at some transmission related assets. The informal parlance and switchyard assets, which they sold to ITC transmission in the second quarter. And so we booked again at roughly $16 million or $0.04 in Q2. That was part of our plan throughout the year, which is why you'll see sort of an aberrant trend between our '19 actuals and what we anticipate for 2020.","Greg Gordon","Understood, it may be wrong, but I think you're breaking interbank out separately now, for the first time. I'm happy to get the incremental disclosure. But can you just give us the rationale for that? And then I have one more question. ","Rejji Hayes","Yeah, happy to. EnerBank this year, and they had a wonderful year as Patti noted, they hit about $2.6 billion, a little over $2.6 billion in assets, which is in excess of 10% of our consolidated asset rational. And so we chose to report out this segment at this point. ","Greg Gordon","Great. My final question is on the decision to fund the pension, how much did -- how much sort of dollars did you top off the pension? And can we think about the financial benefit of that being sort of the delta between the financing costs and the expected pension return? ","Rejji Hayes","Yeah. So starting with your last question first, yes, we did take into account and you should assume that the EPS related pickup is net of the funding costs. And so we anticipate about $0.05 earnings per share upside attributable to that. The amount and you'll see this in the appendix is a little over $530 million. And so that allowed us to fully fund our inactive defined benefit plan.","Greg Gordon","And that was funded from a parent infusion or from off of the actual operating company, balance sheet? ","Rejji Hayes","The latter. So we did a term loan in the interim at Consumers Energy. And it's interesting, the term loan funding of that was about $300 million. We actually had a little bit of excess cash flow that allowed us to fund it with a bit of excess cash, which also helped the EPS accretion attributable to that.","Greg Gordon","Okay, thank you all very much. Have a great morning.","Rejji Hayes","Thank you, Greg.","Patti Poppe","Thank you, Greg.","Operator","The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hi, good morning team.","Rejji Hayes","Good morning, Julien.","Patti Poppe","Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So, perhaps just kicking off first, as usual, we're focused on the CapEx in the upward trend and nicely done on the upward of $0.5 billion increase here as you go forward. Can you talk a little bit about the upside trajectory? I suppose, if we take that $0.5 billion just kind of in the latest single year in isolation, going forward and you continue to do that, you end up somewhat in excess of your 10 year plan.","So, obviously, we talked about the full but perhaps this might be an opportunity to elaborate a little bit. And then probably the second question was a time, DP had some pushback on their latest process on procurement in there R&D. Any reasons with respect to your ongoing efforts on the renewable side specifically? What are specific quests on it?","Patti Poppe","Well, I'll take the first part, and I'll let Rejji take the second part, Julien. The capital plan, the $25 billion capital plan, does have fluctuations year-to-year some. And you'll see, we've got a five year look in the appendix of the deck, so you can see what the plan is by year. And we do have some opportunities in that $25 billion and we talked about that after the third quarter.","You know, there's certainly demand for additional spend on electric reliability and grid modernization and our gas business. And as always, we're working to balance the competing demands for capital internally, having our internal capital battles, if you will, but also making sure that our bills remain affordable, making sure that the capacity to do the work is possible. So that, we have good credibility with our regulators that we do, what we said we're going to do.","And so the upside that you see in this first five year forward adding additional year is the natural fluctuation, but it all supports the $25 billion plan and that supports our 6% to 8% growth trajectory.","Rejji Hayes","Yeah, Julien, you also just asked about what could allow us to -- I think, if I heard you correctly, just dip into those upside opportunities in this, Patti and I have talked about in the past. Now the constraints are primarily, customer affordability.","And so that is the primary constraint on whether they will be able to dip into those upside opportunities to $3 billion to $4 billion in that 10 year plan, as well as balance sheet constraints and potentially workforce capacity. And so, overtime as all of those potentially move favorably. We will consider recalibrating, but for now, that's where the plan sets.","Now getting to your second question related to if I heard you correctly, again, the seed wasn't all that good, but it sounded like a potential reaction to I think the ALJs decision and DTEs integrated research. But needless to say, we're not going to speak for DTE on their regulatory filings. But if you're asking whether that has an impact on our IRP and the execution of IRP, the answer to that is no, we obviously just concluded the RFP. Well, first we got approval for our IRP in mid last year.","And we just concluded in September or deepen the Q4. The request for proposal for the first launch of 300 megawatts of solar. This is part of a longer-term effort to really build out solar generating assets, to the tune of 6 gigawatts by 2040.","And this first trance or call it 1.1 gigawatts that we're approving the settlement, we just did about 300 megawatts this year, we'll do another 300 megawatts, in RFP in September this year in the balance of 500 megawatts in 2021, half of which will be rate base, half of which will be PPA. And so we're in execution mode, and obviously, we'll look to file a new IRP in June of '21 for the settlement. So, that's where we stand on that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","All right. Excellent. I'll leave it there. And thank you all. Best of luck.","Rejji Hayes","Thank you.","Patti Poppe","Thanks, Julien.","Operator","The next question will be from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Michael Weinstein","Hi, good morning guys.","Patti Poppe","Good morning, Michael.","Michael Weinstein","Hey. I just wanted to confirm that the extra $500 million of capital spending that's planned for the next five years is not part of the $3 billion to $4 billion of upside opportunities, right? Because the total 10 year plan didn't really change that much.","Patti Poppe","That's right, Michael, you've got that right. This is just the one year roll forward. So it shows the modification in the plan.","Michael Weinstein","Got it. So this a -- is it in acceleration of spending that you would have done in the second five years of that 10 year plan basically?","Patti Poppe","No, it's right in line with our plan to add some additional, the IRP solar that was approved as well as some additional electric reliability. And really you can plan on fluctuation between the gas, the electric, the renewable parts of the spend as the years go forward, so that we can optimize that capital spend to the benefit of customers.","And, again, as mitigating the challenges that Rejji articulated around affordability balance sheet. We're always just working the plan to have the highest value capital year after year.","Michael Weinstein","Right. And also, I wanted to confirm that there's no incremental equity needs from any of that either doesn't -- obviously doesn't look like a plan change at all and equity. And that this is all -- it's all ATM and internal programs, right? There's no block equity. ","Rejji Hayes","Yeah. That's correct.","Michael Weinstein","Okay. And one thing I would maybe you could talk a little bit more about is you discussed a little bit about the attraction of new commercial or industrial customers in your territory. And can you discuss the potential impact on electric load and on your industrial customers as electric vehicles gain traction across the supply chain for the auto industry?","Patti Poppe","Yeah, I would say industrial loads that we are seeing being added actually ends up being very unrelated to automotive. Michigan is more and more diversified. We've had some big ag customer additions and some pharma additions. And so I would say if anything, we're seeing some diversification in Michigan and our makeup of our industrial rate base.","But I would also say -- our industrial customer base. But I would also offer on the EV front that as the chair of the EEI electric transportation as the co-chair of that committee, I've had an opportunity to really get exposed to some of the national fleet operators. We had Amazon for example at our National EEI Meeting in January talking about their ambitions to electrify their fleet.","I see that as a big opportunity. Load growth for electric per capital certainly has not had significant increases in fact it goes down in many cases as equipment gets more efficient, lighting gets more efficient. And I think that fleet potential to be actual load growth potential in the future as their ambitions materialize. Now I will tell you it's not going to sneak up on. ","Because with their first of all, they need to have electric transportation at the fleet scale available, the actual vehicles, the trucks, et cetera. And that development cycle is not fast. But then we'll be working with them to cite their charging stations and make sure we maximize the benefit to the grid and minimize the addition to peak demand. ","So I think it's a great opportunity, frankly for the industry. And Michigan will certainly be participants in that.","Michael Weinstein","Super, thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will be from Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Praful Mehta","Thanks so much. Hi guys, and congrats on a good quarter. ","Patti Poppe","Thanks, Praful.","Rejji Hayes","Thank you Praful.","Praful Mehta","So maybe first, a more big picture step back question. Utilities clearly have been doing well in the in the current stock price environment, and CMS clearly doing well do given the execution. Do you think there is any use of that currency from your perspective, M&A or otherwise that you think you can look at or execution is primarily the focus at this point?","Rejji Hayes","Yeah, Praful. Our position on M&A versus organic growth has been consistent for some time. And we're fully focused on executing on our capital plan. We've got enough to do within our walls. And as I've said in the past, we're paying one times book to fund those capital investments, I'd rather do that and pay a premium for somebody else's CapEx backlog. So we're acutely focused on executing on our plan.","Praful Mehta","Fair enough. Makes sense. Then, just quickly on the operating cash flow, then you're looking at the slide 17. And you say up 100 from the 2020's $1.7 billion. Just can you walk through that what's the increase that you're kind of seeing in the long term plan? And I guess connected to that I also saw increased NOL utilization on slide 23. So just try to understand a little bit of the drivers around the operating cash flow. ","Rejji Hayes","Yeah, so Praful as you may recall, prior to the enactment of tax reform at the end of 2017 we were on this very healthy trajectory of about $100 million of year-over-year or at least year versus prior year budget OCF accretion per year. And it has to do with just the very nice fundamentals of this business.","I mean, we're investing capital, growing rate base, getting solid customer receipts. And I'll give full credit to our folks who manage working capital very well on our team as well. And so it's just a nice, healthy byproduct of all that good work there.","And so the only reason we paused slightly was just due to tax reform and the cash flow degradation effects of that. So we basically took a two year pause on that level of growth. And so we guided in 2018 at $1.65 billion we managed to exceed that. ","And again, we guided in 2019 a $1.65 billion and managed to exceed that again. And so now we feel like again, relative to what we budgeted, the prior year will be back on that sort of $100 million per year increase starting this year in 2020. ","And so that's what we have in the forecast and we feel very good about that, particularly given the magnitude of the capital investment plan, our ability to manage our costs, and again, just execute well in the working capital front. And so we feel like we have a very nice glide path to continue on that trajectory. ","Now, as it pertains to NOLs and credits, we obviously had a significant remeasurement going back to tax reform on our NOLs, we still think we've got a little bit of utilization left on what's remaining. But then also, we still have quite a few business credits that we've accumulated overtime and we expect modest accretion of that, just given some of our efforts in the renewable side.","And so that's where you see still decent amount of also a combination of NOLs and tax credits. And so at this point, we don't expect to be, a federal tax payer until call it 2024. There's a modest amount that we will pay in 2023, based on our forecast, but really not a partial taxpayer to 2024. Is that helpful? ","Praful Mehta","Yeah, that's super helpful. Thanks for that. And then just finally, in terms of storm impacts and storm costs, is there any in the current rate case filing, is there any plan to change what gets recovered or what is allowed to be recovered in terms of storm costs?","Patti Poppe","Yeah, in our next electric rate case, certainly we want to reflect the average service restoration expenses. And what we've been recovering in rates is less than what we've actually experienced on the last five year average. And so we want that to be reflected.","But we also want and believe that with the age of the system that our increased spend in both the fundamental reliability of the system, we've been increasing both the actual spend as well as the requested spend, we think there's a lot of justification for that to keep up with the age of the system. ","And so we'll continue to ramp the reliability spend. But we also want accurate reflection of the operating expenses associated with service restoration. And while frankly at the same time, we're working to reduce the cost of every interruption by making our processes more efficient, by making our utilizing technology to respond faster and at a lower cost. And so we're doing both simultaneously.","Praful Mehta","Got it super powerful. Congrats again, guys.","Patti Poppe","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.","Shar Pourreza","Hey, good morning, guys. ","Patti Poppe","Good morning, Shar. ","Rejji Hayes","Good morning Shar.","Shar Pourreza","Just on a couple questions. On your annual CapEx guide in your disclosures that's closer to the back of the slide deck. There's obviously some shuffling spend between 2020 and 2021, can you just remind us what actually drove this.","And can you maybe talk a little bit more about the new CapEx you're introducing towards the back end, really more specifically on the mix between gas and electric? ","Rejji Hayes","Sure, Shar, happy to take that. So a little bit of the shift that you probably have noticed between what's we're expecting or what we were expecting in 2020 in our prior five year plan that we rolled out in Q1 of last year, instead of this five year plan, it has everything to do with just the timing of the rate case in the forward test years.","And so this current vintage now that we're a year smarter reflects the magnitude of spend we expect in 2021. And that aligns nicely with the gas case that's pending, that we filed in December of last year, and with the electric case, we\u2019ll likely file in Q1 of this year. ","And so that's really what why you see that shifting between 2020 and 2021. And what we've always said and this remains true to form is that, the absolute amount for the quantum of capital we anticipate spending on a five year period one year period is, always pretty consistent.","But the composition does change overtime and sometimes you get shifts in a year, and so that's effectively what you're seeing. And then for the outer years, I think Patti did a nice job summarizing this, is just, we're just basically losing 2019 from the prior vintage and rolling in another year.","So going from a '19 to '23 plan to a '20 to '24 plan. And as part of that roll forward, you're seeing an expansion, more of the solar generation will do attributable to the IRP, so taking on that sort of final tranche of call it 250 megawatts that will rate base.","And then you couple that with additional spend, in both our electric distribution, reliability related capital investments as well as gas infrastructure spend. And so those are kind of the pieces you're seeing in the back end of that five year period.","Shar Pourreza","Got it. And then some of the -- and then Patti just started to be a dead horse on this, but I just had a follow-up on that incremental capital opportunities, you guys have been highlighting. It seems like you're managing O&M well.","You have built headroom that continues to improve the economic backdrop remain strong in your service stories. You kind of highlight, you do have sort of balance sheet capacity. So I'm kind of curious is what are the drivers that we are missing as far as you look to pull forward some of that spend.","Is there anything else outside of just managing towards that 7% growth target, that midpoint? Is it a function of trying to find the optimal capital projects internally? So what's sort of the offsets those drivers, because it seems like the drivers seem to fit towards you accelerating spend versus not. ","Patti Poppe","You know, one thing I'll tell you about our 10 year capital plan, you know, I think some people might argue that it's impossible to have a 10 year capital plan because conditions change so much or you don't know enough about the future.","I can tell you our 10 year capital plan has a significant amount of meat on the bones. And what we intend to do is make sure that we are able to execute the work that we have committed to. And so I'll tell you, the ramp up of capital requires a significant operational and ability to execute and prepare the workforce.","And when we hear nationally about constraints on ability to attract talent and to build out a workforce, we have to attract the workforce to deliver all that work. And so that we want to make sure is well timed and well-planned so that we do precisely what we said we're going to do. ","And it's also important that from an affordability standpoint that our customers are able to pay and would value for, value the investment that we'd be making on their behalf. So really customer affordability continues to be a front of mind.","And, and as an operator myself, I want to make sure my team is ready and prepared to execute the work that we commit to. It's easy to write a number in a spreadsheet. It's not a thing to go dig the trench and lay the wire and roll the trucks. So we've got to make sure that we're ready all the way around. ","Shar Pourreza","Got it. So the human capital I expect is bit of a constraint. Okay, great. All right thanks so much guys. Congrats again. ","Patti Poppe","Thank you, Shar. ","Operator","Our next question will be from Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. ","Jonathan Arnold","Good morning guys.","Patti Poppe","Good morning, Jonathan.","Rejji Hayes","Good morning, Jonathan.","Jonathan Arnold","Thanks for taking my question. So I was going to ask you about the shift in the CapEx from '20 to '21, and I think you've addressed that. So thank you for that. Just one other issue. Now you're giving this breakout of enterprises, bank and the parents, which it sounds like you'll continue to do that going forward, given the size.","But should we think Reggie, about the parent roughly consistent going forward with this number you're showing for 2020, or is that going to move around out in the five year plan? ","Rejji Hayes","Well, it should increase over time, Jonathan, because keep in mind, that's largely at this point, interest expense at the parent and you know, we have $12.2 billion of capital investments that we're going to be funding over this period.","And so obviously we do the best we can in terms of getting low interest rates realized in our debt financings, but we just assume that the new money will be raising that that interest expense should come up over time or increase over time.","And so we do expect that segment to increase. Every now and then we overachieve of course. Because Sri and his team has been very good at getting financings at lower rates than anticipated, but it conservatively, we'll assume that that segment does increase. ","Jonathan Arnold","Okay. So you can just basically financing of portion of the underlying growth. I think that's it. I already want to talk on the CapEx, so thank you. ","Patti Poppe","Thanks Jonathan. ","Operator","And the next question will be from Ali Agha with STRH. Please go ahead. ","Ali Agha","Good morning. ","Patti Poppe","Good morning, Ali. ","Ali Agha","First question you, Patti, can you just remind us again, as you are looking at the sales data, roughly how much on an annual basis does energy efficiency sort of takeaway from the sales numbers?","Rejji Hayes","Yeah. So, and this has been, basically come out of the new, what I can call do so much but the 2016 energy law, Ali. And so we have a 1.5% year over year reduction target that we get economic incentives on. And so you take the prior year's load and then you reduced that by 1.5%.","And we do that through all of the nice programs we have and rebates on led light bulbs and things of that nature. And so that's, we're historically, we've been for the last few years, our current five year plan, and we've been very public about this as part of our RRP is to expand those energy waste reduction programs.","And so we're on a glide path to get to a 2% year-over-year reduction. And so that'll be about 2% of our prior year's low's and so I just want to reemphasize that we do get economic incentives on those programs. And so historically, that's been a run rate of call $34 million pretax combined electric and gas.","And so as we glide path to that 2%, that amount of pretax income will crest at about $47 million for the latter years of this plan. And we anticipate about $41 million in 2020 alone as we glide path up. And so we anticipate again, 1.5% to 2% reduction in load as part of that, and remember, it also gets screwed up in the rates as we file new cases. And so that is also something worth noting. ","Ali Agha","Okay. And so just to be clear, if I look at the numbers for calendar '19, as reported weather normalize was negative 1.4. If we adjust that for and at your efficiency, then it should be done relatively flat. And I know you're sort of on an apples-to-apples basis looking at that being up 1%, I believe in '20 and perhaps beyond that.","So can you just talk a little bit more about that dynamic, you had growth going up to 1% and beyond? ","Rejji Hayes","Happy to. And we actually tried to get in front of that question because it comes up quite a bit by offering this new slide 16 in the presentation. But you're thinking about it Ali the right way. And so if you look at that sort of blended, weather normalized, electric load for 2019 versus 2018 1.4% down think of that as flat. ","I\u2019ll also note what's embedded in that 1.4% is a reduction in volume from a very large low margin customer. And so when you back out the effects of that large low margin customer, our weather normalized sales goes from 1.4% down to about 0.5% down. And then if you take out the effects, energy efficiency will now you're up 1%. ","And you can look across all of our channels for electric and see that trend, which we think is the right way to think about it. So residential flat, so again you normalize for energy efficiency, you're up 1.5%, commercial down 1.1%, you normalize you\u2019re up 0.5%. And we have seen those organic trends in our customer accounts just to make sure that we're not being too scientific here. ","And so we feel quite good about that. And think there is very healthy economic growth in our service territory, particularly with the high margin part of our supply chain, -- our customer segments.","Ali Agha","Got you. And one last question. I know as you mentioned, that the 2016 energy law is fully implemented, et cetera. Anything of note in this year's legislative session for us to keep an eye on that maybe relevant to you folks or something that you guys are keeping an eye on as well?","Patti Poppe","No, Ali, I would suggest, particularly here in Michigan, there's nothing really being driven by the elections this fall. Certainly the presidential election is going to be a big distraction. We do have our whole house, State House, of course has two year terms and our congressional districts have two year terms. And so there's reelection. ","Our governor did her state of the state last night and she doubled down on her commitment to fix the damn roads here in Michigan. That's her slogan not mine. And so we're happy to support the investment and infrastructure.","And, frankly, as we do more road repairs, it's a great opportunity for us to collaborate with our Department of Transportation and our construction work here in Michigan to do our investment infrastructure at a lower cost for all citizens. ","So I would say nothing though new from a legislative agenda here in Michigan.","Ali Agha","Got it. Thank you. ","Operator","The next question comes from Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please go ahead. ","Travis Miller","Thank you. Good morning. ","Patti Poppe","Good morning, Travis.","Travis Miller","On the gas case. I wonder if you could layout some of the -- I don\u2019t use the word contentious, but some of the more debatable issues that you see coming up there, and in particular, the ROE and the decision to go with the higher request. ","Patti Poppe","Yeah. Well, a couple things, Travis. First of all, as I mentioned, we have this 10 year gas -- natural gas delivery plan that we filed with our case. And that plan has been well vetted with actually collaborated with our staff at the commission and its development and aligning on our priorities. ","One thing I can firmly applaud our commission for is their commitment to being able to see long-term plan so they can make better decisions in a one year case. And so this 10 year gas plan we filed has a lot of meat on the bones. And I feel very good about it.","You can look at our last case and see that over 90% approval of the capital that we requested is a good indicator that that work that we have committed to doing is the work that the commission would want us to do as well. So we feel good about that. ","Now on the ROE, of course we feel justified in 10.5% ROE ask. And so we always make sure that we have adequate justification for that. It yields about a $25 million impact. If you take the 10.5 to 9.9. And so we recognize that the commission has a job to do. They've made it clear that they recognize that a healthy ROE is important to the utility.","Low cost of capital is important for the benefit of customers and the utility. And so we look forward to seeing what the final outcome of that rate case would be. But what's more important, I think as we really take an eye on is the volume of capital and the alignment with the staff and the Commission on the work that we're doing.","Travis Miller","Okay, great. You anticipated my question on ROE. So I want to ask that delta number. But broadly on the enterprise and EnerBank and especially enterprise. What's your three year strategy? Any updates to that here in the last quarter or two? ","Rejji Hayes","Yeah. So, the plan at enterprises has been pretty straightforward for some time. And so, obviously, a dig drives the vast majority of the financial performance of enterprises. And we really have tried to derisk that business on its future earnings potential quite a bit through the energy contracts that we amended and extended about a year or so ago.","And then we've also walked in good deal of our capacity open margin over the next few years as well. And so we feel like this should be pretty steady, predictable performance at enterprises. I'll also note we've done a few of these contract of renewable opportunities now the last year and a half.","And so, we will look to be opportunistic if those -- if we find nice opportunities with third parties where we can get attractive returns, credit worthy counterparties. And basically, I've described very little terminal value to projects like that. And so we'll look to do those from time to time. But again, we expect the three or four look to be pretty, pretty straightforward. ","Travis Miller","Okay, great. Any of those contracted renewables and the CapEx plan right now?","Rejji Hayes","Not in the 12 that we highlighted.","Travis Miller","Okay. Great. Thank you very much. ","Patti Poppe","Thanks Travis.","Operator","The next question is from Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank.","Andrew Weisel","Good morning, everyone.","Patti Poppe","Good morning Andrew.","Andrew Weisel","I've got one near term and one long term. First on the near term, if you can elaborate. Rejji you gave a lot of good color on the demand trends by class. Are you able to estimate like how much of the impact particularly industrial is related to tariffs and trade wars? And then what are your assumptions for load growth embedded in the 2020 guidance? ","Rejji Hayes","Yeah, so we have, I'll say for 2020 guidance, we're fairly conservative in our position both in 2020. And also over the course of the five year plan. And so for electric and again, you got to keep it -- take into account that we have the energy efficiency programs embedded in that.","We're assuming about, call it flat to slightly declining for electric. And so that is our working assumption for really 2020 and beyond. And it's a gas, flat to maybe slightly up based on the trends we're seeing there. And so that's our current position. ","In terms of industrial activity clearly, we've talked in the past about the diversified nature of our industrial customers and our electric service territory. And I'll just remind that, folks at about 2% of our gross margin equivalent comes from the auto sector.","And so yes, of course we do have exposure to companies that may have some level of exposure to export\/import markets to trade war, whatever you want to call it. But, at the end of the day a lot of the margin we generate comes from our residential and commercial customers. And we continue to see very nice trends there. ","And so, the industrial activity, we're obviously a very supportive of it through our economic development efforts. We do think it's important to Michigan and our efforts on the residential commercial side, but really the vast majority of our sales are driven by residential commercial margin there, and we've seen good trends.","The only other data point I'll leave you with is that 1% change in our industrial estimated growth probably drives about a half a penny of EPS. And so there really isn't a significant impact when you see variation in the industrial class, because of this much lower margin.","Andrew Weisel","Right. Makes sense. Okay, good. Next longer term question. You continue to point to the midpoint of the 6% to 8% range. And obviously you've been delivering 7% and that's probably not a surprise. My question is you show rate-based growth of 7% excluding the upside opportunities on CapEx. ","You have some incremental EPS growth from things like the energy efficiency and demand response incentives as well as the EnerBank growth. My question is, what would prevent you from hitting the high end of the range going forward? Is that equity dilution or any other factors? ","Patti Poppe","Well, I'd say number one, we're always balancing the ability for our customers to afford the products so that we have a sustainable plan. And I'll also offer, and you can see, from our track record on years when there has been some favorability on a year when we could have delivered more than the midpoint we reinvested in the business.","And so one of the key components of our success here is our consistent performance that you actually can set your watch to, that you can rest at night. That's our goal. And so the idea that we would start to fluctuate in pursuit of a higher target really, is not consistent with our commitment to delivering as you would expect year after year after year.","And actually so at, even at this stage of the year, we're thinking two years out, not just next year. And so we're always looking for ways to pull ahead expenses, re-invest favorability for the benefit of the consistency in the long run. ","Andrew Weisel","Sounds good. I'll speak in the last one. Patti, no story of the month, any quick one you can throw at us? ","Patti Poppe","Let's see. Layers many of them. Here's one just off the top of my head. We had a team at one of our service centers, really looking at their meter management process. And when we went out to talk to them, Garrick Rochow, our Head of Operations observed that this team had this problem of meter inventory and how they were managing that inventory.","And because they have these teams called fix it now teams which are empowered work teams right on the ground level focused on driving the business. They had identified this issue with their inventories of meters and identified a $2 million savings specifically that benefits that can be actually parlayed to other service centers that changed their work process. ","This CE Way is becoming embedded in our organization and the ability to teach our coworkers to see and eliminate waste and improve their process. It reduces what we call their own human struggle when our coworkers see human struggle that they can reduce it often parlays into dollars, make their job easier to do, makes them more committed to the ownership of the company.","And it's another good example of a real savings that get driven by real people who do the real work. And I could not be more proud of the team. Thanks for asking. We have a big debate whether I should include that in the script and I am very happy that you asked Andrew. ","Andrew Weisel","I mean you'd have one at your fingertips. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Greg Oriel [ph] with UBS. Please go ahead. ","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks. ","Patti Poppe","Good morning, Greg. ","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. With the renewables CapEx that you've outlined on slide 22, can you maybe comment on how that, contributes to a rate-based growth or as a portion of overall rate based in the plan? ","Rejji Hayes","So Greg, what that's comprised of, it's the combination of renewable spend and certainly in the near term portion of this five year plan to get to the RPS, sorry, a renewable portfolio standard of 15% by 2021 as per the energy law.","So that's the components you'll see instead of the 2020, 2021 timeframe. And we have good projects in the pipeline that we think will allow us to get there. And then the latter portion, as we've talked about in the past is a part of the IRP related renewable spend.","And so again, as we start to execute on this 1.1 gigawatts trench half of which will be owned, half of which will be PPA or contracted that's what's making up the balance of that. In terms of the rate base component, we have of the 1.8 billion of capital, we plan to spend in aggregate over the five year period.","It probably drives about or probably represents about 6% of rate base or thereabouts. So not all that significant at this moment, but overtime we will expect that to grow some. But the vast majority of the spend as we've talked on the past is wires and pipes.","We think that's where if you really want to get the biggest bang for the buck, it's really in the investment in the safety and reliability of our system, both in gas infrastructure and electric infrastructure. And so that's where you see the vast majority of the rate base span and the rate base growth accordingly.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thank you. Congratulations. ","Rejji Hayes","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from David Fishman with Goldman Sachs.","David Fishman","Hi, good morning, and congrats on another consistent year. ","Rejji Hayes","Thank you, David. Good morning. ","Patti Poppe","Good morning. ","David Fishman","Good morning. So, I apologize if this is already been asked. But with the natural gas distribution plan filed, given such a long-term look, effectively by program, when would you expect really if at all to file for another IRM or another multi-year mechanism, I mean, just given the detail by category in this filing along with the IRT and it certainly seems like you are potentially positioning consumers to work with commission toward our mechanism of some kind in the 2020s?","Patti Poppe","You know, I would offer this David. I have mixed feelings about the IR of long-term plans. Because the reality is the system is dynamic, the demands are dynamic. One of the great strengths of our plan, as I highlighted in my prepared remarks is that we've got a lot of flexibility. ","This large percent of our spend under $200 million, the ability to file every year simple concrete filings that are part of a long-term plan allow us to adjust when conditions change. And there\u2019s no big bet strategy that we have employed for over a decade now has served as well in our ability to be flexible.","And so when you lock-in a three year filing and a system like the gas system where you can have dynamism, maybe you've got new regulations, maybe there's an incident somewhere else in the country that reprioritizes our system and our investment strategy. ","I personally liked the flexibility of an annual filing that allows us to go ahead and adjust as necessary. Now, the simplicity of a filing, if you've got multiyear plans certainly can be appealing. And if our commission was leaning that way, and they really preferred that, then of course, we would work with them on that.","But I think the idea of that we\u2019re dynamic and so as our plan has more relevance to our ability to deliver consistently.","David Fishman","Okay, that makes sense. And then the other item just on the filing. I thought you guys did a good job of breaking out your expectation kind of cost reductions, starting in 2021, kind of through the 2020s. We've heard a lot about on the electric side, the potential fuel cost savings and O&M.","But I was wondering if you could kind of elaborate a little bit following kind of extensive review what kind of big buckets or drivers and trajectory you're seeing at the natural gas side in the 2020s? ","Patti Poppe","Yeah, I'd say the natural gas side, it's all about the efficiency of getting the work done. And with every dollar of capital there's still associated O&M that comes with that. So when we can make our capital more efficient, we can make our O&M more efficient.","So we continue to work on our unit costs, on driving our unit costs, on reducing waste from our the ability to execute work, our leak backlog and leak response as a large O&M expense. And so when we make the capital investments that reduce vintage services and service lines and vintage mains, for example, we\u2019re able to reduce operating costs.","And we just completed also large capital project on our automated meter reading for our gas meters. And that helps reduce O&M expense as well that obviously reduces the daily walkthrough of someone's backyard and walking down into their basement to read their meter. We cannot do drive by meter reads that's significantly more efficient and safer for our workforce. ","So there's lots of operating expense benefits to waste elimination in the gas business as well.","David Fishman","Great. Thank you. Those are my questions.","Patti Poppe","Thanks.","Operator","The next question will come from Andrew Levi with ExodusPoint. Please go ahead.","Andrew Levi","Hey, good morning. I guess [indiscernible]. ","Patti Poppe","Good morning. ","Andrew Levi","Just on EnerBank. Obviously, Rejji, we've discussed kind of the company before. Just what are your thoughts as far as the pros of keeping it first, the pros of potentially not keeping it?","Patti Poppe","You know, Andrew, EnerBank is really a valued part of the CMS family. They had a great year. And that's really what we think about EnerBank. They were a great contribution here last year, and in many years in the past.","Andrew Levi","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to return the conference back to Patti Poppe for any closing remarks. ","Patti Poppe","Well, thanks, Chad. And thanks again, everyone for joining us this morning. We certainly look forward to seeing you throughout the year. 2020 is going to be a great one. Thanks so much. ","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference.

This presentation is also being web cast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Glenn Barba, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Thank you.","Glenn Barba","Good morning and thank you for joining us today. With me are John Russell, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Webb, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Our earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this web cast are available on our web site.","This presentation is made as of today, July 24, and contains forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements should be considered in the context of the risk and other factors detailed in CMS Energy's and Consumer's SEC filings.

Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us on our second quarter earnings call. I will begin the presentation with an overview of the quarter, before I turn the call over to Tom, to discuss the financial results and the outlook for the remainder of 2014. Then we will close with Q&A.","In the first half of the year, adjusted earnings were $1.05 a share, that's up $0.22 from last year or 27%. Favorable weather was a big contributor to the first half results, along with cost savings that were implemented last year. The strong first half creates headroom that we will use to reinvest in our operations, focused on safety, reliability and customer satisfaction.","As a result of our first half performance and confidence for the remainder of the year, we have raised our low end of our guidance by $0.02 from $1.74 to $1.76. Our top end remains the same at $1.78.","As you know, we continue to deliver year-over-year growth based on prior year's actual results without resets. Each year, we have achieved or exceeded the top end of our guidance. This year, we are continuing to move in that direction. The low end of our guidance is now higher than the midpoint of our original guidance. Our updated guidance raises this year's EPS growth in the range of 6% to 7%, with our long term guidance remaining at 5% to 7%.","The Michigan Energy Law passed in 2008 is working well. However, we see an opportunity to update and improve it in 2015. The governor has already proposed a set of no regrets principles, which we support. In June, Governor Snyder signed into law, a bill that will ensure Michigan's energy rates accurately reflect the cost of service for all customers. The Governor is focused on making Michigan competitive, and a part of that is having competitive industrial rates. The new rate design is a first key step.","The Senate Energy Committee has convened a work group, in which we are participating to review Michigan's Energy Efficiency and renewable energy policies. It's likely the Group's recommendations will become part of energy legislation in 2015.","Michigan's Governor Rick Snyder is being challenged by Mark Schauer. Key issues involve education, creating more jobs, improving the roads, and resolving the remaining legacy issues of Detroit.","Energy is not an issue. As both candidates meet in the middle on energy policy. Both favor an increase in renewable standard, a continuation of energy efficiency, along with competitive rates. We know both candidates very well, and we will work with either to continue to improve Michigan's economy.","The states economy continues to perform well. Now in its fifth year of recovery, various national surveys have placed Michigan in the top 10. The state is striving to achieve top 10 status in all categories, and is well positioned to achieve that. One of the last remaining legacy issues is the city of Detroit bankruptcy. On July 21, Detroit pensioners voted to accept pension cuts and reduced healthcare benefits. This is a major step for the city to exit bankruptcy. Our company has joined other Michigan corporations in this historic initiative, to improve Detroit's economic recovery.","On the west side of the state, in our largest electric market, Grand Rapids leads the way in economic growth. Not only in Michigan, but as a top ranked city in all of the United States. The city's economic performance ranks among the best in the nation. A recent Manpower Employment Survey found Grand Rapids has the best labor market in the nation. The survey results show that 32% of businesses intend to increase staffing during the third quarter. This compares to 29% in Michigan and 22% in the United States. We are fortunate to serve this growing city.","Since the EPA Carbon rules released, we have been studying them closely. We will be coordinating with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and continuing our analysis. At this time, we appear to be in good position to meet the future targets. But the devil is in the details. Our plan is to move to a cleaner and a more balanced generation portfolio, featuring a greater share of renewable energy and combined cycle natural gas generation.","Now I will turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas Webb","Thanks John. We deeply appreciate your interest in our company and for joining us on the call today. Thank you. As John mentioned, our second quarter results at $0.30 a share were up a penny from last year, and the first half results at $1.05 were up $0.22 or 27%.","As you can see here, we already have put to work some of the substantial upside from the first quarter, with the reinvestments in even more productivity and reliability in the second quarter.","As shown with the yellow arrow, we have got plans to put more to work during the rest of the year, and that's without jeopardizing our ability to deliver earnings growth at 6% to 7% this year.","As you can see in the dotted circle, our substantial cost savings in the second half fully fund planned capital investments. This shows the important work we have completed to self-fund all of our capital investment in 2014.","Now this slide is familiar to many of you, this shows how we continue to reduce our cost levels and reinvest good performance from the first quarter. The O&M reinvestment improves reliability, generates incremental productivity and it pre-funds parent debt, and this last point maintains our conservative risk profile.","Looking ahead to 2015, here is a summary of our recently filed gas rate case for implementation in 2015. Over the past three years, we have reduced our customer bills by almost 10%, that's over 3% a year. With this case, we are requesting recovery of capital investment, partially offset by substantial cost reductions. We are also requesting an investment recovery mechanism to improve the process, for approving and monitoring capital investment, and that's the main reason for our rate cases.","Still with an eye on the future, our small business outside of the utility provides meaningful upside. As most of you know, we plan to layer in long term capacity contracts at our IPP in Dearborn, as capacity prices rise.","We have seen by lateral contracts, already in excess of $3 a kilowatt month. This adds to our confidence, that prices in the $4.50 and $7.50 range may be likely. This would provide an upside of almost $30 million to $50 million, and that's about full year's level of profit improvement for the company.","On the energy side, we recently completed a long term contract for one of our combined cycle units at over $4 a kilowatt month. This is encouraging, it\u2019s a great sign of value of our IPP or John calls it, the Ferrari in the garage over in Dearborn.","On the sales front, we are encouraged by industrial growth. 2014 sales are up 8% compared to last year, and we have raised our growth forecast for total electric sales to 2.5%. You may remember the number was 1.7% in our last call. For example, you may also have read about an announcement just this week from the Italian brake manufacturer Brembo. They are adding 27 megawatts of load to support a new foundry in our service territory. Great new business.","We continue however to maintain a conservative outlook for the future growth, we plan on sales growth of about 0.5% a year. Our philosophy has not changed. We'd rather make conservative assumptions regarding our future, so that surprise our good news, good news for our customers, and good news for you, our investors.","We take the same approach on cost control. While our actual cost performance is at the strong end of peers, we continue to plan conservatively for the future. As shown on the right box of this slide, cost reductions were 3% last year, and before the substantial reinvestment, down 8%. We forecast that costs will be down another 2% this year. We have upped our reinvestment another penny, because of all the great weather in the first quarter, but made no change to the 8% reduction for this year.","For the future, we plan conservatively at a net reduction of about 2%. You can see two examples of how this is accomplished on the right side of this slide. A 2% annual reduction over the next five years is equal to about $100 million reduction in O&M. The plans to replace retired coal plants with gas generation and renewables, combined with changes already in place to our benefit programs, will save $100 million over the next five years. Add on other plant productivity around automated meters, improved field mobility and first time quality and we have plenty of room to fund new programs and still meet our net cost reduction. We are planning conservatively, but we consider this to be an important element of our program to improve customer bills and customer service.","I am sure many of you noted that earlier this week, we closed on a securitization of the coal plants that were retiring in 2016. We were pleased with the investor interest in these AAA rated bonds and the benefits that this will bring to our customers. Saving our electric customers $22 million in the first full year, and more than $100 million overall. We will use these proceeds to pay down debt and equity, and it will provide capacity for us to invest more in needed gas infrastructure projects. This is a real win-win for our customers and our investors.","The productivity steps that we have been taking have permitted us to self-fund rate cases and improve our customer's relative price position as shown on this slide. While our electric residential bills already are competitive, we have much more work to do for our industrial customers. The legislature has provided direction to the commission to enhance rate designs, and coupled with our own cost reductions that self-funded rate cases, these could improve our industrial rates by about 8%. Should policymakers choose to phase out the existing retail open access program, there could be another $150 million available to improve rates further. These steps can put us into a fully competitive position in a very short period of time.","Looking further into the future, this is another slide that is familiar to many of you. The need for investment over the next 10 years has grown to over $20 billion as shown in the blue circle on the right. Those needs are up from what we expected only a year or two ago. Our plans however, only include investment of about $15 billion, limited only by our desire to keep our base rate increases below inflation. Some of the major investments that we do not yet have in our plan, include new capacity for PPA replacements, the potential return of ROA customers, and as MISO puts it, a substantial capacity shortfall in zone seven of 2000 megawatts by 2016, when coal plants are expected to be retired.","Here is the good news; some of these capacity replacements and upgrades provide an opportunity to reduce customer bills. This puts us in the enviable position of meeting reliability needs for our customers and maintaining fully competitive rates and bills, while also providing a nice opportunity for incremental growth. I wouldn't be surprised, if a year from now, we are talking to you about an investment plan of $16 billion to $17 billion, rather than the $15 billion, and without hurting price competitiveness for our customers.","Here is a slide from MISO showing their anticipated shortfall in zone seven of 2 gigawatts. And here is a slide that shows how large the capacity needs would be, should ROA customers return to bundled service, either naturally or by policy, as well as the magnitude of capacity needed to replace PPAs. These opportunities alone require about 3,000 megawatts of new capacity at Consumers, needing our share of the MISO zone seven shortfall could be on top of that. None of this is in our present plan.","So coming back to today, we are pleased to share our sensitivity chart, so that you can see the impact of changes to sales, gas prices, ROE and interest rates in 2014.","And here is our regular report card for 2014 financial targets; we are on target to meet all of these goals. But I want to caution you, that with the need to rebuild fuel inventories that were depleted last year, our operating cash flow target may be at some risk at this point; and this is a temporary issue, it will be fully recovered by 2015.","So here is our overall look at earnings and dividend growth, showing our mindset around consistent good performance at the high end of peers for our customers, without jeopardizing our consistent high end performance for investors. We are proud of the track record humbled by our interest in committed to continuing improvements every day.","So thank you once more for taking time to listen to our call today. John and I would be pleased to answer your questions. So Lisa, would you please open the call for those questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Thank you very much Mr. Webb. (Operator Instructions) And our first question is from the line of Daniel Eggers of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse","Hey, good morning guys.","Thomas Webb","Good morning Dan.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse","Tom, following up on your last comment, kind of the $15 billion, prospectively turning into $16 billion or $17 billion, what do you see as progression, when you guys get comfortable, or think about moving some of these projected generation projects into real spending dollars into capital plants, given the time to develop and implement that kind of capital?","Thomas Webb","Let me start, if I may on that question; because I sort of see a pattern that I have shared, I know, many times with folks where we have got a lot of work to do first, to get our prices competitive, and what we are doing avoiding rate cases and what a big working group is doing across all our customers, and legislature and regulators and the like to try to get a rate design in place, can help us get that done, that's first. Then clearly, we need to get to the elections. And then third, we need the opportunity to have the law updated, and that's going to include a lot of things; energy efficiency, renewables, those are going to impact how we respond to the EPA guidelines. There is a lot going on there, including the retail open access position. Personally, I am a believer that, that's going to correct itself naturally or by policy or by a combination of both.","When we get through those three, then I see us starting more aggressively, trying to figure out how to bring the needed incremental capacity into Michigan. Michigan has a need, we have a need. And we are happy to respond to that, after we get through those steps. So that's why I said, it's my own personal belief, its probably a year from now, when we tell you that that $15 billion, and candidly, you all know, we are at about $15.5 billion, we are just conservative with how we describe it. When we see that may be going to $16 billion or $17 billion, because we will need to put some of that capacity in place, we show on slide 20, where we talk about new generation needed that's in the 20, not in the 15. We see that occurring, and we think we can do all of that without hurting the price competitiveness, that we think is the magic that makes a win-win.","So I apologize for the long-winded answer, but that's sort of the flow that I think, and that's why I think its about a year from now, when you will see those numbers start to grow. And I don't know John, if you want to add?","John Russell","I agree. I think that's the right thing. Dan, I wouldn't put it in the book yet, but as Tom said, really 2015 -- by the end of 2015, we expect to have the law resolved and the opportunities here, just to give you a little bit of an idea for our conservative nature. But still, it doesn't change our growth plan, which performance and guidance, which for the forecast, is again, 5% to 7%. So there is opportunities here to give us confidence that we continue to hit that 5% to 7%.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse","Thank you for clarifying that. And I guess the other question, when you look at the breakdown of weather normalized load growth by customer class of these industrials, [indiscernible] stabilize. In residential, you have had these -- there is still these down comps. Can you just shed a little more color on what you're seeing by customer class, and how you expect those customers behave, to support the 0.5% growth you guys are looking at, beyond this year?","Thomas Webb","That's good question. I would tell you that we still see for the year, residential and commercial sales to be about flat; and we are beginning to see lots of signs of new hook-ups. Lots of green chutes, whatever people like to call that, which are very positive, but we are unwilling to put that in our forecast. We still think, things are soft enough, so those are sort of flat. So what's driving the growth, as it typically does first, is the industrial side. And today we told you that, we have seen an average increase of a little over 8% on the industrial side, and we are forecasting for the year, by the way about that. You may not recall. In the first quarter, we are up 5.8% on the industrial side. In the second quarter, we are up 10.6% for that average about 8% now.","Now grant you, there are few people who are really driving that. There is a particular customer, who is just having a lot of success, and we are not permitted to single their name out, if you don't mind. And that's helping us a lot. But on the industrial side, we really do see good promise, where weather adjusted on the industrial side, we see the strong numbers I talked about. There is still underlying growth without that good customer, that's really nice and positive in the second quarter, when I would have called it closer to flat in the first quarter. So it's pretty good.","Now remember, I gave an example in the presentation about a company called Brembo, they are an Italian brake maker. They make premium brakes. They are a highly regarded manufacturer around the globe, and they have chosen to put more of their business into Michigan, which we are delighted, and with the foundry they are talking about, that's a pretty big load for us.","So we are seeing a lot more of that. There are things we can't talk about, that I look forward to unfolding in the next call or the call after that. The signs are pretty nice. John did a nice job describing how in our service territory, the physicals in Grand Rapids and in the western part of Michigan continue to be really good, and hopefully, there is going to be a nice turnaround on the east side of the state too. Does that help Dan?","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse","That was great. Thank you guys.","Operator","Thanks very much for your question. Our next question is from the line of Greg Gordon of ISI Group. Please go ahead. Thank you.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","Thanks. Good morning gentlemen.","John Russell","Good morning.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","I got a couple of questions. One, just to follow-up quickly on that -- Dan's question on demand. I mean, the weather adjusted electric deliveries, including Retail Open Access, year-to-date are up 2.3%, right, six months ended, which is above your base case long term forecast? And obviously, that's been driven by industrial predominantly. Do you think that industrial base is stable and that you can continue to grow off that base? And then if that's true and you see improvement in residential and commercial on top of that, wouldn\u2019t your -- 0.5% base case become conservative?","Thomas Webb","Greg it\u2019s a great question, and I am going to give you a yes and no. In 2014, yes, we are seeing a nice recovery, the weather adjusted number for June year-to-date is 2.3% and you can tell by the numbers we give you, that its driven by that over 8% industrial. We are already seeing signs, as we begin the third quarter, that's going to continue. So that's why we have upped our forecast from 1.7% for overall weather adjusted electric sales for the full year. We have gone to 2.5 from 1.7, and we feel good about that. We think that's in the right ballpark, and give us a tenth or two, we never get that part right.","But we are not willing to encourage people in the future years, to plan on big load growth as what drives our earnings, because it doesn't, and we'd rather tell you, we want to be conservative, and we expect that growth to be as good as maybe 0.5%, and that's where we would like to be. It turns out, all the things that are happening makes that better. I think that's good for you, and that's great for us, and its wonderful for our customers, because it spreads the rate base across more of our customers.","So I hope you work with us. We plan to be conservative in our forecast beyond 2014, and we are trying to give you the most accurate look we know how to do in 2014.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","Well that was exactly where I was going, the higher load growth forecast doesn't necessarily jack your rate base investment in and of itself, but allows you to spread your costs over a wider base and better control costs?","Thomas Webb","Exactly. Well I am sorry, your point is right.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","The second question I had was, can you -- much in the same way you talked about the timing and pacing of revising your expectations on capital expenditures, can you talk about how soon that Ferrari starts [indiscernible] out of the garage? Or to put it in English, the $30 million to $50 million of potential upside from your merchant power business, what are the milestones and timing that that would cause you to be able to sort of execute that and bring it to the bottom line?","Thomas Webb","So let me correct myself and call it a Mustang GT out of the rouge area.","John Russell","Greg says to put it in English. I heard that Greg, that hurt.","Thomas Webb","So here is what we are seeing; we talked to you about the opportunities on the capacity side, because that's where the big opportunities are. Its going to roll out, as soon as capacity prices start to recover, and we believe we are going to see capacity prices in our zone, in MISO, start to move up in the next year and two; but we are already seeing it in bilateral contracts. In fact, that's why we are encouraged by some of numbers I told you, like $3 already, if we wanted to lock it in on the capacity side.","So I suspect, and I may be a little conservative, that that good news doesn't roll in this year, it rolls in next year and the year after. And our strategy, is not to be greedy, grab whatever we can get right away, or not to be greedy and wait until it gets to 7.50, and it never gets there. Our strategy is just to be prudent, and as we see some in the nice zone of -- don't hold to be a number, but a better number. We will put part of that in place for one of the combined cycles. And then we will put a little more in place, if the numbers get better. So we will like average our way in to some pretty nice numbers.","So to your point, I think its going to be over the next couple, may be two years, and don't forget the energy side too. We are seeing -- we saw a nice uptick when we entered into this new contract at over $4, and then we saw energy rates come right back. So again, you can see, we are just waiting for the right opportunities, trying to be patient. And we can't tell you the day, the month, or even the year, but we know we are protected on the low side, so we are going to be opportunistic on the high side. Bottom line, I'd say over the next couple, maybe three years, you will see this sort of feather in, and I don't mean to mislead you saying, you are going to see a whole year's growth in the same year.","John Russell","Greg, I'd just add too; is that, it's really a compliment to our business. It's not our core. We focus on Consumers Energy, but we just wanted investors to know. Its there. There is opportunity, but as Tom said, we don't really count that.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","And it's not really baked into your earnings growth forecast?","Thomas Webb","The capacity is not, part of the energy is.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","Got you. Thank you guys.","Thomas Webb","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Our next question is from the line of Ali Agha of SunTrust. Please go ahead, thank you.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thank you. Good morning.","Thomas Webb","Good morning.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Tom, just remind us; that sensitivity that you gave us, 1% change in electric sales is about $0.05 in annual earnings for the company. Can you remind us, how that changes depending on the customer class, so if that 1% is coming from industrial, versus CNI. Would it still stay the same, or how should we be thinking about that sensitivity, based on the customer class?","Thomas Webb","I would obviously tell you that, it's the residential side where the bulk of our business is. And so, we are more sensitive to that movement, as it goes up. So if there is a restoration of growth there, its going to give us more impact than on the industrial side, where we try to provide the kind of competitive rates for our big users. That doesn't make us a pile of money but sure brings more business. So I think that's what you had in mind, and that is the right way to think about it.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Right. Okay, got it. And then second, in this gas rate case, you have asked for a full decoupling, as well as this investment rate mechanism. Can you share with us, what kind of receptivity overall you're seeing on the state for those kinds of mechanisms?","Thomas Webb","So on the decoupling, I'd like to fashion that as a part of the overall update to the law. Now I am going to give you an opinion, so anybody listening in could have a different view, but on that issue, I think there is going to be pretty good receptivity to decoupling for energy efficiency as you call it, energy optimization as we call it. But who knows, on this economic side, and on the sales side. I think that's up for grabs in a good dialog and discussion, and we are not hard headed about that. We want to do what the overall group of people, whether it\u2019s the legislature, the regulators or customers and people think make sense. We are happy to pass back good news and bad news right away through decoupling, but it may only be energy efficiency. That's just a personal opinion.","So now when you come to things like mechanisms for recovering investment, they make perfect sense to us, because they provide the regulatory team, the staff, the commission, even more insight to approving our capital investments, and even more insight to tracking how we are doing, and full authority, if we change what we are doing or we don't spend the right amount, up or down whatever to impact that, in a good governance way. We think this is a great way to go forward, but I think there are a lot of different opinions. So people have to think through it. Are the customers better off with this mechanism; and I believe they are, and if people come to that understanding, then I think the need for rate cases will dissipate quite a bit, and you will see us, if we had a full mechanism on our capital investment.","I think what you would see, that we would come in may be every three years or so, because we will need to come back, just to true-up, maybe on revenue and the pass-through cost reductions. But we wouldn't need to come back as often.","So those are up for grabs. That's part of the healthy discussion that's already underway and work group's over at the legislature, as well as the commission who will make some decisions that are very important around that in our rate cases.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Got it. And last question, given you only modestly raised the bottom end of your forecast for the year. But conceptually, as you're looking at the year, just to get a sense of what has improved? I know you've raised your weather normalized sales forecast. Are thinking you're going to maybe spend less O&M maybe in the second half than budgeted? Is it the electric sales that are running better? Overall, what would you attribute the improvement versus say your original expectations?","John Russell","The biggest change for us, the first year -- or the first part of the year, the weather was very good. The first quarter of the year, and the gas business. And one of the things I mentioned briefly is some of the aggressive cost measures, cost reductions that we have taken over the past several years, continue to pay dividends year-over-year, and those are things like some of our legacy costs eliminated, and that was going forward and so forth. So we are seeing a nice combination of a top-end growth, with the cold weather, we are able to reinvest and also the middle line growth or reduction if you will of costs. So those are the two drivers, while we are in the position we are.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Got it. Thanks John. Thank you.","John Russell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Our next question is from the line of Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Thank you.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","Good morning.","Thomas Webb","Good morning Paul.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","With the securitization, you talked about paying down debt and equity at Consumers, how does that flow through to the parent?","Thomas Webb","Good question. Please do think about it just the way you said it. We take those proceeds to pay to offset equity and debt at the utility, and then we take those proceeds that come out of that, and we are able to put them to work, the cash part of that, to work in the gas side of the business.","Now typically, when you see a securitization at a utility, its good news for customers, but you lose rate base. While this is good news for our electric customers, because we will reduce their rates, and remember, that's where we have to help, be more competitive. But then the extra capital resources that come out of that, we have got a big need on the gas side of our business. The gas side of our business is growing exponentially, its becoming a bigger part of our company every day. So this gives us another $370 million that we can put into that gas business, and of course, the rate base goes up there and you get earnings on it, but we are really doing because we need it, we have got a lot of work to do there.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","Thank you. And secondly, this cost of removal benefit, how long does that last and what's the trajectory of that savings?","Thomas Webb","Okay, it varies by business, so it goes between five and a dozen years, and it\u2019s a benefit where you will see us, our taxes improve, because we have accelerated the -- what is a tax benefit we would have gotten over 20 and 30 years into that five and 12-year period. So its five years for electric and 12 years for gas, and that's just -- the main reason we did it, if you didn't recall, was to improve rates for our customers, to help avoid these rate cases in 2014. That's a beautiful benefit t pour through, and it doesn't damage at all the efforts we have to deliver 5% to 7% growth in the future.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","How is that 211 split between gas and electric?","Thomas Webb","So the electric is 211 and gas is 264. So the annual numbers, if it makes sense when I do the five and 12 for you, $42 million at electric and $22 million annually at gas.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","And year-to-date, about 34% tax rate, where do you see that full year and kind of the next few years, if you want to go out that far?","Thomas Webb","That's good for this year, because its that cost of removal benefit, that's what you are seeing. And that will help sustain that level for a couple of years.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you for your question. And our next question is from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Thank you.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Good morning.","Thomas Webb","Good morning.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Not to go over sales growth too much, but I am afraid I am a little confused just in general by the trajectory. On industrial, it looks to me, that last year, there was a substantial decrease; so if you could pare over 2012, I don't see that strong a growth; and I guess what I am trying to understand is, what has changed here? I mean, you guys feel more comfortable with the industrial growth, because of the people who are coming to your service territory and what have you? That's the first question, I guess?","Thomas Webb","I think, let's step back and take a big picture first. We see the industrial growth having improved substantially since the recession, and we are way back to pre-recession levels, and we see that continuing to occur. So the underlying growth is good, its sound, we are comfortable, it should flow through. In fact, we are seeing things we can't talk about today, that's going to add to that growth in the future.","But, let me go to a second level down, little deeper down in. We do have an anomaly, that you were observing. Last year, we had a customer that got hurt; and so you saw a little fall off in the industrial side or their share of that. This year, they are fully rebounded, they are doing great, they had a bump in the road, and that is making our numbers even bigger for this year compared to last year. So you are right in your observation of that. But now keep in mind for the full year, we see ourselves with all classes, weather adjusted at a 2.5% growth.","But we are telling you beyond that, we think the right thing to count on, is something more like a 0.5% growth and maybe we are under calling it, but we are assuming that on the residential side and the commercial side, nothing is going to come up, but we might be wrong, because the hook-ups are increasing this year, but we are assuming not, and we are assuming that underlying growth on the industrial side, not that special one going up and down, will continue. And that's why we are pretty comfortable with that 0.5%. Again, I hope we are wrong on the downside.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Okay, I hear you. Just to sort of focus on that customer growth, could you give us a sense as to what the customer growth was, and how that compares to, what I see, I guess, as a negative 0.6% for residential and 0.3% for commercial. How do we compare the two and how do you see that changing to make these do better than what we have seen year-to-date?","Thomas Webb","So I don't have my old data page in front of me, and I apologize for that, but I will tell you this, if you looked at the recession, our industrial fall-off was about a point less than where the rest of the country was; and then if you look at the recovery, our industrial improvement was about a point better than where the rest of the country was, and I see that, as your best long term indicator of growth; because I see the residential and then the commercial sides following that.","Now there is one other factor to consider, when you are thinking about the economy. For the last three years, whatever number we give you, includes about 1% of energy efficiency across the board; residential, commercial and industrial. So that dampens our numbers. So if we were to tell you, unless this year 2.5% growth. The underlying growth is 3.5%, but energy efficiencies bring that down to 2.5%. And its one of the reasons we want to stay conservative in the future, is because we plan to be able to deliver a full point of energy efficiency every year, that's good for our customers, and we think that's good for the business, it fits our model well, and that's why we go over to the 0.5%.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","I understand. I guess I understand what you're saying, particularly on the industrial; but just, moving over though to the residential, I guess what I am missing at, sorry to be so slow on this, why the negative sales growth for the last six months if things are doing better, I guess? Do you follow what I am saying?","Thomas Webb","I do, I do, I do. So really we don't have negative, let me take you through that point again, let's use the precise numbers. For June year-to-date, residential is down 0.6%. So that really means, its up 0.5% before energy efficiencies. So we are seeing the hook-ups, we are seeing the growth in our economy and in our customers, and then we are helping them be more efficient, so you see the negative number. What I also think is, the residential and commercial side, we are going to tell you, we think are going to stay in that flat zone, little negative, little negative flat right, we can't predict that well. But I think we are probably be wrong, I think they will follow industrial as you go through time, and you will see some uptick. That's opinion in the last part, and the first part was fact.","John Russell","Paul, this is John. One thing I tell legislators, the way I describe energy efficiency, as Tom did analytically. I mean generally in the industry, 1% reduction in growth or energy efficiency is 100% of our load growth, and I think people that like energy efficiency which we do, talk about it in terms of percent, 1% or 2%, but that's how significant energy efficiency is, and it maybe an industry thing in those states that are pushing energy efficiency; where we are growing, we are growing with energy efficiency included in those numbers, as Tom showed you.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Okay. Let me just finally sort of ask you about the renewables that are being discussed in the state. And I know you guys are concerned about customer rates, and I am just wondering, how you communicate the message as to -- I guess, what's your expected impact of increased renewable requirements will be on rates, and whether that's fully understood in the politic, if you know what I am saying?","John Russell","Yeah I do.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","And I am just wondering if you could sort of just lay out a little bit for us about how you are proceeding with that, when people get enthusiastic about renewables?","John Russell","Absolutely, if renewables need to be part of a balanced portfolio, we need baseload. I want to increase renewables, renewable increase also needs to be looked at fairly, with the cost of renewables. We have some pretty good wind regimes here and our wind turbines are doing pretty well. On a scale basis, they are probably with the tax credits they are, second only to natural gas generation. So on scale, I think there is potential here in Michigan to move forward.","The thing that we are pretty clear about though, is when you get into distributed generation in some of the subsidies that are required to make that work, it doesn't make a lot of sense for customers, they are working to trying to reduce rates. And part of it is, we are worried about all of our 1.8 million electric customers, not just the few that may be subsidized for certain things. So in other words, what we want to make sure is that, whatever we move forward with, renewable energy, its best for all of our customers, not just a few.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Okay, great. Thanks so much.","John Russell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Next question is from the line of Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Good morning guys.","John Russell","Good morning.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Just one, I just wanted to go back on sales, in that conversation with Paul occurred to me. The 0.5%, is that before or after energy efficiency?","Thomas Webb","That includes energy efficiency, so the 0.5%, the way we see the math, would actually be 1.5%.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Okay, great. Thank you, Tom. The real question was going to be, on timing of the next electric rate case, and the rate design issue. I don't recall exactly the details, but there were some issues in that order around how -- when it would be implemented. Can you give us your sort of latest thoughts on how that may play out for you, and the timing of the next case, etcetera?","Thomas Webb","So there is three things driving the next electric rate case. One is just the normal electric case. This year for 2014, we fully offset all the capital with O&M cost reductions. Next year, we are going to offset a lot of it, but not all of it. So we need a rate case. Whether its December, January, its not so critical, but we need one.","Second thing is, remember we bought the Jackson plant, and we had an agreement with the seller, that we would close on that, late in 2015, and therefore we wanted to push off, when we got the approval from our commission to December of 2015. And so that all neatly goes together, that's the second reason.","The third reason that we are very likely to go in December, is because we have a new rate design, and the commission now has the direction from the legislature on moving on some better cost of service oriented rate design, and for customers to benefit from that, they need to have a rate case to put it in place. We have a few customers that do benefit from some attractive rate designs that expire in January in 2016. So they are keen to make sure that there is an order out in 2015, that supports the new rate design, that they are very happy with.","So we have got three pressure points since the first time in my career, I can remember people banging on me to please do a rate case as soon as you can. So it\u2019s a little different approach, but we actually think; we want to put it off as long as we can, we don't need it for Jackson until December 2015. We don't need it for the new rate design until the end of 2015, and we really don't need the extra revenue relieved until the self implementation in the middle of 2015. So I think December-ish will probably be our approximate time of filing for those reasons.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","December of this year?","Thomas Webb","Yes.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Great. Thank you, Tom.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Our next question is from the line of Andy Levi of Avon Capital Advisors. Please go ahead.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital Advisors","Hi, good morning.","John Russell","Good morning.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital Advisors","Just a quick question; I think I have asked it before, I am just not sure if the answer is the same. So you have several incremental positives, longer term, whether its big plant, possibly sales growth, higher CapEx. At some point, is it possible that the growth rate goes up, or do you kind of just manage within that 5% to 7% and continue to allow the rate payers to benefit from the upside, even if it\u2019s the big plants?","John Russell","I like the plan we have. Let me state a little bit differently. We have continued to grow at -- give the guidance at 5% to 7%. For the last several years, we have exceeded the midpoint and gone to the top end of that. That is the plan that we have going forward. We have plenty of investment to make, we are worried about customers and investors. For our investors, the important thing I'd say there is, we tend to perform consistently year-over-year without resets, a couple of hundred basis points better than our peers. So the steady predictable outcome, with a dividend increase that grows with that, is really what we are trying to do.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital Advisors","So let's just talk about the big plant. If you were to be able to achieve the top end of the capacity upside, which, let's call an incremental $0.10, $0.12, and let's say, it could be layered in over three years, so $0.03, $0.04 a year, and then obviously, your utilities -- your utility, that wouldn't add to that 5% to 7%?","John Russell","It would certainly add to the mix. The thing that I would look at there, is that it would take risk out of our opportunity to achieve our long term guidance. It may actually enable us to avoid a rate case. I mean, there is things that we can do with that, to reinvest it, to continue to achieve that piece. I mean, I just want to make sure everybody understands, we really take seriously, doing what we say we do. And whether its weather upside, weather hurt, it doesn't matter to us. We continue to achieve what we say we are going to do year-over-year. And that's the mindset we have here, which I think is important and I think its something that investors need to do.","I think we are unique in the industry, that we reinvest favorable weather, and I tell our Board this, that's not easy to do, because we are a pretty capital intensive industry, and to move things around within the year is difficult to do. Yeah, I'd say right now, I'd continue to look at that 5% to 7%. I mean, as we illustrate some things in the future, some capital -- additional capital investments and so forth, it just positions us with higher confidence to achieve that outcome year-over-year.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital Advisors","So just to make sure I understand what you're saying, any upside from the non-regulated business, for no better way, whether EnerBank or DIG will kind of be used to help the rate pare, which is a good thing. But that's kind of what you're saying?","John Russell","Yeah, exact -- to our customers, absolutely. I mean, our customers may see the benefit from that by additional investment in the utility, through some of the -- what we received at CMS.","Thomas Webb","And all of that increases the probability of performing at the high end year after year after year after year.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital Advisors","Got it. Thank you very much guys.","John Russell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Our next question is from the line of Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead. Thank you.","Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann","Hi, good morning.","John Russell","Good morning Brian.","Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann","Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but just on the investment recovery mechanism, in the gas rate case, can you may be just talk about the mechanics of that, and how that would be implemented and allow you to avoid annual rate cases?","Thomas Webb","I wouldn't worry too much about the mechanics candidly. They are really this simple, is that we make a request for the 2015 test year, and that would be addressed in the rate case, and then we'd have this request regarding 2016 and 2017, which would be acknowledged and implemented in 2016 and then in 2017. So we get the three years of capital spending clarified and agreed to, and then the rates that would come along with it, would come along each year, so not in advance. They would come along as you need it for the year 2016, and then as you need it for the year 2017.","And the reason I say, I wouldn't get too much into the mechanisms that we have requested, we are very flexible. It\u2019s the concept we think is a really good one, and we are very anxious to work with the staff and with our customers, and all parties involved to first make sure that they see how much sense it makes for them as customers, and then the mechanism is put in place that works for everybody. So we are flexible on that, we just like the concept, and I think there are a few people who really do embrace the concept.","Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann","Okay, understood. And then the second half 2014 drivers noted on slide 11, how is that dispersed over the third and fourth quarter?","Thomas Webb","We got three different pieces, the cost savings are in there already, so they are kind of automated. The $0.11 that you see on that slide, and the capital investment, the 9 to 11, most of that is already automated, so I think of that as smoothly coming in, or evenly over the quarters.","It\u2019s the reinvestment part that we get to tailor a little bit, so that $0.12, we will -- I don't want to say that will be perfectly smooth, we are chickens. We will put in as much of that as we can in the third quarter without taking and risking the financial performance for the year. So we will leave some flexibility. We will take things that we know, if you don't do them early, you can't get them done, more tree trimming, we'd love to do that. We will do that early. But we will make other decisions, like the potential contribution we might make to a foundation or to low income funds. We will make that call more toward the end of the period, to ensure that we are maximizing the benefits to everybody involved, without missing our commitments we have to you.","So I'd say the bar on reinvestment can move a little bit, it will move with -- do we end up with a hot summer or a cold summer, so it will flex with those things, but the cost savings of $0.11 and the reinvestment and other of $0.09 to $0.11, those are pretty smooth, those are on autopilot.","Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann","Okay, great. And then any initial thoughts on July weather in your service territory?","Thomas Webb","Yeah it was a little cool the first couple of days, and I would just tell you that, there is a few pennies there that we have already factored into our forecasting, and I know you don't get to see that, and I apologize for that, but I am glad to tell everybody. We saw a little cooler weather in July, and our forecast is that there will be some hot and some cool, still yet in the rest of July. So we think there is a few pennies of bad news in there, nothing that bothers us in any great way, causes us to dramatically change our plans. But we will be watching August carefully, and depending on which way that goes, that's why we will tailor that reinvestment of that $0.12 a little bit, based on what comes out of there, and that's why it\u2019s a little hard for me to honestly tell you exactly how much of that will occur or won't occur. It depends on weather and other things going on. Does that help?","Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann","Yes it does. Thank you very much.","Thomas Webb","Yes, thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Our next question is from the line of Steven Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Hi guys.","John Russell","Hi Steve.","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Might be your longest call ever. Just a couple of specific questions; the new DIG contract that you announced here, can you disclose who that's with?","Thomas Webb","No. I might be able to, but I am going to be safe and not risk that. I don't think they would want to be advertised anyhow. I would just tell you, its with a very good counterparty that you would be really comfortable with.","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Okay. And then on -- you discussed the kind of idea that, over the next year we might have visibility on, I guess as much as a couple of billion more investment? It seems like a lot of that might be generation or renewables, should we view that as a decent chance that could come back into the mix?","John Russell","Let me talk about that, I think as Tom said, there is opportunity here. Let's wait till the law, the new law I guess comes out in 2015. I'd say yeah, most of it would be in the generation side, whether its increasing renewable energy. Whether its -- somehow we are buying capacity, obviously now we are doing at the end of 2015, with the gas plant we are picking up.","We may need to do some additional capacity upgrades at some of our plants, which is incremental, and you know this Steve, but for everybody. We tend to also, with our capital investments, try to avoid the big bets. I mean, we try not to bet the farm and build massive plants. The [indiscernible] plant is something that we have delayed. Although the permits are still active, and we will probably hold on to those permits as long as we possibly can. I think the [indiscernible] plant has potential in the future, and as Tom said in his part of the presentation today, If zone seven, which is the lower peninsula of Michigan, is short by 2,000 megawatts. I mean, the way I tell politicians that, is that's a nuclear plant, that's two coal plants, that's three or four gas plants. And that shortage is predicted in 2016. So I think there will be new capacity needed, and as -- we are the best one to do it, and to save rights for our customers, we will make it happen.","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Just one more question related to that, when you think about the Zone seven in MISO, because of the constraints in Michigan, does that generation for the most part, really need to come from within Michigan, or can you buy from other zones within MISO.","John Russell","That's a great question. I'd say generally -- for general purposes, think about it, it has to be here in Michigan. And the reason is, we are on a peninsula, and there is limited capacity, transmission capacity in to and out of the state. And so there maybe some of it, with firm transmission that's outside of the state, that can get in here. But if you remember way back, in the 2000 Energy Law, when that went through, we increased the capacity come into the state, I think to 5,000 megawatts, as I recall. That has been a lot of time -- parked down since I've worked on that one, but that's about the limit. And the lower peninsula of Michigan peak load is round 25,000 to 28,000 megawatts. So pretty small percentage if you will, of the total capacity needed in the lower peninsula.","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Great. Thank you.","John Russell","Thanks Steve.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Our next question is from the line of Andrew Weisel, Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, sorry. Its James George [ph] on his behalf. The question has been asked and answered. Thank you.","John Russell","James, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Okay then, moving on to the last question in the queue, its from the line of [indiscernible]. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. A question John for you, I guess going to, if I am right, slide 25. The payout ratio this year, is around at the bottom of the range of 60% to 70%. Can you see an acceleration of the dividend growth from the 6% historical over the last couple of years in the next four or five years, so how are you thinking about that? How should we think -- reaching to 70% over that time frame?","John Russell","Yeah one thing -- first of all, we want to be competitive with the market which is important to us, and we have stated that publicly. The other thing too, as we have talked about in this call, we tend to be growing faster than our peers. In past several years, we have grown at 7%, I think our peer group is about 4%. So as we grow earnings per share, I expect you are going to see the dividend growth be in line with that level. So as we continue to perform in the future, as we have talked about here today, I expect you will see the payout ratio increase to get to that higher end.","Unidentified Analyst","What should we expect in a five year range, if we were to start from now? Where would you expect the payout ratio to be, in say, a five years time from the 60% this year?","John Russell","I'd say at the low end 5% a year, and at the top end, 7% a year.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay.","John Russell","So just think about earnings growth, which drives dividend, 5% to 7% a year. And again, that would be comped on the two to five years.","Unidentified Analyst","Right. But the issue is, if you increase it by 7%, which is the top end of your earnings, which you have been successfully been able to do, the payout ratio would remain at 60%, it won't inch up.","Thomas Webb","The payout ratio today is 62%. And what John was trying to tell you is that, if we grew average with everybody else, we'd stay at 62%, and if we are -- if our growth rate is a little higher than others, then our Board will consider following that, and your payout ratio could be higher. What we don't want to get boxed into is, trying to predict that we'd be at 64% or 66% or anything like that. We want to be competitive as John said, and we'd like to grow at our earnings growth rate, and mind you, that we will be faster than most of our peers, which provides an opportunity. But we are not willing to quantify it.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you so much.","Thomas Webb","Thank you.","John Russell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for all your questions. And now I'd like to hand back to Mr. Russell for closing remarks. Thank you.","John Russell","Thank you. I would just close by making a comment about -- I am pleased with our strong performance in the first half of the year. It has given us the opportunity that we have talked about today, to reinvest back into the business to take care of our customers, and that has been our strategy. Its difficult to do, but we work hard everyday to do it, to take care of our customers and our shareholders. The progress that we have made continues, and if things go as planned and we have talked about, we will be on our 12th consecutive year of consistent and predictable performance. We appreciate everybody's interest in CMS Energy, and look forward to seeing you with the upcoming events. Well thank you for joining us today, and I think Steve was right, that this could be a record time and call for us, for a full one hour. So thank you.","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen.

Just to remind you, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at noon, Eastern Time, running through May 2. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Glenn Barba, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. Please go ahead.","Glenn P. Barba","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. With me are John Russell, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Webb, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Our earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on our website. This presentation contains forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties and should be read in conjunction with our Forms 10-K and 10-Q. The Forward-looking Statements and Information and Risk Factors sections discuss important factors that could cause results to differ materially from those anticipated in such statements.","This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of each of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in the appendix and posted in the Investors section of our website.","CMS Energy provides financial results on both the reported Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and adjusted or non-GAAP basis. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company's present operating financial performance, unaffected by discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, regulatory items from prior years or other items. Certain of these items have the potential to impact favorably or unfavorably the company's reported earnings in 2013. The company is not able to estimate the impact of these matters and is not providing reported earnings guidance.","Now I will turn the call over to John.","John G. Russell","Thanks, Glenn. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on our first quarter earnings call. I'll begin the presentation with a few brief comments about the quarter before I turn the call over to Tom to discuss the financial results and the outlook for 2013. Then, as usual, we'll close with questions and answers.","We're off to a good start in 2013. For the first quarter, adjusted earnings per share was $0.53, this is up $0.16 from last year, primarily due to more normal winter weather as compared to one of the warmest winters on record a year ago. First quarter results keep us on track to meet our full year guidance of $1.63 to $1.66 a share.","We've identified a number of near-term catalysts that we believe provide the foundation to achieve our long-term goals. Tom and I will provide you an update on each of these during today's call.","This slide shows a list of 8 catalysts that will have an effect on our future performance. You probably heard us talk about them over the past few months. As we look at the list, good progress has already been made. In fact, a couple have been completed, while others provide us opportunities ahead.","The first catalyst is the 2008 Energy Law and the effect it has had on Michigan regulation. The 2008 Energy Law is working as designed. The latest example is our recent electric self-implementation filing. For the first time since the law was passed, there was no opposition and no order to our self-implementation request. A significant milestone and another constructive development.","But despite how well the law is working, there are a few special interest group that would like to change parts of the law. Last November, the Governor gave a report on energy and the environment. Included in the report was Appendix A titled Readying Michigan to Make Good Energy Decisions. The appendix calls for 2013 to be the year of study on energy issues. The Governor outlined a measured approach of data gathering that will help policy makers made good energy decisions for Michigan's future based on facts rather than soundbites.","Seven public forums have been held across the state to gather information on renewable energy, energy optimization, electric retail open access, and other energy-related topics. The Michigan Public Service Commission Chairman and the Michigan Economic Development Corporation Energy Office Director are leading this effort. They will submit a report to the Governor, who is expected to give his recommendation by the end of the year. We expect that the legislature and governor will be looking at changes to the law in the 2014 and 2015 time frame, after certain provisions of the current law sunset. We will keep you updated on the progress throughout the year.","The second catalyst is our rate cases. In March, we self-implemented a $110 million electric rate increase. As we have mentioned before, our electric and gas rate cases are primarily for capital investment needed to provide safe, reliable service to our customers and to meet mandatory state and federal requirements. We will continue to file routine and regular cases for timely recovery of these investments, which keep average base rate increases below the rate of inflation.","We have been a leader in the industry in O&M cost control. Converting all of our coal plants to burn western coal has generated substantial savings for our customers. Restructuring the workforce and labor agreements are 2 more examples that have helped us reduce legacy costs. And as we look forward, there is more that we can do. We are always looking for ways to improve reliability and affordability for our customers. A strong customer focus is important to the sustainability of our business model.","During the first quarter, we announced plans to reduce natural gas fuel costs by 15% over the next 12 months. This will result in a total bundled gas rate, which includes the commodity and the distribution charge being reduced by 7% this year and by 2% on average over the next 5 years. This creates headroom and opportunities to invest in our gas infrastructure business to deliver safe and reliable service.","The third catalyst is our capital investment plan. You can see on the map where we are planning on making our investments. Environmental compliance, the new gas plant, gas infrastructure and upgrades to the Ludington Pumped Storage Plant are some of the major projects planned within next 5 years. We have lowered the top end of our investment plan over the next 5 years to $7 billion from the $7.3 billion you can see on the chart.","Looking out over the next 5 years, we have a solid plan to invest another $8 billion in needed projects that will improve our electric and gas systems. Our investment program continues to drive reliability, safety and customer value, as well as grow earnings and cash flow over the long term.","Catalyst #4. Catalyst #4 is the filing of the Certificate of Necessity, often referred to as the CON for our proposed new gas plant. Late last year, we submitted an air permit. This summer, we will file the CON with the MPSC. The purpose of the CON is to demonstrate the need for new generation and to support our decision that a natural gas plant is the most efficient choice. It also will secure cost recovery.","This new plant will be built on a site we already own. The location is ideal, with full gas supply and electric transmission already on site. The plant will include the latest technology to run as an efficient baseload unit with an optimal heat rate. And it's timed right. The plant will be operational soon after our small coal plants are taken out of service.","Now let me turn the call over to Tom to talk to you more about our first quarter results and the outlook for the rest of the year.","Thomas J. Webb","Thanks, John. The investments that John described deliver vital services for our customers and continued growth for you, our investors.","For the first quarter, our earnings were $0.53 a share on a reported and an adjusted basis. This is $0.16 better than last year. Colder than normal weather provided a boost of $0.03 this year, which was much better than the mild winter experienced last year. With self implementation of our new electric rate case on March 19, our earnings run rate is comfortably in that 5% to 7% growth range. Actual and projected cost are as planned. While recent sales are stronger than planned and promising, we continue to plan conservatively to stay realistic and maintain a solid focus on customer service and investor results.","We're maintaining our guidance at $1.63 to $1.66 a share. Now as is our past practice, we intend to reinvest stronger than planned financial performance in customer reliability improvements. Now please recall, our work that we did last year when we offset fully the adverse implications of an unusually mild winter weather. Otherwise, this would've reduced 2012 earnings by $0.13 a share.","Later in the year, we benefited from a hotter than normal summer, and we put this upside to use by investing substantially more in tree trimming, generating plant maintenance and system hardening. We also were able to make important contributions to low income funds and our charitable foundation at the end of the year. None of these jeopardized delivering another strong year of earnings growth up 7% from the prior year.","Now with all that in mind, it's good to have a fast start this year. And in April, we continue to experience more upside, enhancing the fast start by another $0.02 or $0.03. We already are putting some of this favorable performance to work with incremental improvements to customer reliability. Some of the reinvestment is in our plans for later in the year, and we'll monitor conditions to see how the summer shapes up before acting.","The post-recession recovery has been strong for our industrial customers and, overall, we call the recovery good, but not great, but perhaps just a little better than our surrounding states. This chart shows our year-to-year change in electric weather normalized sales, the green bars show us -- the gray bars are the average of U.S. utilities. The recession hit us a bit harder, but our recovery has been a bit better than most. GDP in our service territory was better than 90% of all states or among the top 10% in both 2011 and 2012.","Industrial sales growth offset recession losses in 2010, building nicely since then. Residential and commercial growth has been modest. Excluding the sales from one company that's on a no margin economic development tariff, we anticipate industrial growth at about 1% this year, and that's on top of a good 4% last year.","We project total sales to grow less than 1% this year on top of 1% last year. Excluding energy optimization, underlying economic growth was 2% last year, and we expect that it would be about 1.5% this year. Now this, of course, is even higher or about a 2% growth if you consider the impact of leap year in 2012.","The shift from propane to natural gas continues to enhance new gas customer hookups, almost doubling new customer hookups last year. We expect to add a third to the level of new hookups this year. This provides substantial savings to customers and should add about 70,000 new customers to our network overall. While many of our near-term catalysts that we're talking about today are in the future, we're pleased to report credit rating upgrades for CMS and for consumers by both S&P and Moody's.","The utility rating is a notch stronger and the parent now has an investment grade rating for the first time. I know for some of you, this has been an overhang, so it's especially pleasing to eliminate this disadvantage.","We plan to continue our strong level of liquidity with $1.2 billion in 5-year revolvers, supporting $2 billion of liquidity overall. We maintain a liquidity level about twice the thickness of our peers, continuing to maintain our conservative approach to the business. Just last month, we prefunded $250 million of parent debt maturities with a 30-year debt. That's another first for the parent.","We also completed our 2013 continuous equity program. Parent cash flow is strong and utility operating cash flow is at its best level ever. This reflects our healthy customer-oriented capital investment program. We've completed planned parent financings for 2013, and we expect to wrap up the utility needs soon.","As always, here's our earnings and cash flow sensitivity chart. So far sales and gas prices are on the high side. Our ability to apply NOLs and tax credits continues to help us avoid the need for new block equity and associated dilution. This is an enviable position. So we're on track to meet all of our financial targets for 2013, and fortunately, with some room to move. If successful, this will be our 11th year in a row with a continued on-plan track record of growth at a premium to our peers.","Thank you for your attention on what we know is a very busy day of earning calls. We appreciate, and we value your interest and your support. We'd be happy to take your call. So Kathy, would you please open the call for us?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mark Barnett of Morningstar.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question. You mentioned, for the first time, with the self implementation that went in totally smoothly, could you possibly discuss some of the -- not the actual growth level of the increase, but some of the rate mechanisms that you had proposed along with the filing? And maybe what kind of feedback you've had so far, even though it's been only about 1.5 months?","Thomas J. Webb","Yes, Mark. A couple of things. The reason we comment things going pretty smoothly is, as you know, when we do a self-implementation in the past, it's got a little bit of debate or discussion in terms of the level and the way we go. The commission has been very helpful, and in fact, in this particular process, they chose not to really have any comment. In other words, saying that you can choose to self-implement the level you want as long as it's not higher than your request, and it's responsible. And two, they chose to use the default mechanism in the law that provides for essentially peanut-buttering these rates across all of the customers. Because, typically, what they might do is ask for a little reshaping of that, in one fashion or another. So that's, in part, what we call, as very smooth. A second part of a 3-part answer here is that for the first time on an electric rate case, they actually built in a schedule and did some work to look at the possibility of settling a case. Now that's very unusual. And electric cases are big and complex, and gas plays cases are small, a little bit more routine, and those get settled. But for an electric rate case, that would be very unusual if that happens. But that's still on the scheduling process. And then third, if I can comment, overall, we've asked for a mechanism that essentially takes the capital investment that we make and permits that to be tracked in just common words, if I may use it that way, so we called it an adjustment mechanism. That's not something that we're counting on. We're counting on our kind of routine approach to rate cases, but it's something that many parties have been interested in. So we've included that in our request as a mechanism that might allow us to avoid the need for these annual rate cases, if the commission were to choose to include that in its order. Now I would like you to know, as everybody, that we've always viewed that as something that's less than a 50-50 probability. So it's an upside, if it were to get approved, and we'll just have to see how that goes. There's been a couple of other rate cases that are unrelated recently that in one fashion or another, have include some form of a tracking mechanism around some capital investment. But this would be pretty new, doing it like we do at PSCR or even a GCR, but for all the capitals. So that's an item of interesting discussion. But I'd call it no more than that, because it's a request that we're trying to get good debate on and see if there's a possibility for consensus.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. If I could, just one more quick question on the -- on your usage numbers. You have pretty -- a fairly conservative forecast. I was wondering about just in the quarter, weather normalized on the residential side. You saw a little bit of a dip. Was there anything in particular driving that? And just anything you saw that's a bit -- you, obviously, still have a slight improvement forecast for the year. Just wondering about how that fits into your expectations?","Thomas J. Webb","Yes. In fact, the way to think about that, when you look at the residential weather-adjusted side, you'll see that for the quarter, it's down, as you were observing, 0.8%. Then you'll see commercial up 1.5%, and you'll see our overall industrial with that one adjustment that I talked about being positive too. On the residential side, I hate to use excuses, but I will remind you that it was a leap year, last year, and it wasn't this year. And the leap year impact overall was worth 1 full point, having that lost day. So inside the quarter, there's a little bit of that and some other things going on. But here's what I would offer to you for the outlook for the year. Think of residential and commercial as positive but still modest growth. It's on the industrial side we've seen a really good rebound. And as you know, that will actually feed the residential side later, and it will feed the commercial side to some point later as well. So the fact we're seeing a good rebound on the industrial side is what we're watching with a lot of care. And then we think, as people get more confidence and more businesses expand in Michigan, the way they're doing today, that eventually will bring along more hookups on the residential side. I hope that helps.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Weisel, Macquarie Capital.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","If you could just elaborate on that last point a little bit more? When I look -- compared to the full year forecast for usage, it looks like it has come down. It was 1% total, now at 0.5%. And industrial was plus 3%, now it's plus 1%. Can you just talk -- is that something that you saw in the first quarter trailing your expectations? Is it more of a forecast of lowering the bar going forward? And then maybe talk about usage per account versus customer growth.","Thomas J. Webb","Yes. I would tell you that we're seeing -- we saw a little bit of softening in the fourth quarter and first quarter, particularly, as it may impact the residential side. And we would sound smarter than we are if I told you we knew the exact answers on this. But I would say there's some concern on confidence of individuals. And therefore, moving out from shared homes and things like that may not be happening as quickly as we thought. And I would say that probably, the withholding tax had an impact on people's confidence. And I think you're now seeing that in a lot of the records, the Michigan consumer confidence index and that sort of thing. So what we're doing is reflecting what we see is a little slow down and projecting that out through the rest of the year. You know us pretty well by now. We do not like to get out there with optimistic assumptions, and then find they're the cause of not being able to do what we need to do for our customers, or what we need to deliver for you on a financial performance. So we'd rather project a little conservatively. So the mixture of real news we've seen. And our desire not to get ahead of ourselves on the recovery and the residential and commercial side has us being a little cautious with the numbers that we're providing. The usage per household, I'd say that the trend has been pretty strong in terms of up, up, up over the years, save the fact but we've spent a lot of work on energy optimization. And that's why I don't like -- ever sound like an excuse, but I do think it's important for you as investors to see the underlying economic growth, and with the energy optimization in and excluded. It's worth about 1 point to us, and a lot of that's on the residential side. So let me help you. I think you could add a little more than 1 point to our residential year-to-year growth, if you were to look underneath the energy optimization. And you can do the same on the total sales, which may help you a little bit. Because we follow that to make sure we're understanding the health of our customers and the pulse of the economy. But you should, in the end, track the bottom line numbers, of course, that include the energy optimization. Because as you know, those are good programs that we're behind solidly, and they actually help our customers and their usage. And they still permit us to get an incentive in terms of a little extra earnings beyond our authorized ROE as a way to help us promote these things. Does that get to your question?","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Yes, that's very helpful. And then one more. I appreciate introduction of this target for propane to gas switching. Can you just elaborate maybe a little the pace of the switching? Any thoughts on political or regulatory support for a plan like this, maybe compared to what we've seen in New England? And then lastly, how we should think about the economics and the operating earnings impact per customer?","Thomas J. Webb","Well, you get a good sense of the pace, if you will look at our Slide 16 called Customer Value, and that's the propane to gas switching. You can see the number of hookups that we had last year, about 1,345. What we expect this year -- but we haven't finished it, about 3,000, and then what you see going into the future. The economics are very strong. They're what drives this. Propane is just gone -- it's disconnected with the price of natural gas. And it looks like it's more of a permanent feature, this disconnection. So there's a lot of people that would like to economically benefit. But I will tell you, on the electric side of the business, when we hook up new customers that the connection part to the general area is socialized. That's not true on the gas side. So we have our regulators looking at that. In fact, encouraging us in regards to finding ways that we could socialize that cost and not have a such a big impact on one customer, as you're trying to take your service into a neighborhood or a business region. So that will help this economics a lot. But clearly, it's a safer place to be with natural gas, it's now, clearly, economically more attractive. We think we're going to get encouragement and support from our regulators to help push this along. And therefore, what we're providing to you here in terms of the number of counts, we think, is pretty reasonable. It could grow a little bit more than that, with the support that I've just been describing. But again, we don't want to get too excited. This is not, in my mind, the New England story, where you're going from oil to natural gas. That's bigger economics, bigger customer counts. For us, it's very important. It's a big deal in Michigan, but not to the scale that you've seen in terms of the growth that they have. This organic growth that we've got, this will supplement and puts us in a pretty good place. So we're real pleased with it, but careful on scale, when you're looking at what is happening in New England.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Okay, that's good context. Just on the economics, I was referring to the economics to you. How -- what will be the earnings impact for your company, not for the customer?","Thomas J. Webb","I apologize, very good question. Just think of the capital investment involved. I -- let me just give you a ballpark. If you look at the number of hookups we've described, you could be talking in the neighborhood of $150 million, $160 million. And then as that comes into the rate base, just take our 10.3% return against that, and you can see the kind of impact that it can have on the company and still provide an attractive payback to our customers.","Operator","The next question comes from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Again, just to sort of follow-up. The change -- just to make sure I understand this. The change in the forecast for sales growth is because of customer behavior driven by less than robust, previously -- previous expectations as to how they'd be responding to the economy at this point in time. Is that the way to think about it?","Thomas J. Webb","Yes. And then later on, a little bit of our conservatives. I don't want to overstate that, but you know us, we've lived through the hard times a decade ago. We are never going to get bold and optimistic about our planning assumptions.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. But I mean -- but you guys are pretty -- you haven't gotten more conservative than you had 6 months ago, right?","Thomas J. Webb","No, no, no.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","So it's basically -- it's -- the real driver should be basically because of this change in behavior that you guys hadn't expected? Is that...","Thomas J. Webb","That's right, exactly right. So we're seeing pretty good upticks on industrial, slows a little bit because you're building on year-to-year comps that are pretty high to start with, right, through the recovery. But on the residential and economic, on the commercial side, we're seeing the green shoots, as people like to call it and describe it. But we're still cautious that, that side's going to follow and is not robust yet. I've watched a lot of other locations around the country. And they're seeing sort of similar situations, and it quarter-to-quarter varies a little bit. But I think it's almost a national issue that we're facing in terms of that side of the recovery.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Sure. Now you also mentioned that there was -- I believe that you guys, just to make sure I understood this. 1% -- you guys would have 1% higher sales growth, if it wasn't for utility, energy optimization, energy-efficiency programs? Did I understand that correct?","Thomas J. Webb","You understood that exactly correct. And that 1% is about the same number if you were to look at residential side, because -- as you look at the classes. But overall, we would have about 1% more growth. So if we tell you, we're to be about 0.5% before that, we'd be at 1.5%, if you excluded the energy optimization.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","These are only your efforts, not what might be happening -- this is people's individual initiative?","Thomas J. Webb","No, that's right. But sometimes that's hard to break out the 2, if somebody's screwing a new light bulb in. And we can take credit for that, we'd like to.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. I got you. Now just finally. And I apologize, there was a discussion at the beginning of the call, and, of course, got little distracted with things going on about legislative and just policy initiatives in the state. And I, obviously, don't want you to repeat what you guys said there. But just, any specifics or bottom line takeaway that we should be thinking about in terms of what those policy initiatives will drive in terms of the opportunities specifically? Just quickly, I don't want you to, obviously, rehash what you just said. But, gee, I'm saying, just sort of like, bottom line takeaway, how should we think about that?","John G. Russell","I think the key -- this is John, the key is that I would look at 2013. I mentioned it's a year of fact gathering. And you've got a data-driven administration, a data-driven commission. And what they're trying to do is find out what is the -- what are the facts behind where we should go when the law, the energy law that was put into place in 2008, comes to sort of what I would call a natural sunset in 2015? At that point, we will have achieved our renewable energy targets. Do we move forward with that? Or do we keep them the same? Energy optimization would be the same. Retail open access, we have a hybrid system here, what do we do at that point? So this is going to be a multiyear process. It'll go through the legislature. I think it's important to note that the administration like -- seems to like what's going on today with our investments. The Senate, the people that run the Senate, and all of the members of the Senate, voted for the energy law in 2008, every single one of them. And most of the folks on the -- most of the Legislature on the House side, almost all of them have been supportive of the law. So we're in a pretty good position to continue what we have here. But the key is we need to look at what's beyond 2015, and that's what the focus of these efforts are.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. So we'll stay tuned, I guess.","John G. Russell","Yes. I think that it's going to be a process.","Operator","The next question comes from Kevin Cole of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess had a follow-up question to Paul's, actually. So, I guess, I'd like to ask a couple of high-level questions, just on general resource planning and need for new generation. And so, I see you've indicated that the system will need a potential of 1,000 to 1,500 megawatts, sort of -- that's going to be the shortfall in 2015 or '16? And to meet that shortfall, you're going to construct a 700-megawatt gas plant, leaving the system roughly 300 to 700 megawatts short. Is that not -- I recognize that your system will at least be tight in that timeframe. How are you and the commission contemplating, like the possible early retirement of Palisades in 2017, which I believe is a big resource for you? Out of state coal plant retirements that could change the general economics of importing power? And then, I guess, separately, do you have any other PPAs that could be subject to early retirements that could further tighten your system?","John G. Russell","Yes, great question. Let me you take that. We've got -- first of all, the coal plants, you're aware, we've got 7 small coal plants that we're looking to retire in the '15, '16 timeframe. That will take out about 1,000 megawatts. The PPA we talked about -- 2 major PPAs we have, one is with the MCV, and one is with Palisades. The Palisades question you raised, really, you need to talk to Entergy, because they're the ones that run Palisades. We have an agreement with them through 2022. They're obligated to us that if they do, if they no longer run Palisades, they need to supply power to us some way for 2 years, and then the contract would be eliminated. And the key is that what we need to do is find out from them -- you need to find out from them what they're actually going to do about the plant. But we assume the plant's going to continue to run and we'll have the power. Your point is right today. We have a shortfall in about 2017. This gas plant will make up for that, part of that gap that we have. But until 2017 -- this is an important piece that will come out in the CON process, we will have an excess of power, a glut of power on the market between now and 2017. I think you've seen the MISO results recently that talked about nearly 20% overcapacity in the area. So the timing of the plan is critical as we go forward.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And then, I guess, now with -- I guess, a quick question on the tracker. As I guess that with last week's success by DTE Gas and their capital tracker, I guess, answers the ALJ question, I guess, it's certain of the commission lacks the authority to grant tracker. Can you spend a couple of moments, I guess, just talking about how you expect that tracker to work like, for example, will you get cash recovery and customer bills? Or will it be a recovery of deregulatory asset, what type of CapEx will be included in that mechanism? Will that CapEx may be preapproved and just kind of the duration of the tracker until it resets?","Thomas J. Webb","Sure. I will remind you again that this is an upside opportunity that's got nothing to do so much with the numbers but has to do with the process. So it would provide more certainty. What -- our request was over a 2-year period. It provides more certainty for that recovery over the 2-year period. And then avoids the need for us to be able to come in for an additional rate case. So it simplifies the process, it gives a little more certainty about the results, and it gives certainty when I say that, not only to you as investors, but to our customers, to know exactly what to expect. So the mechanisms, really, it sounds complicated when you read them, but it's pretty straightforward. It just says for the second year, you project the capital that you would need. We, the commission, will review it and authorize it. You can go ahead and charge for it at the beginning of that second year, self implement, if you will. But we reserve the right, as they should, to audit what was actually spent to make sure it was spent on the right things, and it was the proper amounts. So it gives full authority and full accountability for us, to the commission, to ensure that we've done no more than we should, no less than we should I suppose, too, but that we've done the right things. It just makes the whole process more efficient. And since our rate cases, largely, are all about capital investment to do things that we're catching up on for our customers, and to meet environmental requirements and so on, it just makes for a more effective, efficient process for everybody involved. There's no magic, doesn't make the numbers any bigger, any better, any different, it just makes the process much more stable and more predictable and more efficient to administer. So that's the way to think about it. And I just want to close the answer on this one with -- it's an upside, up for all those things I described. I still give it less than a 50-50 chance of success. But if it were to happen, it'll be terrific. So you're seeing other people get little pieces of it. So I think there's a desire to move in this direction. And sure, there are people who are nervous about change, so they'll find ways to say, well, it's not appropriate or not legal, or not whatever. We're not going to do anything or ask for anything that's not fully legal and fully proper to do.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And what percentage of CapEx will be covered in the tracker?","Thomas J. Webb","Well, in our proposal, for the electric side of the","business, it would be 100%. So it wouldn't be cherry picking this piece or that piece. It would say, \"Here's your program, of your spending for the year,\" like \"Here's your program for the power that you're going to buy and how you're going to do that per -- again, for a year, and then you go ahead and execute that. And to the extent that something is changed, the rules change, the laws change or something, explain that to us, because we'll have to agree to modifications.\" But if you spend what you said you were going to on the things that you said you were going to, and you get the sort of performance you said you were going to, then you'd have a complete tracker. But more on that, I think that's something that we'll work to over time. I wouldn't expect -- and maybe we will be fortunate in this case. But there's a lot of good important things happening in addition to that.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And do you expect this to be fully litigated? Or is this -- or do you think you can now get to a settlement part [indiscernible]?","Thomas J. Webb","Oh, if you're talking now about the General Electric rate case, I did make some comments earlier. And I was -- we were pleased to see that the commission scheduled the fact that there would be discussions around a settlement, and they followed up. They lead that effort. And they have had some discussions around the settlement. But that's all I could say, because, remember, all parties are involved in these sorts of things. And it's not our position to say what will or won't happen. We'll announce anything, if something were to happen to everybody at the point that it occurs.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","If a settlement were to happen, when would it happen? Like what would be the time frame?","Thomas J. Webb","Well, it can't take too long, if it were to happen because you'd be deeper into the regular rate case. So if something were to happen in that arena, now you're asking me for what I'm looking around, and I'm giving you my personal estimate. I'd say it's something that would be within the period of a month, or even more likely see the rate case go through it's standard process. So again, don't please, we're not foreshadowing anything or trying to raise expectations. But we've been asked about it, because it was scheduled and because that some word got out about discussions. It will be a wonderful thing if it happened, but it's nothing that we're planning or counting on.","Operator","The next question comes from Paul Ridzon, KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","When do you expect capital to start flowing on the gas plant, assuming it gets the approval?","John G. Russell","Little bit of capital in 2013, '14, as '14 is really when it begins to pick up.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","You have a sense of magnitude in '14?","John G. Russell","Yes. About $100 million as its planned today. And then you go up -- beyond that, then you go up to about $350 million and then $250 million to complete it over the 3-year period. So the next 2 years, very small capital investment.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold, Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Could you maybe just give us an update on where you said that coal plants on your coal piles versus normal? And what you're seeing versus last year, say, in first quarter and also now, in terms of dispatch?","Thomas J. Webb","I would call it substantial improvement. We -- you remember we were reporting to you a year ago, and I was wringing my hands at that point. Inventory coal piles were more -- double the level of what we would have expected them to be. And, obviously, that was a mild winter, and that was a lot of switching from coal to gas going on. And so, the economics were just going crazy. Well, our supply team did an outstanding job. And I think we talked about this in either the second or the third quarter, working with our suppliers on the rail side and other suppliers to figure out ways to optimize that, and to get better economics for our customers, and to not have to take so much of the coal that we were scheduled to take, so that we've been able to work those inventory levels down closer to normal levels. And what helped us get through that, and I have to admit, we're in a heck of a hot summer. If we hadn't had the real heat out there, that would've been tougher for us to make that progress. So I would -- I don't have the exact number in front of me for the inventory level. But I would tell you that we're closer to normal, and it's not a worry for us right now. What I would add is that we are continuing to work with our suppliers on this subject, because the -- there's been a fairly permanent shift in the general economics, and so we will work on the best way to optimize the supply from all of our fuel suppliers, but particularly on the coal side.","John G. Russell","And Jonathan, if I could just add one thing to that, what Tom said, just a walk-around number for you, anywhere from $2.50 for gas or $3 is where our western coal units begin to be in the money. So in other words, they're dispatched at or ahead of gas. So that has also helped in the first quarter too that the gas prices are well over that $3 level. And we're are dispatching the coal now as we usually have.","Thomas J. Webb","And the team just showed me, so I can share it with you. We're down from over 60-day supply a year ago, down in the 40-day zone, which is more the place we'd like to be.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Can -- any data points you can share on sort of capacity factors now versus then, John? Or anything like that, you have?","John G. Russell","Let me see if we have it here. I think we're up to 64% kind of year-to-date basis. And last year, we were at 56%.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And that's on the coal plants?","John G. Russell","The coal, yes. And that's kind of a normal run rate, Jonathan. That's tends to be what we normally run.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And on the other side, gas was and now is?","Thomas J. Webb","Well, the Zeeland factor -- Zeeland combined cycle utilization was, if I'm reading this right, about 22% in the first quarter. But you'd expect to see that come up a bit as we go through the year.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And how did that compare with Q1 of last year, Tom?","Thomas J. Webb","Well, it was higher last year in the 86% level, and then 88% in the second quarter. So you'd see a lot of shifting back.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Kevin Fallon [ph], SIR Capital Management.","Unknown Analyst","I just wanted to clarify, on the certificate of need process, what's the threshold for the MPSC to make the decision? And in particular, are they obligated to consider other plants? Or is the entire opportunity to cover the net short going forward consumers' opportunity","John G. Russell","Yes, first of all, it would be dependent on what we submit. That threshold is over $500 million, so it has to be a significant investment, that's one of the thresholds. The other threshold is the timing that it needs to be completed in less than 1 year. It's about 9 months that it has to be completed. The key there though is that what we get into is that we have to show the need. So what we have to do is submit an integrated resource plan, which will show the need in 2017. And then on the second item that we have to look at is, is this plant the most competitive for customers? I'll tell you what's nice over the past year or 2, it's pretty clear that natural gas is the choice -- is the fuel choice in the future. A few years ago, I think you were familiar we're thinking about building a coal plant. That part of it, I think, will be pretty clear. But the competitive piece of it, you'll see other people intervene in this case that may be independent power producers today that have gas plants, in Zone 7, in MISO, that will probably claim that their plant built in the last boom back in '98, '99 are better than a plant built in 2013 or '14. So expect that to happen, that's part of the process. The reason we go through the process though is to get approval for the integrated resource plan, to get approval for that -- this plant, the fuel source. The plant is the right one. And we get assurances of recovery, as long as we stick to what we said we would do on the schedule and the cost.","Unknown Analyst","But you guys would feel pretty comfortable, obviously, going into that process, that your project would be able to provide greater benefits than an alternative?","John G. Russell","Absolutely. As I mentioned earlier, we have a site, we've got almost 300 acres on the site, gas is on the site, transmission is on the site, it doesn't require any kind of third-party intervention as far as bringing in cost to that site. We'll have the latest technology today. It'll be a combined cycle plant. There were a lot of plants that were built in Michigan in the late '90s that were peaking plants. So they were simple cycle plants. So there's those out there. That's not really what we're looking for here. This is going to be a base load unit to pick up, in part, for what we retire a mothball on the coal side of our fleet.","Unknown Analyst","That's great. And just one other thing. On the slide in the deck of 2013 sensitivities, when we look at the plus or minus 1% change in electric sales, that's excluding the E1 tariff sales, correct?","Thomas J. Webb","Oh, it doesn't matter if it's in or out, because there are no margin. So you could answer that question yes and no and still be right.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Russell for closing remarks.","John G. Russell","Thank you.

After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at noon Eastern Time running through February 7th. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy\u2019s website in the Investor Relations section.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations.","Sri Maddipati","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Patti Poppe, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Patti.","Patti Poppe","Thanks, Sri, and good morning, everyone. Before I review our results for the year, I do want to touch on what you\u2019ve likely heard in the media. Michigan and the Midwest are experiencing extremely cold temperatures, which are attacking energy delivery throughout myself and driving record demand on our gas system.","The Governor of Michigan has declared a state of emergency given the dangerously cold weather. Our number one priority is to keep people safe and warm. We\u2019ve seen record demand on our system, and while we are working hard to meet that demand, we did have an incident at our Ray storage field, which is now partially back online. But given the weather and demand, we have asked our customers to reduce their gas usage by turning down thermostats and conserving energy across the state. We thank all of our customers who are doing their part to help Michigan crews in dangerous weather, which we expect to last for the next 24 hours.","2018 was a solid year for CMS which Rejji and I will walk through in great detail in addition to sharing the Company\u2019s 2019 goals with the usual emphasis on the triple bottom line. With another year in the books, we\u2019re pleased to report adjusted earnings of $2.33 per share, which is toward the top end of our guidance range as planned.","Building on those results, we have raised our 2019 full year guidance range from $2.46 to $2.50 per share, up by a penny to $2.47 to $2.51. This reflects growth of 6% to 8% on top of actuals, as we do every year with a bias toward the midpoint of 7%. It\u2019s also worth noting that earlier this month, the Board voted to increase our 2019 annual dividend to $1.53 per share, a 7% increase year-over-year, which was in line with our earnings growth. And we are reaffirming our long-term dividend growth plans as being in line with our earnings growth.","As we look back at 2018, Slide 5 serves as a great snapshot of our triple bottom line in action as we worked hard for our people, our planet and our investors. In fact, we were able to reduce customers\u2019 bills by more than $160 million as a result of tax reform and provided over $10 million to our most vulnerable customers to help them pay their bills. We also released our clean energy goal and filed our integrated resource plan or IRP that firmly solidified our promise to care for our planet by eliminating coal as a fuel source and producing over 40% of our energy from renewables at the utility by 2040 with up to 6,000 megawatts of new solar and reducing our carbon emissions by more than 90% during the same period.","We also expanded our renewable portfolio at enterprises with 105 megawatt wind PPA with General Motors and a 24-megawatt solar project for the municipality in Lansing, Michigan. And our triple bottom line is underpinned by our coworkers\u2019 performance operationally. We had a busy year, as we\u2019ve replaced over 13,000 vintage gas service line. We also spent a record amount on forestry at our electric business improving both the safety and reliability of our system.","These achievements and others listed on this slide would not be possible without our investors, both large and small. We\u2019ve entrusted with us their savings and we thank them for that. Without the broad access to cost effective capital from our investors, we would not be able to make the necessary investments to provide safe and reliable energy to our customers. As we entered 2019, we\u2019re now laser focused on delivering for our customers and investors in the current year and preparing for 2020 and beyond.","I can tell you safety is top of mind this year and that as it was last year and the year before that. From boots on the ground to safety in the office, every meeting and every job begins with, what we call, a safety tailboard. All potential hazards are discussed before the job begins and necessary precautions are addressed each day. That may seem simple and may be not that important. I can assure you creating and improving a safety culture requires daily attention and all of us here take that very seriously.","Beyond that, we are planning to invest over $100 million more than the prior year and improving safety in both our gas and electric systems, so that our co-workers and customers are safe. This year, we will continue to focus on enhancing our customers\u2019 experience through targeted programs, increasing economic growth in our home state and protecting our planet, all while staying focused on our commitment to investors to deliver the financial results you\u2019ve come to expect. Our priorities are enabled by our implementation of the Consumers Energy Way which allows us to see and eliminate waste in all of our processes.","Slide 7 highlights our success in attracting new businesses in Michigan. In 2018, we proactively saw and attracted 101-megawatt to load. This is up from 69 megawatts in 2017. This load growth includes key wins from large Internet-based retailers, dairy manufacturing farms and many other industries that chose to bring their business to our state and trusted us to meet their energy needs. We\u2019re proud of these wins and the associated economic growth that they offer including over 5,500 new jobs and $2 billion of investment in our home state just last year.","We will also highlight that less than 2% of our customer contributions are from the auto industry, leaving us less vulnerable to any one sector of the economy. And we know that when Michigan grows, CMS Energy grows. And we will continue to support economic development that will diversify our customer base. As we continue to focus on delivering safe, reliable and affordable energy for our customers, our performance is further enabled by our energy law, which provides a constructive regulatory framework and supports a forward-thinking energy policy.","Today, we have an open seat at the commission as Rachael Eubanks has been appointed to State Treasurer by our new Governor. We\u2019d like to take this opportunity to congratulate the former Commissioner Eubanks and wish her great success as Treasurer of Michigan. I have no doubt that she\u2019s going to do a great job. We expect the Governor, Whitmer, will appoint a new Commissioner soon with two seats currently filled at the Commission. We do have a quorum as evidenced by the recent approval of our electric settlement in early January, and we look forward to working with the administrations pending the point he wants publicized and whoever replaces Commissioner Saari in July, when his term is scheduled to expire.","As we look ahead to the regulatory calendar over the next couple of years, you will see less rate cases given that we managed and settled excessive gas and electric rate cases to close out 2018. The electric rate case outcome was particularly noteworthy since it occurred eight months after our filings and it\u2019s only the second time in our Company\u2019s recent history that we have settled an electric rate case. The highlight of the settlement includes $200 million for reliability investment, that\u2019s $70 million more than ever before plus the ability to true-up costs related to CapEx spending in new business for demand failures and asset relocations.","This settlement allows us to avoid filing a new rate case until 2020. Our IRP filing is on track for a final order in the second quarter. We anticipate an order in our demand response filing and our final piece of tax reform related to deferred taxes in the second half of this year.","Lastly, in November, we filed our gas rate case for $229 million at 10.75% ROE with a 12-month test period ending September 2020. This rate case will focus heavily on safety, as we look to replace around the 140 miles of main and 25,000 vintage services among other gas investments. The weather we\u2019ve been experiencing further highlights the need to continue to invest in our gas system to ensure safety and reliability. We expect a commission order by September of this year.","As we turn to Slide 10, we\u2019re reminded of the work that our team does every day to adapt changing condition. As you can see, in 2018, we benefited from weather and we put those dollars back to work, which derisk 2019. We were able to leverage the early favorability to benefit our customers very effectively in the calendar year. If we experience poor weather and significant storm activity in 2019, we will rely on those pull aheads from the prior year, our lean operating system and our ability to optimize work to maximize safety and reliability for the benefit to customers. This strategy allows us to deliver on our financial objectives in the current year while providing a longer runway for our growth in the future.","As Slide 11 shows, we\u2019ve proven our ability to deliver regardless of who is in office to make up of the commission for varying weather or economic conditions. I have said it before, the part of what makes us consistent is our ability to adapt changing external conditions, and we look forward to working with Governor, Whitmer, and the Commission to serve our friends and neighbors.","And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rejji.","Rejji Hayes","Thank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. As Patti mentioned, we\u2019re pleased to announce our strong results for 2018 with adjusted earnings per share of $2.33, up 7% in 2017 and towards the high end of our guidance as we\u2019ve predicted. Our adjusted EPS largely excludes modest non-recurring costs associated with select legal legacy business matters and federal tax reform, which resulted in a net difference of $0.01 per share between our adjusted and GAAP EPS. As is often the case, we do not carve out much and take the good with the bad with no excuses.","Our 2018 results were largely driven by weather and rate relief net investments of the utility, as highlighted on the right hand side of Page 12, which were partially offset by substantial reinvestment activity or pull aheads as we refer to them particularly in the fourth quarter. We had adjusted earnings of $0.40 per share for 2018 compared to $0.51 per share in the Q4 2017.","In addition to a record level of operating pull ahead in 2018 of the utility, we also capitalize on non-operating pull aheads by prefunding multiple debt tranches at the parent which is a key driver of the negative variance in our parent and other expense versus guidance. As Patti noted, the numerous reinvestment actions taken in 2018 benefit our customers by enhancing service and reducing costs, while serving to derisk our 2019 financial plan to benefit investors, which I\u2019ll cover in more detail shortly.","Closing the books on 2018, Slide 13 lists all of our financial targets for the year and our success in achieving them. I\u2019ll highlight a couple of noteworthy items in addition to achieving 7% annual EPS growth. We grew our dividend commensurately and generated over $1.7 billion of operating cash flow, which exceeded our guidance and was roughly flat with the prior year as anticipated, due to the effects of federal tax reform. Our steady cash flow generation and conservative financing strategy over the years continues to fortify our balance sheet as evidenced by our strong FFO\/debt ratio, which is at approximately 18.5% at year-end and also exceeded our expectations.","It is worth noting that our outperformance for FFO to debt was in part driven by the prescribed pace which the benefits the federal tax reform when corporate entry, which enables us to issue less equity than we initially anticipated in 2018. Lastly, in accordance with our self-funding model, we kept annual customer price increases below inflation for both the gas and electric businesses, all while investing a record level of capital of approximately $2 billion at the utility.","Moving to 2019, as Patti highlighted, we\u2019re increasing both the bottom and top end of our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance, $2.47 and $2.51, which implies 6% to 8% annual growth of our actuals for 2018. Unsurprisingly, we expect the utility to drive the vast majority of our consolidated financial performance, and we continue to target the midpoint of the EPS growth rate of 7%.","To elaborate on the glide path to achieve our 2019 EPS guidance range, as you will note on the waterfall chart on Slide 15, we plan for normal weather, which in this case amounts to $0.27 negative year-over-year variance given the better-than-normal weather experienced in 2018. However, as I highlighted in our third quarter call, we have largely mitigated that headwind with the substantial reinvestment activity that we exercised in 2018. More specifically, we made a number of discretionary pull aheads in 2018 that we do not need to repeat in 2019.","The operational and financial flexibility afforded by these efforts coupled with our usual level of expected cost performance did result in a $0.27 positive year-over-year variance which fully offsets the absence of the favorable 2018 weather. And while we\u2019re on this topic, I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t take a moment to thank all of our coworkers for their hard work throughout 2018.","While the customer and financial benefits and pull aheads are relatively easy to identify, what\u2019s often underappreciated is the organizational burden that pull aheads create since we don\u2019t usually outsource incremental work and our coworkers effectively doubled their efforts to get this work done. As mentioned, we have mitigated some of our regulatory risk in 2019 with positive outcomes in the early settlements of our previous electric and gas cases. We also have a pending gas case as Patti noted, which in order is due in late September. Keep in mind we are showing the net pickup after the impacts of investment-related costs such as depreciation, property tax and interest expense.","We have also embedded the usual conservatism in our assumptions around the sales and financing activity. Please refer to appendix Slide 25 on EPS and OCF sensitivity analysis, unsaid variables among others. As you can see, due to our significant reinvestment activity in 2018 and the constructive regulatory environment, we have a reasonable path to deliver another year of 6% to 8% adjusted EPS growth. Our focus on cost controls, conservative financial planning and proactive risk management underpin our simple but unique business model depicted on Slide 16, which enables us to deliver consistent industry-leading financial performance year-end and year-out.","We have a robust backlog of capital investments, which improves the safety and reliability of our electric and gas systems for our customers and drives earnings growth for our investors. We fund this growth largely through cost cutting, tax planning, economic development and modest non-utility contribution, all efforts, which we deem sustainable in the long run. As such, we are confident that we can continue to improve customer experience through capital investments while meeting our affordability and environmental targets for many years to come.","As you can see on Slide 17, we have updated our five-year customer investment plan by rolling it forward one year, as we often do on our Q4 call. This adds an additional $1 billion of capital investment, bringing the five-year plan to $11 billion in aggregate, roughly half of which is comprised of gas infrastructure investments. We continue to focus on the needs of our aging gas system. As reflected in the forecast, increase in gas as a percentage of total rate base from 30% to 40% over the next five years, which drives over 7% rate base growth.","Please note the annual details of this plan are included in the appendix of this presentation. Our capital investment needs remain significant beyond the five-year period as well. As we work through regulatory proceedings in our financial planning cycle, we expect that the longer-term capital mix will continue to evolve. And we look forward to providing an update to our 10-year capital plan in the second half of the year once we have better visibility on the long-term capacity plan for the outcome of our IRP.","As we highlighted in past, the primary constraint on the pace, which we invest capital is customer affordability. And we are confident that we can continue to deliver cost reductions to minimize customer bill increases. Our numerous capital investment programs will enable reduced maintenance costs on items such as service restoration, leak repair and meter reading among other benefits.","We will also benefit from power purchase agreements rolling off in due time, while also realizing fuel and O&M expense savings as we retire our coal fleet. Speaking of the coal fleet, I am pleased to report that we have recently renegotiated our fuel transportation rates, which will yield over $150 million in customers savings customer savings cumulatively over the life of the new contracts.","We also continue to seek out non-operating cost savings opportunities. In addition to over $1.2 billion of opportunistic refinancings collectively at the parent and utility in 2018, we contributed $240 million into our pension plan in late December to increase the funded status of our pension plans to approximately 90%. This sizable discretionary contribution coupled with prudent decisions of the past such as closing our defined benefit plan several years ago, utilizing conservative asset return expectations, employing a balanced asset allocation strategy among others, has more than offset the unfavorable asset performance experienced in 2018.","In fact, we are estimating about $6 million reduction in our pension expense in 2019 versus 2018 as noted in the appendix. To put our strong cost controls into perspective, on the right hand side of the slide, you will note that our residential electric and gas bills have decreased on an absolute basis and as a percent of wallet for Michigan residents from 2007 to 2017 despite nearly $15 billion of capital investment over that time frame.","Looking now at our operating cash flow forecast on Slide 19, as mentioned, we received some upside in OCF in 2018, due to the pace which the benefits of federal tax reform were incorporated into rates. And some are O&M, we took measures to derisk our 2019 plan, most notably through the aforementioned pension contribution and solid working capital management. As such, we continue to target $1.65 billion of OCF in 2019 and still anticipate a $100 million per year increase beginning in 2020.","In aggregate, we are forecasted to generate over $9 billion of cumulative operating cash flow over the next five years, which will play key role in the financing strategy of our five-year capital plan. In support of our liquidity planning, we also expect to avoid paying meaningful federal taxes through 2023. This is the result of strong tax planning and the forecast layering in of renewable tax credit as we meet the 15% RPS standard in Michigan by 2021. And some are forecasted OCF generation coupled with our tax shield portfolio enables us to continue to finance our capital investment program in a highly cost efficient manner as you will note on Slide 30 in the appendix.","On Slide 20, you will note that we have refreshed the outlook for DIG to reflect positive new developments in our energy contracts. In short, we have successfully amended and extended our existing energy contracts and entered into a new contract at our simple cycle unit in Kalamazoo. The revenue associated with these contract revisions has allowed us to weather the challenges presented by lower capacity prices and we\u2019ve reflected this in our guidance for 2019 and our plan going forward.","As you can see, DIG is almost fully contracted for energy and capacity through 2022. So we feel quite good about maintaining the $35 million pre-tax income run rate. Also if capacity prices were to revert back to recent history, around $3 per kilowatt-month that we could see an additional $10 million to $15 million of upside.","Alternatively, as the market were to tighten the levels comparable and MISO Cost of New Entry, or CONE due to looming coal retirements or the establishment of the local clearing requirement and this opportunity can more than double. Suffice it to say, the enterprise team has done an excellent job of managing risk and reducing the beta in their portfolio for the foreseeable future.","On Slide 21, we have listed our financial targets for 2019 and beyond. In short, we anticipate another solid year of 6% to 8% EPS growth with a bias toward the midpoint. This model has and will continue to serve our customers, well, as they see affordable electric and gas prices from our self-funding strategy as well as our investors who can continue to count on consistent industry-leading financial performance.","As we look prospectively at the consolidated business, our EPS growth continues to be driven by our utility given its robust capital investment needs and forward-looking filings such as the IRP and forward-looking filings, excuse me, such as the IRP provide long-term transparency for key stakeholders, which should provide more visibility regarding regulatory outcomes in the future. Outside the utility, we\u2019ll continue to operate our enterprises business with a low-risk mindset. When we couple our earnings contribution with contracted non-utility growth and prudent financial planning, you can see why we have confidence in our ability to continue to grow at 6% to 8% over the long term.","With that, Allison, please open the lines for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Arnold","Good morning, guys.","Rejji Hayes","Good morning, Jonathan.","Patti Poppe","Good morning, Jonathan.","Jonathan Arnold","And thank you for the update and good luck getting the \u2013 keeping everyone warm out there.","Patti Poppe","Given our best.","Jonathan Arnold","Just a quick \u2013 just Rejji, this might be for you, but I think you\u2019ve given us quite the granularity on timing of spend by segment, at least not recently. So can you perhaps help us see where the $1 billion of incremental electric investment installing, it looks like 2020 and 2021 are the peak spend years. But I\u2019m just not sure what those were before.","Rejji Hayes","Happy to do that. Yes, so you\u2019re right, we do crossed over the five-year period in 2021 and that has a lot to do with the renewables and the trajectors and giving them timing of the tax credits. But if you look at the $11 billion in our new five-year plan versus the $10 billion in our prior vintage, the real difference is, one, you\u2019ve got about $0.25 billion of renewables flowing through our electric supply spend and that again is the gas to the 15% RPS. And then you\u2019ve got about a commensurate increase in electric distribution and gas infrastructure and as we roll forward one year. So I\u2019d say it\u2019s a combination of those three things. Incremental renewables, electric distribution spend as we roll our five-year distribution plan one year forward and then an uptick in gas infrastructure spend. So it\u2019s really those three things, Jonathan.","Jonathan Arnold","So the revenue \u2013 I feel the renewables \u2013 $1 billion of renewables was already in the plan \u2013 the prior plan.","Rejji Hayes","We had it close to those levels. I\u2019d say we were probably about $0.25 billion south. We were in that zip code, but at the end of the day, we wanted to make sure that the renewables we had in the prior plan and this plan reflected what we\u2019re seeing in our renewable energy plans that we filed in the RFPs.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay. And it\u2019s a similar topic, last quarter, I think you said you were planning to give an update to the 10-year view on capital late \u2013 sometime later this year, you still think you\u2019ll do that and any sense of timing and what you\u2019re specifically waiting for before you do it.","Rejji Hayes","Yes. So we would foresee rolling out a new 10-year plan by the second half of this year as we mentioned in Q3 and prior to that, I think I mean the real gating item is, we see it, is the IRP. And so we\u2019re going to get most likely a preliminary point of view from the commission in April of this year. We get 60 days to respond to that. And so that will most likely play itself out by midyear at which point we\u2019ll have better visibility on our electric supply spend over the next 10 years, particularly in those outer years, because that\u2019s when you start to see a ramp-up of, I\u2019ll say, renewables-related spend.","So that\u2019s a key data point. And at the end of the day, we also have to spend a good deal of timing internally making sure that we can solve the customer affordability equation and would be irresponsible to roll out a capital plan that we couldn\u2019t when I say we, our customers and\/or our balance sheet couldn\u2019t afford. And so we want to get all of that math right before we roll it out. I can say with great confidence that the 18 billion that we rolled out in the prior vintage in September of 2017 is well stale and we expect it to be higher than that, but want to spend some more time figuring out how much higher.","Jonathan Arnold","I mean, would it be reasonable to think it would be more than double the five-year plan given the need to kind of \u2013 the compounding effects?","Rejji Hayes","It\u2019s premature to guide you at this point. We had said that, we think there\u2019s about a $3 billion capital investment opportunity in the IRP in the outer years. And so we would feel pretty comfortable saying that we will likely be included in the new plan. And also we\u2019ve talked about this sensitivity in the past, where basically every $60 million or 1% reduction we can achieve in rates creates about $400 million of incremental capital investment capacity. And so if you think about our PPAs rolling off, if you think about some of the cost savings we expect as we retire the coal fleet over time on O&M and fuel side, we do think it\u2019s going to create substantial headroom to accommodate additional spend. So I\u2019d hate to guide you at this point and give you a directional number, but we think it will certainly be in excess of $18 billion.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay. One final thing, how certain are you guys, you\u2019ll need to file another electric case in 2020? Is there a chance to get under the settlement you could potentially go longer?","Patti Poppe","I think given the needs of the system, it\u2019s likely that we will file in 2020, Jonathan. We have the settlement this year. We\u2019re so happy about it, because it does enable certainty in our reliability spend and we don\u2019t have to trade off with some of the other more variable programs that often compete for the capital dollars on reliability, because we have this new regulatory mechanism, but it isn\u2019t, we didn\u2019t sell for a full tracker. We do think there is a basis in this settlement for a tracker in the future, but we know that there is significant electric investment required and our cost effectiveness is captured there. So we think that we will definitely be filing in 2020.","Jonathan Arnold","Great. Thank you very much, guys.","Rejji Hayes","Thank you.","Patti Poppe","Thanks, Jonathan.","Operator","Our next question will come from Greg Gordon of Evercore. Please go ahead.","Greg Gordon","Thanks. Good morning.","Rejji Hayes","Good morning, Greg.","Patti Poppe","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon","Couple questions. I was just a tad late hopping on the call and I just missed hearing the rollup of the actuals for 2018 and you had commented that there was a reason as to why the corporate overheads came in higher than initially budgeted. What was that if you wouldn\u2019t mind restating that, please?","Rejji Hayes","Yes, happy to, Greg. It was largely due to the significant amount of reinvestment activity both in the operating and non-operating sides. So in corporate, you\u2019re going to have some of the non-operating related spend embedded in that. And so we took out at least two tranches of parent-related debt prematurely in 2018, $100 million remaining from our eight and three-quarter notes and then $300 million of the six handle note around midyear. And so a lot of those upfront costs flow through the corporate and other expense.","Greg Gordon","Okay. I know you\u2019ve been just refinancing at a lower rate, or are you diffusing that debt permanently?","Rejji Hayes","Combination of both.","Greg Gordon","Okay. And so I guess I wonder why\u2026","Rejji Hayes","Hang on, to be clear, sorry, just to circle back here, when you say diffusing, do you mean just taking out altogether...","Greg Gordon","Were you paying off or are you refinancing it?","Rejji Hayes","No, we\u2019re refinancing, just to be clear. So we\u2019re extending maturities at a much lower cost.","Greg Gordon","Okay. I guess what\u2019s driving the \u2013 if that\u2019s sort of a one-time expense to prepay the debt, what\u2019s driving the assumption of a flat corporate overhead number this year?","Rejji Hayes","Well, the reality is we\u2019ve been so proactive over the last several years in taking out, I\u2019ll say, high coupon bonds that there really are too many opportunities left in the portfolio. So credit to Sri and his team for their wonderful prefunding efforts, but if you look at the rest of portfolio both of the parent and the operating company, you really see four and five handles and I don\u2019t think we have maybe one six-handle left, but we\u2019ve done a nice job. So, I don\u2019t foresee too many opportunities to prefund at attractive level. So, that\u2019s why we\u2019re being fairly conservative in the year-over-year corporate.","Greg Gordon","Okay. And then my second question was your FFO to debt came in at 18.5% for 2018, you\u2019ve told us the expectation is that\u2019s going to be around 17% in 2019. What\u2019s driving that delta? And do you expect movement in your FFO to debt metrics post 2019 up or down in any meaningful way?","Rejji Hayes","Yeah, I would say it\u2019s a couple of things. And so first, we talked about the prescribed pace at which the effects of tax reform are being passed onto customers and so we initially assumed at the beginning of 2018 that we have an outflow around, call, roughly $200 million and that\u2019s both sort of credits A and B to reflect the reduction in the current rate that flows through base rates from 35% down to 21%. And then we thought there may be resolution on the deferred tax-related refund to customers. That obviously has \u2013 was a little bit too aggressive in assumption.","And so the fully adjudicated process will extend well into 2019. And so we had about, I\u2019ll say, $150 million of upside from an OCF perspective in 2018, because the outflows back to customers did not occur during this year. Now, there is no P&L effect. But there certainly is a cash flow impact. So we expect there will be a headwind in the form of giving those dollars back to customers in 2019. And so that\u2019s, I\u2019d say, the largest source of the variance year-over-year.","And then what you also see, two, is just the reality, as we\u2019re increasing our annual run rate for capital investments. So we\u2019re going from $2 billion a year at the utility to $2.25 billion and so funding that also has credit metric implications and we also still assuming, that the equity, ratio at the utility is at that sort of 52.5% level. And so that\u2019s going to require infusions from the parent down there. And we do debt fund a portion of that. And so that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving us to that 18.5% or thereabouts down to, what I\u2019ll say is approximately 17% in 2019. And we expect to stay at that level for the foreseeable future. Is that helpful?","Greg Gordon","That\u2019s extremely helpful. Thank you. Have a great day.","Rejji Hayes","You too, Greg. Take care.","Operator","Our next question will come from Michael Weinstein of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Michael Weinstein","Hi, good morning, guys. So could you talk a little bit about the equity issuance needs of $150 million a year? I guess that\u2019s a long-term plan and how that differs from the $70 million, like what\u2019s the increment between those two?","Rejji Hayes","Yeah, sure. So similar to what I described in terms of the variance in our FFO to debt metrics year-over-year, it\u2019s really \u2013 it\u2019s few things, Michael. It\u2019s again the increase in our capital spend rate. So our run rate historically has been about $2 billion or at least over the last couple of years and now will be at $2.25 billion with an increase in the new five-year vintage of $11 billion in total. So assuming about $2.25 billion per year at the utility. So that\u2019s going to drive our sort of leverage-related needs and our equity needs as well.","And then again we\u2019re assuming that our equity component of our rate-making capital structure will stay at 52.5%. And so that\u2019s going to lead to fairly substantial equity infusions from the parent into the utility, most of which we fund with equity issuances. And so you have a couple things there. And then the other reality is to in 2018 again, we did not have a significant an outflow for tax reform back to customers as we had anticipated and so we didn\u2019t issue as much equity in 2018. And so some of that will flow into future years.","And so we assume again we\u2019re going to \u2013 run rate will be about $150 million per year of planned equity issuance. We will be proactive about that as we can. So we did a good deal of forwards in the fourth quarter of last year, while we thought our stock was at a relatively attractive price and so we\u2019ve taken a lot of the price risk off the table in 2019 and we\u2019ll see where we end up going forward, but we think that that\u2019s a reasonable level if you\u2019re doing $150 million per year and you look at that as a percentage of market cap, we definitely think that that\u2019s doable in an ATM program.","Michael Weinstein","Got you. And looking at the DIG slide, in the old slides, right, you had $75 million opportunity from a $7.50 capacity price getting out into the future and now it looks like it\u2019s $95. Is there \u2013maybe I just misunderstood why that I don\u2019t know if you explain that before. Maybe could you explain it again?","Rejji Hayes","No, I mean the math that we have, it really is looking at just the potential opportunity that you would have. If you have either a local clearing requirement established in Michigan and we stink the jury quite literally is still out on that, or just given the tightening we expect in the bilateral capacity markets as you see inevitable coal retirements in the zone 7 and throughout the region and so the math is basically rolled forward a year. We\u2019re assuming somewhere around $7.50 and that coupled with the extension and amendment of existing energy contracts with some of our big contracts.","DIG is really what\u2019s fueling a little bit of that incremental upside, but needless to say, we have not incorporated that into our plan. We are assuming what you see on the page here for 2019 about a run rate of $35 million of pre-tax income that we think will last for the foreseeable future. And as you probably noted in the table above, we really have derisked the portfolio a good deal, by amending and extending energy contracts and selling forward capacity fairly ratably over the last several months.","Michael Weinstein","So a lot of the upside \u2013 or a lot of the benefits, reason why it\u2019s more stable for energy, there\u2019s energy contracting, even though the capacity pricing has been softer.","Rejji Hayes","That\u2019s right.","Michael Weinstein","That\u2019s reasonable. Okay. Thank you.","Rejji Hayes","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, good morning. This is actually Eric on for Julian. But I just wanted to ask if you could discuss progress on the IRP filing thus far, and what could drive further confidence in renewables spend beyond that $1 billion IRP through 2021 in the current plan, specifically with the remainder of the solar ITC safe harbor period in 2022 and 2023 ? Thank you.","Patti Poppe","Hey, good morning, Eric. We\u2019re making good progress in the IRP, as I\u2019m sure everyone knows where the first IRP to be filed and process here in Michigan. The hard work that we did to get lots of stakeholder input before we filed has made for very constructive discussions throughout the process, because it is a complicated process. We are planning on it and going to its full regulatory timeline, which would be first preliminary order from the commission in April and then a final order in June. And we\u2019re looking forward to working through the remainder of that process.","To your question about additional renewables to the plan, what we have in the plan right now reflects no additional incremental renewables as a result of the IRP that would be premature to do before we have a final order in that. So right now, what we have built into the plan is meeting the renewable portfolio standard through our RAP.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks. And then just regarding 2022 and 2023, presumably I know you mentioned customer affordability type of equation, if you were to have supportive IRP result, could we potentially see incremental renewables spend in 2022 and 2023 supported by, say, lower fuel cost replacement and whatnot?","Patti Poppe","You know the driver for the renewables is demand on the system and what\u2019s required both to meet the law, but also to meet the needs of customers for their demand for energy. There is \u2013 we do \u2013 we have published our time line of retirements of our coal plants and we also do have the retirement of the PPAs, but in the 2023 time horizon. The power of sales PPA that comes off doesn\u2019t require additional capacity to backfill it. We\u2019ve replaced it with energy efficiency, demand response and other sources in the short run. So I don\u2019t think that would drive incremental renewables in that time horizon.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Ali Agha of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ali Agha","Thank you. Good morning.","Patti Poppe","Good morning, Ali.","Rejji Hayes","Good morning, Ali.","Ali Agha","Good morning. First question, just looking at your quarterly disclosure on weather-normalized sales. On the electric side, I mean the electric sales weather normalized were negative in three of the last four quarters, ended up negative for the year. Just wondering what\u2019s kind of driving that and can you just remind us what you assumed for weather-normalized electric sales going forward ?","Rejji Hayes","Sure, Ali. I will not try to spend too much time on the soapbox around the imperfections and shortcomings of weather normalized math, but I do think that is flowing through the numbers, particularly if you take into account the stark contrast between weather in 2017 and 2018. So I would start there, but then as you look at just numbers that are on the page putting that aside. And so we are approximately 0.5% down blended for electric for 2018 and it\u2019s really important to note that that customer usage level reflects our efforts to reduce customer usage year-over-year through energy efficiency, where we get compensated to do that.","And so we\u2019ve been at this for now about 10 years if you go back to the prior Energy Law in 2008, and so now it\u2019s a 1.5% bogey, and we expect to clear that and we\u2019ve cleared it the last year and we expect to clear it this year as well and so you\u2019ll see that flowing through 2018. So what does that mean. So when you\u2019re negative 0.5% on a blended basis for electric, if your gross it up, you\u2019re about 1% for electric and so we still think that on a normalized load basis is comparable to what most folks are seeing across the country.","And then if you peel the onion a little bit and you look at residential, it was down about 0.3%. So you gross that up, you\u2019re up over 1%. Commercial was up about 0.3%. Again, gross that up, you\u2019re down over \u2013 you\u2019re up a little under 2%. And so we still see pretty good trends there and I think what\u2019s also important to notice that, if you look at the economic conditions in our service territory, they still remain quite good, and so we always point to Grand Rapids, that\u2019s in the heart of our electric service territory and you pick a metric whether it\u2019s GDP, unemployment, population growth, building permits, all of those statistics are trending better than the national average. And so we continue to feel quite good about the economic conditions in our service territory.","So, yes, the numbers I think on the surface may appear a little suboptimal, but again we think there\u2019s a lot more to it. You asked about going forward, we assume roughly flat over the planned period at the utility, again, weather normalized and net of energy efficiency. So, I\u2019d say, we\u2019re \u2013 our expectations are relatively tempered and then the IRP, which spans over a longer period, we\u2019re assuming about a quarter of a percent. So, again we plan very conservatively. And the last thing, I\u2019ll say, is we also aren\u2019t reactive when it comes to normalized load growth expectations. We have very prosperous economic development programs and Patty highlighted in your planned remarks that we hit 100 megawatts in 2018, up from 69 megawatts the prior year and so we really feel like we\u2019re doing all we can to support economic development and our service territory certainly relative to other service territories across the country looks quite good.","Ali Agha","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Second question, perhaps for Patti as well, I mean you\u2019ve got a new Governor obviously in place now. By the middle of the year, you will have two new Commissioners out of three. Just wondering how you\u2019re thinking about the regulatory framework in the state? And do you expect any changes once all of this is settled going forward?","Patti Poppe","Well, we are looking forward to learning the Governor\u2019s plans on our current open position at the commission with Commissioner Saari and Commissioner Talberg there, that\u2019s six more months of that quorum, and with the addition then of a new Commissioner, we look forward to that appointment. I would say that one of the strengths of the Michigan regulatory environment is that it\u2019s captured in the statute and so our energy law that was passed originally in 2008 and then further improved in 2016 provides a lot of continuity in regulatory planning.","And so we do have a great working relationship with the new Governor, many of her staffs are people we\u2019ve worked within the past and so we\u2019re quite optimistic that she\u2019ll make great appointments to the commission and we\u2019ll look forward to working with them, and like our track record has been independent of Commissioner changes, Governor changes, economic changes, weather changes, we have the core capability of adapting to those changing conditions. We have a lot of confidence in our ability to adjust and adapt as necessary.","Ali Agha","Okay. And lastly kind of related to that, my understanding is through because of term limits, there has been a fair amount of turnover in the legislature as well. As you look out over this session or even beyond, anything in particular for us to keep an eye on, or that you\u2019re keeping an eye on anything that could either tweak or change the energy law in any way, any expectations on that front?","Patti Poppe","Well, we \u2013 you\u2019re right, Ali. We have term limits and Michigan was a good concept in practice, it\u2019s pretty difficult, because we do have a lot of turnover. The good news is, it took a lot to pass the 2016 energy law. It was bipartisan wide support. We have two strong committees in both the House and the Senate. We\u2019re really excited about the leadership appointments in both the House and the Senate. And so, as far as we are hearing from the legislative leadership both from the Governor\u2019s office as well as the Senate and the House, they\u2019ve got other very important issues that need to be attended to, no-fault auto insurance, the road, education in Michigan are really taking top priority for the current legislature and the Governor. And we\u2019re happy to work with them and help make those improvements, but I think the general consensus is the energy law that was passed in 2016 was a great and difficult body of work. And so, it\u2019s really still in the implementation phase of that law and we don\u2019t expect changes to it in the short run.","Ali Agha","Got it. Thank you.","Patti Poppe","Yep, you\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question will come from Praful Mehta of Citigroup. Please, go ahead.","Praful Mehta","Thanks so much. Hi, guys.","Patti Poppe","Hey, Praful.","Rejji Hayes","Hey, Praful.","Praful Mehta","Hi. So, maybe first just on this extreme weather events, right, whether it be 2018 summer or now the winter and this polar vortex, just trying to understand, if these kind of events continue, does that fit within the IRP and the load planning that you have, do you think it changes any of the infrastructure needs and does that change potentially the growth profile? So any color on that or thought around that would be helpful?","Patti Poppe","Well, so specifically on the electric side, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking about, the IRP, first of all, has the ability to be refiled every three to five years. So, if we start to see a material load difference, then we would plan accordingly. I will say that even yesterday, for example, where MISO had issues in the Midwest. We were plus 1,000 megawatts in Michigan of supply. So, our planned forecast IRP that we published, I think, reflects a very conservative perspective about being able to deal with the kind of peaks that occur on the electric system. And on the gas system, I think traditionally our system is well equipped and capable of serving this volume of load.","Our interruption yesterday was driven by an equipment failure at our largest storage field, but normally under any kind of, even these extreme conditions, we would have been well equipped to serve that load. And in fact, yesterday morning, when we hit our peak load, our system works perfectly and we had ample supply and ample ability to deliver that supply and we\u2019ve not had to curtail any residential customers even to this unprecedented weather events with the shortfall of our Ray storage field included. So, very proud of the team and how we\u2019re handling the situation, but the system definitely is robust and prepared for the future.","Praful Mehta","Got it. That\u2019s a super helpful color and great performance by infrastructure. So, that\u2019s phenomenal. Maybe moving on, more on the financial side, the pension funding aspect in \u2013 you had $240 million in 2018, could you remind us is there any plan to have any incremental funding in 2019 that\u2019s just currently in your plan, or is there any need to fund 2019 or 2020?","Rejji Hayes","Yes, there\u2019s currently no obligation based on the funded status to fund the pension in 2019. We basically pulled forward about $100 million of required spend in 2019 through this contribution in December of 2018. So, I think at least for 2019, there is not an expected contribution. 2020, I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s one either, but we think that we derisk the plan most importantly, rather significantly by this discretionary contribution in 2018.","Praful Mehta","Got you. Thanks, Rejji. And then in terms of parent and other, obviously, there was a big move, just to understand that impact on parent and other, you clarified that this was mostly related with one-time costs of refinancing and taking out older debt with more obviously cost-efficient debt at the parent level. Is that the entire impact or are there other impacts at the parent level that we should be aware of?","Rejji Hayes","Well, I think in addition to the proactive refinancings, which have associated make-whole costs. I mean obviously every year because the business is growing and we\u2019re funding capital investments, we will have incremental increases in parent debt, which is basically new money financing that we do each year. And so we did issue some hybrids in like a couple of tranches in 2018. So, you\u2019ll see interest \u2013 incremental interest expense associated with. So that\u2019s another source of drag that you see in the corporate.","Praful Mehta","Got you. And that 2019 level that you have, is that the expected level of interest expense at the parent and the EPS at the parent, is that expected to stay flat from there? Or how do you see the parent earnings going forward post 2019?","Rejji Hayes","Yes. I mean, well, remember you got a few things in there. And so we\u2019ll expect incremental interest expense given the growth of the business. And so you\u2019ll have that flowing through the parent and clearly that\u2019s non-recoverable. We do have also a little bit of drag that we talked about in our Q4 call of last year and that\u2019s because of the impacts of federal tax reform, where just the net deductions that you get at that level just aren\u2019t worth as much as they were previously, but I think the other impact too is that we have EnerBank flowing through those numbers. And so that will also be impacting the parent and other expense, because EnerBank is a component of that. And as we always have talked about in the past, we do expect that EnerBank will grow in excess of the consolidated business. And see a little \u2013 you see that as a little bit of an offset of those other, I\u2019ll say, sources of drag.","Praful Mehta","Got you. Thanks so much guys. Really appreciate it.","Rejji Hayes","Thank you, Praful.","Patti Poppe","Thanks, Praful.","Operator","Our next question will come from Travis Miller of Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Travis Miller","Good morning. Thank you.","Rejji Hayes","Good morning.","Patti Poppe","Good morning, Travis.","Travis Miller","I was wondering if you talk a little bit about some of the puts and takes, how you think you achieve that settlement deal when you\u2019ve had some issues trying to do that in the past, what was the key with that settlement?","Patti Poppe","Well, I think there are a couple of things that were critical to the settlement. We\u2019re very proud of the fact that we were able to settle that, but I think it\u2019s a reflection of the quality of the regulatory environment. As we have mentioned over the last couple years with Chairman Sally Talberg at the Public Service Commission, she has done an excellent job of building the quality staff, nothing raised the bar for the quality of our filings, the request of a five-year electric distribution plan combined with the visibility that the commission and the staff had on our integrated resource plan.","You can imagine their ability to see how our filing fits into those long-term plans is a much better way to do good regulation and make good decisions on behalf of the citizens of Michigan. So I would attribute it to a lot of hard work by our team to have good long-term plans. Our request by the commission to see those plans and have them be public, so that we can have good discussions with critical stakeholders and then a willingness to make good decisions together and have a settlement for the best interest of all customers. So, very happy with that outcome. I think it really sets the ground and the framework for future orders as well as future cases regarding our electric investment strategy and cost savings that we can pass along to customers through those filings.","Travis Miller","Okay. Great. And then one other on the whole electric rate case In general. What kind of distribution upgrades either in \u2013 that were approved in the rate case or future would be needed to integrate the level of renewables. Is there anything at the distribution level and perhaps how much and what would be needed in terms of grid upgrades to integrate?","Patti Poppe","Yes. Of course, that definitely will have a key eye on the distributed energy resources and how to integrate those into the grid. I would suggest in this filing, It\u2019s more about the basic blocking and tackling of poles and conductors and substations, transformers, making sure that the equipment that is on the system is robust and reliable. Our five-year electric distribution plan is a $3 billion investment strategy that has more of the high technology attributes at the latter half of the five-year plan.","So, including better visibility through SCADA systems on the distribution system, our ability to have control remotely, our ability to see the operations of the grid to do more looping and smart switching on the system, all of those investments are throughout the five-year plan, but more back-end-weighted.","So, this specific settlement really is focused on the backbone and the basics of the electric distribution system. I often say you can\u2019t put fancy whizbang technology on poles that are falling over. So, make sure we\u2019ve got the poles secure. We\u2019ve got the right conductor, transformer, substations and then we\u2019ll bolt on the technology to the best service of customers throughout the distribution plan.","Travis Miller","Okay. Great. Look forward to the whizbang technology.","Patti Poppe","We do too. I know it\u2019s going to make operating drill a lot easier, but first thing is first. Thanks, Travis.","Travis Miller","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from David Fishman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","David Fishman","Hi. Good morning. Congrats on another solid year.","Patti Poppe","Thank you.","Rejji Hayes","Thank you.","David Fishman","Thanks. Just following up on the regulatory items that we\u2019re talking about, it seems like when I was reading a little bit of staff testimony, it was actually pretty favorable with regarding earnings sharing mechanism. I know this is meant to coincide with a tracker. But I was just curious if this is something in a future filing, you might pursue separate from a tracker.","Patti Poppe","I think what we believe about this current electric rate case settlement is that this deferred accounting that we agreed to really is a first step in the direction of tracker \u2013 of a tracker for future filings. And so that again, comes with as we build trust. We have a tracking mechanism for example on the gas system for our enhanced infrastructure replacement program. And over the last couple years, we\u2019ve done a great job of doing precisely what we said we would do and that gives confidence then to the commission that they can do preapprovals in a more routine formulaic tracking mechanism, but we\u2019re quite satisfied with this outcome of the settlement and we think it foretells well future filings.","David Fishman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Andrew Weisel of Scotia Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Andrew Weisel","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just first I want to clarify something; I think Rejji answered in an answer to Ali\u2019s question about demand growth. I think you said you\u2019re expecting flat, maybe up a 0.25%, but in your Slide 16, you showed 1% growth from sales and economic developments. How do I reconcile those, is that purely energy efficiency?","Rejji Hayes","Yes. So, long-term over the five years, we expect flat to a 0.25% for growth. So that is first and foremost. I am referring to the five-year period, but this page often, I think, is a source of confusion. When we talk about sales growth and the simple perhaps unique model slide, Slide 19 that you reference, we\u2019re not suggesting that long-term we\u2019re expecting 1% sales growth. What we\u2019re talking about on that page is how much sales growth contributes to the self-funding strategy.","And so when you look at the pieces, we say cost reductions two to three points. That means cost reductions fund half of our capital investment or rate base growth to alleviate the burden to customers. And so sales is a component of that equation as is tax planning as is non-utility contribution. And so those are the pieces that allow us to fund about three quarters in aggregate of our rate base growth. So we can keep total rates, customer prices, bills at or below inflation and so it\u2019s a little bit difficult to fall the way it\u2019s positioned on that page. But we\u2019re not implying 1% growth in long term.","Andrew Weisel","Got it. Okay. And then just to follow up on the sales side, any updated thinking with marijuana now legal, have you seen any activity around Grillhouse\u2019s increased demand, and if and when this could turn into a meaningful driver or could it add complexity of demand unexpectedly spikes in house or warehouse, without you guys getting sufficient warning?","Patti Poppe","Yeah, those are all great questions. And we are working on evaluating what the effect will be from what we\u2019ve seen from other jurisdictions anywhere from 1% to 4% additional load as a result of the legalization of marijuana has been experienced elsewhere. We\u2019re not forecasting that in our plan yet at all. The regulations are still being defined and clarified, and they are slightly different than other states. We are the only state in the Midwest and so there is a potential that it could be a driver here.","We\u2019re actually working very proactively to identify who those growers would be. We\u2019ve had inbound contacts from large growing entities that want to come and locate here and \u2013 which is great because if we have advanced notice, then we can plan where best to place that new quickly growing loads. So we definitely haven\u2019t built into anything into our plan. But we are actively working with the growing community to make sure that we are prepared to serve.","Andrew Weisel","Great. And then one just last one here in terms of the gas storage. So obviously you\u2019ve asked customers to conserve usage during this cold snap. My question is, how are gas storage levels going into this week\u2019s polar vortex, and in the past, have there been instances where the reservoirs ran dry or close to it, and how did that work mechanically?","Patti Poppe","Yes, no, we had ample supply. In fact, our storage fields were perfectly prepared and ready to serve even peak demand that\u2019s early in the season. So certainly we have abundant supply. If a day like this happened in April, that would be a challenge to the system, because our annual cycle is to draw off the field throughout the winter season. However, we had ample supply. The disruption at our Ray storage field was the equipment that is able to then deliver the stored gas to the system. And so that\u2019s where the bottleneck was yesterday and today, but it certainly wasn\u2019t lack of abundance of gas.","We have some of the largest naturally occurring storage fields in the nation, in the continent right here in Michigan, and so we have ample supply, it was just a matter of getting it distributed effectively.","Andrew Weisel","Great to hear. Stay warm, I see mixed and feels like it is negative 32 in Jackson. So I guess I can\u2019t complain about five degrees in New York. Good luck.","Patti Poppe","Yes. We\u2019re definitely setting records in demand. There is no doubt about it. Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.","Shahriar Pourreza","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Patti Poppe","Hey, morning, Shahriar.","Shahriar Pourreza","Apologize if this was covered, it\u2019s unfortunate to harp on a little bit late. Just in your sort of IRP discussions right now that you\u2019re going through. Is there sort of any dialog or any movement around potentially earning on the PPAs? I mean I know obviously your interest would be to own, but is there still an option right now turn on the PPAs?","Patti Poppe","Yes. And if you read the staffs filing, they did not have object to the earnings mechanism. They just had a different formula, which yielded a much lower earnings mechanism on top of the PPA, but like all things, that has definitely opened for negotiation. The staff also filed that we would be able to own 50% of the supply.","So there\u2019s lots of room, I would suggest. What I appreciate very much is that all of the stakeholders have been working together for the best integrated resource plan for Michigan. This is a long-term plan. It has long-term ramifications. Some of the current methods of people being able to, for example, purpose solar being added to the system at uncompetitive prices not in the best interest of customers, even though we are fully supportive of additional solar being added to the system.","So we think that integrated resource plan has created a great framework. Our willingness to offer a market-driven avoided cost calculation through competitive bidding creates the open platform for this earnings mechanism, so that a developer who is leveraging our balance sheet. The cost of that impact on our balance sheet is adequately reflected in their bid is we think a very constructive framework and we like the direction of the conversations that have been happening here with all the critical stakeholders. So I would suggest that we\u2019re making good progress.","Shahriar Pourreza","And then just want to confirm this is incremental to your plan, right, so when you think about your planning inceptions on how you guide. This is something that would be incremental?","Patti Poppe","You know, we would say, yes, it would be incremental. But don\u2019t forget, we always are working toward that 6% to 8%, right, and so everything we do is in for the purpose of solidifying our consistent, repeatable, reliable performance. And so all of these outcomes add up to a total picture, it is predictable in total and that\u2019s what we know you love about us and that\u2019s what we really work toward every day.","Shahriar Pourreza","Noted. And then just one last question, Patti, and then it\u2019s a little bit of message left more of a minor, question is just around not getting the tracker, at least potentially punting it. Did that impact at all as you think about your 10-year plan that we\u2019ll see very shortly. Did that impact the profile of the spend at all?","Patti Poppe","No, because, again, we\u2019re pretty happy about the agreement and the settlement, because it does create a framework for our long-term trackers, but we didn\u2019t plan on long-term trackers. We don\u2019t object to coming in annually and describing what our spend plan is, and that in fact allows us to be more adaptive to changing conditions. And we\u2019re pretty satisfied with that arrangement.","So we were very happy with the outcome of the settlement and not to say we wouldn\u2019t appreciate more formulaic rate making, but we are all Okay standing up to the scrutiny of an annual filing as well.","Shahriar Pourreza","Okay. Great. Thanks so much. All my questions have been answered. Have a good one.","Patti Poppe","Great. Thanks. Thanks, Shahriar.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session.

Rao","Good morning and thank you for joining us today. With me are John Russell, President and Chief Executive Officer and Tom Webb, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on our website.","This presentation contains forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements should be considered in the context of the risks and other factors detailed in our SEC filings. These factors could cause CMS Energy's and Consumers' results to differ materially.","This presentation also includes non-GAAP. A reconciliation of each of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is included in the appendix, as well as posted in the Investor section of our website.","Now let me turn the call over to John.","John Russell","Thanks, DV. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on our first quarter earnings call. I'll begin the presentation with an overview of the quarter, provide an update on energy legislation and turn the call over to Tom to discuss the results and outlook. Then as usual close with Q&A.","First quarter adjusted earnings per share were $0.73, down $0.02 compared to last year but up $0.04 or 7% on a weather-adjusted basis. In January our Board approved a 7.4% dividend increase, the ninth consecutive increase in as many years. The new annual dividend of $1.16 per share results in a competitive payout ratio of 62%. Today we're reaffirming our full-year adjusted EPS guidance of $1.86 to $1.89. This reflects our plan to grow 5% to 7% off last year's actual results.","Our improved safety performance that began in the second half of last year continued through the first quarter. Compared to last year's first quarter, safety improved 58%. Our electric and gas systems continue to perform well. On the gas side we had record sales in February. Capital investments in our electric system have resulted in improved reliability, the best in 10 years. Customer satisfaction has increased for both electric and gas business customers. And I'll talk more about these results in just a few minutes.","We also have a tentative five-year agreement with our union, pending ratification. The mutually beneficial contract will support a high level of customer service and increased investment in the gas business. Here you can get a sense of how we're investing heavily in the gas business. We already have one of the largest natural gas systems in the country and we plan to grow it to better serve our customers. Our 10-year plan calls for almost $6 billion of capital investment.","We plan on replacing 800 miles of main, installing nine new compressors and connecting 100,000 new customers. We have another $1 billion of opportunity to plan to grow this plan with more replacements conversions and supplying natural gas generators.","We're able to continue our investment in the gas business as falling natural gas prices create headroom and offset base rate increases. Over the last six years our customer's average bill has been cut by a third, falling from $3 to $2 a day, supported by natural gas fuel costs declining by 50%.","We've been able to do this by cycling our gas storage fields and filling them with low-price gas. As you look over the next five years we see customers' prices staying relatively flat as new investment is offset by cost reductions and low natural gas prices. We're in a good position to invest in the gas business, maintain a high level of system performance and deliver increased reliability with lower prices to our customers.","We're committed to providing our customers with exceptional value. Our dedication to improving customer satisfaction has moved us from fourth quartile to second quartile for electric and gas business customers and to first quartile for residential customers, a significant improvement over the last five years.","In 2016 we anticipate having all four segments in the first quartile, as we continue to focus on customer satisfaction by delivering the quality of service our customers expect. Customer satisfaction is an important element of our breakthrough thinking that leads to predictable and sustainable financial results.","As you know, Michigan is currently in the process of updating its energy law. The Governor is focused on adaptability over the long term as Michigan moves away from coal and more towards natural gas generation and renewable energy sources. His vision provides a constructive framework.","The Michigan Senate and House are currently developing and debating legislation. The bills we have seen range from full regulation to an increase in the cap. The Governor stated that he would like to see the cap remain unchanged but would require five years of firm forward capacity. He calls this fair choice. We look forward to working with the Governor and legislators on the energy policy and meeting Michigan's long term energy needs.","The Governor has established four pillars to make Michigan's energy more adaptable, affordable, reliable and environmentally sound. We support his vision and see many opportunities to achieve the state's energy goals. Our current energy efficiency program is working well and saving customers money. A continuation of this program with revenue recovery and the existing incentives would make the 15% elimination of energy waste attainable.","We fully support the Integrated resource plan process that would allow the regulated utilities to determine the most economic capacity plan. By providing our customers with enablers like our smart Energy program they will have more control over their energy usage and save money. Like the Governor we want to see the elimination of subsidies to a fair choice policy or full regulation without mandates and begin to address the looming capacity shortfalls facing the state.","MISO continues to predict a capacity shortfall in zone seven, Michigan's Lower Peninsula. We're nearing this reality as coal plants are shut down and excess capacity is eliminated next year. In order to begin addressing this we need a strong and supportive new energy law. The law will help the state meet its goals by eliminating waste, adding renewables and allowing the state to determine its energy future.","Now I'll turn the call over to Tom to review the quarter.","Tom Webb","Thanks, John. And thanks to each of you for joining our call today. As always, we deeply appreciate your interest in our company and for spending time with us on the call today. For the first quarter, our earnings were $0.73 a share on both a reported and an adjusted basis. This is $0.02 below last year and $0.04 or 7% above last year on a weather-normalized basis. All business units were well ahead of their plans with company results $0.21 better than budget.","As you can see here, the first quarter weather-normalized earnings up 7% and another cold winter O&M reinvestment is underway. Even with huge added costs of about $45 million or $0.08 a share associated with longer lives in the new mortality tables and lower discount rates, our continued cost reductions offset this and result in lower costs, down 3% from last year.","Our earnings per share forecast is already $0.17 ahead of plan. Please recall last year when we added substantial reliability work and still hit the top end of our 5% to 7% guidance. This year weather has helped $0.14 and our cost reductions, coupled with other improvements, are $0.04 ahead of plan.","Reinvestment underway includes increasing utility forestry work and accelerating a planned major outage at DIG from 2016 to 2015. This has the double benefit of pulling ahead the outage cost into 2015 when we have ample room to absorb it and freeing up capacity in what will be a very tight year in 2016. In addition, we plan to increase DIG's capacity by 38 megawatts. This will add further to profitability next year.","While we're on the subject of our business at the Dearborn industrial generation facility, here's an update on both capacity and energy. The opportunity to increase capacity-related profits by $20 million to $40 million already has been enhanced. Just recently we added a new nine-year capacity contract at a price that nearly doubled what we had assumed in our forecast.","In addition, we're adding a new long term seven-year energy contract for one of our two combined cycle units that could improve profits by more than $5 million a year. This is in progress. The good news here is that we're beginning to realize benefits from the layering in strategy for capacity, as well as energy, enhancing the upside potential at DIG by as much as $25 million to $50 million a year with long term contracts. Patience is paying off.","The outlook for our utility service territory in Michigan continues to be healthy. Whether it's building permits, GDP growth, population growth or unemployment, we continue to outperform Michigan overall as well as the U.S. average. First quarter sales were up nicely, continuing to support our outlook for full-year sales increases of 3% for industrial customers and 1% overall. First quarter industrial sales are below the full-year forecast but that's as expected, reflecting a ramp-up at several customers during the year. In fact, the full-year outlook is about 3% but we prefer to keep the forecast at a conservative level.","Please remember that our earnings growth is not predicated on sales growth or cost reductions. Upsides from these are intended for our customers. Even without any upside our capital investment over the next 10 years will be 45% greater than the last 10 years. The opportunity to increase that investment by as much as $5 billion to over $20 billion continues to be practical, particularly when many of the investment opportunities can be included without increasing customer bills.","There is a lot of work ahead but none of it represents big bets that put the company at risk. Capital spending projects are progressing well. For example, we're 40% through our Smart Energy meter rollout. And this has been a terrific project to re-introduce ourselves with each and every one of our customers.","Our environmental spending, primarily to address clean air standards, is 85% complete. We still have work ahead replacing gas mains and distribution systems and we're 15% along the way. We've upgraded compressor stations and we're halfway through the work to replace compressors to maximize efficiency at our gas storage fields. As an LDC, remember, we have the largest storage fields in the nation. And our project to upgrade our pump storage facility at Ludington, the fourth largest in the world, is nearly at the halfway spending mark. This project will provide a 16% improvement to capacity.","A lot of our capital investment enables us to reduce O&M cost and these are down 10% since 2006. And we will reduce these costs another 7% by 2019. As we switch from coal plants, which require a substantial number of people to run, to gas and wind farms, which require about 10% of the work force needed to run coal, we'll be reducing our O&M costs by over $30 million.","By continuing our program to harden our pole tops we will reduce future storm-related damage and we'll capitalize rather than expense that work. This results in lower O&M costs, spreading costs to our customers over a longer period of time. In addition, natural attrition, a variety of quality-enhancing productivity actions and Smart Energy meters will help us reduce our costs substantially. And that's down 3% last year and 3% more this year.","Here is our sensitivity chart that we provide each quarter to assist you with assessing our prospects. We've added capital investment and O&M cost metrics to permit you to assess just how much these opportunities might be worth. And here's our report card for 2015.","Obviously with the Arctic blast we're well ahead on earnings. We will, however, work to put this surplus to good use with even more reliability improvements for our utility customers and accelerated outages to enhance our outlook for 2016. You'll note that we've graded ourselves with green checks on all metrics and a double check on earnings per share growth. While we're not increasing our guidance beyond 5% to 7%, I suspect that our performance so far this year, coupled with our track record over the last decade, probably gives you a pretty good sense that we feel pretty comfortable.","Continuing our mindset that focuses on customers and investors permits us to perform well. We hope you agree. We're now in our 13th year of premium earnings and dividend growth and we plan to continue this performance for some time.","Thank you very much for your interest and your time today. We look forward to taking your questions, so, operator, would you please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Your line is open.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So I wanted to first dig into the Michigan side of the equation. In terms of the fair choice on the cap, what percent of your customers as you understand the current proposal, would come back to you versus opt to choose the five-year capacity compliance mechanisms?","John Russell","Well basically where we're at now, Julien on that, that's just a proposal that's out there. The first choice or the fair choice aspect what the Governor is looking for is that he doesn't want subsidies from our existing utility customers to pay for the capacity that's used as a backup for the retail open access customers. So, a little too soon to tell on that, but basically if it works the way he's thinking, what would happen is they would have to show the firm capacity five years out so that we would not be responsible for supplying that capacity.","And based on that, it depends what the market is going to be. I think the numbers we have today -- we've got about 300 customers or about 0.2% of our customers that are on retail open access. It's hard for me to access what their contracts are like or what the market's like, but as you saw in some of the capacity auction results from the MISO market, some of the deregulated states are a little bit higher than the regulated states. So, it would be up to them to determine the best deal that they have.","Tom Webb","And let me just add one thought, Julien and I'm not sure your question was going this way, but what we've experienced in the past is when the market changes which this could be a part of we saw about 80% to 90% of that load come back over a period of time say a year or two years this could be a little different depending on the duration of their contracts as John just said but I think the economics will push them our way along with the potential policy change.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent and then looking at the DIG site of the equation in terms of adding the 38 megawatt what's the timing and cost of that by chance?","Tom Webb","Will remember we just described that pull ahead. In our presentation today where we were telling you that we're taking an outage that we plan to take in 2016 actually in the fall of 2015 so will have that in place this year that 38 megawatts in that cost of about $8 million to $9 million is part of that pull ahead which includes that upgrade and you won't see that repeated of course in 2016. So the money is being invested this year about 8 million to 9 million for the outage and the upgrade altogether with the benefit accruing to us next year.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And then the new contract on the nine-year capacity deal that\u2019s annualized at that same rate every year?","Tom Webb","That's correct.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","What kind of customer is it just by chance?","Tom Webb","Well because as you noticed I mentioned we\u2019re in the progress of doing that I don't want to mention the customer's name, I don't think that would be appropriate. You wouldn't be surprised about who that customer is and the duration that we're looking at here on this contract will probably be about seven years.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","It's not the same counterparty to the nine-year capacity as the seven-year.","Tom Webb","So you're working your way into a name, but the answer is no and that's probably as far as I should go.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Dan Eggers","John just going back to the legislation conversation, I guess which bills are most consistent with what the governor has on offer right now and how organized the legislature is to get this done in a timely fashion.","John Russell","I'll start with the last first the timing of this, I mean the Governor has targeted it for June. I think it's possible but it's pretty aggressive. And I think that's going to be dependent primarily on a non-related topic which is a ballot proposal to improve the roads in Michigan. If that doesn't get past I think the legislators are going to be more focused on the budget than energy for maybe the summer.","So expected to be done by year-end but it may not be done by the middle of the year. And as far as where the bills are they are pretty much across the Board. The house is full regulation, the bill has been set and the house is full regulation. The Senate has two bills one is to increase the cap and one is to ensure that the customers who are on retail open access have a one-time shot at going to the market and they can't come back.","So when you look at how that is and what I mentioned earlier about where the Governor is it looks like the top end of this or the worst-case scenario would be 10% with a firm capacity position that they have to disclose to a regulator going forward. And maybe the best case for us would be full regulation but I don't think it would happen all at once and maybe Julian's question kind of related to that is that I think we would see this come back, Tom, mentioned we saw a big jump the last time we went through this but it's going to take time. I don't think it's going to be all at once because I believe and I don't have the data for this but the contracts that the third parties enter into with our customers for retail open access probably have a duration of a year or two. So I don't think any legislation would stop those contracts from being in effect.","Dan Eggers","John, beyond the choice issues where do you think things settle out on renewables and is there going to be a window where the increase renewable standard and you guys have a bigger stake of that or how you think that parts going to play into the legislation as well?","John Russell","Yes, I think that will end up as a part of an Integrated Resource Plan. I think that's where the kind of the tone is going today rather than mandate a certain percent I think where they would go is more of putting it to an IRP putting it towards a more Integrated Resource Plan that maybe long in 10 year [ph] with the ability to seek approval on a multi-year basis for changes that may occur. And to be more specific as you seen gas prices drop substantially over the past five years if we did in Integrated Resource Plan 10 years ago gas probably wouldn't be a preferred option. ","However with gas prices the way they are today they are a preferred option, so you want that -- as the Governor calls it adaptability with changing technologies, changing commodity prices to go back in in the interim of that long term plan to be able to adjust the plan, get an agreement with the regulators and move forward with that type of generation.","And Dan, for your point it's also going to include renewable energy, energy optimization and all that. The Integrated Resource Plan will cover the spectrum not just the supply aspect but how we get the supply, what fuel source and how we do energy optimization. And this thing that I like about it is that if we do that it also show the most economic plan, we will put forth the most economic plan for our customers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Greg Gordon","I just wanted to circle back to the commentary on capacity, so I'm looking at page 14. So you're saying you were at less than $0.50 capacity that your forecast is that you're currently expecting to earn around $2 in capacity? Or did you say that you\u2019ve come in based on this new capacity contract ahead of the forecast on this page.","Tom Webb","That's right. So when you're looking at the bar that has below it $2.00 that's our old forecast and then on the little box on the right side you'll see near-term. We're looking at numbers around $4.50 and that's our reference to doubling for that similar period. And over the long term we're looking at if you average it over the whole period around $3.30 so that gives you some benchmarks. To your specific question we've got $2.00 in our numbers but you can see we\u2019re about to revise those and go up.","Greg Gordon","Okay and that time period -- over what forecast period do we average go from $2.00 to $4.50 and average $3.30 from [indiscernible]?","Tom Webb","$4.50 would be near-term, so you're going to look at the next couple of years. In the long term is over a nine-year outlook.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Paul Ridzon","The $8 million that you're spending at DIG this year that's not -- it's an unregulated asset. So is that capitalized or is that going to be O&M?","Tom Webb","Just think of that as a regular non-utility business. So the part that\u2019s capitalized is capitalized and the part that\u2019s expense is expense in the project. Just try not to think utility for a minute and it will look very normal that way. The bulk of it candidly is going to be expensed, that goes in for this year but as you can see we have plenty of room to put it in.","Paul Ridzon","So the net impact on '16 is an $18 million swing because you're avoiding that capital expense next year and you're picking up the $10 million?","Tom Webb","You can do that math that way but I would caution you not to because remember we're taking the good news this year that's happening unrelated to it to fit it in. So your base didn't change. And then next year yes we had planned to spend about $10 million which we won't need to. But if we've got some head room next year what do you think we will do?","Paul Ridzon","Host a big party for analyst.","John Russell","What's your second choice Paul?","Tom Webb","No, we will find a way as you've grown accustomed to see us get in that growth of earnings of 5% to 7% no matter what. If it's easy or hard and I may as well take the question on before it comes. We've got so much work to do on the reliability side in the utility that I would just tell you there will be a time when we won't and maybe the 5% to 7% will drift up a little bit. Again I would get excited about it because we've got plenty of work to do this year and we will have plenty of work to do next year so it's not in that timeframe that you would likely see us change from our guidance of 5% to 7%.","Paul Ridzon","Assuming the contract your currently negotiating at DIG comes to fruition how much -- what's the free capacity look like over the next several years, that's currently unhedged.","Tom Webb","Yes. So we'll be for the '17 to '18 planning year a little over 500 megawatts available. And then a little bit better than that a little higher than that in other words as you go through time. So that's all upside opportunity.","Paul Ridzon","And this is with the new capacity this will be 750 megawatts total?","John Russell","Well no we\u2019re actually making two upgrades and the number you will get used to seeing will be 770 megawatts. So we had already planned and we were just been quiet about it putting in [indiscernible] and increasing the capacity at DIG this year. This new increase which is news because we just authorized it inside of our own company will add that extra 38 megawatts on top of that net-net will go from you've seen 710 in the past will go to 770.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Weisel with Macquarie Capital. Your line is open. ","Andrew Weisel","Just one more on the Michigan law, the energy efficiency side of things I think you said that you would support it with the continuation of revenue recovery in incentives. How likely is that from some of the proposals that you're hearing around the legislature, is it expected that that will continue as is or are people talking about potentially changing the element of it?","John Russell","What we're hearing at least right now is I will call revenue certainty the decoupling seems to be optional for the utilities to choose which is fine with us if we choose to do it or don't. The incentives they haven't really dug into the incentives yet, but the argument I think is pretty strong that we make electricity, we deliver electricity we sell electricity we should be incented to help our customers understand why we're not trying to do that with energy optimization. So I have a feeling the incentives that they have worked well for us and I expect those to continue but that maybe in a regulatory format rather than a legislative format.","Andrew Weisel","Then on doing some more generally the recent MISO capacity auction obviously cleared low but that's obviously in the near term where you don't see that shortfall yet. Have you seen, you\u2019ve talked a quite a bit about your own contracts but maybe more broadly in the bilateral market have you seen any change in the bidding or the asking since that auction?","Tom Webb","I'll tell you what I think will take this into two pieces. Let me just describe a little bit about what we see in the bilateral market. And from a capacity standpoint I would tell you this indication we gave you of $4.50 near-term is reasonably indicative of where we're. Obviously folks out there are watching very carefully what happens in the energy law. The ability to put more capacity in place, the accountability for doing that, those will all be positive things but in -- will the policy is being worked out people are nervous and trying to figure out are we going to fill that big void that begins next spring when we take a third of our coal plants out and have to somehow fell in behind that. So there's a lot of speculation in the markets about where we're go. The best it can give you on bilateral is around 450 for the spring 2016 to spring 2017 planning year. Now you asked a different question about the near term capacity market in MISO and maybe John can add to that.","John Russell","One of the things that we found is Andrew, we found pretty revealing as we have talked, we expect the capacity prices to rise in Zone 7 next year when we shut down at least our company shuts down a third of its coal capacity. This year I think the news out of the capacity auction was that capacity prices were low as expected except in Zone 4 for which was the one deregulated state and that was Illinois. And the capacity prices there are 50 times higher than in the generally regulated states of the rest of MISO. So that's an interesting time to see this happen when we haven't seen a lot of the capacity come out of the market. And you can rest assured we\u2019re talking to a lot of people here in Michigan about the risks of the volatility of the deregulated market.","Andrew Weisel","Then one last one, you made it very, very clear that the upside to DIG should not necessarily drive faster than 7% earnings growth and how the sales growth and cost cutting is not what's driving your plan here. Maybe a different way to ask a question is when you look out in the near or medium-term what's your expectation on customer bills? You talked about the gas side but maybe more on the electric side if you do reinvest a lot of the upside from these various drivers into this system without charging customers for it, is it possible that we will see customer bills on the electric side falling over the next several years?","John Russell","Let me take that one since you don't want to hear Tom anymore talk about -- how we're going to draw 5% to 7%. One of the things that I think is very important to understand about our capital investment plan is that we invest capital for a couple reasons and if we don't achieve those reasons we don't invest the capital.","One we need to make sure that it provides value to our customers. Two, it ensures that we reduce fuel costs. Three, it reduces O&M cost and fourth if there's an environmental commitment that we've made to improve the environment whether it's driven through EPA state laws or our own initiatives we do that too. So the customers by us investing capital get a better environment a better bill and better reliability and that's really what we strive for. In the five-year plan that we have today with the capital investment we have we can still keep customer rates below the rate of inflation the base rate increase below the rate of inflation and that's on the electric side.","On the gas side that also holds true but as I mentioned earlier with a low grass prices customers are paying bills the same rate that they did in 2001. So we have a lot of headroom, fuel is in our favor in most cases here and where it isn't in our favor because we're making investments on the electric side we're seeing the results and reliability the results in customer satisfaction and the results which I think are unique for us compared to others is the reduction in O&M cost. And we see that happening. Tom showed you the one chart. We're down last eight years 10%. In the next five years we expect to be down 7%. And that's on an absolute basis that includes inflation, it includes the legacy cost that we have. So we feel very comfortable that we invest the right amount of capital to do the things that I just mentioned and keeping the bills affordable.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann. Your line is open.","Brian Russo","Just a follow-up on the last question and commentary, you mentioned the gas retail rates are expected to be flat over the next few years due to lower gas prices and cost controls but yet you're go is to keep rates at or below the rate of inflation so is there upside investment opportunity in that segment that you guys can capture.","John Russell","Yes. Definitely. When thinking about that Brian it's the cost the base rate our rate of inflation keep it at the rate of inflation but on one of the slides I showed you can see the increase in investment in the capital in the gas business because of the dramatic decline of the natural class fuel cost, we\u2019re down about 50% in the fuel cost which provided headroom for us or does provide headroom for us to be able to make additional capital investments while still having the customers overall bill decline.","Brian Russo","Does that imply upside to your current capital budget forecast?","John Russell","There's opportunity there, I think I stated we've got $1 billion on top of that if we choose to but right now that seems like the right level. The one thing that we're a little pushed against is we hired about 625 people in the gas business over the past three years and we're growing those people I think it's going to be a competitive advantage for us to have people that can install pipe, weld pipe going forward in the future. So as those people develop we may be able to put a little more capital into it but one thing about the gas business is that it's not just plug-and-play it takes a lot of employees to get that done and what you'll find in some areas contractors are getting a little short now because of the influx in capital. So we made a decision a few years ago to move ahead with our own workforce, worked with our union and we added 625 people to do that which will position us well in the future and so if there was going to increase, think of it incrementally.","Brian Russo","Okay. Understood. And then what customer classes are driving for 3% industrial sales growth forecast?","Tom Webb","Across the board is the best way to think about what's happening there. And when we're thinking -- if your question is going to what's going to happen in the rest of the year because you did see that we were only up 2% industrial and 1.9% in the first quarter. What we will see in the rest of the year is food there's some folks who have program with us that they're going to need more power will see some increases, building and you know that fits pretty well with economics that we're seeing so more cement and alike. We're seeing a little more on the silicon side, so it's a little more high-tech that's coming in and the aluminum side of the industry. All of these industries have told us they need more and we'll be providing that and we\u2019re already beginning to see that tick up just a little bit. So our forecast is pushing us to say it's going to be higher than 3% industrial growth but we don't -- you know us. We don't want to say that until we actually see that come to do.","Operator","There are no further questions in the queue at this time. I will turn the call back over to our presenters.","John Russell","Great. Thank you. Thank you for joining us today. We're off to a good start again this year and we look forward to working with you through the rest of the year and we will put this year's this first quarter's good weather to good use for our customers and our investors.

Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and also posted in our website. ","Now let me turn the call over to Patti.","Patti Poppe","Thanks DV. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on our second quarter earnings call. I will begin the presentation with a review of our second quarter results, the progress made on our first half checklist and I\u2019ll share a little bit more with you about our Consumers Energy Way. Tom will then provide the financial results and outlook and will wrap up with Q&A.","Second quarter earnings were $0.45 per share, up $0.20 from a year ago, on a weather normalized basis earnings were up $0.14 or 52%. We are proud of our results and they were driven primarily by our outstanding operational performance. The cost controls and other good business decisions we put in place earlier in the year had a positive impact for this quarter.","Today, we are reaffirming our full year adjusted earnings guidance range of $1.99 to $2.02 per share. For 2017 and beyond as we previously announced, we plan to grow adjusted earnings per share at 6% to 8% annually. Let\u2019s go through our first half checklist. ","We\u2019ve made good progress achieving our financial and operational objective, the last 6 months were no different than the last 13 years, focused on delivering results for our customers and our investors. Michigan\u2019s track record of constructive regulation continues with the appointment of the new commissioner and our 8-K strategy is on track and focused on recovering capital investments through routine and regular rate cases. We\u2019ve been a leader in the transition to clean our environment and in April we retired seven baseload coal plants that have generating power dependably and affordably for over 60 years. A change like that is not easy, but the way we care for our people and our communities during the transition makes it a very positive step towards a sustainable energy future.","Recently, we launched a new initiative of continuous improvement that we call the Consumers Energy Way. I am excited about the customer focus benefits and waste elimination this program will deliver over the next several years. And then finally, the Michigan Legislature broke for the summer recess without taking action on the energy bill although the reforms would be positive for our customers as we have consistently reiterated we are not counting on any changes in our long-term financial plan as a result of the new law.","We are pleased with the appointment of Commissioner Rachel Eubanks. Her education and financial experience will be nice addition to an already strong commission and we look forward to working with her. Electric and gas infrastructure investment is needed throughout the state and by working with Michingan\u2019s agency for energy and our commission to prioritize those investments, together we can assure that the benefits for customers and the state will be realized in a well planned fashion.","We plan to self implement our electric rate increase of $170 million on September 1st at the current authorized 10.3% return-on-equity. The staff has recommended a $92 million revenue increase based on a 10% ROE. Half of the difference between our self implementation amount and the staff\u2019s position is the ROE and cost-of-capital adjustments. On August 1st, we plan to file a $90 million gas case, 93% of this case is made up of new investments to strengthen infrastructure and improve system capacity and deliverability. ","As the fourth largest combination utility, the strength of our gas and electric businesses together is a balanced mix that serves the people of Michigan and our investors well. We are very fortunate to be in this desirable position.","Reducing coal dependency is a strategy on which we\u2019ve been focused for several years. A recent example of this was the shutdown of the classic seven coal plants that I mentioned earlier with thoughtful planning years in advance, we were able to keep our promises to employees, vocal communities and Michigan\u2019s beautiful natural resources. Having reduced our coal generation more than any other investor on utility, we are leaving it better than we found it. As we continue to plan and look for additional ways to reduce our coal dependency and become an even more sustainable energy company.","Another critical step we\u2019re taking to assure sustainable performance is the roll-out of our Consumers Energy Way. For the past couple of months, our executives, directors and managers have all attended intensive training that will help them to identify the most efficient operational standard and ways to eliminate waste. After talking with each and everyone of them, I am further convinced that we can continue improving our customer experience and reducing costs for years to come. The next decade of extraordinary outcomes will be achieved by a strategy of working safely, completing work right in the first time, at the lowest cost and on schedule. ","We will continue to improve and deliver results for our customers and our investors. One area where I see more opportunity to improve specifically is distribution cost performance and we have a plan to do that. By reducing our total electric distribution cost by $30 million, we would be in first quartile and for $70 million we can make it all the way to the top of the list. The Consumers Energy Way is the strategy that will help us realize that goal all the while improving our customers experience and satisfaction.","The future performance of CMS Energy is bright and sustainable, the Consumers Energy Way will allow us to drive continuous improvement to achieve and maintain a high level of operational performance. My co-workers and I will eliminate non-value added activities and replace them with higher value offerings for customers and more certain financial results for our investors. By creating a culture of continuous improvement, every person, every job, everyday and every customer touch point can improve. ","With a track record like us, it\u2019s hard to expect more but we have a plan and strategy to do just that. Our commitment to extraordinary outcomes in all areas of our business enables our previously announced move to 6% to 8% adjusted earnings growth beginning next year and that continues year after year after year. ","Now, let me turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Webb","Thanks Patti. Second quarter results at $0.45 were up $0.20 compared with the year ago and on a weather or normalized basis up $0.14. This is substantially better than our original plan more than offsetting the adverse weather in the first quarter. For the first half overall, our earnings were $1 for a share up $0.10 or 11% from plan. Now as you can see here, while our first quarter results were down $0.14 from the same period in 2015, we more than offset that with our performance in the second quarter which is up $0.20. The weather helped a bit as did the expected impact of approved rates. In addition, we reached a settlement with the Michigan Treasury on used taxes, a nice $0.03 uplift. ","As you would expect, we also improved our O&M cost compared with the year ago by $0.09 in the second quarter. This reflects benefit gains, better run collectable account performance, all plant closures and a variety of other solid operating improvements. Looking ahead into the second half, if weather is just normal, we\u2019ll accomplish a nice uptick of $0.13 compared with 2015. As you may know, we already have a headstart on the third quarter with hot and muggy weather in July. Even with that or even without that, we would have plenty of room for growing infrastructure investments and we continue to project 5% to 7% earnings per share growth with solid confidence. ","I know most of you are well acquainted with the concept of this slide, where we show our projected earnings per share growth for the full year as the year progresses. During the first quarter, mild winter weather and abnormal storms reduced our earnings per share outlook by $0.13 but in a short period of time we were right back on track with earnings growth in the 5% to 7% range. You can see the improvements that offset abnormal weather in the lower box on this slide. ","We are ahead of our guidance and as always will put that upside to work for our customers and will deliver consistent pure leading EPS growth. We\u2019ve delivered 7% adjusted EPS growth for almost 15 years. Here is the picture of our track record for just the last 5 of those years, it shows how we consistently offset bad news and put good news to use for our customers without compromising our predictable earnings growth of 7% each and every year. Over the last 3 years, favorable weather and cost reductions in excess of our plan generated room to invest a quarter of a billion dollars for our customers, half from weather and half from cost productivity better than planned. That\u2019s a big number, we put these savings to work in many, many beneficial ways. ","Turning to 2017 and the future, here is our business model which is pretty simple and maybe just a little unique. We\u2019re fortunate to have a lot of capital investment opportunities over the next 10 years as we catch up on projects we didn\u2019t do over the prior 10 years. This investment in reliability, cost improvements, environmental mandates and other areas grows by about 6 to 8% a year, perhaps what\u2019s unique about our model is that we self fund the bulk of the investment increase keeping our customer base rate growth at or below the level of inflation. That discipline provides a real rate reduction for our customers as we make substantial improvements on their behalf.","Over the next 10 years, we\u2019ll invest over $17 billion in both our electric and gas businesses as shown in the circle on the left. 37% of this investment is in our growing gas business which already is the fourth largest in the nation. What\u2019s important is that all of these investments add tremendous value for our customers, whether it\u2019s exceeding compliance requirements for clean energy, enhancing productivity, reducing costs or improving our service. And we have opportunities to increase spending further on infrastructure as well as replacing large PPAs. We can build new capacity cheaper than existing PPA contracts, opportunities around these items could be in the $3 to $4 billion range. ","Part of the secret sauce as Patti mentioned is being able to reduce our O&M cost to help funding investment. We prefer annual rate cases because they are simple and manageable and they provide us with the opportunity to share our cost reductions with our customers as we gain recovery for capital investment programs, you can see our plans on the right. We are constantly refining including sizing ourselves to demand, for example we\u2019re in the middle of a voluntary separation program to enhance the phase of savings in a manner that treats our colleagues in a fair and respectful way. Net of cost increases, our cost reduction will be $60 million or about 3% a year over 2016 and 2017. That\u2019s consistent with our prior performance as shown on the left where we reduced our O&M cost by almost 3% on average each year since 2016. It\u2019s a program we\u2019re proud off and one that we can continue for many years as we take advantage of solid business decisions and better processes that we describe as the Consumers Energy Way. ","In addition to our cost performance, our conservative yield sales growth and our ability to avoid new dilutive equity, we still have attractive upsides outside of the utility. As you can see in this slide, continued layering in of the energy and capacity sales could enable us to increase our profitability by $20 to $40 million at our Dearborn industrial generation operations, you call that DIG. This is a nice insurance policy for our utility and a catalyst for new growth and by the way today we\u2019re celebrating 10 years without a safety incident at DIG, Safe and excellent operations are the foundation of our success.","Now, here is our standard profit and cash flow sensitivity slide to help you with your assessment of our future performance. I know there is a lot of concerns around the sector about the impact of low interest rates on pension and benefit obligations. A 50 basis points drop could be worth about a $12 million hit to earnings for us, lower debt cost however would offset much of that and should we make a pension contribution of say a $100 million that would offset the rest and then so we do not see a major interest rate concern for us.","The world changes every day and our model is built on being prepared to mitigate or take advantage of changes as they occur. Brexit from the European Union which I think surprised a lot of us last month has sure surprised me is a good example. It created opportunities to issue more debt at even lower interest rates, it also added to uncertainty, one of the reasons that we keep a little thicker liquidity levels than most of our peers. For example in May, before Brexit we extended our five year revolvers another year. Our liquidity including these revolves is over 15% of our market cap and that\u2019s a bit thicker than the average of our peers. ","And here is our report card, we are right on course to achieve our plans for capital investment, high quality balance sheet, competitive customer prices, a robust dividend payout, strong operating cash flow and adjusted earnings per share growth in the 5% to 7% range. We are pleased to have been able to deliver consistent strong earnings growth for 14 years and we intend to continue this for a long time. Our earnings and dividend growth continue at a consistent type pace every year no matter what\u2019s happening in the economy, the weather, politics or succession planning. ","So thank you for your interest and your support, we\u2019re deeply grateful for it and we\u2019d be delighted to take your questions. So Tiffany would you be kind enough to open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much Mr. Webb. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin with UBS. Your line is open.","Tom Webb","Good morning Julien. ","Julien Dumoulin","Hi, good morning. So perhaps first quick question, congrats on the results but could you elaborate a little bit on the continuous improvement efforts you guys have emphasized voluntary separations, et cetera? Where do you stand relative to plan on a multi-year basis? Clearly, given how well you're doing this year, what are the thoughts in the back half of the year on O&M tracks?","Patti Poppe ","Well Julien, thanks for the question because it obviously is an area of real focus for us. We feel great about the relative performance to plan, obviously and that\u2019s reflected in our results but as we look forward to the year for the balance of this year, we really are continuing to everyday improve our processes and our operations so that we eliminate the waste of rework, the waste of return visits et cetera and every time we do that, it\u2019s a cost saving. So we have those cost savings built into this year\u2019s plan and we continue to execute on that plan.","I would also say on the VSP, the VSP is a culmination of many years of working on productivity improvements and I would say that our recent launch of the Consumers Energy Way is probably too early in its life to attribute to the VSP, but it\u2019s always important to write size and match our workload with our workforce and through a voluntary program like this, we\u2019ve enabled employees to optionally decide to retire early which then set us up for great performance next year where we have our workforce and the workload lined up.","Tom Webb","So dealing in one of the thoughts.","Julien Dumoulin","So bottom line, it's a rate reflective.","Tom Webb","It is, but Julien also keep in mind the part you don\u2019t want to hear as we do more and more this year, we\u2019ll put that surplus cost improvement to work but more reliability and all that good stuff but what it does for us is gives us headrooms, so it allows us to fit in more investment. ","Julien Dumoulin","Right. Absolutely. Second question, on the legislative angle, can you comment more broadly? If you are unable to get comprehensive legislation, have you guys thought to doing something a little bit more specific or tactical? Would be curious if there is potentially a new avenue for something more specific.","Patti Poppe ","I would say that first-of-all again the changes to the energy policy are not embedded in our plan but what we do think is important for the state to address is the idea that alternative energy suppliers don\u2019t have to demonstrate that they have firm capacity. And through Micel\u2019s recent 3 year forward looking capacity auction proposals will be curious and observing and we have filed comments that when they make their filing with the FERC in mid-August, we\u2019ll have a better indicator of some of the changes that they are recommending will in fact be a way to help address that loophole where people can sell power that they don\u2019t actually have. We want to make sure that gets fixed or show reliability and resource adequacy in Michigan.","Julien Dumoulin","Got it. All right, thank you.","Patti Poppe","Thanks Julien.","Operator","Your next comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. You line is open.","Ali Agha","Thank you, good morning.","Patti Poppe","Hi Ali, good morning.","Ali Agha ","First, Tom, can you just elaborate a little bit on this tax settlement you referred to? Was that just a Q2 event? Will that have lingering impacts over the course of the year? How should we be thinking about that?","Tom Webb","So the tax settlement was around used taxes and is something we\u2019ve been working on for gosh it\u2019s almost a decade and a half and the way I would ask you to think about that, that\u2019s a nice benefit that we\u2019re glad to have this year because it was worth $0.03 in this quarter, but it\u2019s a onetime thing. There is a little bit of a benefit going forward but it\u2019s not big enough that you should get excited about it, right. So what we do is we\u2019re looking at that, that\u2019s a nice offset to the onetime bad weather that we had in the first quarter. So it kind of lines up and gives you a good quality of earnings. So we\u2019re glad to have it, it\u2019s been a long time coming and we\u2019re delighted that the Michigan Treasury is happy and so are we. ","Ali Agha","Okay. The second question you referred to the low interest rates and the implications of that. Just thinking of that from another vantage point, one of the positives in Michigan from a regulatory perspective is that your authorized ROEs are above industry average and have been very consistent. Just wondering, in this persistent low interest rate environment, are you getting any sense that there may be pressure on authorized ROEs or is your sense that the regulators still remain very comfortable with where they are at?","Tom Webb","I don\u2019t want to speak for the regulators but I would say this is that when you look at the authorized ROEs including riders and things that people have, we\u2019re really not that far out of line with the better performing utilities around the country. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that special of the thing and then I\u2019d also agree, there is interest rates come down and puts pressure on where those numbers should be. You can see by our request in both of our rate cases, that we think that there is something between where we\u2019re asking and where the staff often would be that there is kind of a middle point in there that\u2019s around that 10.3%. So we\u2019re hopeful that they see the usefulness and importance of that and the competitiveness of that level and that could sustain. ","Ali Agha ","Okay. And then thirdly, the goal to get to the top quartile you said another $30 million gets you there. How long do you think it takes you to get to that level? And then related to that, Tom the cost savings you laid out for 2016, 2017 over a long period of time, how much more can you say you can take out of the system to continue that very impressive cost reduction program? ","Patti Poppe ","Ali, I\u2019ll answer the first part of the question. As we build our plan for run rate, our distribution cost and distribution cost per customer, I would, we see in past to mid to late 2018 gets us to the top quartile and then additional savings come from a sustained commitment to continuous improvement in waste elimination and so that\u2019s the time horizon we\u2019d be looking for the first quartile competitiveness. ","Tom Webb","Let me just then add to that because I know it\u2019s a good question that people do ask us and we ask ourselves. So if you look at that slide that talks about the O&M cost performance, you\u2019ll see a line and that is called the attrition for an example. And that line is nothing but we lose about 400 or so people each year through retirements in the like and when we bring somebody in to replace that with our new programs for defining contributions to the divine benefit and different healthcare for new employees. We save a good chunk of money, about 40,000 dollars with each turnover, till that time the 400 gets you into $16 million a year and that\u2019s 1.6% of our O&M right there all by itself. That sustains for good many years because we still have a large population of older guys like me, so there will be more people that take advantage of that over time and then I would say beyond smart meters and productivity and VSP programs and all that, what Patti has described that we\u2019re proud to talk about as the Consumers Energy Way, it provides a lot of opportunity that she has shown some specifics on it but it provides some opportunities in everything we do. It cuts into the finance organization and cuts into the back office, it isn\u2019t just the operating piece up front. We can be a lot better what we do smartly not paying for it.","Ali Agha ","Thank you.","Patti Poppe ","Thanks Ali.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Tom Webb","Good morning Paul.","Patti Poppe ","Good morning Paul.","Paul Ridzon ","Are you aware of anything going on behind the scenes in Lansing, so that we can hit the ground running in the lame-duck session? ","Patti Poppe ","Well, we know of it, there will be conversations in the short window before the election when the senate comes back into session. We don\u2019t expect the house would take it up before that, but if the senate can come to some conclusions before the elections, then in that lame-duck its possible but I would say that we don\u2019t think it\u2019s likely.","Paul Ridzon","Okay. And then what about into 2017?","Patti Poppe ","So then there are elections, you know implications of the elections this fall particularly in the house, there are a lot of seats up for grabs, there are some people who are predicting that the house could shift from public into democrat that would be a big change. Terms limits are real challenge in Michigan because it requires then all new legislators have to be briefed on a variety of subjects including this complicated one. So I doubt that they would hit the ground running, but certainly I would expect that we will be back at it come the start of the year.","Tom Webb","Can I just add to that, as Patti said earlier, remember nothing of this new law whatever it might be is in our plan and we are pretty happy with the 2008 energy law, it gives us so many wonderful things that we can do. So its got to be good meaningful change when it occurs. ","Paul Ridzon","Got it, okay, thank you.","Tom Webb","Thanks Paul.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Michael Weinstein","Hello, guys.","Patti Poppe","Hi Michael.","Michael Weinstein","Hello, Patti. When you were talking about competitive suppliers and the requirement to buy capacity for their customers, in the absence of those requirements though, I'm wondering, what does the energy and the capacity shortage or availability situation in the state look like over time? At what point in the future do you see the critical shortage of capacity in Michigan and in Zone 7, Zone 4?","Patti Poppe","Well, so Zone 7 we see and it was recently published, a 300 megawatt shortfall in 2017 is the forecast that eats into the reserve margin pretty significantly and by 2021 up to doubling of that 600 megawatts was just the publicly announced plant closures as you know, DTE announced several closures recently. So that definitely is in the forecast, what\u2019s not in that forecast is any other early retirements of other units. So again we do think that it\u2019s a critical issue that needs to be addressed and we need to assure that the people who are selling power in Michigan have that power that they can actually provide the power they sold and so it does highlight the issue that exists in Zone 7 with this hybrid market.","Michael Weinstein","I guess in the interim, if there is a shortage, how do you meet that shortage?","Patti Poppe","While we are certainly able to cover the load of our customers where we have adequate supply and reserve margin to serve the 90% of the load in our service territory and so where we are covered. The question will be how the alternative providers cover. Now on a hot day when we have to deploy, there is a whole emergency set of procedures that MISO invokes across the entire region. If there are constraints on any given day and so there is a whole procedure to manage that obviously all the peakers come on and everyone is required to ramp up everything they\u2018ve got and then we dial download purposely that as the programs with those customers allow demand response et cetera. So that\u2019s obviously important part of the mix as well.","Tom Webb","There is only a couple of IPPs left and we\u2019re one of them called DIG. So it puts us in a good spot to back up the utility so that we do what\u2019s needed there and it also puts a statement in the spot having that bit of an insurance policy, but we all agree, it\u2019s something that needs to be addressed and we have more certainty going forward.","Michael Weinstein ","Would it be accurate to say that on slide 18 when you talk about the $4.50 to $7.50 possibilities going-forward capacity, is that the high-end of that range, would be a shortage condition where there is no other solution; DIG just is the solution to serving the region?","Tom Webb","Yeah, I\u2019d say what we see in the market as we do bilateral market sales, the upside opportunities between 450 and 750, you might sell a little bit at 750, but I wouldn\u2019t think of selling what\u2019s left there, that would be probably a more aggressive assumption that is realistic. So somewhere in between there is what could happen in the market, that will be opportunity for us. You\u2019ll note that we\u2019ve sold a lot of our energy, that just makes sense to do was long-term contracts out of DIG, but we\u2019ve held a lot of our capacity available one for the situation and two for insurance for our utility to make sure that we\u2019ve got backup.","Patti Poppe","And if Michael does a 3 year forward-looking auction, it does give more visibility and these bilateral agreements then become more attractive depending on what that auction foretells. So I think a 3 year forward-looking capacity auction would be a good enabler to what Tom\u2019s describing.","Michael Weinstein ","Got you, thank you very much.","Patti Poppe","Thank you.","Tom Webb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Jonathan Arnold","Good morning, guys.","Patti Poppe","Good morning Jonathan","Tom Webb","Good morning.","Jonathan Arnold","Two questions, you're $0.13 ahead, weather, so far. You alluded to the hot and muggy July. Can you give us a sense of what the through-July number might look like? And then, as well, what are you reinvesting in currently. What's the best way of deploying those extra dollars in the system. Is there a possibility you run out of stuff to do?","Tom Webb","I\u2019d answer the last part and then ask everyone that they look at the slide towards the 2016 EPS outlook which is a little curvy chart. To your point Jonathan, there is a little box there that shows how we did the recovery. A lot of that\u2019s ongoing stuff and some of that\u2019s onetime things, you know like they used tax. And then you\u2019ll see that we saw our cells running up because we are doing better on our cost reductions then we anticipated so we are on the upside sort of with opportunities to reinvest more. ","The weather side that you\u2019re asking about which is in addition to that, if you just took July for what we know for the months so far, there is $0.03, $0.04 of earnings upside associated with that. I am always cautious with those kind of numbers because what\u2019s August going to be like, $0.03 or $0.04 up again or down, we don\u2019t know, we just plan on normal weather and our projections. So where can we put that money to work over so many opportunities, we can pull some outage work ahead from next year into this year. That helps next year\u2019s results and helps our reliability, so we\u2019re looking at that. ","We can do more on the tree-trimming side, that\u2019s probably the single biggest thing we can do to improve our reliability and so there is a place that we can do more work on and above and beyond what we\u2019ve been authorized to do by the Commission. There is also more esoteric things like low cost financing, if these rates continue to stay low, we can take a hard look and we can make these decisions sooner or later we can go pretty far back into the year and decide that let\u2019s just take on some more low interest debt and prefund some of our future debt and all that does is it might cost us a little bit for settling this year, there is the investment part, but it will save more money to create more profits, 17 and sometime forward years. ","So I could go on because there is an awful long list, but those are some of the areas that are very practical and they are on our radar screen and we\u2019re looking at them and we\u2019re timing them in way that we think allows us to do the max performance for our customers and then not miss the earnings growth. ","Jonathan Arnold","Great, thank you Tom. And then, could you just remind us when, how far out your no-equity look currently is?","Tom Webb","Yeah, I think we go out to 2021 and 2022 and there is in the appendix of your material, a slide that I will refer folks so that you wouldn\u2019t miss that, it\u2019s our operating cash flow slide, it\u2019s got a big got arrow flying over shown that we take out about or improve our operating cash flow about a 100 million a year and on the bottom box you can see our NOLs and credits in the yellow side and you can see they go out to 2021. So it will be 2021, 2022 before we\u2019re looking at meeting any block equity but I caution you again, 10 years running predicting that incorrectly, it could go out further. ","Jonathan Arnold","Fair enough. Alright. Thank you, Tom. Thank you, Patti.","Patti Poppe","Thanks Jonathan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Leslie Rich with JP Morgan. Your line is open. ","Leslie Rich","Good morning. ","Patti Poppe","Good morning Leslie.","Leslie Rich","Question on slide 13. You have $0.13 there attributable in part to pension yield curve and enhanced capitalization. Could you just walk through what that is? What the yield curve moving down why that's a benefit?","Tom Webb","Yes, this is that new process that we put in place towards the beginning of this year, where it is looking at how you do your expenses when you\u2019re discounting the pension cost and what we\u2019re now doing is actually discounting if you will at the point of each year as opposed to an average of all the years. And by doing that, that actually gives us a better look at how to reflect on our programs. So it\u2019s like our designed benefit pension program where its closed, new employees aren\u2019t coming into that. So the bulk of our liability is more upfront than it is in the back. So by taking low interest rates in the curve early on, it\u2019s cheaper for us and of course as you go out in time and the curve rises above the average, it\u2019s a little more expensive. ","But that\u2019s a big savings to us and it should as well as we go into the future years minimize the amount of volatility we have when we\u2019re looking at discount rates and the pension curve interest rates. And that\u2019s maybe why when I said earlier, the impact of 50 basis points on our pension plan on OPEB is only about $12 million, I know I heard that\u2019s a bigger number for some companies but it could be because the program has closed, new employees come into a DC program. ","And then on the enhanced capitalization, all that is, that is just where we really should be capitalizing work we\u2019re doing instead of putting it in O&M. That allows our customers to get a better deal they pay for it later but its also a benefit for us as we do that because that\u2019s less O&M expenses and so that our profits are higher if you will. ","So we\u2019re just doing a little more of that and one of the examples that you may recall, we\u2019ve used a few times in our slides called pole top maintenance and that\u2019s just where we do a little more complete work, complete when there is a storm, replacing a whole pole-top cross arms and the like instead of just doing bits and pieces. By doing the whole work, we get to capitalize it instead of count it as O&M and those are couple of good examples for us.","Leslie Rich ","Yes. That's great, thank you.","Tom Webb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Weisel with Macquarie. Your line is open. ","Andrew Weisel ","Hello, good morning everyone.","Patti Poppe","Good morning.","Andrew Weisel ","First question is a follow up on DIG. It looks like you sold some more capacity in energy for 2017 and yet the outlook for expected income hasn't changed. So that basically just means that the prices were in line with your expectations or is there any other moving parts there?","Tom Webb","No, no other moving parts whatsoever, good observation. It showed 25% last time and is at 0 now. That\u2019s around the energy side and we pretty much, it\u2019s a lot of that light blue bar that you see up there in \u201917. We had factored that in at the prices that we expected. So there was no big uptick in our numbers from that.","Andrew Weisel","Okay. And then moving forward, you said you want to keep some, I forget if there was energy or capacity or both. Do you have a targeted amount of how much you\u2019d want to retain for those future years?","Tom Webb","Well we\u2019re at a bit of a sweet spot right now. On energy, we have about 25% available as we go out in the future. Now, we\u2019ll be happy to actually market and sell a little bit of that as the right opportunities come up with long-term contracts. On the 50% to 90% available, that\u2019s already you could tell at a ramp as you go through the years. We wanted to keep that 50% level, one as an insurance policy for our utility in case it was needed and two because we really do think economically those prices will be a little bit better and that\u2019s what we used to call the layering in capacity contracts. So we\u2019re not trying to be greedy and we are trying to be patient. So we are layering them in if they are little bit better each time we get a chance, and so if some more come up, if there was another good deal, we might layer in some more we don\u2019t have one right now.","Andrew Weisel","Great, very helpful. My next question is on the weather-adjusted load growth. Residential's been a little bit volatile recently. I believe it was down about 2% in the first quarter, then up about 4% this quarter. Any comments on the trends there, you're not really a story based on load growth; just curious what's driving those movements and what you're expecting for this year and beyond?","Tom Webb","In part, it\u2019s our highly skilled ability to the weather adjustments, maybe we\u2019re not the best in the business. So you\u2019re right and to be a little more precise in the first quarter, our residential sales were down 2.1%. We scratched our heads and we said can\u2019t be right, it\u2019s got to be weather adjustments when we get more than 1 or 2 standard deviations away from normal. ","So here we are in the second quarter, now we\u2019re up 3.8% for residential. Now, often people would cheer and say isn\u2019t that great and build stories around it. I actually scratch our heads and say isn\u2019t that a little bit of the weather adjustments again. So what I like to do and I hope you bear with us is sort of average those two together and what we will tell you is that we think is that if we\u2019re in a small growth this year, that would be nice. ","But what we\u2019re planning on is a small decline for residential. We may be for the full year, we maybe a little conservative on that and on commercial we say it\u2019s going to be flat and I think we\u2019re realistic on that and then on industrial, we\u2019ll tell you we\u2019ll be up 2.5 plus percent and I think that\u2019s pretty realistic to because we did see, you didn\u2019t ask about it but a tick down on the industrial side and what we saw there was still good strength on food, manufacturing, automotive, chemicals, a whole variety of construction, a whole variety of areas we\u2019re ticking up nicely as we expected but metals did not do well. I think that has to do with the competitive pressure coming out of China and in addition we had a couple of our bigger businesses. So one on the construction side with insulation, that just did an acquisition and they are actually relaying out a lot of their production facilities and I wouldn\u2019t even mention it except that it was a 1% decline all by itself. So we may have some oddities on the industrial side in our report for this quarter, and we\u2019ll see how that plays out. Does that help you?","Andrew Weisel","Yes, very helpful commentary. Thank you.","Tom Webb","Operator, any other questions?","Operator","There are no further questions in queue. ","Patti Poppe","Okay, well thank you everyone for listening into our call today. We appreciate your interest and ownership. Tom and I look forward to seeing many of you over the next few months. ","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference.

Barba - VP, Controller and CAO","John G. Russell - President and CEO","Thomas J. Webb - EVP and CFO","Analysts","","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann","","Operator","","Good morning everyone and welcome to the CMS Energy 2014 Third Quarter Results and Outlook Call. This call is being recorded. Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today, beginning at 12.30 PM Eastern Time, running through October 30. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's Web-site in the Investor Relations section.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Glenn Barba, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. Please go ahead.","Glenn P. Barba","Good morning and thank you for joining us today. With me are John Russell, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Webb, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on our Web-site.","This presentation contains forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements should be considered in the context of the risk and other factors detailed in our SEC filings. These factors could cause CMS Energy's and Consumers' results to differ materially.","This presentation also includes non-GAAP information. A reconciliation of each of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in the appendix and posted to the Investor section of our Web-site.","Now, I will turn the call over to John.","John G. Russell","Thanks, Glenn, and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us on our third quarter earnings call. I'll begin the presentation with an overview of the quarter before I turn the call over to Tom to discuss the financial results and the outlook for the remainder of the year. Then as usual we'll close with Q&A.","The first nine months have produced good financial and operational results. Our 2014 full year guidance remains on track at $1.76 to $1.78, which is at the high end of our original range. Operationally, our efforts are being acknowledged by nationally recognised surveys. J. D. Power and Associates ranks our gas utility the second highest in residential customer satisfaction in the Midwest. The gas utility's improvement from the prior year's study makes it the most improved utility in the nation. Sustainalytics, which looks at a number of sustainable factors, ranked Consumers Energy number one among peers. These recognitions are evidence that our Company is getting better every day.","Looking back over the last few years, we have consistently grown 7% each year. This is our 12th year of predictable financial performance. Each year we grow earnings of the prior year's results. Today, we are pleased to provide 2015 guidance of $1.85 to $1.89, consistent with our 5% to 7% growth rate. We are confident in next year's plan and our ability to execute it. We have many upside opportunities that will keep us on track to achieve our long-term organic growth.","Election Day is less than two weeks away. We have been watching the local and national races closely. The race for Michigan's Governor has remained as we have envisioned, focused on a number of non-energy issues. The challenger, Mark Schauer, is supportive of an increase in the renewable energy standard, as is Governor Snyder. We will work closely with either administration on making Michigan's energy policy one of the best in the nation. The latest polling results show that Governor Snyder is leading by 4% over Mark Schauer.","The Michigan Senate is reviewing energy policy and beginning to construct legislation. Senator Mike Nofs is coordinating two workgroups, one is focused on energy efficiency and the second on renewable energy. An important issue for Senator Nofs is defining clean energy sources rather than just focusing on renewables. This definition may allow us to capture the 300 megawatt upgrade at our Ludington pumped-storage facility.","As we look around the corner, we see opportunities to continue to grow the business. The election will be behind us shortly and we can begin focusing on Michigan's energy future. Next year we should see improvements with the passage of the 2015 Energy Law. Our competitive industrial rate structure will take effect late [2015] (ph). [Inaudible] time we may see a final order in our upcoming electric case. As we continue to monitor the capacity markets, we also see opportunities for capital investment that are not included in our current plan.","You can see the impact of the new rate design and next year's fuel savings on electric rates. Residential customers will see rates fall about 1%, commercial customers will be down about 5%, and industrial customers will see nearly a 10% reduction. The largest energy intensive industrial customers could see base rates drop up to 15% with the new rate design, and including fuel savings these rates could drop 20% in the next 15 months. These structural changes, rate changes and fuel savings, will improve price competitiveness, competitiveness for all customers, and make Michigan more attractive for large businesses.","I receive a lot of questions about how we can continue our performance for our customers and our investors. We begin by increasing customer satisfaction and adding customer value, the foundation of our business model. Every year about 400 employees leave and about 300 full-time employees are hired at lower costs including benefits. With fewer employees, we continue to do more work and improve productivity. This leads to high employee engagement and our Company ranking is among the most admired in the country. Although simple, these strategic steps drive breakthrough results year-over-year.","Here's a look at two major construction projects. Cross Winds, located on the east side of the state, will begin commercial operations by year-end. With this investment, we are able to meet the state's 10% renewable energy standard one year ahead of schedule and at a cost less than plan. In the southwest part of the state, a 24-mile, 36-inch pipeline has been installed eliminating the bottleneck and completing a 90 mile span. This pipeline is capable of delivering 1.2 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day.","Now let me turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas J. Webb","Thanks, John, and as always we deeply appreciate your interest in our Company and for spending some time with us on our call today, thank you. As John mentioned, our third quarter results of $0.37 a share reflect continued solid progress. For the first nine months, adjusted earnings at $1.42 a share were up $0.13 or 10% from the same period a year ago. And this excludes an increase of $0.03 a share in our long-term reserve for Bay Harbor environmental maintenance. Having completed the remediation, we are truing up the established reserve back in 2004 to maintain for water treatment facilities over the next couple of decades.","As you can see here on the shaded circle, we put to work more of the substantial upside from the first quarter with reinvestments in even more productivity and reliability. As shown with the yellow arrow, we have plans to do even more O&M reinvestment during the rest of year, and this is without jeopardizing our ability to deliver earnings growth at the high end of our original guidance which is in the 6% to 7% zone.","And as you can see in the dotted circle, our planned cost savings in the fourth quarter more than fund planned capital investment. This reflects the important work we've completed to self fund all of our capital investment in 2014. So in other words, we permanently funded with continuing O&M cost reductions 100% of our 1.6 billion of capital investment in 2014. We are proud of our team that not only has continued our eight-year run of continuous cost reductions, but accelerated them to a level that fully funded a record level of capital investment, and that's without any increase in rates to our customers.","This slide, which I suspect is familiar to many of you by now, shows how on top of the large planned cost reductions we have further reduced our cost levels. This as well as favorable weather in the first quarter provides room for investment to improve reliability, generate incremental productivity and pre-fund debt. This not only maintains a conservative risk level, it makes it easier to continue improved performance for our customers and EPS growth at the high end of our peers.","Now as the year winds down, there's a number of choices that we have will narrow but the opportunity continues right through the end of year. Thinking about the future, this is another slide that's probably familiar to many of you. The need for important projects requiring a capital investment over the next 10 years exceeds $20 billion as shown in the blue circle on the right. Those needs are up from what we expected just a year ago. Our plans however include just a portion of this need, limited only by our desire to keep our base rate increases below inflation.","You may already have noted what's new on this slide. We have updated the projection period from 10 years starting in 2013 to 2015 and we've raised the level of investment from $15 billion to $15.5 billion for needed reliability upgrades, again without jeopardizing our ability to keep customer base rate increases well below inflation. Now I wouldn't be surprised if a year from now we're talking to you about investment plan of something in the $16 billion to $17 billion range rather than the $15.5 billion, and again that's without hurting price competitiveness. [Inaudible] $15.5 billion level of investment, electric base rates are up about 1.5% a year, well below forecasted inflation.","Here you can see one aspect of investment that still is not included in our plan. Should ROA customers return to bundled service either naturally or by policy, we would need to add investment to provide another 800 megawatts of capacity. Later in the planning cycle, we'll need to replace expiring PPAs with more than 2,000 megawatts of capacity and we believe we can do that without raising customer bills. These opportunities alone require 3,000 megawatts of new capacity at Consumers and none of it is in our present plan.","While you can see this investment creates a substantial upside for organic growth in our business, there are several other upsides ahead. For example even though we've got a pretty good track record on cost savings and a reasonable plan ahead, we likely have more room to improve productivity which can create more room for capital investment, and that's our growth engine. While some companies have increased their cost over the last seven years, we've been able to reduce ours and reduce it enough to fully offset inflation and reduce our absolute cost by 7%.","Our plans permit us to achieve another 10% reduction over the next five years. As shown in the right box on this slide, these future savings already have been identified, the decisions have already been made and they would be difficult to reverse. For example, the planned shift from coal to gas generation with the closure of 950 megawatts of coal plants will reduce O&M by $25 million. This simply reflects the fewer number of workers needed to run gas plants compared with coal plants.","With the responsible decisions already taken regarding benefits, we'll save another $75 million over the next five years. As we replace retiring workers with new employees and achieve reasonable levels of productivity, we'll save another $75 million, and although we have one of the slower rollouts of smart meters as we prioritized our capital, these smart meters provide new levels of productivity and service and we've counted only $25 million for that. We're comfortable with projecting net savings of $100 million or 10% over the next five years but there may be room to move.","Sales may provide additional upside. Michigan continues a robust recovery and is among the top 10 states in GDP growth. Grand Rapids, one of the major locations in our service territory, has an even higher pace of GDP growth. Its growth is in the top 10% of all U.S. cities. Michigan has done pretty well compared to U.S. averages and economic performance in our service territory has been even better. We may not have factored fully this level of economic performance in our sales outlook.","As you can see in the box on the right side of this slide, industrial sales have been strong, up 8% this year. Residential and commercial growth has lagged but still up 2.5%, or 3.5% if you exclude energy efficiencies. Our outlook for 2015 to 2018 may be somewhat conservative with industrial growth at about 2% a year and total growth at about 0.5%, and that's fine with us because we'd rather be surprised on the upside than the downside.","In fact, here's a listing of some recent announcements by various companies making substantial additions to their business or entering Michigan with new business. These examples alone add 155 megawatts or about 2.5% of sales growth. These will happen over a couple of years and we expect there are a few more announcements yet to be made.","On top of that, the Ferrari in the garage is winding up its engine. As capacity prices in Michigan rise, there's an opportunity for our Dearborn Industrial Generation plant to realize profit improvement between $30 million and $50 million higher than what's in our plan. Over the last few months, we've seen good signs including a new long-term energy contract for 250 megawatts at over $4 a kilowatt\/month.","We also are seeing near-term bilateral transactions for capacity at prices in excess of $3. In addition to that, the DIG plant bid successfully into our competitive utility capacity auction for 25 megawatts in 2015 and 50 megawatts in the 2016 planning year and all at good prices. These are all excellent signs regarding additional upside.","Now that's a lot of upside including utility capital investment, cost reductions and sales growth as well as the Ferrari in the garage. As a reminder, we have an active gas case that should permit us to recover $144 million of investment for the 2015 test year. That would be $88 million after cost reductions. This is a simple small case and it's possible it could be settled.","We still plan to file an electric rate case at the end of this year for three reasons. First, this is the mechanism to authorize improved rate design that will provide more attractive rates to large job providers without losing our competitive position for our residential customers' bills at about 10% below the U.S. average. Second, this is the process to authorize the purchase of the 540 megawatt combined cycle gas plant in Jackson [inaudible] [lower] (ph) than any other over the last six years and near record. Last, this permits us to recover investment in the 2015 test year, substantially offset by continued cost reductions, and with a roll-off of the 2001 securitization charges of $80 million the rate impact will be smaller. This rate case is a real win-win for our customers and our investors.","As we continue with our capital investment program, our CapEx levels at 19% of market cap now exceed the average of our peers. Importantly, our liquidity and operating cash flow levels also exceed the average of our peers. And it's shown on the left side of this slide, our financing work continues to benefit from attractive markets and smart use of good tools.","For example, our 2014 securitization lowers cost for our electric customers by $22 million next year and provides more resources for investment in our gas business. In addition, we recently issued a 50-year First Mortgage Bond and it's a first for us and that's the lowest 50-year bond rate for any utility in my lifetime.","So coming back to today, we're pleased to share our financial sensitivity table. You can see the impact of changes in sales, gas prices, ROE, and interest rates in 2014, no worries here. And here's our report card for 2014 as well as the new outlook for 2015. We're on a target to meet all of our goals by continued caution that with a need to replenish our fuel inventories from low levels at year-end 2013, our operating cash flow target may be at risk in 2014. It's a temporary issue, recovery occurs in 2015.","As you can see, our targets for 2015 show another year of strong consistent growth. I hope you were not surprised by our initial EPS guidance of up 5% to 7% again in 2015 and growth in operating cash flow up another $100 million. I know that some of you believe that regulated utility models have increasing risk, but we hope you're beginning to see just the opposite at CMS. Our efforts to improve our cost, our reliability, customer rates and bills, as well as customer satisfaction actually improves our ability to deliver consistent earnings and dividend growth at a level that you've become accustomed to from us over the last 12 years.","Here's our outlook of the overall earnings and dividend growth showing our mindset around consistent good performance at the high end peers for our customers without jeopardizing our consistent high end performance for investors. We're proud of the track record, we're humbled by your interest and we're committed to improving performance every day. So thank you again for taking time to listen to our call today. John and I would be delighted to answer your questions. So, Janet, would you please open the line?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Dan Eggers at Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse","John, I guess as we're moving into the winter season, you covered a lot of topics on the call, but can you just talk about where you guys see the system operationally going in the winter given some of the challenges we saw last year and kind of your comfort on the MISO regions for us, reliability concern with fuel, and all those sorts of issues?","John G. Russell","Dan, you're talking about the electric side?","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse","Probably both sides actually.","John G. Russell","Okay, I guess we're well-positioned. I mean the storage is full which is great after a very cold winter the beginning of this year, so the team has done a nice job replenishing the field. So I'm comfortable on the gas side. On the electric side, we're good as far as capacity for this year. The real issue in MISO and particularly in Zone 7 becomes 2016. That's when you begin to see the falloff of the retired plants, there will be capacity needs there. The debate going on today is, MISO is looking at their forecast thinking Zone 7 could be anywhere from 2,000 megawatts to 3,000 megawatts short.","So from our standpoint, that's something that we're looking at. We've got plans in place so that we need to add capacity, we can, and like everybody is familiar with the plant that we were going to build, the gas plant that we decided not to and instead bought the JP Morgan plant for a much lower cost, everything is in place to move ahead with that one, expansion of the existing plants could take place. So there's lot of opportunities we have here.","The big thing is we just need to see where this kind of shakes out with if MISO's predictions are right and what happens with the energy law. As Tom mentioned, there are some \u2013 if the markets begin to tighten, which I expect they will, what you may see is a return from customers who were taking their supply from third-party suppliers today return to us, and at that point that's an opportunity for us to execute some of the plans we have to build the capacity to serve their needs. So that's kind of in summary what the next two years look like, but we're in good shape for next year, the following year is the one that I think a lot more [will tell what happens] (ph).","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse","I guess, John, on that point, if you look at Slide 16 where you guys continue to show the prospective need for a lot of capacity to service customers coming with open access coming back and PPAs went away, when do you guys get comfortable enough to put that into your CapEx program and what milestones should we be looking at for you guys to get there?","John G. Russell","One of the things, Dan, that we're doing, our plan is not to build above the growth. So at the end of the day what we do is we look at our forecasts for five years out, 10 years out, but our planning and our construction will really follow where the load goes. So what we will do is, in the short term probably buy from the market and in the long-term build, and that may be different from most regulated utilities that build large incremental projects that go above the growth rate and then wait for several years for the growth to catch up to that. With the hybrid market that we have today, that is a disadvantage to us because if we do that we simply put what seems like free capacity on the market for the third-party suppliers to take advantage of.","So ours is to build to that level of capacity, and the good news is, since most of our growth in the future will be renewable energy or growth as far as a fuel source for generation, it will be renewable energy or gas, you have a lot more flexibility in building to that level and not building above it as we did in the old days with coal and nukes.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse","But I guess, John, should we assume that if choice goes away in early '15 with new legislation, would that advance at least the need to address the 800 megawatts of potential load coming back with the change in CapEx plans?","John G. Russell","Absolutely, absolutely, when they come back we're going to have the power for them.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse","Okay. And then I guess one last question just on the renewable front here with potential expansion of the renewable energy target, how do you guys see the mix of kind of wind and solar in the next cycle given the fact it was a pretty wind heavy first kind of renewal investment?","John G. Russell","I mean I expect that to continue, Dan. The one thing that Michigan has proven with the way the team's built the plants here, the wind regime in Michigan is clearly the most cost advantageous renewable energy source in Michigan. Solar, although it's getting a lot of play in a lot of other areas, it really hasn't taken hold here. Part of it is our conditions here, the lack of huge incentives like you see in some other places throughout the country. And really if you want renewable energy here, wind resources are the way to go. So that's definitely the plan of the future here.","Although I think distributed generation to some extent will take off. I think you'll probably see us doing some pilots in certain areas, because if customers want that we want to provide it for them but there isn't the great demand like we see or the economic benefit like we have for the large wind scale projects.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse","Very good. Thank you, guys.","Operator","And the next question comes from Paul Ridzon at KeyBanc. Please proceed.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets","I know that that is all permitted, but do those permits sunset at any point?","John G. Russell","Yes, they do, Paul. We've got about another I think a year and a half, something like that, 18 months as it is today. So if we move forward with it today in a combined cycle, we could do it, otherwise we'd have to re-permit it. But as we've talked about before, everything is in place. The sites there, we own it, we have generation on-site, electric facilities there are good, the gas facilities are good, and as we talked earlier in Dan's question if there was a need to drive and build that plant soon, I expect that the permitting process would go along very quickly.","Thomas J. Webb","And just remember the policymakers really will be driving for it, not against it.","John G. Russell","Right.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Great. And how long would that take to re-permit you think?","John G. Russell","Less than a year, could be nine months.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets","And then construction is what, pro month 18 months?","John G. Russell","Yes, start to finish probably say three years between permitting and final construction. So nine of that would probably be, 9 to 12 permitting but we'd be doing the engineering during that time, and then 24 months for construction.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets","And how should we think about balancing rates with CapEx if a plant is needed, would you defer some of the other capital to keep the 15.5 intact?","John G. Russell","No. Great question. We talked about this I think on some of the other calls, is that if the return, if the ROA customers return, that's about $150 million more in revenue to us and it's about a 4% discount for all of our customers across the board if they return. So we would probably, one way to think about is, eat into that 4% reduction to a small percent but all of our customers would benefit from that plant being built, not only in having the reliability in Zone 7 but also the fact the rates would go down not up.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets","And lastly just an update on what's happening in the UP and the discussion around that.","John G. Russell","Yes, what do you want me to say?","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets","I guess it's still a mess, right?","John G. Russell","Yes, I mean again let's just for everybody on the call, we're not involved in the Upper Peninsula in Michigan, we don't serve there. But I think what it does, Paul, is demonstrate to a lot of people in Michigan the unintended consequences of what I would call full deregulation. I mean even though it's not but basically 80% of the load shifted from WAC to Integras and right now at least for everybody listening it looks like the impact to 50% of the customers in the [inaudible] increase in rates on December 1, and that is not what we should be in as far as a business. So, yes, I think it's going to change, it changed people's outlook about deregulation.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Brian Russo from Ladenburg Thalmann. Please proceed.","Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann","I think you mentioned earlier that the $15.5 billion of CapEx can increase to $16 billion to $17 billion. Is that encompassing the potential for only CCGT if ROA is eliminated, and would that impact your EPS CAGR?","Thomas J. Webb","First of all, the first part of that question is, yes, it assumes \u2013 a lot of the capacity that we're talking about is not in the $15.5 billion. So as John just described, we'd have to pick up some of that. Remember, this addition, what we're doing here with the purchase of a plant is one of the cheapest adds of capacity that you'll see, and then building a Thetford is going to be a very efficient approach to what we would do as well. So the answer to point one is, it would increase our cost a bit, so we've left those out.","And then question two, I kind of leave it to you to think about what the answer is in regards to what we would do with our earnings guidance, because we look for every opportunity we could. You would naturally think that, let's raise the 5% to 7% to a higher number. We'll stick to the 5% to 7% and look for ways to put that benefit to work for our customers if we can, so we still deliver for them and for you.","Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann","Okay, great. My other questions were asked and answered. Thank you.","Operator","At this point, there are no further questions. So there are no further questions.","John G. Russell","Oh, great, alright, good. Well, first of all, thank you for joining us today on the call. First nine months were good months, they were good position for us, we're in a good position to meet our guidelines. Obviously we appreciate your continued interest in the Company and we look forward to seeing many of you at EEI over the next week or so. So with that, we'll close up the call. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

These factors could cause CMS Energy's and Consumers' results to differ materially.","This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of each of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is included in the appendix, and posted in the Investor section of our website.","Now, let me turn the call over to Tom Webb, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Tom Webb","Thank you, D.V., and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining our call. As always, we deeply appreciate your interest in our company and for spending time with us today. And John sends his regrets that he can't join us today. He is recovering from a medical procedure and we look forward to his return in a few weeks. I know he'll miss fielding your questions today.","So we'll begin the call with an overview of the quarter and provide an update on the legislative process, before turning to more detail on the gas business, the fast half and our growth model, and then we'll close with Q&A.","For the first half of the year, adjusted earnings per share were $0.98, down $0.07 from last year but up $0.03 on a weather-adjusted basis, were $0.13 ahead of plan. Today, we\u2019re reaffirming our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $1.86 to $1.89, and as you know, this reflects real growth of 5% to 7% of last year\u2019s actual results.","We filed our gas rate case last week for $85 million. Like our previous cases, it's small and primarily driven by capital investment. Even with this rate case, we expect total customer bills to decrease in 2016 due to lower gas commodity prices. Last month, we self-implemented our electric rate case at $110 million, and we expect an order for this case in December, which would mark 2.5 years since the last order. Our predictable growth has continued over that time and we have self-initiated many cost reductions to keep prices low for our customers.","Here you can see the impact of our actions along with constructive regulatory environment. Our industrial rates are at a competitive level that's attracting new business to the state. Rates could be improved further with changes to ROA policy, creating a competitive advantage for Michigan\u2019s business in the Midwest and in the country. As we've improved industrial rates, residential bills have remained low at about $3 a day.","Recently we committed do more in Michigan and help grow businesses. Our spending on in state goods and services will be $1 billion per year over the next five years. By helping to make Michigan a competitive state in which to do business, we are seeing growth. In Grand Rapids, the largest city in our service territory, housing, GDP, population growth and unemployment are all better today than Michigan as a whole and the U.S. Overall, Michigan is moving towards becoming a top 10 state and Grand Rapids is leading the way.","Michigan\u2019s energy law update can help to drive this growth. Bills are now in committees with the house and senate. Recently Senate Committee Chairman Mike Nofs introduced a comprehensive bill after considerable research and debate. The Senator\u2019s bill proposes to keep the ROA cap. However, the bill stipulates stringent requirements for both, ROA suppliers and customers. In order to protect all customers from reliability and price volatility, the supplier would be required to procure a minimum of three years of capacity. And ROA customers who decide to stay with alternative suppliers would be required to provide a three-year notice prior to returning to bundled utility service. Once the customer returns from ROA, they are no longer eligible to switch back.","These policy leaders are broadly in agreement with the integrated resources plan process which would give the state the flexibility it needs among many things, to enable investment in needed new generation and comply with state and federal environmental regulations. The IRP would replace the existing certificate of necessity process with a more comprehensive longer term decision making process. The IRP would provide us with the assurance of recovery and allow us to plan capacity resources for a decade or more. This transparent process could include new gas capacity, renewables and efficiency programs.","Now on the regulatory front, I'm please to highlight the Governor\u2019s announcement yesterday of the appointment of Norm Saari as a new Public Service Commissioner. He has a long track record of public and private service in the utility sector and public policy space. We look forward to working with him.","We continue to look at and evaluate new investment opportunities that could increase the capital spending in our 10-year plan. When we look at these opportunities, we evaluate each one by asking, does it add customer value; does it reduce O&M cost; does it help balance our fuel sources and\/or is it mandated by state or federal regulations, and none of our investments in the plan or those identified as opportunities are big bets.","Our gas business is one of the larger distribution systems in the country. This scale provides many investment opportunities for additional growth. We've been upgrading our compressor stations, installing new transmission lines and replacing aging infrastructure. We could do more and we could accelerate the pace.","Our plan calls for doubling gas investment over the next 10 years. This brings our investment mix to over one-third gas. Our customers benefit from the safety, reliability and cost effectiveness of the gas plant. If fuel costs remain low, additional headroom will allow us to make these investments without impairing price. On average, our gas customers spend about $2 a day. That's equal to their bill in 2004.","Now here's a little more detail on our results. For the second quarter, our earnings were $0.25 a share on both, a reported and an adjusted basis. This is a nickel below last year or a penny on a weather-normalized basis. Weather in June was the mildest in 15 years. Cooling days where 50% lower than last year. Economic sales also were flat as one substantial low-margin customer came through a temporary supply interruption.","For the first half of the year, our results were $0.98 or $0.86 on whether-normalized basis. That's $0.03 better than 2014. And at the mid-year checkpoint, we are $0.13 a share or 15% better than our plan. We have lots of room to move.","As you can see here with first half weather-normalized earnings up $0.03, we\u2019re positioned well. Even with a nickel of cost in the second half associated with new mortality tables and lower discount rates, our cost reductions of $0.12 more than offset this. For the full-year, costs are down about 3% and new rates already have been implemented.","At mid-year, our earnings per share is $0.13 ahead of plan, and like last year and many of the years and the decade prior to that, we added substantial customer reliability work and still plan to hit our 5% to 7% guidance. O&M reinvestment of $18 million is underway, including more forestry work at the utility and accelerating a planned major outrage at DIG from 2016 into this year. The DIG pull ahead accomplishes a double benefit of accelerating the DIG outage cost into 2015 when we had ample room to absorb it and bringing up capacity in what will be a very tight market in 2016.","In addition, we'll be increasing DIG\u2019s capacity by 38 megawatts and these reinvestments could add $20 million to profitability next year. From time to time, some of you ask us, how we accomplish consistent earnings growth year-end and year-out and how we do it without raising customer rates above inflation. As you know, we have a robust capital investment program and a substantial opportunity to increase it. However, we build our investment plan starting with customer rates growing no faster than inflation. And here is how we do that. Our O&M cost reductions worth about 2% a year; conservatively forecast sales growth of about 0.5 point a year; avoidance of block equity dilution worth about a point and other self-funds five points of investment. This permits earnings to grow 5% to 7% and customer rate impacts stay below inflation.","Here is our capital investment program for the next 10 years. Investment in our gas business grows substantially. Investment in our electric business continues to grow too but at a slower pace. And please remember that our earnings growth is not predicated on sales growth or cost reductions. Upsides from these are directed to our customers. Even without any upsides, our capital investment program over the next 10 years will be 45% larger than the last 10 years.","As a percent of market cap, CMS investment was 10% over the last 10 years. It\u2019s 16% over the next 10. This exceeds peers. The opportunity to increase that investment by as much as $5 billion to over $20 billion continues to be practical, particularly when many of the investment opportunities do not increase customer bills.","A lot of the capital investment we put in place enables us to reduce O&M cost. These are down 10% since 2006, and we\u2019ll reduce these costs another 7% by 2018. There is no magic to this cost reduction program. It\u2019s simple. Natural changes in our business like coal to gas generation and Pole Top Hardening make the difference.","Here is more detail around cost reduction actions, down 6% in two years as we switch from coal plants, which requires substantial number of people to operate, to gas generation and wind firms, which require about 10% of the workforce needed to run coal, we\u2019ll be able to reduce our O&M by $35 million. By continuing our program to harden our Pole Tops, we reduce future storm-related damage and we capitalize rather than expense that work. These are just a couple of examples of how we\u2019ve reduced our cost 3% last year and are in the middle of a program to do another 3% this year.","Since 2006 through 2014, ours is the only utility to reduce its cost, down almost 3% a year. We forecast reductions perhaps conservatively at 2% a year between 2014 and 2018. The outlook for the economy in our utility service territory continues to be bright. As you can see here, many companies from a variety of sectors have announced new factories and businesses. This will add new growth of almost 3%. Despite this, we continue to plan conservatively, including overall sales growth at about 1.5% over the next five years and industrial growth of about 2%. While this is another opportunity in our model to minimize customer rate growth, there may be a little upset.","One more element of the self-funding model that promotes robust rate base and earnings growth without allowing customer rates to grow faster than inflation is the benefit from a large stockpile of NOLs. Typically a utility would lose about 1% of its earnings growth through dilution associated with new equity to fund growth. In our case, we\u2019re fortunate to be able to invest our cash in utility growth rather than taxes avoiding full points of dilution. So the model is simple and perhaps it's a little unique. We start our planning by keeping nominal customer rate growth below inflation, or in other words, we provide real rate reductions. With cost reductions, modest sales growth, no block equity dilution and shrinking surcharges, we\u2019re able to grow rate base by 5% to 7% and with substantial opportunity to do more.","Many of our capital investment opportunities not yet in our plan can be accomplished without any increase to customer bills. This includes replacing PPAs as they expire and the potential that customers on ROA may return to bundled service, creating more headroom to pull ahead incremental capital investment.","So here's the PPA example of growth not included in our plan. We have more PPAs than our peers, and as they are replaced, we\u2019re able to build new gas generation at a cost that's lower than the existing PPAs. What a nice way to grow our business and provide reliability for our customers without increasing their bills.","And here is the opportunity should ROA customers choose to return to bundled service. As they return, which may be a better economic choice for them, all our customers can experience rate reductions of about 4%. This provides headroom for more investment to meet customer needs. Think of it by replacing expiring PPAs and building for returning ROA customers, we'd add 3,000 megawatts of new generation that's not yet in our plan. And this is without increasing customer bills at all, a clear win for our customers and a clear win for our investors.","You can see the need for new generation in MISO\u2019s most recent report. MISO updated their 2016 capacity forecast showing MISO will be short 1.5 gigawatts in Zone 7 by spring. With our newly purchased Jackson gas plant, we can provide sufficient capacity for our bundled customers. We can't however be sure if AES suppliers can do the same for those ROA customers. And by the way, our mix of coal field capacity has been reduced from over 40% to a third today, and as you can see in the appendix slide with coal plant closures next year, the mix will be below 25%.","With our business model, we've been able to deliver consistent earnings growth of more than 7% each year for over a decade, through recessions, through adverse weather, through changing policy leadership and through anything else that came our way. As we do, we hope you to see this as a sustainable model for our customers and our investors for a decade ahead.","As you can imagine, with this consistent investment growth, our operating cash flow as a percent of market cap has gone from less than our peers five years ago to greater than our peers today, with prospects that additional growth will provide an even larger cash flow. This is a nice place to be providing resources for the future, resources to invest more for our customers, more rate base growth and\/or improve capital structure.","So here is our sensitivity chart that we provide you each quarter to assist you with assessing our prospects. In this time of rising and volatile interest rates, it's comforting to know that our model is not very sensitive to changes in interest rates. At the utility, higher borrowing costs related to higher interest rates is largely offset by the impact of higher discount rates on our benefits and retiree programs and perhaps a higher return on equity in the future.","At the parent, our practice includes pre-funding parent debt two years in advance and maintaining a smooth maturity schedule. This insulates us from substantial risk to change in interest rates. If for example interest rates rise from our plan by 100 basis points, the annual earnings impact would be less than a penny a share, and we already include high interest rates in our 10-year plan.","Here is our report card for 2015. We\u2019re in a good position and at the midway point with substantial benefit from the Arctic blast earlier in the year and better-than-planned cost reductions so far this year.","We're putting the surplus to good use with reliability improvements for our utility customers and we\u2019re accelerating outages to enhance the outlook for 2016. Continuing our mindset that focuses on customers and investors permits us to perform well. We hope you agree. We've achieved substantial improvements in customer value and customer satisfaction. We have the best cost reduction track record in the nation. We are in our 13th year of premium earnings and dividend growth, and we plan to continue this performance for some time.","So thanks for your interest and your support. We appreciate your calling in, and we'd be delighted to take your questions. So operator, would you please open up the line?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly, and thank you very much Mr. Webb. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll pause for just a second. Our first question comes from Michael Weinstein with UBS. Your line is open.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Good morning, it's Julien here.","Tom Webb","Good morning. Nice to hear your voice.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Likewise. So I suppose first quick question if you don't mind, just with regards to legislative developments. Just to be very clear about expectations. As far as the latest proposals from Nof moving through this summer, is that still in line with what you're expecting in terms of return to ROA and return to customers?","Tom Webb","The bottom line is yes it is, and I would just comment, keep in mind that we\u2019re not planning on any return in our financial plans that you see. That's kind of all of an upside. We suspect as the policymakers work through this during the summer months and do something before the end of this year that from an ROA standpoint, there may be an economic opportunity that comes out of the law where customers will decide it's probably better to be with bundled service, because they are likely to have to secure not only energy but capacity as they go forward. And to do that, they may find bundled service a better place to do, and that's exactly what we like. We like seeing them make the right economic decisions. So the answer again to your question is yes.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Great, excellent. Perhaps coming back to the cost-cutting efforts. Just to be clear, how are you setting up in the next or I suppose the pull forward isn't quite happening to the same extent. What are you thinking year-over-year? Just I know you have a broader confidence in your 5% to 7% growth rate, but how do you think year-over-year in terms of cost-cutting effectiveness? I know it's a little early but just kind of curious.","Tom Webb","Well, we feel very good about what we're doing. As you recall, I mentioned that we\u2019re ahead of plan already. You can see that on the reinvestment slide when you have a chance to peek at that. You'll see our cost savings are better than what we anticipated to the extent of about four or five pennies. So that's pretty good. That's a big number. So the plans for this year are good. The reinvestment will continue. Now if I told you how much we\u2019d reinvest at the end of the first quarter call, it would be a lot more. And what I tell you at this call because of the cool weather that we had in June. But when you look at that reinvestment slide, you still see we\u2019ve got lots of room to move and lots of decisions to head, to tailor into what are the right places to put our money and still deliver for you on the profits.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Great. And a last little detail. As you're assuming we get some developments on the legislation in forthcoming periods, how swiftly thereafter would you anticipate making a filing or talking about new generation construction just in terms of a timeline since we\u2019re coming up against here potentially seeing this legislation going forward?","Tom Webb","Yes, a little premature to say exactly what we do because we need to see what the final shape of the plan is, but think of it in two fashions. There will be - likely be this new IRP process. So that will have work done by the state to start planning where we need to be to meet PPA requirements, to do our own state requirements on environmental, all of that. That will be followed by the official IRP process. So that will take a little while. So I suspect what you'll see in the law are some bridging actions. Now I'm just speculating, but take something like energy efficiency to ensure that we continue to do the good work we're doing today, there may be a little bridge that says you continue on the program you have today for a period of time before you go into new things. Is that sort of thinking that wants me to hesitate a little bit on how soon we say we'll announce new capacity, part of it will depend on how the ROA plan goes, returns to customers, part of it will depend on the needs of what may come out of the EPA in August and September, maybe more renewables. So we'll put all that together, be talking to the regulators and policymakers and then probably have something if you made me guess early next year to give you a sense of where we think we're going and what our proposals are.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Thank you very much. Good luck.","Tom Webb","Julien, thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Dan Eggers of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Dan Eggers","Hi. Good morning, guys. Just extending on Julien\u2019s question about the IRP process. Can you maybe walk through how you see it working as best you can tell right now, working with the commission to kind of layout the parameters for renewables, for efficiency, for conventional generation? And then with the shortfall in \u201816 in Michigan, even with the MISO updates, how you go about trying to resolve that in the context of a bigger policy goal?","Tom Webb","I'd be glad to do that. First of all, think about what we'll do. We'll make sure our bundled customers are covered. So from a capacity standpoint, we've got a lot of optionality, even though the state is going to be sure probably at the least the Lower Peninsula [ph] and the spring of next year, we will have tools to take care of our folks. What we\u2019re uncertain about and part of what the law is about is who is going to take care of the ROA customers. Is that something that the AESs are willing to do economically with those ROA customers or it's something where we really do need to step in for long-term planning basis.","So here are the steps. First, the public service commission will put some parameters together for the IRP filings. So it will take a little time to do that. Second, within a couple of years of the enactment, there has to be IRPs filed. So you see there is a little flexibility in there, but that's the next step, and that will include a long-term outlook. And then before we file an IRP, if you follow the bills the way they are structured today, we would do bid an RFP to make sure we understand what's out there in the market that we would factor into our plans.","Now you might think of that as, what does that mean? You're not going to able to build thing. I wouldn't think of that at all. I'd think of that as the common sense that we use. Remember, we were about to build a new gas generation plant in [indiscernible], and instead we twice went out on our own to check the market. And in the second check, which was last December, we found, my goodness there is a far better deal for our customers. So we were thrilled to put that in place and did that, change our capital investment totals at all? No, because we backfilled with things that we can't fit in today with things that needed to be fit in it and so that worked just perfect.","So then when you get into the RFP process, there is they call it a shot clock, interesting a little basketball hooper is in here. There will be a 270 day process for that to go through. So you see that's a little bit of a long process, and therefore there will be some bridging in between on several issues which could include energy efficiencies, it could include a bridging around generation plants where the existing con might be used as a quick process to cover needs in the future and not have to wait for a year or two or so to make those decisions. That\u2019s all up in the air. That\u2019s all the kind of discussion that's happening this summer, and everybody seems to have their heads screwed on very right to make sure that the state and our customers are taken care of. That makes sense?","Dan Eggers","It does. Now let me ask the simple question which is when we sit from the outside looking at next year, what should we look from you guys as far as how you address the shortfall in Michigan for \u201816 and \u201817?","Tom Webb","Well, two points. First point, remember, we are inside of those numbers you see. We\u2019re covered. We have adequate plans in place to take care of all of our bundled customers. If for some reason there was an emergency and I'll do a theoretical thing, all ROA customers chose to come back to bundled service right away, we would find short-term measures to cover that and think purchases on the market, think use of short-term PPAs, think DIG, think all the list of options like that, there are many. So short-term, we could be in very good shape. Longer term, we want to plan for more certainties. So what we would work on is how to put more permanent capacity in place in Zone 7, so our customers will essentially own their generation as opposed to renting it.","Dan Eggers","Okay, got it. I guess one last question, Tom. If you could just - what do you see as the kind of the big bridge drivers if we look at the second half of \u201815 versus \u201814? I think you probably need to make $0.15, $0.17 more in this second half than you did last year. Just what are kind of the chunky pieces you see helping to get to that number?","Tom Webb","Yes, that's a good question. If you can, if you\u2019ll refer to slide 12, you will happen to see sort of the best roadmap, but I think it's in the slides first half, second half. When you look at the second half, we already have programmed in actions that give us lower O&M, and that's in the $0.12 that you see, that's largely what that is. And those are all underway, so there is no like new cost reductions that desperately need to be found. And then you've got the mortality tables that are the full-year effect. You remember it was $45 million, so just the portion that impacts in the second half is about a nickel of bad news. Then you got rate release and everything else. Remember, just about all of our rate release that we\u2019re talking about is really second half. So think of the electric rate case as an example. On the electric rate case, we just self-implemented. So we\u2019re actually collecting that. We get all that upside as we go through the second half of the year, something we didn't have in the first half of the year.","So I would tell you there is a lot of natural things like that, that don't require a lot of wishing and praying or worrying of any kind. And then have you think about slide 13 that shows the reinvestment plan. We're actually still in the mode of looking where we deploy our resources in steps throughout the course of the year to go from $0.13 better than planned to what would leave you with a good 5% to 7% earnings growth.","So we are in, I'd say great shape. This is actually a fun place to be. It's little tougher when it's the other way like it was about three years ago when we had a really mild winter and we had a fine $0.13, which we did, and as you know, the actuals speak for themselves we're in great shape. So not a lot of pressure for us, but you can see our normal cost reductions coming in place. We\u2019re now getting rate release in the second half. We didn't have in the first half. And so the comps, I guess, are a little busy easier if you look at it that way.","Dan Eggers","Great. Thanks for time and best recovery wishes for John, please.","Tom Webb","Thank you for that. Thanks Dan.","Operator","The next question is from Jon Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Jonathan Arnold","Hi, good morning.","Tom Webb","Good morning, Jonathan.","Jonathan Arnold","Just quick question on the slide where you show the 6% to 8% opportunity versus 5% to 7% in the plan. Tom you mentioned - you have sort of short-term and long-term labels there. Can you just - it seems like you're going a step further towards raising the growth rate without actually doing that. How do you think about short-term, and are you meaning to imply that in the next year or so we could be there?","Tom Webb","I think that's fair enough. There is a mix of things, some of which are short-term and some of which are a little bit longer term. So when you think about the generation side of things, those are a little bit longer term adds into our plan, but there is plenty of short-term things to do as well. And I'm actually going to take you to slide that you prefer not to be taken to I think, instead of the one you're talking to, and that\u2019s slide 13 which shows the reinvestment curve again. Here is the best way I can encourage everybody to think about this. There are some very important things we don't have to do but we sure would like to do for our customers. Tree trimming is one of the simplest explanations I have. Our tree trimming cycle is closer to 10 years and it should be closer to five or six years. So the commission is kind enough to give us a little bit more with each rate case and then they know every time we can find an opportunity to do a little bit more when we have good news from cost reductions or weather or whatever it is, we also do a little bit more.","What I would caution everybody is, yes, underneath we could probably be growing a lot faster than 5% to 7%, but inside as long as we have that opportunity to do these important things for our customers, we\u2019re going to do those, and I think there will be things like that to do certainly this year, and I think certainly next year, and then we'll talk about the future after that and that's not a hint up or down, we'll just talk about that a little bit later.","The other thing it does for us is by doing this work like the DIG pull ahead and like more tree trimming and whatever, it actually makes it easier for us to deliver the next year because our customers are better off, we pull cost ahead that would have happened in the next year or the year after, but it makes it easier for us to deliver the good results that you need to see. So no move from the 5% to 7%, certainly not today.","Jonathan Arnold","So the - you do at some point run out of things that you can accelerate like will you catch up on tree trimming and is that part of the motivation for putting this opportunity number out there?","Tom Webb","Well, we get asked the question enough that we wanted to show with the investment profile how easy the model works. So if we had more investment, we can do that without putting stress on our customers and still give them average rate increases that are less than inflation. That's the point. The point is less so to say, look for 6% to 8% earnings growth in the near-term, just know that the capacity is there, but our desire to use that capacity this year, next year and who knows beyond that is important and it's paying off. It's paying off for our customers, and then indirectly it's paying off big time for all of our investors by allowing us to have that happy customer group as well as to be able to deliver that 5% to 7% every year.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay. So can I just - one follow-up on that, Tom, the NOLs. Can you remind us how much runway you still have on NOLs and how - when those end out of that sort of - how does that fold into the longer term growth outlook?","Tom Webb","Yes, we're good on NOLs for several years to go. The gross NOLs are near $1 billion still, and remember, then you got to net that for the tax effect. And I believe in your appendix you do have our operating cash flow slide, and it will show you in the bottom bright yellow bar when anybody gets a chance to look at that, that NOLs and credits are still positive and available all the way through 2020, and the NOLs are used up a little earlier than that depending on bonus depreciation and depending on other tax things. But at this point, we\u2019re still pretty comfortable telling you, we can go five years without any block equity because of that tax opportunity. I\u2019m a little embarrassed because every time I - once a year I have to explain to you it has to go out another year. Probably five years ago, I think we were telling you that we had five years to go and today our time is up, but fortunately we have another five years to go.","Jonathan Arnold","Great. Thank you, Tom.","Tom Webb","Thank you, Jonathan.","Operator","The next question is from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Your line is open.","Paul Patterson","Good morning.","Tom Webb","Good morning.","Paul Patterson","Just wanted to touch base a little bit on the sales growth. Could you give us a little bit more of a flavor as to when we look at the 0.5% growth, how much of that\u2019s focused on industrial versus the other rate losses?","Tom Webb","Yes, happy to do that. So we - our first half sales growth weather-adjusted weather-normalized for electric was flat. You'll see that in our addendum, you'll see that data.","Paul Patterson","Yes, I did see that.","Tom Webb","Yes. And you'll see residential down and commercial up a little bit. That's nothing to really get too nervous about because we've seen that flat to down to up a touch. It\u2019s oscillating. Those two are not making the big recovery. Now typically you would see after recession. So that's still ahead of us. That hasn't started happening yet. The point for today is probably more around the industrial side. When you look at the data, our growth was over 1% in the first half and we know that its underlying growth is better than 2%. So you may say what's happening. Now I have to be careful because I can't talk about a specific company, but there is an individual company that's a big customer, a very low margin customer of ours and they have an interruption on the supply side, and it was a stubborn one. And I'm not even sure and it's not my business to say when they'll be coming out of that, but obviously they\u2019ve worked their way through that. And when that comes back through, you'll see the industrial numbers back up to what we think is a more reasonable level. So keep in mind, we expect that to happen for the future and we really haven't factored in all the 3% of new growth from new businesses locating which will be largely late this year, mostly \u201816 and some \u201817. But the answer to your question was, in the analysis think industrial as of today.","Paul Patterson","Okay, but when we look at that 0.5% increase, how much, I guess, what I'm really saying is going forward? How much do you guys associate that coming from industrial versus higher margin residential and commercial?","Tom Webb","Yes, I can help you on that. So when you look at that, think of the long-term growth as flat to positive on residential and commercial. And that may be where we are under calling things a bit, because typically there is a point after recession where the jobs and the employment bring in more residential, which brings in more commercial. The industrial side in our assumptions going forward is the main driver because we have great visibility into that. We know the folks that are expanding. We know the folks that are shrinking, if they were, but mostly net expanding. And we know the folks that are coming into the state that have announced, who\u2019ve shared of that and those that are looking that we can announce because they haven't yet. So we feel pretty good on that side. Does that help?","Paul Patterson","That's very helpful. Just in terms of the sensitivity since you guys always provide, is that - when we look at that 1%, is that basically across the customer groups or is that pretty much with the same trends that you're seeing in terms of industrial leading that? Do you follow what I\u2019m saying?","Tom Webb","I do. That sensitivity we do on an average basis.","Paul Patterson","Okay.","Tom Webb","So, if you will, think about the sensitivity that would be oriented more to industrial than to residential, that would make the sensitivity a little less so, because residential is key in here. So we do an average.","Paul Patterson","Okay. And then IRP versus the mandate, which is one of the differences we see inside the legislation I think. Does that make a significant difference in terms of what you think the sales growth outlook would be, or is it just a question of what\u2019s selected in terms of making the - does it have an impact I guess on decision [ph].","Tom Webb","Yes, I don't think that's going to have a big deal on sales growth and competition where you were going. So when we talk about having or not having a mandate and using the IRP, that mandate would have been around renewables is a simple example. If you don't have a mandate because the policymakers would rather make sure that the IRP process is more thoughtful around what the important things are doing, and in an IRP process you might come up with 4% renewables as opposed to a mandate might say something else. The policymakers think the IRP process will be more thoughtful. And when we get into all the needs for capacity, for environmental compliance and those sorts of things, I think you\u2019re naturally going to see a mix of renewables, a continuing mix of energy efficiency and we\u2019ll probably need to put some capacity in place.","So when you were relating it to sales growth, I know you were thinking more choice. I would tell you, we've assumed 10% continues forever in our plans. So if you were to conclude that ROA customers might be coming back in this process that will actually help sales.","Paul Patterson","Okay.","Tom Webb","Okay?","Paul Patterson","That's great. Really appreciate it. Thanks so much.","Tom Webb","Pleasure. Thank you for calling in.","Operator","I\u2019m showing no further questions at this time, I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Webb.","Tom Webb","Thank you very much. We appreciate everybody joining us today. We had a strong first half. We look forward to the second half of the year and we expect to see an improved energy law as we've been talking about today, and we expect to see an order on our electrical rate case in December, and we expect to deliver predictable financial results. So thanks for your interest and spending time with us today. We'll see in the near future.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

The earnings news release issued earlier today, and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded.","After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] Just a reminder that there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12:00 PM Eastern Time, running through August 1st. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations.","Sri Maddipati","Thank you, Rocco. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. With me are Patti Poppe, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix, and posted on our website.","Now I'll turn the call over to Patti.","Patti Poppe","Thanks, Sri. And thank you everyone for joining us on our second quarter earnings call. This morning I'll share our first half financial results and outlook, and I'll also review our approved IRP settlement that lays the groundwork for our clean energy future. Rejji will add more details on our financial results and review the model. And as always, we'll close with Q&A.","The first half of this year was challenging, but manageable given our unique capabilities and our conservative planning. Despite unfavorable weather and significant storm activity, we remain on track through the first half of the year with earnings of $1.08 per share. As a result, we are reaffirming our full year guidance range of $2.47 to $2.51 per share with a bias to the midpoint, and we'll continue to manage the work as we adapt to changing conditions through the remainder of the year to achieve the results you expect.","While every year is different, the blueprint to the CMS model is simple and repeatable. We plan conservatively to deliver the consistent results that you can count on year in and year out. Our actions to reinvest positive weather in 2018, benefited customers last year and have positioned us well to meet our financial objectives this year, which Rejji will describe in more detail. This model, where we ride the roller coaster, so you can enjoy a smooth and predictable outcome, has served us well over the last decade plus. And we'll continue to utilize it going forward to achieve our 6% to 8% growth.","The major highlight for the second quarter was the MPSC's approval of our Integrated Resource Plan settlement. As clean energy leaders, we take pride in our long-term IRP, that is the map for our clean and lean energy future. We had broad support for our plan including, the Attorney General, the MPSC staff, residential and business customer groups, and environmental advocates.","In the near term, the settlement includes the planned expiration of the Palisades PPA in 2022, and the early retirement of two of our remaining five coal units Karn 1 and 2 in 2023. We'll meet our near-term needs with increased demand side resources, which have economic incentives, as well as 1,100 megawatts of solar, which will be procured through competitive RFPs conducted over the next three years for projects delivered in 2022 through 2024.","Half of the projects will be owned and included in rate base, and the other half will be contracted through PPAs on which we will earn our new financial incentive mechanism. A good portion of this including our demand response programs are not yet baked into our financial plans, and we consider it all as upside for our customers, our planet and our investors.","Longer term, the IRP calls for a total of 6,000 megawatts of solar to replace the expiration of the MCV contract and the retirement of our remaining three coal plants. There was once a time when we had to make a sucker's choice, between clean and expensive energy, or the cheap and dirty stuff, that just isn't true anymore. And our plan along with the broad support we have gained for it demonstrates that. There is not a trade-off here, only a trade up- affordable bills, a cleaner environment, and a higher quality mix of earnings. Our Michigan legislators understood this important balance when they passed the 2016 Energy Law, which included an increase in our renewable portfolio standard, and incentives for demand side resources and PPAs.","As we look to the future, we'll also begin incorporating more storage as costs continue to decline. Let me remind you that storage is not new to us, as we have been dispatching it for some time at the Ludington Pumped Storage facility and understand the value that it provides to our customers, which is why my story of the month really is a story of the last half-century. 1969 was the year we began construction with our partners at DTE at the Ludington Pumped Storage facility. Those of you who heard the music while waiting for our call might have noticed it was all from 1969. No detail left unattended at CMS.","There on that bluff overlooking Lake Michigan, we built what was at the time, the world's largest battery that has served our customers for over 50 years. We recently renewed its license with FERC for another 50.","While initially built to utilize excess power produced by nuclear power plants at night, now Ludington is a key asset in our portfolio as we integrate more renewables. We began an upgrade of the facility in 2011, which will be completed next year. This upgrade creates about 420 megawatts of additional capacity, making Ludington Pumped Storage the fourth largest pumped storage facility in the world. In fact, we have the six largest motors in the world, each at 500,000 horsepower of clean energy production. Now that's the muscle car after my own heart.","The upgrade will improve the efficiency of the facility, while also reducing the time it takes to refill the pond. In other words recharge the battery by five hours. For our estimates, Ludington offers an annual value to our customers of about $60 million through the energy and capacity it provides. For over 50 years, we've integrated storage in our daily generation strategy including pricing it into the day ahead in real-time MISO markets. As a result, we've had plenty of time to familiarize ourselves with how batteries work on our system. In fact, we consider ourselves storage experts.","We look forward to technology advancements that allow us to take advantage of additional low cost battery storage in the future. Switching gears to regulatory matters. Governor Whitmer made another appointment to the commission, and I would like to take a moment to congratulate Commissioner Tremaine Phillips on his appointment and thank Commissioner Saari, who has served this state well, in many capacities.","Commissioner Philips is a Democrat, and formerly served as Director of the Cincinnati 2030 district, a project focused on sustainable energies. He also worked in Governor Granholm's Administration on Michigan related energy policy. Over the next few years, we look forward to working with Commissioner Phillips, Commissioner Scripps, who was another great recent addition to the commission, and Chairman Talberg, who will retain her role as chair at this time.","It's worth reminding you that our model allows us to perform consistently regardless of changes at the commission, unfavorable weather conditions, the economy, or other external factors. Our track record demonstrates our ability to deliver consistent premium results year, after year, after year, and this year, you can expect the same.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rejji.","Rejji Hayes","Thank you, Patti, and good morning everyone. For the second quarter, we reported net income of $93 million, which translates into $0.33 of earnings per share. Our second quarter results were $0.15 below our Q2 2018 results, largely due to mild weather, which impacted our electric volumetric sales. On a year-to-date basis, we have delivered $306 million net income or $1.08 per share, the latter which is $0.26 per share lower than our financial results in the first half of 2018.","Weather continue to be the key driver of financial performance in 2019, starting with the substantial storm activity experienced in our electric service territory in Q1, which led $0.09 in negative variance versus the first half of 2018. In the second quarter, we saw cooling degree days approximately 30% below normal, which also contributed the negative variance in the electric business, and is offset in the positive gas sales we've seen over the course of 2019.","Weather aside, the balance negative variance versus 2018 was largely driven by anticipated underperformance enterprise in the first half of the year, and a higher effective tax rate, both of which were incorporated into our EPS guidance for the year. These headwinds were partially offset by rate relief, net investment-related costs, which provide $0.07 positive variance relative to the first half of 2018.","That said, we remain on track to achieve our full year EPS guidance, as Patti noted, given the back-end loaded nature of our 2019 plan which we highlighted earlier this year, and a steady implementation of cost control measures over the course of this year, which has kept us on the plan. As always, we plan conservatively and manage the work to meet our operational and financial objectives year in and year out, and 2019 will be no different.","To elaborate on the glide path for the second half of the year on the right hand side of the waterfall chart on Slide 12, you can see the key components of our year-to-go financial plan, which gives us a high degree of confidence that we'll achieve our 2019 financial objectives.","As always, we plan for normal weather, and you can see the benefits of last year's cost pull aheads which provided 20% of expected positive variance versus the second half of 2018 more than offset the absence of favorable weather in 2018. To put the magnitude of last year's pull aheads in context, in 2017 we had operating and maintenance expenses of approximately $970 million and spent just under $1.1 billion in 2018 funded by last year's weather driven financial upside, which is why we're confident the 2019's O&M spend will be well below the 2018 levels.","The remaining six months of the year also include about $0.12 of additional rate relief, net investment related cost driven by the previously set electric rate case and the expectation of a constructive outcome in our pending gas case for which we're scheduled to get a commission order by the end of September. Lastly, we expect the balance of our year to go plan to be comprised largely of cost savings, and non-weather sales performance at the utility, and enterprise earnings contribution, all of which are forecast and enumerated in the table on the lower right hand side in the page.","Now I'll touch on these more in detail. Starting with utility as discussed in the past, every year we plan for 2% to 3% net cost savings which are reflected in our estimates of $0.06 to $0.09 of positive variance. And so the top line, we anticipate weather normalized sales to be flat for the year versus 2018, which reflects the usual conservatism, and we have been encouraged by the favorable mix that we have seen over the past several months, as our higher margin residential and commercial customer segments have exceeded expectations. So we're forecasting about $0.06 to $0.08 of EPS pickup there.","As for enterprises for our initial guidance, enterprise earnings are expected to be back-end weighted, as lower capacity sales are being attributable to the residual effects of the 2018 MISO planning resource auction roll-off. So we'll begin to see the positive variance versus 2018 in the second half of the year as our fully contracted 2019-2020 plan year capacity contracts commence.","Closing out the 2019 war, the weather has largely been a headwind of the electric business in the first 6 months of the year. We have been encouraged by the volumetric sales trends we have seen in July with cooling degree days approximately 10% above normal on electric service territory to date. We've estimated about $0.04 potential upside to our plan attributable to the July weather, but needless to say we never plan for weather to drive our financial performance. So we'll continue to manage the business with a healthy level of paranoia the benefit of customers and investors.","As a reminder for how we have managed to perpetuate our success over the years, our focus on cost controls, conservative financial planning, and proactive risk management underpin our simple but unique business model depicted on Slide 13, which enables us to deliver consistent industry-leading financial performance, year in and year out.","We have a robust backlog of capital investments, which improves the safety and reliability of our electric and gas systems for our customers, and drives earnings growth for our investors. We fund this growth largely through cost cutting, tax planning, economic development, and modest non-utility contribution, all efforts which we deem sustainable in the long-run. As such, we are confident that we can continue to improve customer experience through capital investments while meeting our affordability and environmental targets for many years to come.","Digging into the core elements of our business model was announced earlier in the year. We have a capital investment plan of over $11 billion over the next 5 years, which focuses on the safety and reliability of our gas and electric systems, as well added renewable generation as depicted on slide 14. Our capital investment needs remain significant beyond the five-year period.","With our IRP in the execution phase, a gas rate order pending and the initial stages of our financial planning cycle underway, we look forward to providing an update to our 10-year capital plan in the fourth quarter. As we plan for the future, the key constraints for our long-term capital investment plan will be customer affordability, and balance sheet and workforce capacity. As for the quarter, we remain acutely focused on cost reduction opportunities throughout our cost structure, which offers over $5 billion of opportunities, excluding depreciation and amortization expense.","Over the next decade, the exploration of the high-priced Palisades and MCV power purchase agreements should collectively deliver approximately $150 million of annual savings over time. Also the gradual retirement of our coal fleet will provide substantial O&M and fuel savings beginning with the retirement of our Karn 1 and 2 units in 2023, which we estimate will generate approximately $30 million of O&M savings. And while we remain coal plant operators, we continue to seek opportunities to reduce our structural costs as evidenced by the recent renegotiation of the fuel transportation costs at our Campbell units which has led to an estimated $150 million of nominal savings over the next several years.","These opportunities on the supply side of the business will be supplemented with capital enabled savings, as we modernize our electric and gas distributions, which should reduce our operations and maintenance expenses. Lastly, the CUA will serve as the key pillar of our cost reduction strategy over time as we eliminate waste throughout the organization.","These efforts will provide a sustainable funding strategy for our capital plan which will keep customer bills low on an absolute basis and relative to other household staples in Michigan as depicted in the chart on the right hand side of Slide 50. Another element of our self-funding strategy is economic development and slide 16, illustrates our success in attracting new industrial activity to our service territory over the past several years, which is augmented steady organic growth in our residential and commercial segments.","As highlighted in Q1, we're targeting 100 megawatts of new load in 2019 and continue to trend on plan with 50 megawatts secured through the first half of the year. We also continue to see attractive levels in diversity in our new load, which is reflective of our electric service territory. As you'll note in the pie chart on the right-hand side of the page, in 2018 approximately 2% of our customer contributions came from the auto industry.","As we continue to invest capital and manage customer prices, we are also dedicated to maintaining a healthy balance sheet and robust access to capital markets. On slide 17, we have a snapshot of our credit ratings at the utility, and the parent and I'm pleased to report that the positive trend continues. Moody's recently reaffirmed their ratings, the utility secured bonds, and the parent company's senior unsecured bonds at Aa3 and Baa1 respectively.","It's also recently reaffirmed their strong ratings for the utility secured bonds at 8+. And S&P sits nicely with a single A for the utility secured bonds and a triple B rating the parent senior unsecured bonds. These ratings are reflective of our strong balance sheet and operating cash flow generation, which reduces cost for our customers and fund our capital plan efficiently to the benefit of investors.","And with that, I'll pass it back to Patti for some concluding remarks before Q&A.","Patti Poppe","Thanks. Reggie. We believe we have a compelling investment thesis that will serve our customers and investors for years to come.","And with that, Rocco please open the lines for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much, Patti. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Sullivan of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Michael Sullivan","Hey, everyone. Good morning.","Rejji Hayes","Good morning, Michael.","Patti Poppe","Good morning, Michael.","Michael Sullivan","Hey, so just first I think in Q1, you guys described, the year is tracking, I think, $0.01 better relative to plan and now in Q2, it seems like pretty much on plan even with some of these headwinds in Q1 and then the tailwinds in Q2. I guess, can you just give us a little more detail on what the additional levers you have to pull in case weather is below normal or worse than normal in the second half of the year, since it looks like you're just budgeting for normal?","Rejji Hayes","Sure, Michael. So, very good question. And as always, I would just start by saying, whenever we prepare a financial plan for any given year, we make sure that first and foremost, we plan conservative, but also our plan has sufficient contingency across a number of working assumption to make sure that in the event weather is sub-optimal, in the event there is a sub-optimal regulatory outcome that we have enough cushion to provide for again any downside case.","And so again, as we always say, we do that we're the investment community and that's where our plan reflects. And so as you think about the first couple of quarters that we've had, we're $0.01 ahead, and we feel like we're on plan at this point even with, I'll say mild weather in June as well as a strong activity in Q1.","And so, we have managed the cost as we always have, and that includes a number of, I'll say, opportunities that we execute on over the course of the year. So we've been very advantageous on the non-operating side. So we've done refinancings that have provided cost savings in excess of plan. And so we did take our bond in Q2 that provided savings that we hadn't anticipated.","We've also found some tax planning opportunities that have created additional upside. And then the operating side, we continue to look at opportunities through deferral potential spend opportunities for stretch goals and things of that nature. So there are always flex down opportunities that we look out over the course of the year that we will execute on, if we see downside.","Patti Poppe","And Michael, I'll add that we really have ramped up our waste elimination work. It is our play of the year for the CUA, and it's the power of the CUA. We've been -- we're in really our third full year of implementation, and we are feeling the benefits of being able to deploy a new capability quickly across the organization, and that's what's important about running a lean operation, and a lean operation you can adapt to changing conditions.","So the conditions this year are able to benefit from the great work that we did in '18 to pull ahead expenses. And so as Reggie described, pulling ahead maintenance in 2018 has allowed us to defer other maintenance that might have otherwise been done in this 12-month period because we did it early. But more importantly, I would say the capability we are building around waste elimination, and just imagine our thousands of employees all across the state, learning how to see and eliminate waste.","Simple things like how we stuff the bills at the billing and mailing center for our bills. When we do construction projects, a contractor picks up their equipment. Rental fees on the equipment, when we don't in a timely basis, get them to come pick up their equipment can pile up. So, we've improved our process simply to make sure that the rental equipment gets off our property, and off our books, and off our ledger as quickly as possible.","So it's little things all across the state that add up and allow us to be more nimble as conditions like this change and I would even offer in this most recent storm that we just experienced here in Michigan.","Our storm response was extraordinary. We were able to get our contractors off the system faster, we were able to get mutual assistance optic system faster because we have done a lot of work utilizing the CUA to improve our processes, and improve our storm response because it's such a major part of the customer experience.","So all those little things add up and create this nimbleness and provide the confidence that we have that this back-end loaded part of our plan leverages last year's favorable unplanned conditions, to deal with unplanned negative conditions that occur this year that are outside of our control. What we can control is how we respond and we're doing that extraordinarily well.","Michael Sullivan","Great, and thanks for the color there. And just to clarify, as a follow-up, the July sales that you're showing there benefit that's -- you guys are also factoring in any sort of headwind that you may have experienced from the storms over the last weekend?","Rejji Hayes","So the $0.04 that I highlighted in my prepared remarks, that reflects the gross sales that we realized as a result of at least the July weather we've seen to-date. The impact of the storm for our preliminary estimates is about $8 million of O&M, and I'd say that's about a couple of cents and so our $0.04 of upside for the July weather did not take that into account.","But again, going back to my initial comments, we do plan for contingency for a number of our, I'll say, cost buckets including storms and so we do have contingency in our service restoration cost assumptions for the year, which will absorb the cost of that storm. So we still feel good about the July upside that I articulated.","Michael Sullivan","Okay, great. And then one final one, just flipping over to the regulatory side, I think you've got an ALJ decision due in the gas rate case next week, I was just curious how you're feeling about that and potential for settlement given it seemed parties weren't too far apart? And then just kind of going forward, I see you're going to file again shortly thereafter, and just how you're thinking about maybe being able to space out the cadence of rate cases over the long-term going forward?","Patti Poppe","Yeah, one thing that became abundantly clear -- is abundantly clear through the staff's position on this gas rate case, Michael, is that there is a strong support for gas investment. The safety of our system, the age of our system warrants strong and diligent attention. And so that's why I think you would see that in that staff position, we were very close. In fact the rate base that they recommended and we requested, was the same at $6.5 billion. So we feel good about that.","Sometimes, it's good to let a final order go all the way, let a case go all the way to a final order. We have had success with settlements and I think that that's been representative of the constructive regulatory treatment, and environment here in Michigan, and our relationship with all of the extended parties who participate in a rate filing. But we think going potentially to a final order in this case would not be a risky outcome given our mutual commitment for gas investment.","We do anticipate filing our next case in the fourth quarter of this year, and that's simply because we have so much work to do on the gas system to make it safe. And the good news is over the last five years, for example, we've reduced customers' bills by 28%, driven both by the commodity price, but also the cost savings that we've delivered on the gas side of the business.","So our unit costs for all of the work that we do continue to decline as we implement the CE Way, and we're able to do more work for less dollars, get more value-added for customers, and that's important because of the volume of work that the system really does require these days. So we do anticipate filing another case at the latter half of this year -- fourth quarter of this year.","Michael Sullivan","Great, thanks a lot.","Patti Poppe","Yeah. Thanks, Michael.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Greg Gordon of Evercore. Please go ahead.","Greg Gordon","Hey, good morning.","Rejji Hayes","Good morning, Greg.","Patti Poppe","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon","So I know you specifically -- Rejji you specifically address this in part on the call when you talked about sales growth for the year, that you're seeing reasonably good strength and higher margin residential sales, but have you seen lag on commercial and industrial sales relative to what your plan was. And is that -- if so, or if not, how is that related or not related to what's going on with trade tariffs, et cetera and pressure we're seeing on the auto industry?","Rejji Hayes","Yeah, good question, Greg. So I would say, first, let me start with the commercial side. We actually have been quite encouraged with the commercial activity we've seen relative to plan and so when we talk about favorable mix it's not just residential, but also commercial.","And so commercial actuals to date, still exceed our expectation along with residential. And so I'll point you to the numbers that we have in our disclosure. But we're about 0.5% down in the weather not normalized basis year-to-date versus 2018. As we've said in the past, that's net of our energy efficiency programs so obviously when you gross up the 1.5% reduction in customer uses that we work to achieve every year.","We're actually up about a point on commercial, and so the customer accounts really would go to on the commercial side. We're up about 1% on a rolling LTM basis, and so customer counts are for commercial and residential. And then for industrial while we've seen a little bit of softness there down about 2% with energy efficiency included in that about 0.5% growth, so taking out energy efficiency.","We're actually seeing a pretty good story from our smaller industrial customers, because if you take out basically one large low margin customer were basically flat net of energy efficiency, and so if you think about that again excluding energy efficiency, up about 1.5%.","So we continue to be encouraged by the trends we're seeing across all of our customer classes. I do think there is a little bit of a slowdown we're seeing at least for the first part of year, for some of our larger industrial customers and whether that has to do with trade wars or broader economic effects, I think remains to be seen. We always highlight in the upper left hand corner of that sales slide that we're continuing to see very good trends economically and Grand Rapids, which is in the heart of our service territory.","And so whether it's GDP, whether it's unemployment, population growth, building permits, all of that continues to trend quite well. So we still think it's a very nice economic story in our service territory, and I think it's too early to tell whether there are any broader macro themes taking place nationally or globally.","Greg Gordon","Great, thank you. Clear.","Rejji Hayes","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Eric Lee of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, please go ahead.","Aric Li","Hi, good morning.","Patti Poppe","Good morning, Eric.","Aric Li","Hey, so just shifting gears a little bit in terms of thinking about the longer term opportunity ahead. Could you speak a bit to renewable prospects beyond the initial 1.1 gigawatts laid out in IRP approval as well as just maybe the PPA earning aspects in regard to that, I think, the longer-term mix for rate base and PPA there?","Patti Poppe","Sure. Obviously, our IRP paints a very clear picture of by year when we'll be adding these additional 6,000 megawatts of specifically solar, while we are also doing the demand response and energy efficiency to soften the peak and reduce that demand that's required on peak that the whole system is built around. And so as we look at our 6,000 megawatt path, it was important that we build the plan to pre-build that solar before the big PPA at MCV and the remaining coal plants come offline.","We need to make sure that that solar is installed, working as plan, that we've learned how to optimize and dispatch that much solar across our system. And so we have a pretty methodical plan, as we go across actually the years. In the neighborhood of 300 to 500 megawatts of solar beginning in 2021 and going all the way to 2030, we end at 600 megawatts of solar by 2030 per year. So that ends up then when you add all of that up, that 6,000 megawatts total of solar by the end of our 2040 IRP time horizon. So you can see it's pretty systemic.","Now keep in mind that one of the great things that we negotiated in our IRP settlement, is this agreement that we would build half and rate base that half of the solar and that's through potentially build on transfer, perhaps we'll build it ourselves. We're going to have to do -- we in fact want to do an annual RFP to set the proper price for that new solar being added to the system, which really bodes well for customers and allows us to make sure we have the lowest cost new solar every single year taking advantage of the cost curve, and the technology curves in solar.","The other half then would be built by others and we would then earn our financial compensation mechanism, which is currently at 5.88%, which is unknown proclamation of our weighted average cost of capital to as a financial compensation mechanism on top of the price of those PPAs.","So we think it's very good on many fronts and most importantly sets a level playing field here in Michigan for the implementation of new solar that's to the benefit of both the planet, and our customers, and therefore then our investors through both the financial compensation mechanism in the fact that we will be rate basing half of that.","Aric Li","Got it. And just quickly in regards to that. Is there a potential for perhaps beyond the initial 1.1 more rate base or even maybe say a higher FCM?","Patti Poppe","We re-file the IRP anywhere from every -- we're required by law to file it within five years. We agreed in our settlement to file another IRP in three years. And I can't predict what will come out of that settlement or another IRP. Rather we'll obviously always look to adapt and change as conditions change, as the market changes to the benefit of customers and investors. And so each filing that we do will of course have opportunities to improve the framework.","Aric Li","Got it. And when should we think about storage spend kicking in more meaningfully? I know you've spent some time on that earlier.","Patti Poppe","Yeah, right now we have it at the latter part. We have 450MW at the latter part of the IRP and personally your guess is as good as mine, but I would be shocked if sometime in the next 20 years, there is some breakthrough in storage, given the commitment of automakers to electric vehicles does create a marketplace for technology, and R&D, and storage. We are so closely linked to that our US automakers here in Michigan and our partnership with GM, and Ford, and Chrysler has been very strong. And so we will, I think, be in a position to take advantage of smart storage a sooner than later.","We have a pilot. We're running this summer with residential storage application. We've got a couple of batteries installed at some commercial locations. We're doing a lot of learning and I forecast that as we filed subsequent IRPs will be able to model additional reductions in costs on storage going forward. We're hopeful for that, because we think it will be a better way to balance the system over time with renewable energy as a primary energy source.","Aric Li","Great. Good to hear. And one last question and I'll shift back to the queue. What do you think about the potential for maybe accelerated coal retirements and your renewable development given potential appetite at the MPSC?","Patti Poppe","We did a lot of studying in our plan about the right timeline for our current -- our remaining coal plant retirements. Of course, again every IRP will consider. But here something really important to remember with the coal plant retirements. I have co-workers there who have dedicated their lives to delivering energy for the people of Michigan. And so, both for our coworkers and the communities where those plants, an important tax base, it's important that we recognize that giving them an accurate date of closure, so they can plan their lives, so those communities can plan for redevelopment.","It's important that we stick to the plan that we published, so that they don't feel like we're taking advantage of them. And so when we talk about our triple-bottom line of serving people, the planet, and profit. This people aspect of the transformation of our energy system is equally important to serving the planet, and then delivering earnings for our investors.","So that is a key component of driving the timeline. And frankly, we also have to build out all the solar and make sure it works as intended, and make sure that we have the capacity that we need when we retire those plants. So those two factors really do drive our current timing. And we feel good about the current timing. We think it's well ahead of -- much of the country will end up with an 80% carbon reduction by 2030, and 90% -- over 90% carbon reduction by 2040 that's a decade ahead of the peer\u2019s climate core, that's a decade ahead of most -- many of our peers. And so we do feel like our aggressive actions that we've taken to date, retiring a gigawatt of coal already, does reiterate our commitment to the planet. But we also think the triple bottom line is important in the execution.","Rejji Hayes","Eric, the only thing I would add an additional to all Patti's good remarks around the resource adequacy operational employee, I'd say implications of an accelerated call shutdown. There also is a consideration from a balance sheet perspective, and so you still have Moody's, which continues to include securitizations in their credit metric calculation. And so you could definitely anticipate a scenario, which you had an accelerated coal retirement plan that led to a significant levering of the balance sheet, because remember, when you securitize these assets, they effectively get 100% funded by debt.","So while, do you still have that constraint in place, I think it really does hamper any accelerated coal retirement case. And so that's also keeping strength worth noting.","Aric Li","I appreciate your time.","Patti Poppe","Thanks, Eric.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Weinstein of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Michael Weinstein","Hi guys, good morning.","Rejji Hayes","Hey, Michael.","Patti Poppe","Hey, Michael.","Michael Weinstein","Hey, my question is about the long-term capital plan in light of, with the IRP approved. I'm just wondering at what point do you anticipate at this time rolling that into the long-term plan, the 10-year plan -- and can you -- what can you say about it now in advance of the official rolling out of those numbers?","Rejji Hayes","Yeah, Michael. I would say, as from our prepared remarks, we anticipate at some point in the 4th quarter will provide color on a new 10-year plan. So I would say it would either be on our Q3 call which takes place in the 4th quarter or potentially EEI, but it will be one of those two scenarios, most likely.","And as we said in the past, our expectations are at least quite high that it will be in excess of the prior 10-year plan that was rolled out in September, 17 of about $18 billion or reaffirmed during the Investor Day. And so, we'll be in excess of that given the opportunities afforded by the IRP, but we also have a significant capital investment backlog as we've talked about in the past on our wires and pipes.","So both of the electric and gas distribution systems. And so we do think there are incremental capital investment opportunities, and the key constraint will be customer affordability, as well as balance sheet, and workforce constraints. And so we have to make sure that all of that works out. So we're going through the math for the front end of our planning cycle, the IRP was a gating item which is now behind us. But we have to go through all of those machinations and things that our customers can afford, as well as our investors and employees. Well, we can get from an operational perspective. So those are all the key things we're thinking through.","Michael Weinstein","I mean, as you --- and your thought process on the 6% to 8% growth rate is that would be unchanged even with a higher plan. Right?","Rejji Hayes","No, we don't provide EPS guidance beyond a five-year period. So the current five-year plan of $11 billion, that from our perspective can deliver 6% to 8% EPS growth. And I wouldn't even suggest that when we rollout a 10-year plan we'll provide 10-year EPS guidance. Because I think that maybe unprecedented, we are fortune 500 company.","So we'll see where we end up, but we are planning of a five-year plan in Q1 of next year that will likely have some estimate around EPS growth and for 10-year plan that will just be on the capital side, but not much color beyond that.","Michael Weinstein","All right, thanks. You guys are -- have always been trend setters. So you never know, right?","Rejji Hayes","Well said, Michael.","Patti Poppe","Nice, Michael. Nice quote, we hear you.","Michael Weinstein","All right. Thanks a lot.","Patti Poppe","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Praful Mehta of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Praful Mehta","Hi guys.","Patti Poppe","Hi, Praful.","Hey, Praful.","Praful Mehta","Hi. So may be firstly on the, the cost part and the O&M. Because clearly in 2019 you're benefiting from some of the stuff that you did in 2018 to push cost around. How should we think about going forward from a profile perspective? Given -- if you have in a reduced cost in 2019, does that mean that we should think about that going up back again in 2020? Just from a profile perspective, how do we think about those costs?","Rejji Hayes","No. I think, Praful, really 2018 should not be viewed as any sort of comp for future years. And that's why it's difficult. When you think about the way in which we manage the business, the way in which we manage the work, 2018 obviously we had almost $100 million of weather driven upside. And so we really ramped up the operating and non-operating pull-aheads of the course that year, which is why we're I think just under a billion in one of O&M costs, and this year we expect to be well below that.","So when we think about the baseline, when we look at what we budgeted for 2019 and we'll try to take 2% to 3% off of that as we often do on a net basis, and that will dictate where we end up for the 2020 plan and beyond. And as we think about just in general, our cost structure, there really are kind of two approaches for how we think about our financial planning.","There are planned cost savings that incorporated into our budget. So we look at non-operating and operating opportunities like waste elimination as Patti highlighted. We've talked about attrition management in the past tax planning revise. And then we have planned initiatives during the year.","So we're doing a lot of work in the supply chain to take advantage of economies of scale, IT solutions adding more automation across the organization to realize cost. Those are planned opportunities that we incorporate in the budget. And then in to a year, as we get into a year, we see, I'll say, unforeseen sources of upside or downside then we flex. And so a year like this year, where we've seen historical levels of service restoration cost attributable to storms, as well as mild weather.","That's when we start looking at things like, okay should we defer some ambitious plans we have that are strategic or operational in nature that we will not need to be done this year; do we look at things around non-compliance opportunities on the training side. So, that's when we start to look at into a year opportunity. But generally the baseline is usually what has been planned for in the current year and then we try to take 2% to 3% off of that. So 2018 really isn't a proxy for what a run rate O&M is for us. Is that helpful?","Praful Mehta","Yeah, that's very helpful. Thanks Rejji. Good detailed color, which always is helpful. And then maybe secondly on the credit side. And you talked Rejji, a little bit about the securitization.","Also I think the PTAs could get imputed as debt from a rating agency perspective. So how should we think about the credit and the equity needs going forward? You've clearly benefited from some of the tax pieces that you've got in terms of AMT credits. But going forward, how should we think about that in the 150 a year in terms of equity, is that still kind of the plan, or do you see that moving around a little bit?","Rejji Hayes","Yeah. We will want to see. I mean obviously we've just commenced our five-year planning cycle, and so we're not going to roll-out a new five-year plan until Q1 of next year. That will incorporate, I'll say, some of the implications around the IRP, and Karn, and some of the puts and takes. I still generally believe that our five-year plan will look very similar to the current plan, we were maybe a little over $11 billion. But will have I'll say relatively modest amount of equity issuances per year. That allow us to keep the credit metric range of, call it 17% to 18% FFO to debt.","So remember we have managed the balance sheet, very conservatively for the last several years, when we do have really hospitable capital markets. We didn't go on M&A binge, we didn't do any levered repos, we just chipped away at our balance sheet with equity issuances to fund our capital plans and grew the business organically. And so even post-tax reform, that's given us a lot of latitude to continue to modestly fund the business with equity. And we think even if there is a Karn, or when there is a Karn retirement in the securitization besides of that, it shouldn't really balloon out our equity needs.","And remember with the PPAs, even though there will be a levering effect of that, the financial compensation mechanism does partially offset that, because we will get earnings on those PPAs and that's in fact part of the reason why we structured it that way. So we feel very good about the balance sheet going forward, but it's premature to talk about exactly what the equity needs will be until we rollout our new 5-year plan in Q1 of next year.","Praful Mehta","Got you. Again, super helpful with the detail. But so we should think about it in the range of the same 150, is that still fair?","Rejji Hayes","I think, directionally that's correct. But I will be more precise clearly when we roll out the plan next year.","Praful Mehta","Got it. Thanks so much guys.","Rejji Hayes","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Travis Miller of Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Travis Miller","Good morning. Thank you.","Patti Poppe","Good morning, Travis.","Travis Miller","I was wondering if outside of the utility now, if you could update strategic direction thoughts there for enterprises, and then also if anything has changed with EnerBank?","Patti Poppe","Yeah, nothing new on EnerBank, yes, we've repeated the last couple of calls. No new news there. They continue to be a part of our portfolio, a very small part that is relatively essentially self-funded, and so no changes there. Enterprises, you'll have noticed that they've done a couple of new renewable projects, very small, very targeted, customer driven.","They've been driven by customers approaching us that we have starved, and either our enterprises business or our utility business outside of our regulated service area. And so we've been able to meet the needs of say, Lansing Board of Water & Light with a 24 megawatt solar installation there, 105 megawatts of wind in Ohio for General Motors. But those are more opportunistic in nature and we do feel well positioned.","We like to say we're big enough to matter, but small enough to care. And for example in Lansing -- Lansing Board of Water & Light is right here in Michigan, and they had multiple developers go out of business in their attempt to install and build out this wind -- this solar project.","And so we have the capability of doing those projects, but we don't show up in our private jets. We drive our load truck over from across the street, and help them do their work. And that's a good positioning for us and for enterprises. And so where we do have additional projects, we want enterprises to grow as the utility growth and -- but don't be confused, our utility business is the primary driver of earnings and our plans for growth.","Travis Miller","Okay, great. And then just two quick on Enterprises based on what you said there. One is, what do you think that market is large, do you think that market is for customers coming to you presumably wanting the renewables in the future? And then also, would enterprises be eligible to apply for some of those or participate in the RFPs on the utility side?","Patti Poppe","Yeah. Your second question first, our affiliate is not allowed to compete for the renewable projects. But I would also offer -- we don't have an eye on the specific market size because again, as I mentioned, we're really opportunistic as these projects come to us and more so, what I can tell you, though is there a lot of our utility customers, large industrial brands that you would recognize that we made commitments to 100% renewable energy. And we've been able to provide a large customer tariff with the utility, so they don't have to rely on our non-utility business. But in other states we have opportunities to serve those very same customers. But again, we don't have -- it's not -- we're not in hunt of that, it really does come to us opportunistically.","Travis Miller","Okay, great. I appreciate it.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.","Paul Patterson","Good morning.","Patti Poppe","Morning, Paul","Rejji Hayes","Morning, Paul.","Paul Patterson","I'm going to ask you to just go over again sort of Greg Gordon's question on sales growth, I was a little bit, I just want to make sure I fully understand it. Could you once again just sort of go through what your weather-adjusted sales growth has been and how much energy efficiencies impacting it? And, I guess, how much energy efficiency that you guys, your programs, your utility sponsored programs are responsible for?","Rejji Hayes","Absolutely. And let me point here as well Paul, to the materials that came out with the press release, Slide of Page 13 and 14 that has or weather-normalized electric utility statistics--","Paul Patterson","Right. I have been looking at them.","Rejji Hayes","--you can also look at that those for reference. But I'll reiterate. So, what we've seen year-to-date relative to the first half of 2018, for residential were down 0.5%, commercial down 0.5%, and industrial were down just under 2% at 1.9%. And those numbers again are weather normalized.","They also take into account the reduction of customer usage favorable to our energy efficiency programs. And so, by design, we look to reduce electric power from the prior year by 1.5%, and we get economic incentives to do so. And so, very effective, really going back to 2008 law, and executing on those plans. And so, I always try to highlight that the reduction in customer usage is incorporated into those numbers.","And so it acts that how for back, the effects of those programs out you can really add 1.5% to the numbers, you will see on that page. And so, think about that financial down 0.5% on a gross basis, excluding the energy efficiency programs are up a point, same for commercial, and then industrial down about 0.5%, again grossed up for the effects of energy efficiency. And so that's how we think about it, not on a blended basis, we're down about a little under 1%.","And so again, grossing that up, you're a little over 0.5% when you exclude the energy efficiency. So that's what we think about it. And we also look at the customer accounts just to make sure that what we believe is segment place across residential, commercial does reflect those grossed up numbers and so we've seen customer counts go up for residential down 0.5%.","On a rolling latest 12 months basis, we've seen commercial up about a percent. And so we're seeing very nice trends there. And the other point I have made in the past and I'll make it again, is that weather normalization math is a very complicated and imperfect science. And so if you take into account some of the, I'll say, weather extremes we saw last year and tried to back that out as hard as our folks work to get that math right, it's still quite complicated. And so that's why while we state these numbers and report them, they are not always as perfect or precise as we'd like them to be.","And then for industrial the only other point I'd make, there is that we continue to see good performance from our small industrial customers. And so we have seen, if you carve out one large low-margin customer, and you can actually effectively add about 1% to our blended electric weather normalized sales performance.","So like I said, we're down about a little less than 1% weather normalized, and when you take out that one large low-margin customer we're basically flat in our industrial or as much as that is a little below 2%, you take out that one large customer were up over a percent. And so we have seen just very good performance across our customer classes and particularly when you exclude the effects of our energy efficiency programs, which are designed to reduce customer usage. Is that helpful Paul?","Paul Patterson","Yeah, that is helpful. And I didn't want to belabor it, I just want to make sure that I understood that that 1.5% is based on your utility energy efficiency efforts.","Rejji Hayes","That's exactly right.","Paul Patterson","Okay. Okay. And now, just one sort of quick follow-up on that. on the gas side, I know it's a small quarter for gas usage, but it did seem to grow pretty rapidly I think that's on Page 14 or I have to agree -- let me find it. But if you follow what I'm saying, the residential grew like 14.3% and 8.3% for commercial. I just was wondering, is there anything going on there? I mean, it just seems like a relatively high number on a weather-normalized basis.","Rejji Hayes","Yeah. So I'll first go again point to the weather normalized math and the imperfections. But we've actually seen pretty good customer accounts across gas as well. And so we do think that part due to what I will say that a positive spillover effects when you have good industrial activity. And so you start with decent industrial activity, that leads to residential increases, and then you get commercial activity, and so there is a very nice spillover effect taking place in gas and I think that's what we're seeing in these numbers.","But again, I want to temper expectations both on the downside and the upside. It's a very difficult piece of math to employ.","Paul Patterson","I follow you. It just sort of jumped out of me. Okay. I understand to take it with a grain of thought I guess to a certain degree. But, okay. Thanks so much guys. All my other questions were answered, and have a great one.","Patti Poppe","Thanks Paul.","Rejji Hayes","Thanks, Paul. See you.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Fishman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","David Fishman","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Patti Poppe","Hey, David.","Rejji Hayes","Hey, David.","David Fishman","Hi. Just going back to a little bit of the long-term CapEx guidance that we might receive. Should we expect to see a gas distribution investment plan, sort of similar to what we saw with the EBIT for electric that potentially outlines long-term opportunity there, kind of with an expanded IRM in mind.","Patti Poppe","Yes, you should. We're working on that as we speak, which is another reason why we're going to wait till the latter half of the year to publish the 10-year plan. I can't promise that it will result in an IRM. But I do think that it will paint a nice clear picture. And I think our commission has done a really good job of soliciting these plans, these multi-year plans, so that as they're making an annual determination during a rate case, they have a better perspective of where it fits into a longer-term plan. And frankly, they can't hold us accountable even if it's not a formal program to doing what we said we're going to do, and we're up for that kind of scrutiny because we're pretty good at planning, and we want to be able to be trusted in our ability to execute.","So we've been working on a long-term gas plan. We know how important the safety of the system is for the state of Michigan. And so, we'll look forward to sharing that more publicly over the next year or so.","David Fishman","Okay. So that's something for over the next year or so not necessarily alongside long term CapEx plan?","Patti Poppe","Some of it might be published with our long-term CapEx plan. It definitely is the key driver for it. But we may wait until early 2020 to formally publish it.","David Fishman","That makes sense. And then one quick housekeeping item. Just on the year-over-year drivers slide, I think you added a more explicit $0.08 of enterprises benefit. I just wanted to make sure I knew all the drivers, that's mostly because the MISO capacity rolls off into better negotiate capacity contracts. And then how much of that proportionally is about the new energy contracts versus maybe the incremental Ohio wind farm?","Rejji Hayes","Yeah. So you have a few pieces there. I think you highlighted, the largest driver. And so as you roll off of the MISO planning resource auction of 2018, and its implications in the back half of the year, you start to see capacity sales tick up. I can't give you the earnings per share. But it's a vast majority of that pick up and then you have two other components.","So you rightfully noted some of the effects of Northwest, Ohio. It's interesting that our wind project was fun. The implication there is that their production tax credits that we expected to realize resulting from that project earlier in the year, but because we had a slow start for enterprises, we didn't actually realize the effects of the production tax credits at enterprises in the first half year.","So we'll pick that up. Also in the second half of the year and the last thing I'll note, is if you think about the comp relative to 2018, we did have a write-off in the second half of the year of about $3.5 million attributable to file our city, because we were no longer planning to convert that plant from coal to natural gas.","And so the absence of that write-off, we spent $3.5 million pre-tax. That's about a penny. And then you've got, I think the vast majority of the capacity sales as well as the realization of production tax credit. So it's those three things that largely get you back our planned EPS contribution of $0.14 from enterprises for the year.","David Fishman","Okay, that's great color. And yeah, those are my questions. Congrats again on a great first half.","Rejji Hayes","Thank you.","Patti Poppe","Thanks, David.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Poppe for any closing remarks.","Patti Poppe","Thanks everyone, for joining us again this morning. And certainly, we look forward to seeing you out and about at upcoming events."]}}
