As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded, Thursday, April 21, 2016. I would now like to turn the conference over to Randy Arickx, Executive Director of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Randy C. Arickx - General Motors Co.","Thanks, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us as we review GM's financial results for the first quarter of 2016. Our press release was issued this morning and the conference call materials are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast on the Internet. Included in the chart set materials published this morning, we've included the key takeaways from each chart in the notes pages in order to provide color on the results.","This morning, Mary Barra, General Motors' Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, will provide some brief opening remarks; followed by Chuck Stevens, GM's Executive VP and CFO. And then we'll open the line for questions from the analyst community.","Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the legend regarding forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language. In the room today, we also have Tom Timko, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; and Dhivya Suryadevara, Vice President, Finance and Treasurer, to assist in answering your questions.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Mary Barra.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Thanks, Randy, and thanks, everyone for joining the call. I'm extremely pleased to report that GM delivered a very strong performance in this quarter. So let's take a look at the numbers. As the highlights and year-over-year improvements include, first, revenue of $37.3 billion, up $1.6 billion. Q1 record, EBIT adjusted of $2.8 billion, which is up $0.6 billion, Q1 record EBIT-adjusted margin of 7.1%, up 1.3 percentage points, and Q1 record earnings per share adjusted of $1.26, up 47%.","Our net income was $2 billion; this is also up a $1 billion. And in addition, our record 28.5% ROIC on a trailing four-quarter basis demonstrates the positive results of our disciplined capital allocation framework.","If we look we've returned $0.9 billion to shareholders as of March 31, and this really underscores our commitment to enhancing shareholder value over time.","I think it's also important to take note that in Q1, we saw improved performance in all of our segments, led by North America, continued strength in China and breakeven results in Europe. We've had positive developments for Chevrolet and Cadillac, which are our two global brands.","To start with, in the United States, Chevrolet retail share was up a full point year-over-year to about 11%. Malibu's best Q1 retail sales since 1980 in the U.S. and in March, 85% of Malibu sales were the all-new models. In addition, we are launching the Cruze and very excited about that reception in the marketplace.","In China, the Malibu XL flagship sedan is also key to growing the brand in China from a Chevrolet perspective, and again this vehicle is getting good reception. And from a Cadillac perspective, in the first quarter, our ATPs were the highest in North America in our history, and we're very excited about the Cadillac CT6 and the Cadillac XT5 that are now launching in both China and the United States.","From a North America perspective, U.S. retail sales are up 7% year-over-year, largely on Chevrolet and Buick performances. U.S. retail market share grew faster than any other automaker, up 1.1 percentage points to 16.6%. And ATPs of $34,600 exceeded the industry average by about $3,500. And ending total dealer inventory was down 13% year-over-year.","If we move to China with our joint venture partners, we delivered over 963,000 vehicles, up slightly from Q1 2015, thanks to the growth in SUV and the luxury segment. The Buick Envision sales more than doubled and when we include the Baojun 560, total SUV sales jumped 148%. We're also very excited about the new Buick LaCrosse sedan that was introduced, that can continue to build on the strength of Buick in China.","And our Cadillac sales continue to raise, up 6.1% in the quarter, on top of 17%, which was the full-year increase last year. In Europe, we broke even in Q1 and we are on plan to breakeven for the calendar year. And this is really driven by Opel's product offensive.","Opel\/Vauxhall sales were 309,000, up 8.4% year-over-year, outpacing the industry and this is really on the strength of the Astra, which was made Europe's 2016 Car of the Year. Market share was up in 15 of the 21 markets and these are \u2013 the increases are in most of the major markets across Europe. And we still have two very important product launches in Europe this year, the Astra Sports Tourer and the Mokka X.","In South America, operating performance improved because of our continued work and especially the focus last year on rightsizing the business, while protecting the new product pipeline. And if you look at GM Financial; GM Financial grew its captive presence with GM customers and dealers in all regions with North America increasing its penetration of GM retail sales to 37% in the quarter. This is up from 21% in the first quarter of 2015.","And across the company, our operational excellence program, which is really driving Six Sigma and continues improvement in every aspect of the business, is well underway and it's playing a key role in the $5.5 billion cost efficiency challenge that we have outlined and that we expect to achieve by 2018. The success of the core business has enabled us to make smart investments in shaping the future of personal mobility.","On the autonomous front, we announced our intent to acquire Cruise Automation to further accelerate the development of autonomous vehicle technology and position General Motors in a leadership role. In car sharing, we introduced Maven, which combines and expands our multiple car sharing program under a single-brand, which includes Maven City and Maven+.","Maven City offers cars on demand in key cities driven by on OnStar-powered smartphone connectivity that really provides the customers an ownership-like experience. And Maven+ is a completely dedicated private fleet for residential community. We started this in New York City, as I've talked about it in the past. We're going to soon be adding Chicago and this will give us the potential to reach more than 5,000 residents.","On ride-sharing, as you know, we also announced the strategic partnership with Lyft. And it's a four dimensional approach that enables us first to develop an integrated network of on-demand autonomous cars. And we also introduced Express Drive and this is a short-term rental program on the Lyft platform that makes General Motors cars available to Lyft drivers at affordable rates. It also exposes those passengers and drivers to our products and gets more seats in seats.","We have the first launch, which is in Chicago, and demand is eight times the supply. We plan to add hubs in Boston and Baltimore and Washington in the near future. Another aspect of the alliance in the partnership that we have with Lyft is being able to combine the Lyft experience with our vehicle connectivity leadership and this really provides a better experience for the customer.","And we also see many opportunities to jointly expand both of our business and present cross-marketing opportunities, and you'll see us taking advantage of those as we move forward. From an alternative propulsion perspective, we also revealed the 2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV at the Consumer Electronic Show, it's going to achieve more than 200 miles per charge of all EV range and will cost about $30,000 after government incentives, production will begin later this year.","So in summary, our strong first quarter gives us even more confidence that we will deliver the earnings growth we outlined in January. We delivered Q1 record EBIT adjusted, EBIT adjusted margins and EPS adjusted, along with a record return on invested capital. Our aggressive product launch cadence and continued cost discipline will help us deliver on our commitments for the year and continue to drive shareholder value.","With that, I'll turn it over to Chuck.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Thanks, Mary. I just wanted to take a couple of minutes to provide some perspective on the quarter. As Mary said, all reporting segments posted improved results from a year ago, including about $500 million of improvement outside North America. Clearly, we're on track for another record year in 2016, very much in line with the overview we provided back in January. Just a few comments on our results by region. First, let me start with North America. North America continues to put up impressive numbers.","We continue to see steady moderate industry growth in the U.S. of approximately 3% and we expect that trend to continue throughout the rest of the year. EBIT-adjusted of $2.3 billion was a first quarter record, up over $100 million from a year ago, despite over $200 million in restructuring expense and the increased launch-related costs.","The success of our important launches like the Chevrolet Malibu and Cruze, as well as material and cost efficiencies will help more than offset higher D&A, marketing and engineering-related costs throughout the year, as we continue to invest in our portfolio and brands. And as we've said before, we expect to maintain 10% plus margins for the calendar year, while delivering improved EBIT-adjusted performance compared to 2015. Shifting to Europe, we are very pleased with the breakeven results in Europe, more than a $200 million improvement year-over-year and we remain very much on track to deliver breakeven results for the full year.","We continue to see moderate growth in Europe, where industry volumes were up about 5% year-over-year in the first quarter, and as Mary indicated earlier, Opel\/Vauxhall sales outpaced the industry by growing over 8% compared to a year ago. The success of Opel\/Vauxhall's recent launches such as the Astra and the Corsa, have contributed to increased wholesales and related top-line growth in the region. We're also very focused on costs where we're utilizing tools such as operational excellence throughout the region and you are seeing some of the results. In regards to earnings cadence for the year, we expect normal seasonality throughout the year, while we continue to manage FX challenges in the region.","Moving on to China, another solid quarter with strong equity income of $518 million, about equal to a year ago. While the industry grew roughly 6% in the quarter, our retail sales were roughly flat year-over-year. The quarter was impacted by model changeovers. However, as our launches ramp up, we expect volumes and market share to improve. Our previous guidance, industry growth in the mid-single digit range and our ability to sustain our strong margin performance has not changed and we're very much on track. We also continue to capitalize on improving mix with our strong SUV and MPVs sales, as well as products like the Cadillac CT6 and XT5, while remaining focused on cost efficiencies and driving material cost performance.","Turning to South America, EBIT-adjusted improved this quarter versus a year ago by approximately $150 million in a much more challenging economic environment. As you are aware, macroeconomic conditions remain challenging with no near-term recovery in sight. While we're pleased with the developments in Argentina and are seeing positive market signs there, political uncertainty continues in Brazil where industry volumes were down 29% in the first quarter. However, the results of our restructuring actions over the past year contributed to improved results this quarter versus a year ago. We'll continue to take actions to help mitigate the negative headwinds that are impacting the industry and GM's results in that region as appropriate and we are well positioned to take advantage of the economic recovery when it materializes.","Finally GMF, we continue to execute our captive strategy and are seeing the results. As Mary mentioned, penetration in the U.S. increased to 37% in the first quarter, up from 21% last year. Revenue grew by $700 million to $2.1 billion in the first quarter, a record, and we earned $225 million in earnings before taxes in the first quarter, another record.","Shifting to our capital allocation framework, we continue to focus on driving shareholder value. In the first quarter, we returned $900 million to shareholders, including $600 million in dividends and $300 million in share repurchases.","We also remain focused on investing in the business. And as Mary discussed earlier, our strategic investments in Lyft and Cruise Automation will help us build the foundation for driving further shareholder value in the future. And as we indicated earlier this year, we also took steps to further de-risk the balance sheet by contribution $1.5 billion to our U.S. hourly pension plan during the quarter, and just recently finalized another $500 million contribution in April.","As you know, the $2 billion contribution was funded with debt, providing the company greater flexibility by pushing out any required pension contributions further into the future. As expected and in line with normal seasonality, Q1 adjusted automotive free cash flow was an outflow of $1.5 billion for the quarter, which was a $200 million improvement versus a year ago.","With regard to our total company outlook for the year, we are very much on plan for improved full-year profit and margin growth versus 2015, which would be another record year for the company. And we have even more confidence that we will achieve our EPS adjusted guidance of $5.25 to $5.75 for the full year. And we continue to expect growth in adjusted automotive free cash flow to nearly $6 billion in 2016.","That concludes our opening comments. We'll now move to the question-and-answer portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, guys. A first question just on the pace of buybacks in the quarter. It seemed like it was a little bit light. Obviously, it's a tough working capital quarter, a seasonal quarter for you on cash flow. I'm just curious as we see cash flow ramp up through the course of the year if you continue to see the buybacks as a significant opportunity here?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Sure. And at a minimum what we want to do is complete the committed share buyback program that we announced in the first quarter last year, which was $5 billion through the end of 2016 and per our capital allocation framework, as we generate free cash flow, we are going to buy back shares as expeditiously as possible, but as I said john, at a minimum we want to complete that first $5 billion on our path to the $9 billion upsize that was approved by the board earlier this year.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then just a second question as we think of the free cash flow you're showing on slide 23 here. There's a $500 million benefit from equipment on operating leases and I'm assuming that's the gain on vehicles coming back off lease and the residuals performing better than expected. I'm just curious if that is correct and if that's something you think will continue through the course of this year. And what is driving that? Is that just better market conditions or is that better residual performance because nameplates and brands are starting to resonate with consumers?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah, John, that is essentially related to daily rental fleet and that is related to fewer units being placed into service. When you look at the impact of daily rental and cash flow, you need to look at both the equipment on operating leases and accrued and other liabilities and inventory. So, it kind of shows up in three different places. We can provide you with a little bit more specificity around that, but that has nothing to do with lease residuals on vehicles that are being leased through GMF, obviously that flows through GMF results.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's...","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","But with that said, we are seeing \u2013 continue to see positive results on lease terminations from a GMF perspective.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's very helpful. And then just lastly, it sounds like the Baojun brand is helping you out quite a bit in China and it's sort of a great example of a purpose-specified brand in a market. As we think about sort of potentially the need for a purpose-specified brand in the electrical vehicle market, is there ever a consideration to brand the Bolt or the Volt a different brand and come up with a new angle there because one of the electric-specific companies that's out there has got a good cache in their brand and it does seem like there might be some competitive dynamics that would be solved if you came up with a good new brand there.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Yeah, from a brand perspective, I think when you look at the Chevrolet Volt, to start with a few years back, it's done a lot \u2013 I think, to help increase awareness and consideration and positive views on the Chevrolet brand, so we've been building on that, Chevrolet is a global brand, and it's a full range, when you look at the electrification not only just all-electric with the Bolt, but extended range electric vehicle with the Volt, and even vehicles like the Malibu Hybrid. So, I think we look at it and see it as a \u2013 an opportunity \u2013 to a certain extent, Volt and now Bolt EV are starting to have a level of their own, and we think it really complements the Chevrolet brand globally.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Itay Michaeli with Citi.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and congrats.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Thanks, Itay.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Thank you.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Just want maybe to start with actually a long-term strategic question. You've had a busy quarter with Lyft, Cruze, Mobilize REM and Maven. I was hoping maybe, Mary, you could kind of provide some color on kind of how investors should think about the magnitude of the long-term opportunity that you're pursuing here, particularly maybe in regions where GM has not historically been well-represented. What's the long-term vision for GM with respect to some of these opportunities that you are pursuing?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Well, I'd say, it hard to size them when you look at how many different people are sizing up, is autonomous going to cause the industry to grow, is it going to shrink it, I think there is too many unknowns, but what I would say is, we see a significant opportunity and that's why we're moving so aggressively on all fronts, when you look at the technology that we're putting into cars, as it relates to connectivity. When you look at what we're doing from a propulsion perspective, not only dramatically improving our technology from an internal combustion engine perspective, but the investments and the leadership position that we have with the Chevrolet Bolt EV to be the first automaker that has the type of range of 200 miles plus at an affordable price of $30,000 after incentives.","Then when you look at autonomous and we believe that we'll see autonomous in the marketplace first in a ride-sharing activity for a whole host of reasons of being able to control and grow and learn, we think that's a huge opportunity across the globe to your point. So, I can't specifically size it, but I think it's extremely significant, that's why we're pushing it so aggressively and it builds on top of a strong core business. So, again, I think that'll unfold over time, but we see it as significant.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","That's very helpful. And maybe just a follow-up for Chuck. I know we are still early in the year, the Cruze and Malibu launches, but just how are you feeling, Chuck, around the $1,500 variable profit goal for the year on those metrics?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. We're very much on track with that Itay, based on the reception so far and our expectations and the launch pricing and the delivery of cost as we launch these products. So, we're very much on track. And by the way, continue to be on track along the same dynamic in Europe, with the improved profitability on the Corsa and the Astra that we talked about before.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","That's very helpful. Thanks so much, everyone.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Spak with RBC.","Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. First one is in North America. I think, if my notes are right, this is the first time in maybe even two years that the carryover pricing wasn't a drag. And I guess I just want to sort of confirm what's in that, what's not in that. So the K2 platforms are now in that and is maybe within the carryover. Pricing is sort of still okay there, but some of the others a little bit of a drag. Is that the way to think about it?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah, obviously the K2 has been in carryover pricing since the end of 2013, early 2014 as we move through that launch cycle. So, when I look at carryover pricing, I think there is two dynamics. Headwind was really the rundown of model changes. We are getting ready to launch the new Cruze and the new Malibu. From a carryover pricing perspective a positive is, we continue to see price opportunities on full-size trucks and full-size SUVs that we're taking advantage of. So, as we look at the year, it feels to me that carryover pricing will be perhaps a bit less of a headwind than we've seen in the last couple of years.","Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then the second one is just to follow up on South America, which is clearly a challenged environment. I believe earlier this year you were still looking for improvement there. I don't know exactly what you're thinking in terms of your political expectations for what's going on down there, if things have changed or not, but are you still on \u2013 given the work you've seen there, are you still on track to see some improvement there and maybe you could just clarify is that from a margin or an absolute dollar perspective?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Well, when we looked at how the year was developing or our expectations for the year in 2016 versus 2015, what we said is we could see a scenario where we would see slight improvement in aggregate on a year-over-year basis depending on how the macro situation developed. I would say our first quarter results are certainly encouraging from that perspective, I mean we improved $150 million on a year-over-year basis in a much worse macro environment. And I have to hedge my input or guidance for the rest of the year because it's really difficult to forecast what's going to happen in Brazil. Down 29% in the first quarter, but the team continues to take action. We've got a strong product lineup, we're getting traction on cost and it's a good start to the year, but let's see how the rest of it plays out.","Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right. So environment worse, but your internal performance better than expected?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","At least through the end of the first quarter, yes.","Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Pat Archambault with Goldman Sachs.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. Thank you. Good morning.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Good morning.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Hi, Pat.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Maybe just starting on some of the technology stuff, Cruise Automation, obviously there's been a lot made about the amount that was spent on that, right. I think it was over $1 billion reported in the press and that was a pretty big premium over the private valuations that were discussed in those same articles. Two questions to that. Number one is what are you exactly getting out of that, that made it such a sought after asset? And then maybe more broadly, I mean what does it tell you about sort of the nature of innovation, right? It seems like part of why it's surprising is a small outfit like that can come up with technology that a large outfit like you guys want. And so what does that say about kind of the nature of partnerships as we look to go on this very aggressive technology path?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Sure. Pat, first off, as everyone knows the transaction hasn't closed and we will provide additional details on the acquisition when the deal closes. We still expect that that will happen in Q2. So when you look at that though, there is a lot of technical capability within General Motors. And when you look at the specific technologies that are necessary, which there are many and there's still, I will say, critical development on the mainline, the expertise and the work that's already been done by Cruise, we saw as something that would really accelerate our ability to lead from an autonomous perspective.","And I think from a shareholder perspective, we are always looking at ways that we can lead and get there more quickly and make the decision of do we partner, do we buy or do we develop internally. And as we looked at the capability, we clearly thought, and our vision of the future again of where Cruise was headed, we were very much aligned similar to the way we were with Lyft and we saw this as a huge opportunity to really accelerate our performance in autonomous.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And I guess just building on that, within the technology, autonomous driving, cyber security, V2V, are those things that ultimately you want to really have full control of in-house, or do you see yourselves working with partnerships for the foreseeable future just given how fast all of this is evolving?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Well, I think as an OEM and looking at the whole autonomous experience, we want to make sure we control the key areas where we can differentiate the experience for the customer and the entire customer experience. So, but within that there are strong partnerships. We continue to work with Mobileye along with other partnerships. But I think what you need, where we are going to place the emphasis on is controlling the key aspects of the whole value chain.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. If I can sneak one last one just on leasing. I know that you said, Chuck, that leasing was, the residuals were performing well. The Manheim of course has turned a bit. What are your like underlying residual assumptions for your lease book? Are you assuming some kind of decline in residuals, or how is that sort of working into that?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes certainly, used car pricing has been at all-time highs over the most recent couple of years and from a planning perspective, we expect moderation in used car pricing. That's built into both the auto company as well as GMF's expectations, and we're seeing that play out kind of as we expected. So, no material exposures, no material risk and as I said, as we anticipated a moderation in used car pricing is built into our baseline plan.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. All right. Thanks a lot guys, and congratulations on the quarter.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Thanks, Pat.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Thanks, Pat.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Had a couple questions on North America. First, I'm trying to just triangulate how pricing and costs may look going forward and maybe just to kind of level-set me, was there roughly a $400 million year-over-year tailwind from the non-recurrence of that, the rental sales delays from last year and about a maybe $150 million cost benefit from the pension change this quarter?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","That's directionally correct, picking out those two specific drivers amongst many, yes.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So I guess it's pretty impressive that you are suggesting that pricing actually improves over the course of the year, even as that factor on a year-over-year basis, I would expect would fade into the back half?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Well, what's going to help the pricing for the rest of the year, Rod, is obviously new majors, the Malibu, Cruze, XT5, amongst others and that's very consistent with what we guided before that we expected to see a increase in new major pricing over the rest of the year. And the full-year impact of the pricing actions we've taken over the last number of months on full-size SUVs and trucks and kind of cycling through some of the support that we've had to provide on passenger cars as we launch these new cars is going to have a benefit from a carryover pricing standpoint.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So you're saying it's not really just Malibu and Cruze because it looked like to offset that on an annualized basis, you'd need to improve the pricing by like $3,000 on those vehicles. You're suggesting that there's other vehicles that you've been taking price up on. Is that right?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Sure.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then the North American fixed cost number, you showed in your deck $600 million. I'm assuming that that includes the $150 million from the pension, so it was like $750 million in the quarter. Is that a reasonable run rate that we should be thinking about for the rest of this year?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","No. And again, when you look at the puts and takes, first quarter this year versus first quarter of last year, clearly we had that fleet loss headwind last year in the first quarter. This year we had the SAP program, which we've talked about very clearly, which was in the range of $240 million, you already brought up the pension. But in addition in the first quarter, we had launch-related costs from both a marketing and a manufacturing perspective in the range of $200 million.","We've very clearly talked about an increase in engineering expense in 2016 versus the prior year to support our very aggressive product launch cadence. And that obviously has had an impact in Q1, but as we've talked about in the past, broadly speaking, starting in a company level, Rod, we said that incremental material, logistics performance, savings and manufacturing in GBS would more than offset increased fixed costs associated with D&A, marketing and engineering, as we went through that product launch cadence and that's playing out as we expected from a total company level.","In North America, we cycle through and we are talking to you early next February, I would expect that to be relatively flattish, when I think about material cost performance, logistics performance and the net fixed cost increase year-over-year. So, nothing fundamentally has changed. And my last comment would be, take this in the context of, we will and we're still very much on track to generate 10% plus EBIT margins in North America in 2016. And obviously, there will be puts and takes on all the drivers, but I think that's the fundamental message.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you. And just one last thing, if you can comment on this, it seems like a number of companies, including GM, are performing really well in Europe, better than expected, but there's a bit of caution maybe partly because of the concerns about Brexit. Is that something that is sort of characterizing your outlook that just the uncertainty there is affecting your view and is there \u2013 do you have any thoughts on what the implications of that might be?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Well, as we sit today, very strong first quarter, significant improvement versus last year, I would say ahead of plan through the first quarter, we're still committed to drive that business to breakeven this year. But versus where we were at three or four months ago, I'd say the biggest kind of cloud or headwind out there is the currency environment and what's driving that is the weaker pound sterling, which obviously isn't being helped by the Brexit situation. And I'd say that's the biggest risk that we have amongst many, but that's the biggest risk that we have right now that we're working to manage through.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes, kind of continuing on North America. Looking at your 10-K, it looks like when you talk about variable profit, it shifted even more to trucks. It went from 1.6 times the average to 1.7 times and cars deteriorated from 40% to 30% and even CUBs deteriorated. I guess a few questions around that. One, will the actions in terms of products around Malibu and Cruze, and I assume the Lambda platform help move this over the next year? And then second, with some competitors seeing the profit pools in large SUVs and pickup trucks adding capacity over the next couple of years, how are you thinking about protecting those profits in the years to come?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah, we'll certainly, as we go through the launch cadence, not only on passenger cars and new entries in the Cadillac portfolio and refreshing the oldest crossover lineup, we would expect to see that profit dynamic shift and obviously improve those profit pools in passenger cars and crossovers, vis-\u00e0-vis trucks.","The other thing that's just mathematically impacting that shift from the 2014 K to the 2015 K is we're selling more vehicles in Mexico and obviously there are more passenger cars there and they're lower priced, lower profit, obviously lower cost, and that's having an impact as well. Relative to trucks, the way you protect your profit pool in trucks and SUVs, great products, great brands, continue to take advantage of that, align supply and demand and continue to drive cost efficiency. And our trucks, well into their lifecycle, continue to perform very well.","We had just under 38% retail share in the first quarter. We continue to lead in the industry, we just launched a refreshed truck, which will carry us to the next generation truck, and we feel very confident that we'll be able to protect those pools, because we've got great products.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And just a follow-up on sedans, how \u2013 and we'll see GM Financial later in the day \u2013 are you dealing with the fall in residuals on sedan prices? Is it, A, any noise from the dealers that they need trade-in allowances? I'll ask GM Financial later on how it's showing up in the lease returns. And then as you work with your rental car partners, any shift from risk to program cars on that, or \u2013 and are they beginning to ask for lower-priced cars, or are you leaving that for the competitors?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Well, as I mentioned earlier, Brian, overall, lease portfolio continues to perform well for GMF, obviously trucks and SUVs are performing very well; cars are performing not as well as they had been, but at a portfolio level, we are okay. We talked about very specifically our strategy to reduce our daily rental fleet sales, and that's really focused on repurchase because at the end of the day, what we're trying to do is, reduce our exposure to the used car market, continue to focus on retail deliveries, which drives better residuals ultimately and better owner loyalty, so that's part of the strategy as well.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.","Neel N. Mehta - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone. This is Neel Mehta standing in for Adam Jonas. Mary, the company has been making a number of investments, both organic and strategic, in shared, electric and autonomous. These are serious moves that are creating a pretty formidable collection of proprietary high-tech assets and software engineering capability and intellectual property. Is there any argument that can be made to support this collection of tech along with the existing OnStar infrastructure to exist as an independent entity separate from the parent company to perhaps help maximize value to shareholders?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Well, first, talking about the connectivity. I mean, I really think when you look at putting the customer at the center of what they want, they want that in today's business. So, it's vital to have integrated into the vehicle from a tech perspective to meet and exceed the wants and desires of customers today. From an autonomous perspective, I appreciate your comments, I think we are looking at it very seriously and with the extensive technology capability we have inside the company along with scale and understanding how to do and execute vehicles with this type of technology safely, I think it is something that really it is an opportunity for us and that's why we're moving so quickly on it. But I think right now, when you look at it, it's looking at how the business is going to evolve and we'll look at that over time, but the technologies I see are \u2013 many are very core to selling vehicles today. And even on autonomous, that's a journey, there is an evolutionary path and a revolutionary path and we're working on both.","Neel N. Mehta - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. And one follow-up, if I may. What does management think of the idea of creating a brand that is 100% focused on electric propulsion, whether it be an all new brand or say taking Cadillac and focusing on all further development just on EVs?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Well, I touched on this before. But when you look at it, first of all, we have two global brands, Chevrolet and Cadillac, and there is also pure EV like we have with the Bolt EV that will be coming out later this year, we have extended range electric vehicles with the Chevrolet Volt. But then we also have a lot of electrification, the Malibu Hybrid and we'll be launching over 10 new electrified vehicles in China. So to us really the electrification is something that we integrated in the portfolio that allows us to build not only our capability and spread it broadly and reach more customers, but also to build those brands so they're viewed appropriately as technology leaders. And I think we continue to do that, so we see it as core and integrated.","Neel N. Mehta - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Oh great, thanks for taking my question. Just first question on the free cash flow. If you look at working capital and accrued and other liabilities, it looked like it was a $2 billion outflow in the quarter versus just $900 million last year for those two items. Is there anything unusual and should that be a nice reversal into Q2? And then could you just remind us on the pension funding, once you do the $2 billion, you are done for the year, so this is essentially just swapping pension for debt?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. Again going back to the comment I made earlier, I think look at working capital separately, which was a $400 million impact versus $600 million in the first quarter of 2015. When you look at accrued and other liabilities, that's the other line that is impacted by reduced customer deposits associated with daily rentals, so as we sell less daily rentals, we get less customer deposits. As we de-fleet, it has an impact on operating leases, so you got to kind of look at those two lines together and net-net, it was a $1.1 billion impact in the first quarter of this year versus $1.5 billion last year, which is a $400 million improvement broadly speaking.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And the pension funding though, once you do the $500 million, it's done for the year.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Well, we borrowed $2 billion. We will have contributed $2 billion. We're done, I mean obviously that was as we talked about it, a risk management approach to push out some of the timing on the liabilities into a 20- and 30-year timeframe and push out mandatory contributions from maybe 2019 and 2020 to the early 2020s, 2022, 2023. We would expect as interest rates increase, when they increase that that will help close the remaining gap at least from a U.S. perspective going forward.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. From the credit side, you talked earlier, it sounds like you don't see a big impact from used car prices on your lease portfolio. Any color on subprime risk in terms of how much of GM Financial is subprime, and how are those loans performing? A lot of concerning headlines about subprime default. I mean is the performance within your portfolio pretty consistent though? Because I think there's probably an industry mix issue out there.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Well one, our subprime portfolio originations have been relatively constant over the last number of years, so we're not growing that, that's first. Two, AmeriCredit, now GMF, subject matter experts in subprime and managing the risk associated with subprime. Third, our delinquencies and credit losses associated with subprime have been very stable over the last number of years. We see no incremental risk associated with that. And then finally, we're running today originations as we execute our captive strategy, 80% of originations are prime, near prime. So, again very stable levels of subprime activity at GMF.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Very helpful. And just one last strategic question. Some of your competitors are talking about battery pack cost of $190 per kilowatt hour for both the cell and the pack. Can you match that kind of cost today and does that sound reasonable where the technology is today from your perspective? Any thoughts there on the EV costs and the competition.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Yeah, we've talked about with the Bolt EV and with the strategic work that we do with LG and with some other key suppliers, so we think we're on a path with the Bolt as we launch and get to scale of being in an industry-leading position of $150 and then continuing to improve that down. So, we work very closely on that. We think it's key, and not that we talk about it specifically with numbers, but we've seen dramatic improvement from the first generation of the Volt to the second generation of the Volt that is carried into the Bolt EV and we'll continue to drive that down.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","And the $150 though, is that for the cell, or is that all in cell and pack?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","I believe it's all-in, but I think when you say all-in, there everybody may have a slightly different definition of what they mean when they say all-in depending on how they have architected the vehicle. We can provide more detail on that, but again I think there's some variation in how people are defining that.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.","Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. Congrats on the great quarter.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Thank you.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Thanks, Ryan.","Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, so first question is just on China. Your margin there has been remarkably stable, right, relative to I think investor expectations. It would fall given the softer pricing environment. So can you talk about how you've been able to keep that margin steady despite what looks like kind of 6% type declines versus maybe more normal 3% type price declines, whether that's due to mix, volume, cost, something else given that you don't provide a China-specific walk. And then what are the drivers going to be going forward for the rest of the year?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah, nothing has changed vis-\u00e0-vis the China fundamentals versus what we've been talking about for the last year or so. Fundamentally price continues to be a challenge. Last year it was in the range of 4% to 5% negative price headwinds. On carryover, we expect that same level this year. That's what we've seen play out so far in the first quarter. And we're offsetting that impact through improved, significantly improved mix and you saw some of those results. The Envision as an SUV, sales up significantly; the Baojun, 560, we're launching critical new products like the Cadillac CT6 and Cadillac XT5. So mix has been a mitigant to the price headwinds, as well as carryover material performance and kind of when I look at those two together, they kind of offset the price headwinds and where you see the benefit, at least on an aggregate equity income or profit perspective is volume.","And we would expect to see that play out. Obviously, we continue to focus very much on cost efficiency, both material logistics and fixed cost, but broadly speaking favorable volume, favorable mix as we improve our Cadillac portfolio and launch more crossovers and MPVs. Favorable material performance offsetting or more than offsetting price headwinds as well as fixed cost increases, we bring up new plants. That's the broad strokes, Ryan.","Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks. And the last one is just a quick question on auto finance given that you've already commented on used car prices and subprime penetration. Maybe just round that out, could you talk about what you see as the sustainability of some other trends that have been supportive of SAAR like loan duration and lease penetration?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Well, we expect for us \u2013 specifically, we had pretty strong lease penetration in the first quarter, driven by again some of the model wind-down efforts around Malibu, Cruze and the SRX. We would expect to see that moderate, we'll be somewhat below industry average because trucks don't lease at the same levels and obviously we're overweight in trucks. So, we would expect to see that kind of continue. We're taking a number of actions to make sure we optimize residuals, we talked about the Express Drive, rental hubs, anything that you can do \u2013 the factory pre-owned collection, anything you can do to take that supply out of the auction and generally will help residuals over time and clearly that's a focus that we have going forward.","Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks. Congrats again.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mary Barra.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Well, thank you very much and thanks everybody for joining the call this morning. I have to say I'm extremely proud of the team from what they were able to accomplish this year, but we know we have more opportunity as we go through the year. We're going to continue with the discipline and detailed focus on strengthening the core business and the adjacencies, but also taking advantage of growth opportunities and our ability to lead as personal mobility is transformed and redefined.

Welcome to the General Motors Company First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, May 2, 2013.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Randy Arickx, Executive Director of Communications and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Randy Arickx","Thanks, operator, good morning, and thank you for joining us, as we review the GM financial results for the first quarter of 2013.","A press release was issued earlier this morning and the conference call materials are available on the Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via the Internet. Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the legend regarding forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set.","The content of our call will be governed by this language. This morning, Dan Akerson, General Motors Chairman and CEO will provide opening remarks followed by a review of the financial results of Dan Ammann, Senior Vice President and CFO.","Dan Akerson will then conclude the remarks portion of our call with some brief closing comments. After the presentation portion of the call, we\u2019ll open the lines for questions from the analyst community. In the room today we also have Tom Timko, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; Chuck Stevens, CFO of North America; and Jim Davlin, Vice President, Finance and Treasurer.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Dan Akerson.","Daniel F. Akerson","Thank you, Randy, and thank you all for joining us. As we do every quarter, I\u2019ll review some highlights and then Dan Ammann will take you through a more detailed presentation on our results.","Before I do that, I want to let you know that the segment reporting we are showing today reflects the successful implementation of what we call country of sale financial reporting. What this means is from now on, our automotive segment revenue and profits will be reported in the geographical regions where the vehicles are sold.","This new approach will give us improved visibility into our profit and revenue across the individual markets and product lines which in turn will help us optimize capital allocation and drive improved results. As we will walk through the numbers, you\u2019ll see that what we are providing you with an apples-to-apples set of comparisons to prior periods using this new approach.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 2, which summarizes our performance. Despite the mix of red and green arrows, this was a solid quarter for GM, and we are much more of a formidable competitor now than we have been in more than a generation. We are very much on plan financially as well despite the competitive landscape, the volatility that we have seen in several currency markets, and Europe\u2019s ongoing challenges.","I won\u2019t read the entire slide, but I would like to draw your attention to a few key points. First, we increased our global market share to a 11.4%, which is up 0.02 year-over-year. The gains were concerted in North America, Europe, and international operations. And what you are seeing is the result of several new successful product launches.","In addition, we are reporting EBIT-adjusted of $1.8 billion, which is down $400 million compared to a year ago. When you look at the regional detail, you can see that Europe actually improved its EBIT-adjusted results year-over-year. North and South America was down slightly and both GMIO and GM Financial were essentially flat.","Market conditions at GMIO outside China continued to be challenging. You can also see on the slide that our adjusted automotive free cash flow was down quite a bit year-over-year, which Dan will cover in more detail. As we will explain, we are impacted by lower cash earnings in the adverse timing of various items, which you expect to reverse in the balance of this year.","Now, let\u2019s turn to Slide 3, which is a summary of other first quarter highlights. Let\u2019s begin by recognizing GM Financial. GM Financial already helps us meet the financing needs of customers and dealers in strategic and underserved markets in North America, all with very good risk adjusted returns and a smaller balance sheet than other captive automotive finance companies.","As we look at our global growth strategy, we saw significant opportunity for them to help us with cars profitably around the world as well. That\u2019s what drove us towards the acquisition of Ally International Operations. We recently completed this acquisition in a majority of markets and we expect to close the remainder in a timely fashion.","Going forward, GM Financial will be able to provide financing in markets that represent roughly 80% of our sales volume. Of course, our customers are the final arbiters of success and our momentum is building with each new launch.","In China, GM and its joint ventures had a record first quarter sales and March was the second best month ever. We also began domestic production of the Cadillac XTS in February, which marks the start of our drive targeted to triple Cadillac annual sale in China to 100,000 units by the end of 2015.","In the United States, meanwhile, Cadillac\u2019s 38% year-over-year increase in the first quarter was the largest of any volume brand and Buick\u2019s 28% increase was number two. The driving force at both brands is great new products like the Cadillac ATS and Buick Encore, which are both in segments where we didn\u2019t compete here before.","Another success story is developing in the United Kingdom, where Vauxhall grew in its quarter sales by 19% a year ago. The entire UK market was up less than half that amount. Strong early sales of Opel Mokka and the Opel ADAM also helped to drive these results, and both vehicles are off to a strong start in the rest of Europe as well. In fact, we now have more than 100,000 Mokka orders and more than 30,000 ADAM orders on the books.","Finally in Brazil, the new all-new Chevrolet Onix helped Chevrolet deliver a 3.2% first quarter sales increase almost more than double the market. Progress in Brazil helped to offset challenges in Venezuela due to geopolitical situation.","As we move forward, we are going to keep the pressure on. In China, our 2013 capacity is about 20% higher than last year. And we are introducing redesigns of the Buick Excelle and the Cadillac SRX. Our strength in China offsets weaknesses in our other GMIO consolidated operations.","On the other side of the world, the production of the all-new Chevrolet Impala has begun at our Oshawa, Ontario plant. This car has designed to shift to our sales mix from roughly 70% fleet to 70% retail over time. At Cadillac, we unveiled our new CTS at the New York Auto Show to rave reviews. And we also unveiled redesigns of the Buick LaCrosse and Regal.","These new cars will give Buick an essentially all new U.S. showroom by the end of this summer. Perhaps and most important product news was the announcement of the Chevrolet Silverado 1500, we\u2019ll launch with carryover pricing and D8 fuel economy that\u2019s one MPG better than Ford EcoBoost D6.","Together the Sierra and Silverado are winning combination that should drive our average transaction prices through a combination of improved series mix and option penetration along with lower incentives.","The Coupe have models are in production and we\u2019ll bring other light-duty models on line later this summer. Finally, we submitted our global leadership in connected vehicles in February when we announced the automotive industries largest deployment of 4G LTE mobile broadband. We are going to rollout 4G LTE across all GM brands and regions starting in 2014 in the United States and Canada.","What makes our approach so innovative is we will offer built-in connectivity, in other words you will not need a tablet or smartphone to access 4G LTE in a GM product. There are many more examples of GM\u2019s progress that I could say, but I think the message is clear. We are a very healthy company that\u2019s getting stronger each quarter and in the product arena we\u2019re playing offense in competing to win.","Now in the interest of time, I\u2019m going to turn the call over to Dan Ammann, who will review our quarter in detail after that I will return to some closing comments. Thanks.","Daniel Ammann","Thanks, Dan. Slide 4 provides a summary of our first quarter GAAP and non-GAAP results. Net revenue for the period was $36.9 billion. The decline from the prior year was partially due to $400 million in unfavorable foreign exchange translation. In addition, while our deliveries to end customers were higher, our wholesales, which drive revenue, were down. Our GAAP operating income was unchanged at $1 billion. Net income to common stockholders declined $100 million to $900 million and our fully diluted earnings per share came in at $0.58.","Our automotive net cash from operating activities was $500 million, a $1.8 billion decreased from the same period in 2012. For our non-GAAP measures, EBIT adjusted was $1.8 billion in the first quarter and EBIT adjusted margin was 4.8%. Our adjusted automotive free cash flow was negative $1.3 billion for the quarter. The decline from 2012 due to lower earnings and timing related items we\u2019ll discuss later in the presentation.","Slide 5 identifies special items of the first quarter that had an impact on our earnings per share. At the top of the slide, our net income to common stockholders was $900 million and our fully diluted earnings per share was $0.58. As we advised in our 2012 calendar year earnings announcement, we had a $200 million impact from the devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar in the first quarter. This charge plus the net effective few smaller items had a (inaudible) unfavorable impact on earnings per share.","On slide 6, we remind you of our consolidated EBIT adjusted for the last five quarters. At the bottom of the slide, we list the revenue and margins for the same periods. Our operating income margin for the first quarter of 2013 was 2.6%, which was equal to the same quarter in the prior year. Our EBIT adjusted margin decreased 1 percentage point to 4.8%. We next display the recent history as our consolidated wholesale vehicle sales, which were 1.6 million vehicles in the first quarter slightly lower than the prior year. We\u2019ll discuss our new disclosure of this volumetric momentarily. Our global market share increased 0.2 percentage points to 11.4% for the first quarter.","On slide seven, we provide an explanation of the $400 million decrease in year-over-year consolidated EBIT adjusted. We are in $2.2 billion in the first quarter of 2012. Volume was $200 million unfavorable primarily due to lower wholesale volumes in North America and Europe. Mix was $100 million unfavorable. Price was $200 million unfavorable in GMNA and total cost was $300 million favorable due to lower expenses in Europe. Other was $300 million unfavorable due to foreign exchange.","On the next slide, slide eight, we discussed our transition to country of sale reporting that Dan previously mentioned. Beginning with this quarter\u2019s earnings announcement, we will now report revenue and profitability in the automotive segment, in which we sell our vehicles to our outside customers. Previously, our segment results included the impact of inter-segment sales and profits. This new approach improves the profit and revenue visibility across our markets, which will be helpful for managerial purposes.","Chevrolet Europe financial result will continue to be recorded within the IO segment to be consistent with how we manage the business. This new approach of reporting automotive segment financial performance does not affect our consolidated results.","We will also now report wholesale vehicle sales volumes instead of regional production volumes. This change fully aligns our disclosed with that new country of sale reporting.","Slide nine gives a summary of 2012 calendar year revenue and EBIT adjusted on a previously reported and on a country of sale basis. Please note that under our revised methodology will generally no longer have revenue recorded in our corporate and eliminations as the segment results reflect only sales to outside customers.","Slide ten gives a similar comparison of the two methodologies for the first quarter of 2012. The country of sale results for the other quarters of the previous year will be displayed on our upcoming segment charts.","Slide 11, gives our year-over-year EBIT adjusted performance by segment on a country of sale basis. North America was down $200 million to 1.4 billion. Europe improved to a $200 million loss. The performance in IO was flat at $500 million and South America reported a break-even performance, down $200 million for the same period in 2012.","GM Financial continued to deliver solid profitability with $200 million in earnings before taxes and our corporate sector was a $100 million expense for a total of $1.8 billion EBIT adjusted for the quarter.","We now move on to our segment results with the key performance indicators for GM North America on Slide 12. For the first quarter of 2013, our total U.S. market share was 17.7%. Our retail incentive levels on an absolute basis are higher from the prior year period.","On a percentage of ATP basis, our incentives for the good quarter were 111%. This puts us at a 116% of industry average levels for the first quarter of 2013. The increase from the prior year is largely due to increased incentives on full-size trucks as we manage to transition to our all-new Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra.","Turning to Slide 13, we showed North America\u2019s EBIT adjusted for the most recent five quarters. At the bottom of the slide, revenue was $23 billion, down $200 million from the same quarter in 2012. EBIT adjusted margin was 6.2% for the first quarter, down 0.9 percentage points from the prior year. Our U.S. dealer inventory was 744,000 units at the end of the first quarter. The increase from the prior year was primarily due to our recently launched vehicles in new segments. GMNA's wholesale vehicle sales were 829,000 units for the quarter and 19,000 unit decrease from the prior year due to production downtime we\u2019ve taken to prepare for upcoming launches.","North American market share came in at 17.1%, which was an improvement from both last year and the prior quarter. On slide 14, we provide the explanation of the $200 million year-over-year decline in North America\u2019s EBIT adjusted. EBIT adjusted was $1.6 billion for the first quarter of 2012. Volume was $200 million unfavorable due to the lower wholesale vehicle sales. Mix was $100 million favorable due to our recent launches of the Cadillac ATS and XTS.","Price was $200 million unfavorable due primarily to higher incentives as we manage our full-size truck transition. Cost had no net impact as $100 million in reduced pension income was offset with $100 million in decrease material and freight costs. This adds to EBIT adjusted of $1.4 billion.","On slide 15, GME reported an EBIT adjusted loss of $200 million for the first quarter, a $100 million improvement from the prior year. Revenue was $4.8 billion through the quarter, down from $5.3 billion in the prior year period. EBIT adjusted margin in the segment was negative 3.6%. GME\u2019s wholesale vehicle sales for the quarter were 249,000 units, 17,000 less than the first quarter of 2012. Our European market share in the first quarter was 8.3%, a small increase from the prior year.","On slide 16, we provide the major components of GME\u2019s $100 million year-over-year improvement and EBIT adjusted. Despite the lower number of wholesale vehicle volumes, volume rounded to zero impact. Mix was $100 million unfavorable due to continued vehicle downsizing and unfavorable country mix. There was no impact from price although we continued to see competitive pressures in the European market. Cost was $300 million favorable due to $100 million in lower depreciation and $200 million of savings between engineering expense and other fixed costs. Other was a $100 million unfavorable due to foreign exchange, primarily the weakness of the British pound. This totals to Europe\u2019s EBIT adjusted loss of $200 million for the first quarter of 2013.","We now move onto GMIO\u2019s profitability for the prior five quarters on slide 17. On the first quarter of 2013, EBIT adjusted was $500 million including equity income from our joint ventures, approximately equal to our performance from a year ago has strengthen our China JVs, offset weakness in consolidated operations. At the bottom of the slide, GMIO\u2019s revenue from our consolidated operations was $4.8 billion, the $200 million decline from first quarter 2012 is partially due to $100 million in unfavorable foreign exchange translation.","GMIO\u2019s EBIT adjusted margin from consolidated operations was a negative 1.4% down 3.7% percentage points from the prior year. This is due to pricing pressure in Australia related to the (inaudible), the 12% industry decline in India as well as unfavorable mix in volume in the Middle East.","We expect some of these factors to continue to pressure the performance of our IO consolidated operations in coming quarters. Our net income margin from our China JVs was 11.7%, a 1.5 percentage point increase from the prior year.","GMIO\u2019s wholesale vehicle sales were 243,000 for consolidated operations and 841,000 for our China JVs. Our market share in the region was 9.6%, a 0.2 percentage point improvement from last year. Our market share in the China market remained a very strong 15.2% for the first quarter.","Turning to slide 18, we provide the major components of GMIO\u2019s year-over-year performance. Volume had no net impact and mix was $100 million unfavorable due primarily to unfavorable country mix. Price was zero because we\u2019re able to offset pressure in some markets with increases in Korea. Costs also had no impact as lower material and freight costs offset an increase in depreciation and amortization. To change due to other made at the zero is the $100 million increase in equity income was offset by unfavorable FX in our consolidated operations.","On slide 19, we look at South America\u2019s EBIT adjusted for the last five quarters. The bottom of the slide revenue was $3.7 billion in the first quarter to $200 million decrease in 2012, which is more than explained by unfavorable foreign exchange translation.","The EBIT adjusted margin in the segment was a negative 1%. GMSA\u2019s wholesale vehicle sales were 233,000 units, 4,000 less than the first quarter of 2012. South America market share was 17.2% in the quarter, a 1.1 percentage point decline from the prior year. Although as Dan mentioned our market share in our core market of Brazil was favorable year-over-year.","On slide 20 if we look at the components of the $200 million decline in profitability in our South America segment. The impact due to volume was zero as reductions in wholesale vehicle sales in Venezuela, Columbia, and Argentina set by gains in Brazil.","Mix was zero was an unfavorable country mix was offset by favorable product mix driven by our new vehicle launches. Price was a 100 million favorable as we took action in Argentina and Venezuela to partially offset inflation in those markets.","Cost had no impact in other words 200 million unfavorable due to a 100 million unfavorable foreign exchange in Brazil and Argentina in the absence of the gain from our 2012 acquisition. This total was our break-even performance for South American in the first quarter.","Slide 21 provides our walk of adjusted automotive free cash flow for the first quarter. After adjusting for non-controlling interest, preferred dividends, and undistributed earnings allocated to Series B and deducting GM Financial, automotive income was $1.1 billion for the quarter.","We had $200 million in non-cash special items and our depreciation and amortization was $1.4 billion expense. Working capital was $1 billion use of cash, reflecting typical working capital seasonal trends. the $300 million decline in this category year-over-year is primarily a function of timing impacts of lower production in North America.","Pension and OPEB cash payments exceeded expenses by $300 million in the quarter. Other was an $800 million use of cash, the $700 million change from the prior year due to fewer vehicles and service for their rental car customers and the timing of cash payments related to prior quarter incentive accruals. This total is down to automotive net cash provided by operating activities of $500 million.","We had $1.9 billion of capital expenditures in the quarter and $100 million true-up contribution related to our 2012 salaried pension annuitization deal for a total adjusted automotive free cash flow of negative $1.3 billion.","On slide 22, we provide a summary of our key automotive balance sheet items. We finished the first quarter with $24.3 billion in cash and current marketable securities and $11 billion in available credit facilities, the total available liquidity of $35.3 billion. A book value of debt was $5.2 billion and the book value of our Series A preferred stock remained at $5.5 billion. Our U.S. qualified pension plans are now underfunded by $13 billion and our non-U.S. pensions are underfunded by $13.3 billion. or unfunded OPEB liability was $7.7 billion at the end of the first quarter.","Slide 23 provides a summary of our order financing activities. GM Financial reported their results this morning and will be holding an earnings conference call at noon. Our U.S. sub-prime penetration in the first quarter came in at 7.7%, modest decline from the prior year and closer to the industry penetration. Our U.S. lease penetration increased 8 percentage points to 20.6% in Q1 as we took advantage of our higher residual rates and new Cadillac launches to significantly close the gap to competitive leasing levels. Lease penetration in Canada was at 9.6%, up 0.7 percentage points from the prior year. GM new vehicles as a percentage of GM Financial originations were as to 51% and GM Financial\u2019s percentage of GM\u2019s U.S. consumer sub-prime financing and leasing was 26% in the quarter. GM Financial\u2019s annualized net credit losses remained low at 2.6% and earnings before tax was a $180 million for the first quarter similar to last year.","On slide 24, we\u2019re updating our estimate of the company\u2019s full-year effective tax rate to be closer to the high 30s in percentage terms. Please note we calculate the effective tax rate on an income before taxes and before equity income basis and also exclude the impact of special items. Our effective tax rate was 35% for the first quarter of 2013 and 12% for the prior year period. The rate for the entire 2012 calendar year was 15%.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it back to Dan for his closing remarks.","Daniel F. Akerson","Thanks, Dan. We covered a lot of ground this morning. But I hope you can see that we are systematically and successfully implementing our plan to grow profitably around the world. There\u2019s a new vitality here at GM and is represented in all of our brands. We\u2019re aggressively addressing the issues that have held us back. We\u2019ve maintained our fortress balance sheet and improved our financial flexibility and our new products are connecting with customers.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to you, Randy.","Randy Arickx","Okay, thanks, Dan. Operator, we\u2019re ready to start the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instruction) Our first question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsch Bank. Please go ahead.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsch Bank","Good morning, everybody. Can you hear me?","Daniel F. Akerson","Yes. Good morning, Rod.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsch Bank","Couple of things; one is, I was hoping you can talk about Europe a little bit and costs savings in Detroit. You suggested that you\u2019d have about $600 million of lower depreciations that maybe half of the $300 million cost reduction that you had this quarter, but you also indicated about $300 million of other restructuring savings. It looks like in this quarter at least it was maybe twice that. So any thoughts on the outlook for cost and also related to Europe just any additional color on how you expect the year to play out as the inventory correction behind you and so forth?","Daniel F. Akerson","Right. So starting at the end there, we came into the year with the company inventory in pretty good shape, but a little bit heavy on the dealer inventory side, so we have worked through a good chunk of that in Q1 here. And in terms of the more general trends in the business, I guess what I would say is that, we are very much on plan with the actions and objections that we\u2019ve laid out back in our third quarter call last year, both in terms of what we\u2019re trying to do on the top line, as well as on the bottom line.","The cost performance in Q1 was quite strong. I would say that there are some timing items that came into Q1 that amplify the cost savings that you are seeing and, we\u2019ll see some normalization as we will through the year. But everything that we talked about in terms of our objectives on the cost side and on the product side, we are achieving obviously, that\u2019s what we control the things, we don\u2019t control over the overall market environment and the overall industry there and that remains quite challenging.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsch Bank","Okay. And just secondly, if you can talk a little bit about the China JVs, obviously, are showing some pretty good profitability at this point and you talked about some very aggressive growth and spending plans over the course of the quarter. Does that \u2013 the mix of those two \u2013 how does that kind of play out vis-\u00e0-vis dividends? Are you able to sustain the historical policy of dividending the prior year\u2019s earnings or will the capital spending acceleration have any impact on that?","Daniel F. Akerson","I\u2019d say, as a general matter, we\u2019ll be add-on year the prior year\u2019s earnings going forward. So, no fundamental change to that at this point.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsch Bank","Okay. And just one last thing, you\u2019re still expecting improvement in South America for the full-year?","Daniel F. Akerson","Yeah, the first quarter \u2013 the story there was really a function of Venezuela and everything that\u2019s been going on there. Venezuela is, I think you know, is a profitable market for us and others. We had very little production in Venezuela in Q1 due to geopolitical obstacles, if you like, so that impacted the Q1 results. We see a path to get that back on track. And importantly, the business in Brazil, which is really the biggest market there, obviously, has performed well and is picking up a fair amount of the [slide] there. So bottom line, we expect to build, as we\u2019ve said before, build on last year\u2019s progress for the region for the year.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsch Bank","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hey, thanks, everyone. So you\u2019re calling out that your Chinese capacity should be up 20% year-on-year. I was wondering if you could give us a similar figure of how much your capacity will be up in North America year-on-year and how much it will be down in Europe year-on-year?","Chuck Stevens","Yeah, hey, Adam.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hey, Chuck.","Chuck Stevens","From a North American perspective, I guess the biggest driver on any capacity change year-over-year would be what\u2019s happening with the truck plants. And as we talked about before, that\u2019s going to be relatively flat. So I don\u2019t see a significant change in capacity. As a matter of fact, if you look at Q1 with some of the downtime that we had in Arlington, our capacity utilization was a bit below 100%. So I don\u2019t see a fundamental shift in our overall capacity as we go through this year.","Daniel F. Akerson","And I\u2019d say on Europe, I mean, obviously, the main action in terms of installed capacity there will come at the end of next year with Bochum. It\u2019s the moment we\u2019re optimizing shifts and so on to keep demand capacity as opposed to the installed capacity optimized for the volumes that we see, so and you have no fundamental change there even.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. And if I can follow-up with a question about the Japanese yen, the topic came up yesterday in the sales call a little bit, kind of seeing some initial signs of some aggression towards a discounting and price reduction, I believe Dan Akerson, you are on the tape earlier today also pointing out that\u2019s an issue, maybe it was you Dan Ammann. Can you give a sense of how much your market share may have benefitted over the past few years as the yen has been so strong and perhaps how much of a headwind this could be as the Japanese either improved their products with a value proposition?","Daniel Ammann","I\u2019d say, it\u2019s really hard to go back and try to \u2013 we are sort of going through the exercise. But it\u2019s hard to go back and define exactly how much market share movement is attributable to what. So I mean, the way we look at it is, we compete in the marketplace every month. Month-in and months-out, we obviously keep an eye. We have our strategies. We have our vehicle portfolio. We have our launch activity. We have all the things we\u2019re doing.","We keep a close eye on the competitive dynamics whether it\u2019s currency-driven or something else driven and adjust course as we need to on a month-to-month basis at least at the tactical level. So, we\u2019ll keep an eye on what people are doing here, the market share dynamics through the first four months of the year. I mean, you\u2019ve clearly seen them as we have, which has been favorable to us and to some of our domestic competitors, we\u2019ll see how people react to how it played out. So it\u2019s just too soon to make a call really.","Daniel F. Akerson","Adam, this Dan Akerson. I think it varies by market, for example, in the U.S., where some of our Japanese competitors are manufacturing a lot of product here in North America and then their supply chain will be to some extent and it will vary by competitor sourced in North America. And where you see and where I\u2019m particularly vigilant is where does it \u2013 how does it impact us into lesser developed countries, emerging market countries where both U.S. and Japanese competitors are exporting into out of a base, it might be in Japan or might be in Korea or China or wherever. So, as Dan said, it\u2019s hard to isolate this and give it a broad brush, it\u2019s very specific to by country, by region.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks, Dan. And just a one quick housekeeping follow-up with your change of your reporting structure of revenues where vehicles are sold rather than produced. Can you confirm where are you now, recognize royalties from the China JVs, the imported cars in into China and spare parts into China. Can you tell us are those then accounted for outside the China JVs in the regions or they \u2013 has that been moving around? Thank you.","Daniel Ammann","There\u2019s no real change between what\u2019s in the China net income or China equity income line versus what\u2019s on the balance of the business, royalties are part of the overall engineering expense that are allocated around the segments based on revenues and so on. But there is no change between China and the rest of the company.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","And spare parts also in the regions as well.","Daniel F. Akerson","Same story.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Ceraso with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Christopher Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to talk a little bit about price in North America. It was a headwind in Q1, but you mentioned as the new trucks ramp up, you should get some improvement in ATP. At what point do you think we will see price flip to a tailwind in North America?","Chuck Stevens","Yeah, as we talked about back in January and most recently March, as we think about 2013, we expect price on carryover products to be a headwind primarily related to the transition on truck. So I would expect that headwind and carryover products to continue through the sell-down period in Q2. But as we start to come up with new products like the Impala, the K2 which were launched and just started production earlier this year, we started to see some offset with pricing on new products. And I would expect to see some of that rolling in, in Q2, but really be more second half weighted.","Christopher Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. And then I guess kind of a related question if I understood your discussion about the cash flow correctly that 800 million of other that was a negative with cash going out the door for incentives where you had accrued previously, so it wasn\u2019t in the P&L. Are we going to see that effect happen in subsequent quarters as you move trucks off the lot that have these heavier incentives on them, and the cash goes even though they\u2019ve already been accrued?","Chuck Stevens","Yeah, I would say that the cash flow cadence, some of the 800 million was attributable to what you described. I would say the cash flow cadence is going to be a little bit back and forth more than usual as we move through this year because of the unusual production cadence. If you look at the Q4 to Q1 to Q2 production cadence, usually it\u2019s up and then up again and this year we had a different production cadence on that. So that moves payables around and moves receivables around and moves incentive accruals and cash amounts around, so there\u2019s fair bid going on in terms of cash flow timing.","Christopher Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. I am sorry. Can you run through that again? What is the timing that you expect and how does it differ from your typical seasonality?","Unidentified Company Representative","Well, typically Q1 is our seasonally weakest quarter for cash flow. That remains the case this year. In fact, it\u2019s exacerbated this year due to some of the production cadence timing. Obviously, we had lower earnings in the quarter, so it translates straight through the cash flow. The biggest chunk of the impact relates to some of these timing items, which will reverse during the course of the year.","Christopher Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, and then just one last item on Europe, I think you mentioned that you drew down inventory, does that mean you\u2019re going to be building some in the future, which helps earnings in subsequent quarters relative to Q1 or now you feel like you are at a more comfortable level?","Unidentified Company Representative","I think we are about where we would like to be, and again, obviously it\u2019s a function of what the market does over the coming quarters.","Christopher Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you","Unidentified Company Representative","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Yeah, thanks, good morning. A couple of quick ones, first on North America capacity, just taking a multiple year view, I think on a straight time basis [IHS] has, you had about 80% and I understand that not everybody looks at it on a straight time basis, but starting with that, how are you thinking about the capacity needs as you get to peak volumes? You know it sounds like you\u2019re not looking at too much in the way of new facilities, but how should we think about that impact on incremental margins as you roll out third shifts over time that sort of thing, taking sort of a multi-year view?","Daniel F. Akerson","Yeah, perhaps I adjust this capacity utilization was on a three shift basis. Right now on a two shift basis, we\u2019re running at about 100%. As we go forward and think about industry in the U.S. at $16.5 million, $17 million, we would expect to build and meet that by increasing the number of our facilities on three shifts today. We have eight or about 50% of our facilities on three shifts. Obviously, we have the capability to take that up. Our expectations would be to be running at a 120% to 130% utilization rate going forward as measured on kind of a two shift basis or closer to a 100% on a three shift basis. Obviously that has a significant impact on sending fixed cost if you can run your facilities on three shifts versus two shifts. I am not going to provide an estimate on that on a go forward basis, but that would be clearly what we want to do to get more fixed cost utilization going forward.","Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then it sounds like there\u2019s a lot of variable cost that has to come into the system, obviously, if you are increasing the shifts, but it would be dwarfed by the efficiencies on the fixed side, is that kind of the right way to think about it?","Daniel F. Akerson","Absolutely.","Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. And the one follow-up if I can, just really quickly, on Europe, the pricing, which was flat year-on-year, I mean, can you just give us a little bit more on that? Is that sort of an indication that things maybe stabilizing at, albeit, fairly low pricing levels in the region or is there product and other things in there that are helping that?","Daniel F. Akerson","Certainly, there is product in there that\u2019s helping that for us, the pricing environment remains quite competitive as you would expect given the situation there. We\u2019re product line by product line, market by market to optimize pricing, taking price where we can giving it up where we need to in order to optimize. We have much better visibility and much better tools frankly to manage some of that now than we had previously and that\u2019s allowing us to further optimize where we are.","Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line Colin Langan with UBS. Please go ahead.","Colin Langan \u2013 UBS","Great, thanks for taking my questions. I was just wondering when you show the walk for North America costs were flat year-over-year, but you do have the K2XX rolling out. Why is that cost, even I would have thought that had been given the size of the launch and should we think of that maybe being a headwind from a cost as we go in to Q2 and Q3. (Inaudible) maybe how that launch cost played out through the year.","Daniel F. Akerson","Yeah, let\u2019s start by talking about the calendar year again consistent with what we talked about back in January. We expect year-over-year fixed costs to be up primarily because of incremental D&A, incremental marketing, some pension income headwinds, and some manufacturing costs per-production and startup. I would expect most of that to roll through in Q2 and Q3 as we really start to ramp up the K2XX and the plants to the rest of the year and start the marketing activities.","Specific to Q1, we had as Dan mentioned earlier a $100 million headwind related to pension income. We also had a $100 million headwind from a fixed cost standpoint on manufacturing, primarily related to the downtime in Arlington, those were offset by favorable performance in variable cost, a $100 million in material and freight, and on around a $100 million in warranty related costs as the quality and base vehicle Monte gets better for us. So good performance on variable cost, we still have fixed cost headwinds as we expected and I would expect the fixed cost headwinds to increase as we go through Q2 and Q3 and hit the real launch cadence.","Colin Langan \u2013 UBS","Okay. Thanks for that color. I was looking at your upcoming, I guess, was that an optimism to annualize the Q1 results? How should we think about the Cadence, I think you touched on this before, but I think you mentioned that you expect your losses to be reduced by a third to a half, is this still the right range to be thinking about or do you think you maybe doing a little bit better given how Q1 came in?","Unidentified Company Representative","As I said I think earlier the \u2013 we laid out a plan in Q3, we gave some perspective back in January for the year. What we\u2019re seeing in the first quarter is on plan and consistent with the execution of those objectives, but in terms of the top line and the bottom line, as I mentioned earlier, cost performance was a little stronger attributable partially due to some timing benefits that came into the first quarter. So I\u2019d say we are on track relative to the objectives that we\u2019ve previously laid out. But this is the first quarter into the year and there are huge uncertainties obviously in relation to the European macro-economic environment and how that\u2019s going to unfold. So where we end up will be function of the things we do control, which we feel quite good about and a function of things that we don\u2019t control, which are quite uncertain.","Colin Langan \u2013 UBS","Okay. And just two last quick questions, where will be \u2013 part of [LA] has closed, I mean what is the \u2013 any estimate of the impact that should have and the timing of, obviously, that impact. And also in terms of the tax rate, I mean, it seems to be in the high 30s for this year based on your guidance. Is that normal or should we think when we go past this year it comes back down again, I think, mid 30s and above?","Daniel Ammann","(Inaudible) the results will roll in consistent with the closing so we closed the biggest chuck of this back on April 1 so that will come into the second quarter results. The overall outlook and run rate that we\u2019ve talked about previously still holds in relation to that. On the tax rate, we gave the perspective for this year, obviously, we\u2019ll see as we move through the year how that involves and how that rolls into next year. But I\u2019d point out importantly our cash tax rate is unchanged from \u2013 essentially unchanged from last year or continued to be in that 10 percentage range from a cash tax point of view notwithstanding the fact that the accounting GAAP tax rate will be in the upper 30s.","Colin Langan \u2013 UBS","Okay. Thank you for your help.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, guys.","Daniel F. Akerson","Good morning.","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a first question on the change in the reporting, presumably this isn\u2019t just an accounting exercise, I am just trying to understand as you shift the country of sales methodology here, what the shift internally as far as accountability and targets of your organization and really sort of what does mean for us measuring performance internally and driving the business.","Daniel F. Akerson","Well, the main reason we\u2019re doing this is for internal managerial purposes. I mean, as you\u2019ve seen and what we\u2019d laid out to you this morning that the external at the segment level that the changes aren\u2019t that dramatic between the previous approach and this approach. When you get below to the country level and to the product line level, we now have dramatically improved visibility by market, by product line from a profitability point of view and that will allow us to get much more focused on decisions ranging all the way from capital allocation to sales accountability, profitability, accountability. So this is a much greater and more significant internal impact than it is externally and we\u2019re seeing significant benefits from the improved visibility already on an internal basis.","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That\u2019s helpful.","Daniel F. Akerson","I would say if you go back a couple of years in time, we weren\u2019t quite sure with some of our products were in terms of profitability. And I know that \u2013 it may sound a bit strange, but we did not have the clarity, and therefore we didn\u2019t have the accountability that we have now. So this in my opinion in terms of managing the company is a huge step forward.","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, it\u2019s incredibly encouraging, I appreciate that. Second question just on raw materials in general, if we look back over the last year, it was about a $1,000 drop in raw mats going into a vehicle. The players that we talked to all are pointing their finger at the automakers as taking the benefit, because there\u2019s indexing and escalators and all that stuff. I\u2019m just curious what you\u2019re seeing on the raw mat front if you\u2019re getting the benefit from that already or when that ultimately should come and particularly given such a severe pullback through the beginning of this year?","Daniel Ammann","We are seeing the benefit of that. We\u2019ve taken some of that benefit in Q1. It really depends commodity by commodity, supplier by supplier, agreement by agreement as to how much is indexed versus how much isn\u2019t, what the lag time is and so on. But we certainly had some benefit in Q1 and based on where our current spot rates are we would expect to continue to have some benefit. But commodity prices are proving to be very volatile. I think they\u2019re all up again today from where they were.","So that\u2019s a spot driven, market driven element. We will obviously keep a close eye and take the benefits where we can and try to mitigate increases if and when they come.","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And just lastly, I mean if we look at the current consensus EPS for 2013 in the ballpark of 335, I\u2019m sure that will change today. But then if we think about really the cash earnings, it\u2019s at least 435 if not greater. I think one of the confusions around the stock is that, it looks like it\u2019s trading in north of nine times earnings, but reality is trading south of seven times earnings on a cash EPS basis. Would you ever consider communicating maybe more explicitly a cash earnings number? So the multiples would be more comparable to history, because I think a lot of people are being confused by the simplistic PE and not understanding of the actual cash PE is much cheaper than it is \u2013 than it looks like?","Daniel Ammann","Well, that\u2019s something that we would hope that these sophisticated sell side community will help to educate me on this. But hopefully we\u2019ve been quite clear about the difference between and one of the main drivers obviously is the GAAP versus cash tax rate. We\u2019ve tried to be as exclusive as we can in helping people understand that I would say from our dialogue with your larger investors, we haven\u2019t seen a whole lot of confusion on that front. But it\u2019s a useful perspective and we\u2019ll take that as we go.","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you very much.","Daniel Ammann","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays Capital","Yes, good morning. I would like to hear from Dan Akerson on a point he made on early slide about the 4G connectivity. Basically, I\u2019m looking for \u2013 what\u2019s the business case not just division around, what you are doing with connected car with that? Because at least the first [client share] of other competitors are varying just to use the consumers smartphone as they are linked in to the cloud and on a kind of costs per vehicle basis, you can certainly see the argument for that. So what is really the business case you see for this move?","Daniel F. Akerson","Well, we think going forward that this new demographic coming into the marketplace, pleas recall, I have children now that \u2013 I have grandchildren I should say that have only growing up in the world with smartphones. And our estimation instead of waiting for trends to overwhelm us, try to look over the horizon, having come out of the technology and communications area, the bigger the pipe, the more you reward it into the future.","So when we look at what we can do with a 4G pipe into a car, you can change the business model almost entirely. You maybe able to have a real revenue generating opportunity into the car with \u2013 when you come up for example, what happens if when the logo shows on your screen, analysis brought to you by Allstate, how many times is that going to pop and how much can you get from Allstate or I don\u2019t want to pull out one insurance company. Children, as you take them to school, of course, you got to watch distracted driving, we are very aware of that, but in the back seat, you can literally go from your living room, the children can pick up the same show that was on television or watch anything they want because this is going to deliver an incredible amount of downloaded capacity in different formats.","So at very little marginal cost, we opened up what I think are potentially lucrative lines of business that don\u2019t exist in kind of a safety and security or what you see on a \u2013 that\u2019s not integrated into other forms of media that exist in the household, can transition right with the car. So\u2026","Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays Capital","And are you\u2026","Unidentified Company Representative","\u2026it\u2019s a different model, but you have a different demographic that is different than you and I that\u2019s going to \u2013 we already see in some of our market research that put this high on their scale on their list of what\u2019s important in buying a car?","Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays Capital","And have you made any progress of your former colleagues in Telcom on bundled data plans that would include SIM car in a connected car?","Daniel F. Akerson","Yes.","Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays Capital","As a modest additional cost?","Daniel Ammann","I don\u2019t want to get into the contact, but I will tell you, having come out of that industry, the change that we\u2019ve affected between these two and the modules we\u2019ll be putting in these cars, it will affect, it will be a 4G LTE combination that will allow us to switch our entire fleet overnight. We\u2019ve never been able to do that. So we have flexibility that allows for our service providers to have to compete for our business, not only in terms of price, but featured to functionality.","Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Ryan Brinkman \u2013 JPMorgan","Hi, good morning, congrats on the quarter, and thanks for taking my call. There was a question earlier on your strong China JV margin, which 11.7% looks to be the strongest in a couple of years now, but can you maybe help us a bit more on the drivers of that improvement, because previously I think, we have been hearing on these calls about modest margin compression on a tougher pricing environment over there. So what accounts for that nicely bounded 1Q, and was there maybe anything lumpy to report in there?","Daniel Ammann","Yeah. I\u2019d say, first of all it\u2019s one quarter. But second of all, the business continues to grow over there and you understand as well as we do this as a business that has meaningful fixed costs and a fair amount of operating leverage to it. So if you can grow the business and keep some control from a pricing point of view, you do get operating leverage and that some of what we\u2019re seeing. How that market shakes out of the balance of the year, we\u2019ll need to watch, clearly people are adding capacity and it\u2019s a very competitive marketplace. But we\u2019ve grown \u2013 we\u2019ve been outgrowing the market there for the last little while and we hope to continue to do that.","Ryan Brinkman \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. Then on slide 16, you mentioned that the cost in your (inaudible) positive swing helped just $100 million by the lower D&A. So can you talk about the non-D&A savings there? I know you\u2019ve taken out a lot of salaried people in recent times, et cetera, is that the primary driver or there are other structural cost reductions to report. And then just second to that, is there anything you can say now in terms of savings from the Bochum closure now that we a better idea of how that\u2019s going to shake out.","Daniel Ammann","We are not saying anything about the Bochum closure at this point in time other than to refer you back to the overall fixed cost reductions that we previously talked about. In relation to the first quarter Europe cost performance, some of that a bit over of $100 million of that is the D&A reduction as a result of the impairment we talked about last time. There is a good chunk of fundamental cost savings in there between engineering and some of the other manufacturing items as I mentioned earlier. There are some time \u2013 other timing items that fell into this quarter which further helped that number. But I\u2019d say more fundamentally, we are in aggressive cost control mode in Europe, frankly, across the whole company hopefully as you have seen in our results, but in Europe, in particular, it\u2019s a very tough market environment. Ultimately, we don\u2019t totally control the top line but we do control what\u2019s going on cost wise and we\u2019ll stand aggressive on it.","Daniel F. Akerson","Let me just jump in there. First of all, we are pleased with our progress, but we are still losing money in Europe, a lot of it. And so we have a lot of work to do. Our objective is clearly to breakeven and then profitability. But I think we sent from the outset, it\u2019s okay, we have to match production with demand. But we also have to reduce cost across the board and everything we do, whether it\u2019s an IT, advertising, human resource cost across the board. And that\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re trying to do that globally. But we\u2019re particularly focused on it given the situation in Europe, the uncertainty over the next year or two on a macroeconomic basis; we have to protect the business as much as we can. And so although I think this is good progress, we have a lot of work to do yet.","Ryan Brinkman \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay, thanks. Then maybe just my last question could be much to do about nothing. But it looks like you filed an S3 last Friday. Is that just a generic shelter? Is there anything you can tell us more about it or what it might imply? And then second to it, it seems that the registration of course does not encompass any primary shares and there will be no proceeds to the company. But it does say, in one location that proceeds are received from the exercise of warrants could be used for general corporate purposes. So could you also sort of maybe remind us on the procedure of warrant exercise here and whether you could use that, use the net share, settlement method or otherwise use any cash proceeds from such exercise to repurchase stock as it\u2019s sometimes the case? Thanks.","Unidentified Company Representative","Yeah. The ability to net share settled the warrants is a function of individual warrants. The warrants that are referenced there are those that are held by the selling stockholders. And so the registration statement more generally, this is a procedural issue. We wanted to put that up. I mean as we said in a press release concurrent with filing that shelf that we\u2019re not aware if it\u2019s time of any specific plans by any selling shareholder to execute an offering. But we just wanted to take that mechanical step to have that ready.","Ryan Brinkman \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. Congrats again on the better results.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Joseph R. Spak \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just one more quick one on your \u2013 can you just \u2013 you mentioned the volume was flat despite wholesale is down, it looks like they were down 6%. Can you just explain that a little bit, what exactly \u2013 how did that happen?","Daniel Ammann","It\u2019s because we look at it on a country-by-country basis and aggregated up that way. So while total maybe down, it\u2019s a country-by-country in terms of the financial impact.","Joseph R. Spak \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then just one more in Europe, is it possible to give a day\u2019s inventory number across all of Europe?","Daniel Ammann","It is, I don\u2019t have that number right in the hand. What I\u2019d say to you is that and I think I mentioned it before, we came in the year in good share on a company-owned inventory basis, a bit heavy on the dealer inventory side. And I\u2019d say we worked that down so that we feel based on the current market environment at least that we\u2019re in a reasonable place on both.","Joseph R. Spak \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then last one from me, back in Detroit for GMIO you said EBIT absolutely will be up, margin will be down, and just given the change in structure, it looks like GMIO actually had the largest change. So is that still accurate or is there any change to that outlook for the year?","Daniel Ammann","We\u2019re not updating our outlook specifically here on this call. But I guess what I\u2019d say is that we did have some challenges in the consolidated operations in Q1 as evidenced by the result there. In Q1, those were offset by strength in China. We\u2019re one quarter into the year. We\u2019ll need to see how those relative trends shake out over the balance of the year.","Joseph R. Spak \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, that\u2019s all.","Daniel Ammann","Thank you.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets","Yeah, great, thank you, good morning. so wanted to go back to the 4G LTE conversation and hoping you can talk about how OnStar fits into that roll out. And is this an opportunity for you to perhaps significantly grow on size global subscriber base, I know it\u2019s been very, very well in China and here in the U.S. and Canada, and could that be a segment that you may consider eventually disclosing separately, perhaps investors see just a subscriber base business and potentially high margin there?","Daniel Ammann","Quite honestly hadn\u2019t thought about it, because this doesn\u2019t happen until end of 2014, but that\u2019s a good question. We do want to change this from primarily safety and security business to one that\u2019s much more feature rich and where we get, we get some real money from it, and we\u2019ve never been properly compensated in my opinion having come out of this industry in terms of what we provide to the carriers. For example, with the new contract when it kicks in every time we implement, we get $20, we use to get nothing.","And we\u2019ll actually revenue share and usage on that service, so this is a little bit different than the model of just having a carrier plug into your jack in the car, the carrier gets all of it, all of a sudden we\u2019re part of the solutions and not just an intermediary where we start to share revenue in different ways with the carrier. So we are not in the wireless business, but we are facilitating a customer and we\u2019re facilitating content. So there is a whole new frontier for us that I think we\u2019ll have margins that will exceed which you typically see in the manufacturing business.","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets","There are no further questions at this. I will now turn the call back to Randy Arickx, please continue with your presentation or closing remarks.","Randy Arickx","Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Tuesday, February 6, 2018.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Dhivya Suryadevara, Vice President of Corporate Finance. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.","Thanks, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us, as we review GM's financial results for the fourth quarter of 2017. Our press release was issued this morning, and the conference call materials are available on the GM Investor Relations website.","We're also broadcasting this call via webcast. Included in the chart set materials published this morning, we have the key takeaways from each chart in the notes pages in order to provide color on the results. This morning, Mary Barra, GM's Chairman and CEO, will provide some brief opening remarks; followed by Chuck Stevens, GM's Executive VP and CFO.

In the room today, we also have Tom Timko, Vice President, Global Business Solutions (sic) [Global Business Services], Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; and Rick Westenberg, Vice President and Treasurer, to assist in answering your questions.","I will now turn the call over to Mary Barra.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Thanks, Dhivya. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining. 2017 was a transformative year for GM. The very strong results we reported this morning demonstrate the earnings power of our core business and extend our track record of meeting our commitments.","Let's look at the full year results. Our EBIT adjusted of $12.8 billion repeats 2016's record performance. We had a record EBIT adjusted margin of 8.8%, and record EPS diluted adjusted of $6.62. We returned $6.7 billion in cash to shareholders, and our return on invested capital adjusted was 28% on a trailing four quarter basis.","GM begins this year as stronger, more resilient company because of the decisive actions we have taken in the past few years to: first, reshape our business; second, to focus on higher return opportunities; and third, invest in technologies that enable our vision of a future with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion.","We plan to continue our momentum in 2018 and position the company to accelerate further in 2019. This year, we expect continued strength in North America where, in 2017, we achieved a record EBIT adjusted margin. We expect improved results in GM International where we saw strong equity income in China and return to profitability in South America. We expect momentum from a full year sales of new crossovers and, later, our all-new full-size pickups, and we expect improved performance by adjacent businesses including GM Financial, and of course, we'll maintain a very strong cost efficiency focus across the entire business. Chuck will share additional details in a few minutes.","In the core business, where a strong mix of winning vehicles helped drive another outstanding year in 2017, in the U.S. specifically, GM was the pickup truck sales leader for the fourth year in a row. Chevrolet grew retail shares for the third consecutive year, and we became the fastest-growing crossover company in the industry with retail share up 1.6 percentage points.","Building on the success of our refreshed crossovers will be the 2019 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra full-size pickup, which go on sale later this year; and also the global launch of the Cadillac XT4 luxury Caddy CUV crossover.","With GM International, GM China delivered a year of record sales led by Buick and Baojun, and our luxury brand Cadillac, which grew 51%. To continue this momentum, GM China will introduce 15 new or refreshed models including seven SUVs and crossovers this year.","Finally, in South America, Chevrolet continued its market leadership, where sales rose 13.8% last year. In addition to great products, we are strengthening our performance through cost efficiencies that offset incremental investments in the business. We are on track for our commitment to achieve $6.5 billion in efficiencies by the end of this year on the 2014 baseline, and we'll continue that focus on costs beyond 2018.","In addition, we are making remarkable progress in advancing our vision for the future of personal mobility. This year, we expect to increase our investment in transportation as a service initiative to $1 billion. Last month, we filed a safety report that is available on GM.com and a safety petition with the U.S. Department of Transportation to allow us to safely deploy our fourth-generation self-driving Cruise AV. It is the first production-ready vehicle built to operate safely with no driver, no steering wheel, no pedals or manual control. The Cruise AV is another milestone on our path to deploying self-driving vehicles in a ride-sharing environment in 2019.","To advance our vision of a zero emissions world, we also announced the General Motors will introduce at least 20 new all-electric models by 2023. As we continue to make meaningful progress and lowering battery costs, we are confident that our next-generation EV architecture will be desirable, attainable and profitable with a range that our customers want. We will begin unveiling these vehicles in 2021.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Chuck to share additional details.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Thanks, Mary. I'd like to give some perspective on the quarter and provide additional insights into our 2018 outlook. Our strong fourth quarter results kept another record year of earnings as we met our commitments for the fourth year in a row. EBIT adjusted for the year of more than $12.8 billion repeats 2016's record performance, and we delivered a record margin of 8.8%, despite significant volume and commodity headwinds. We also achieved a record $6.62 in EPS diluted adjusted. Net revenue was $145.6 billion, down 2.4% from 2016 as we right-sized dealer inventories in the United States.","Our strong results for the year were driven by a record North American margin of 10.7%. This was achieved even with wholesales being down more than 10% versus 2016 and flat versus 2015. In addition to the record margin in North America, GM Financial generated record earnings before taxes. And within GM International, China sustained its strong equity income, and we returned to profitability in South America.","Turning to the fourth quarter, we generated $37.7 billion in net revenue, a record $3.1 billion in EBIT adjusted, and delivered $1.65 in EPS diluted adjusted. In the fourth quarter, North America generated $2.9 billion of EBIT adjusted, a Q4 record and an increase of $200 million year-over-year. We generated these strong earnings off $28.8 billion of revenue, resulting in another quarter of 10-plus percent margins for North America and leading to our third straight year of 10% or higher margins.","Volume continued to be a headwind the fourth quarter, with wholesales down 135,000 units on a year-over-year basis as we reduced our U.S. dealer inventory as planned. We ended the year with 63-days supply and 753,000 units of dealer inventory, down 8 days and 92,000 units from the end of 2017, both far surpassing the targets we committed to early last year.","We generated the record results in North America, despite the decline in volume and an increase in raw material costs of about $200 million in the fourth quarter through improved mix, pricing, and cost performance. Both our fourth quarter and calendar year performance demonstrate the resiliency of our North American business.","For the calendar year, the North America team delivered EBIT-adjusted of $11.9 billion with a record 10.7% margin even with a 447,000 unit decline in wholesales and $600 million of commodity headwinds. And pricing remained strong. Our U.S. average transaction prices continued to grow, despite increased industry-wide incentive spend and a slightly weaker industry volume. Our fourth quarter ATPs of about $37,000 were $1,500 higher than the fourth quarter of 2016.","The underlying strength of our business continues to improve as actions we have taken to reduce our fleet sales, improve residual values, and drive cost performance are playing out favorably in our results.","Moving to GM International, this is the first quarter for our new reporting segment which combines the former GMIO region with the former GM South America region. Overall, EBIT-adjusted for this segment improved $200 million year-over-year driven by cost and price improvements. South America continued to improve. The fourth quarter was the second straight profitable quarter resulting in breakeven for the year, and we anticipate continued improvement in 2018. China continues to deliver solid results with equity income of $2 billion for the full year, about equal to 2016.","A few comments on GM Financial and our Corp segment. As we continue to progress towards full captive, GM Financial posted record revenue of $3.3 billion and record earnings before tax adjusted of $300 million in the fourth quarter. Earnings assets grew 25% to about $86 billion, supporting expected future earnings growth, and we anticipate continued earnings growth in 2018.","In the Corporate segment, costs were about $500 million for the fourth quarter and about $1.5 billion for the full year. This was in line with our expected costs for the year. As discussed at the Deutsche Bank Conference, spend on transportation and service is expected to increase about $400 million in 2018 versus 2017 as we prepare to deploy self-driving vehicles in a ride-share environment in 2019. As a result, we expect the Corporate sector quarterly cost to run in the $500 million to $600 million range for 2018.","Turning to cash flow and capital allocation, Q4 adjusted automotive free cash flow improved by $1.7 billion year-over-year primarily due to favorable working capital as a result of normalization of production from the third quarter of 2017, partially offset by the impact of reduced dealer inventory. Adjusted automotive free cash flow for the full year of 2017 was $5.2 billion, down $3 billion year-over-year primarily due to lower automotive EBIT-adjusted of $400 million and movements in dealer inventory levels and the resulting impact on sales incentives of $2.2 billion.","As Mary mentioned, we returned $6.7 billion to our shareholders through $2.2 billion in dividends and $4.5 billion in stock repurchases through 2017. And as a result of our strategic sale of Opel\/Vauxhall, we were able to reduce our cash target by $2 billion. This is reflected in our year-end cash balance which is $2 billion lower than the 2016 year-end cash balance.","Now, I want to share more details on our 2018 outlook. As we outlined last month, we expect to deliver full year 2018 EPS diluted adjusted in the mid-$6 range. We expect core EBIT-adjusted and core automotive adjusted free cash flow to be largely in line with core business performance in 2017. Core results consist of all operations excluding our autonomous vehicle operations, including Cruise Automation, Maven, and our investment in Lyft.","Core automotive free cash flow will likely remain flat in 2018 as GM North American production levels and ending dealer inventory are expected to be relatively flat. Capital spending, as I said last month, will be about $8.5 billion for 2018, and we expect our annual run rate to decline as we get past our next-generation truck launch.","Looking at 2018 cadence, we expect Q1 and Q4 to be the weakest quarters driven by typical seasonality, as well as our retooling downtime related to our new full-size pickup trucks. We expect Q2 and Q3 to be the strongest. North America will be impacted in Q1 by an approximately 60,000 unit volume decline primarily due to truck downtime. As a reminder, Q1 is typically our weakest cash flow quarter due to working capital seasonality. Given the anticipated lower production I just mentioned as well as CapEx spend to support the truck launch, Q1 cash flow is expected to be meaningfully below our historical averages.","Our pace of buybacks for 2018 will be dependent on our free cash flow generation, our quarterly dividend which will remain at $0.38, and any additional calls on cash throughout the year.","In North America, we expect to sustain an EBIT-adjusted margin of 10%-plus primarily due to continued strength of the U.S. industry, favorable mix due to a full year of new crossovers, the launch of our all-new full-size trucks, and a continued focus on overall cost savings.","In GM International, we see improvement in 2018 driven primarily by the continued strengthening of our business in South America. In China, we see a similar dynamic as in 2017 and the past few years: continued pricing pressure offset by a richer mix of crossovers and anchored by strong sales from Buick and growing sales from Baojun and Cadillac resulting in another year of strong equity income.","In Korea, we've had recent discussions with key stakeholders regarding the need to improve Korea's financial and operational performance. As we strategically assess our performance, additional restructuring and rationalization actions may be required. More to come on this topic as we move through the year.","We see a significant opportunity for growth in adjacencies in 2018, specifically GM Financial, where we expect to once again improve earnings. Globally, while we expect a continued increase in raw material prices, we currently expect to largely mitigate through other cost performance.","So to sum it up, a record fourth quarter, another record year of profit, margins and EPS diluted adjusted in 2017 in the face of significant volume declines and commodity headwinds. And our organization is focused on meeting our commitments again in 2018, as we've done for the last four years.","That concludes our opening comments. We'll now move to the question-and-answer portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks for taking the question. I guess just to level set everyone, your core EBIT and core free cash flow, which you were saying flat in 2018, those metrics are about $13.5 billion, and just a shade under $6 billion on free cash flow?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","That would be the math when you look at what we delivered in 2017 and adjust for the investment in AV.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks. And the $300 million increase in AV and mobility that you're pointing to in 2018, is that the level that you think gets you ready to launch at scale in the first quarter of 2019, or should we expect a step-up in the quarter you actually go live?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. I would say it's $400 million roughly, from $600 million to $1 billion on AV itself, $700 million to $1.1 billion overall in the TAS (17:22) segment when you factor in Maven and some of the other activities. But specific to AV, it's $600 million to $1 billion, Joe. And that's the run rate for 2018. That's what we think we need to spend in order to continue on that path, and we'll have more to say about 2019, as we exit through 2018.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And last one, just \u2013 because you mentioned some of the adjacency growth in GM Financial, and clearly, there's \u2013 I know there's a lot of economic factors that go into the forecast, but there's been a more recent focus on rates. Do you feel confident with that on a reasonable range of rate outcomes for 2018?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Well, clearly our expectations for \u2013 or maybe not so, but I'll make it clear now. Our expectations for 2018 were based on a set of assumptions from a macro perspective. Here specific in the U.S., it was an environment where there are going to be moderate increases in interest, 75 basis points, moderate inflation, moderate wage growth, continued GDP growth and an industry that was going to be in the low 17 millions. Under that construct, we would expect the growth in GM Financial as indicated, as well as another strong year in North America with 10-plus percent margins. And that's our baseline assumption, and that's what we're executing to at this point.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Guggenheim.","Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Good morning.","Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Just wanted \u2013 could you give a little more color on the puts and takes for your GM North America EBIT in 2018? So I guess if we maybe refer to the typical bucket that you're reporting it in the slide, how should we think about those puts and takes for this year?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","So, you're looking for an EBIT bridge, Emmanuel. So I'll give you kind of a high-level view, because we kind of paint at the macro backdrop. So the way I think about it and going back to the Deutsche Bank Conference, and look at from a tailwinds and a headwinds perspective, clearly, as we think about 2018 headwinds \u2013 and it's global, but obviously a big component of North America \u2013 commodity prices are going to increase, pricing is going to continue to be challenging in the carryover space, and we expect a lower industry. And then we've got the added specific issue in North America as we talked about of the incremental truck downtime roughly 60,000 units.","To generate 10% margins in North America and offset some of those tailwinds \u2013 or headwinds, we have the full-year impact of our crossover launches, specifically the mid crossovers \u2013 Traverse, Enclave and Equinox \u2013 and we think that's going to be a pretty significant tailwind from a pricing perspective. We expect volume to be relatively flat year-over-year, but mix will be a headwind because of the lower truck production. And we expect cost performance to be favorable as we've demonstrated over the last couple of years with commercial and technical savings in GPSC and further SG&A efficiencies more than offsetting the incremental impact of commodities and launch-related costs. So, that's kind of the broad buckets.","Obviously, as we've done over the last number of years, that's the baseline plan. And as we go through the year, we will make adjustments and course correct in order to continue to execute towards that objective, again contextually within the macro environment that I described earlier.","Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities LLC","That's helpful. And I guess specifically within GMNA pricing, do you see any risk of just increased competitive conditions on the truck side? I mean, I understand on the crossover side, you have new product. But I guess on the pickup truck side, it seems like conditions are getting extremely competitive. I guess what is the directional assumption in your guidance for that?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. I would say, broadly speaking, we will have favorable pricing on new major, primarily driven by the full year of the crossovers and then the launch of the new truck later in the year. And there'll be a headwind, as we've seen over the last few years, on carryover pricing. As you know, incentive spend continues to amp up. But I would say, in that context, we still think truck pricing is going to be reasonably constructive.","And just one data point, if you look at truck pricing transaction prices, say, Q4 versus Q3 in 2017, from a segment perspective, they were up another $1,000 a unit from a transaction pricing perspective. We were down slightly given the age of our truck, and we've built that into our plan as we go through 2018. So on balance, we feel reasonably good about truck pricing. Certainly, we're looking forward to the next-generation truck which we think is going to be a significant tailwind for us.","Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thank you for the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and congratulations.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Thank you.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Maybe a question on the strength of the pickup truck franchise, but I'll ask it in a different way. Chuck, if I look at your guidance of kind of mid-$6 EPS, and I remove the $1 billion of Cruise AV investments, would it be fair to say that kind of all else equal, GM could still earn $6-plus in a, call it, high 15 million light vehicle SAAR. How can you think about the sensitivity now to the SAAR given what we've seen in terms of the pickup truck variable profits for yourselves and the industry?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Good question, Itay. So, the basic math would be, if we're in a 16 million industry versus 17 million, our wholesales are going to come down roughly 200,000 units, right? So 200,000 units at our average variable profit, the math would suggest that we would be north of $6 EPS in that environment for sure. I mean, it's a reasonably easy math exercise.","I think the key is how that develops, right, and how that 17 million to 16 million industry develops, because there's other factors that would come in play; what's the pricing environment as you're going down in aggregate, what's the mix. But I would say that that's how we're trying to position this business. I've always talked about North American EBIT margins of 10%, and building a business model that would sustain that in a mid-15 million to low-16 million range and that's what we've been progressing to. And I would say the resilience of the business model last year would suggest that. We're kind of wholesaling or producing at a SAAR level that was less than 17.6 million when you look at our year-over-year volume decline.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","That's very helpful. And just my follow-up. On the $1.5 billion of adjacent profit growth, I think for 2021, can you just share the cadence around that? How much might you be seeing this year and how much might that be contributing to your expectation of earnings improvement in 2019?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. I would say that without providing specifics over that kind of direction, where we're going to see and what we said back in January was a significant improvement in 2018, primarily GM Financials, as we continue on the captive. And then, we'll leg in the benefits in aftersales and OnStar as we go through kind of the 2019 to 2021 timeframe. The aftersales will be driven by continued growth in the car park after we bottomed out kind of in 2016, troughed out and then continue to increase our service loyalty, and OnStar is just continuing the growth of 4G LTE and some of the other related opportunities for revenue growth from that perspective. So, long answer. Simple answer is most of that improvement is going to come in GMF in 2018, and then between the three of them, kind of leg that in 2019 to 2021.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","That's very helpful. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Oh, great. Thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on a good quarter.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Thank you.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Any color \u2013 you've talked in the past about small cars losing money. Any update there in terms of maybe turning those around that could be the only area that is underperforming, I guess, and is it still losing money?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Last year, we had a focus and we took several actions to improve the overall performance across our car portfolio. Although, as you saw the shifts in the market, significant pressure on cars especially in the U.S. So, we continue to look for opportunities. We are well positioned though when you look at the fact that it was in the 2015 timeframe when we invested in and launched the compact and the mid-size with the Chevrolet Cruise and the Malibu. So we're well positioned with those being very robust architectures to continue to respond to the marketplace with very little capital investment as we move forward.","I'd also say if you look broader globally from a car perspective, when we start to launch GEM in the 2019 timeframe, I think that sets us up very well especially in emerging markets, Mexico, China and South America to have a very strong car platform and really reach into the marketplace where customers are focused.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And any color on the size of the raw material headwind that is based on your guidance in terms of number?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah, I mean, just to put it in perspective, last year, when we look at it in aggregate on a year-over-year basis, it was in the $700 million ZIP code. I think our baseline planning assumption is something a little bit less than that in 2018. So, roughly speaking, call it, $400 million to $500 million. But I think the important point is, as we see that develop, obviously, we were able to offset that impact last year through really strong performance across all other cost drivers. And we will react as we see how this develops during the year. But again for baseline planning assumptions, call it in the ZIP code of a $0.5 billion or so.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And just one last question, how should we think about the uses of free cash flow this year? I think you indicated in your comment that would be about flat year-over-year. Do you think the majority of the excess cash will be used to repurchases? Or should we model it in that way or do you need more de-leveraging? Any thoughts there?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Well, I think that our capital allocation framework is relatively transparent. We've been executing to it with discipline over the last number of years. So our guidance is flat free cash flow year-over-year in the core business. So call it roughly, ex-TAS (28:57) $6 billion, with TAS (28:58) roughly $5 billion, and we pay dividends, so that will be $2.2 billion. That will leave $2.8 billion for other actions. Other actions being M&A, not that I'm suggesting there's anything on the radar, but that's what that's for and\/or restructuring and\/or share buybacks. And I would say, as we go through the year, you would start with a $2.8 billion kind of opportunity for share buybacks and we'll see what develops. But to the extent that we have free cash flow available, that's what we're going to do. We're going to buy back shares.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. All right. Thank you very much for taking my question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, guys.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Hey.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I hate to beat the dead horse here, just kind of staying on North America for a second. But when we look at it, the performance in the second half of the year has been pretty remarkable with volumes down and margins incredibly strong and actually in the fourth quarter up. I'm just curious, as you look at the market, I mean, the two levers that you've been able to pull is product launches and strong mix and the second one is cost cutting. So I'm just thinking, as you look at sort of your product cadence going forward, do you think there's an opportunity to upsell consumers into products that are better for them at higher prices and higher variable margins? Do you think you can kind of clip off another 5-point move towards crossover? Just kind of how you're thinking about that upselling opportunity.","And then also, how much further you have to go on cost cutting in North America to potentially offset any weakness or create just absolute upside to earnings going forward?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. Let me focus on trucks, John, because we spent a fair amount of time talking about that at the Deutsche Bank Conference. While we've done very well with the current truck franchise, we think there's significant upside with the next-generation because we've released a number of constraints that we've had that will allow us to drive richer mix.","The Silverado, we will have eight very distinct models that will cover the breadth of the portfolio, including up level where the current truck has really underperformed. We've also eliminated the constraint on crew cab mix that we've had. We underperformed versus the market on crew cab mix, and I think we talked about in general a $2 billion opportunity for revenue growth just by releasing those constraints. So that's an example of something that we're executing. We're executing with the next-generation truck.","I'd also say that as we think about the overall truck, not only are we releasing some of these constraints and have a broader product offering, there is going to be significant differentiation between the Silverado and the very premium Sierra, and we're going to continue to focus on that and we think that's going to provide upside as well as the Denali mix that has been very favorable to us.","And I think you'll continue to see that focus on differentiation when we launch the heavy-duties as well as the SUV. So, very, very purposefully, as we did the full-size truck pickup, we're trying to address some of the challenges we've had over the number of years to really drive the best possible mix and profitability. And we think \u2013 I think we solved that with this truck that we're going to start launching later in 2018.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Chuck, just to clarify, the $2 billion revenue opportunity, that does not include the HDs? Or does that include the HDs as well?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","That was \u2013 that was on LDs, just looking at crew-cab mix.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","So, a high-level number, John, right? But if you just look at our penetration or our average transaction prices versus kind of the segment leader and that opportunity and we think that we can close 75% of that just by releasing the constraint on crew-cab mix.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And I got to imagine that's got pretty high variable margins?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","It does.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Yeah. Then a second question. Mary, I mean, I think a lot of us here in New York and even in the investment community are looking at the potential launch of a test fleet of Cruise vehicles here in New York City this year. I'm just curious where that stands as far as the launch and what we should be looking forward to hopefully for an event, an investor event around it.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","So, we are on track and proceeding to be able to launch in a geo-fenced ride-sharing environment autonomous vehicles in the 2019 timeframe. Clearly, the focus continues to be on the development we're doing in San Francisco because of the complexity of that environment and the learnings that we get and the speed of learnings that we get from San Francisco. We are in the process of mapping New York, and I don't have anything specific to share of when we'll actually have a fleet deployed, but we are on that path as we announced last year and we'll continue. But I'd say the primary focus is on San Francisco.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just lastly real quick. Chuck, when we look at the GMF dividend, it looks like it went in reverse from the ParentCo to the GMF $600 million in the fourth quarter. What's going on there? And when can we expect to see sort of the more traditional dividend up from the FinCo to the ParentCo develop and, I mean, when will that occur? And should we looking at $1 billion size out in 2019 or 2020 when GMF matures?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. The dividend came from GMF to the parent in 2017. It was not included in our free cash flow numbers. It was related to the transaction of divesting our FinCo in Europe. And as you looked at the proceeds and the leverage ratios and everything else, they had the capacity to dividend about half of the proceeds to us, which we did. Again, that's not captured in the free cash flow number for 2017, obviously, in liquidity.","Relative to long term \u2013 I think good question, John, and I think I would think about it in the context of our view on long-term cash generation capabilities of the company. Clearly, where we sit right now, pretty heavy CapEx load with the next-generation truck, incremental investment in AV, we're in the ZIP code of $5 billion to $6 billion of free cash flow. As you think beyond the next couple years in this kind of environment, we think our cash generation capability increases significantly.","A couple of drivers to that. One, we'll be cycling past our high capital spend, and as we've indicated, we expect capital spend to come down. And two, we're going to at some point in time start to get the benefit of dividends from GM Financial, and I would say stay tuned on that. We'll have more to say as we get closer to that, but that is certainly part of our go-forward kind of plan relative to cash and cash flow and enhancing the overall cash generation of the business.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you very much.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks. Just two questions. First, you've made some really bold moves, your team on rationalizing and exiting businesses where the chances of generating a positive return on capital are really, really remote. Obviously, Europe's being the biggest and most significant of that. So as you assess the portfolio today, are there still some either product areas or regions, and I guess I'm thinking Korea, although I won't say Korea, that areas where really you maybe couldn't justify being in long-term?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Well, if you look at it, I mean, I think we have a track record of demonstrating that we're going to look at, to your point, those segments and regions and\/or countries and look at our ability to generate the right returns over a long period of time.","Clearly, Korea is a challenge for us. We have a strong presence there. We've grown market share. The brand has \u2013 Chevrolet brand has done well. But the current cost structure has become challenging, and we're going to have to take actions going forward to have a viable business. We've already begun conversations with the key stakeholders in GM Korea, including our minority owners and the union, and being very clear that we need to improve the financial and operating performance. So we're right in the middle of having those conversations.","We know, within Korea and there's a few other countries, where we have to look at, that we're going to take the steps necessary to have the right franchise going forward that may result in some rationalization actions or restructuring that potentially could have a material impact on our results. But it's too soon to tell right now. We're right in the middle of the conversations to make sure everybody, all the stakeholders, understand the steps we need to take.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, Mary. And you mentioned a few other countries. Any of these countries outside of Asia or could you be more specific?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","I would say primarily in our GMI operations. But I would say Korea is the one that we're most focused on, the others I think would be less significant.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right. All right. And then my second and final question on the robo-taxi fleet, can you \u2013 a bit of a round numbers are helpful here. How many Level 4, Level 5 vehicles does GM have on the road in their testing fleet right now? How many would you expect by year end and maybe an order of magnitude for 2019?","I asked that question because it's important for us to kind of put to your guidance some transparency on the amount of money you're putting towards it to try to think of it on a unit basis, to kind of have an understanding of the size of your footprint. So if you could help us with it, that would be appreciated.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Right now, we have about 100 vehicles that are driving primarily Gen 2, Gen 3. And so, that's where our focus. That will be growing through the course of this year. Remember where we talked about when we were together in the fall, getting to a point where we're collecting a million miles per month and so we're on that path to get there throughout this year. Beyond that, we haven't sized it and that is something that we'll share more as we get through this year and into the 2019 timeframe.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, Mary.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Congrats on the quarter.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Thanks.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Thank you.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","You mentioned in the slides that you've now achieved by the end of 2017, $5.5 billion of the $6.5 billion cumulative cost saves targeted through 2018. These savings, I think they started in 2015. So I guess like 75% of the savings period has elapsed and you've now realized 85% of the targeted savings. So, is the takeaway that the cost savings continue but at accelerated pace or maybe that \u2013 and if history is any guide, since you've increased the number a couple of times, there could be some upside in 2018 to that $6.5 billion number? Do you think if there there's some incremental pressures in 2018, like higher than anticipated commodity prices that you might be able to push a little bit further on cost to try to offset that?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Well, I'd say first, when we first rolled out this objective, it was at $5.5 billion. And as we overachieved it last year, early last year is when we raised it to $6.5 billion. Importantly, just to level set that this is primarily commercial savings, SG&A and manufacturing which we've said would more than offset the incremental investment in marketing, engineering and D&A. And what we like to do is achieve the commitments that we make and then move from there. So, clearly, we are very focused on achieving the $6.5 billion that we committed to back in 2015. Clearly, we believe there's opportunities above and beyond that that we're going to continue to pursue. And once we hit the $6.5 billion, we will set the next objective for ourselves, because I do believe there is, and so does Mary, further opportunities beyond that.","And I'd also say, Ryan, that if you look at last year and look at the EBIT bridges that we sent, you'll see pretty significant, across the board, cost performance outside of these buckets as well. So we had significant improvement and warranty, driven by improved quality, reduced recalls, all the things that we talked about back in 2014, and we are really focused on that. So more to come, but first, we're going to get the $6.5 billion commitment in the bag. And then, I'm quite sure that we'll have more to say on above and beyond that.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then, Chuck, I think I heard you say that there would be a 60,000-unit headwind in truck volume in the first quarter due to the changeover to the new pickups, which I think was a little surprising because the launch doesn't, I think, take place until 3Q. But all along you've been approaching this launch a little bit differently than in the past, even taking some downtime in 2017, for example, to prepare for a 2018 launch. So maybe could you just talk about some of the efforts that you've already taken and then are going to take in 1Q to kind of help to prepare for this smoother-than-typical launch in the back half of the year?","I think it might be helpful because consensus is below your forecast currently. And I think a primary reason for that is that the Street is maybe not fully understanding why your profits can maintain at such a strong level while you're launching a new truck, because typically in the past both GM and Ford have seen, at least temporarily, lower profits in the year that they launch a new truck.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. Specific to this truck, again, start at a high level, Ryan, this is an all-new architecture. Our last three generations of truck were fundamentally off the same architecture, with changes in sheet metal. So, this is an absolute all-new architecture which requires all new body shops.","So, when we take downtime at certain facilities, it's because we're either converting or constructing new body shops to facilitate this launch, and we've been opportunistic around doing that around holiday periods so that you can get extra time to make these transitions without a full impact on downtime. So, again, taking advantage of Christmas time and leading into Q1, we've taken that opportunity with this transition.","As I said back in January, we expect the unmitigated impact of launch and volume for the next-generation truck in 2018 to be about 130,000 units. We've tried to leg that in over the 2017\/2018 timeframe by taking, again, opportunistic downtime to do the work that we needed to do at the facilities.","In addition, we will be launching this year, and we're in process right now, of building what we call the Oshawa Shuttle, where we're taking bodies from Fort Wayne through the old body shop, shipping those to Canada and painting and assembling trucks there, which will fill about half of that gap. So, that's a mitigating action to take, a pretty significant headwind of 130,000 units, in essence, mitigate half of it and we're confident that that's going to turn out to be a benefit for us in 2018. Again, this is a massive level of change in our four facilities with an all-new architecture, and we're going to have to manage this and execute this flawlessly over the next couple of years, and so far, so good.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for taking our questions here. Want to talk a little bit about solid results this year, with free cash flow coming down obviously from 2017 to 2018, you're going to have that to be flat year-over-year again. But as we head into 2019, is there any reason to think that we can't get back up to that pro forma $8 billion that you laid out for 2016?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","I think 2019 might be a little bit premature for that, David. Again, this is early days, right? But going back to what I talked about earlier, what's going to drive kind of moving off the run rate that we're at right now into what we talked about before, it's going to be as we cycle through our heavy CapEx cycle, we're launching and starting to launch of the light duties in the T1 this year. And next year, we still have HDs and then the full-size SUVs. And we're launching GEM as well in 2019.","So, I would say that we need to cycle through 2018, 2019 capital spending, and then we'll start to see a meaningful decrease in that beyond the 2019 timeframe. And I think that would be kind of the trigger point to see that inflection. I mean, again, very early days and all premised on kind of the environment we're operating in right now.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah. That's fair. I mean, just kind of picking through the results and thinking about some of the positives from an adjusted EBIT perspective, things like warranty expense, I mean, just trying to understand what's going to drop through that could maybe give you better free cash flow than kind of what you're guiding to for 2018 and then also picking up into 2019.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. And let's talk about warranty for just a second. Clearly, a good tailwind in 2017 from a P&L perspective. The drivers of that \u2013 half of that was kind of an absence of reserve adjustments that we took in 2016 and half of it was what we were seeing come through in base warranty, extended warranty experience which resulted in an adjustment to our reserves, but then on a go \u2013 the go-forward accrual. I think the cash impact of that bleeds in over time, because as you're adjusting reserves and the repairs, obviously, warranties extend for three to five years. So, that would be another area that we would expect to see an improvement in the cash associated with that, but probably beyond 2018.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And then just following up on a line of questioning earlier, I think, Mary, you were saying generating about a million miles per month with the test leads that you have. How much you augmenting that real world mileage with simulated miles? And does that grow over time and how much incremental expenses that really weigh on the P&L and CapEx for the autonomous development?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","So, just to be to be clear, we have about 100 vehicles, we'll be growing that fleet of the Gen 2, Gen 3, getting to a million miles a month. Not there yet, I just wanted to be clear on that. But we are absolutely supplementing and doing quite a bit of simulation both here and in San Francisco using the experiences that we have or the miles that we're capturing and the work that we've done in that space. So, I can't give you the specific number of simulated miles that we've done, but I will tell you it's very significant.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Is there any rule of thumb or ratio we should be thinking about? I know, I'd say one of your larger competitors, it's a very still number, but they were doing maybe 3 million miles overnight with some of their compute power. So, any color you can kind of give us there from a ratio of what you would think you need on simulated miles versus real world miles could be useful?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","I don't have the specifics on that. We can look into that. I don't know if we've come out and said exactly how much we're doing from a simulation perspective. I would say I think when you look at the real performance that's happening, look at the rate of improvement, and there was just a study that came out where the substantial rate of improvement we had from disengagements and also the number of miles we traveled, I think it's pretty significant.","So, I think all of that comes together with the real measures of what we're seeing in, again, in a very complex urban environment. We saw a 63% reduction in disengagements from 2016 to 2017. And also the average monthly miles per disengagement improved over 2,500%. So, very significant when you look at what we're doing with the miles we're experiencing and learning from in San Francisco added with the simulation. So I think it all comes together in those numbers, which I think is probably a better thing to look at.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everybody.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Hi, Rod.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I had a couple of questions remaining. One is just could you clarify what the Korea losses are running at right now within GMI?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","We don't report country-level profitability, Rod. So, sorry.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Maybe just switching gears to North America, obviously, pretty impressive pricing and ATPs. And I'm wondering if you can clarify \u2013 you've given us some of the components, but when you think about the net outlook for 2018, you said components were crossovers positive, obviously some weakness in the carryover, and it sounded like you're assuming higher subvention for a higher rate environment. The unusual thing this year is that you've got pretty tight inventories on the trucks, which I presume could help mitigate some of the normal incentives that you have on the run out. Any thoughts on how we should be thinking about your positioning for net price?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","I think overall, net price will be positive in 2018 versus 2017. The benefit \u2013 the tailwinds will be crossover pricing, a full year of that, and really cycling off of pretty low transaction prices \u2013 pretty low, pretty tough pricing environment for us, given the age of those products into the new products. So that will be a tailwind. And the new truck will be a tailwind, I think, February 6. But those combined will be greater than carryover headwinds.","And you bring up a good point. Clearly, we ended the year very lean from a truck inventory perspective and our production is going to be lower this year versus last year, so we expect to continue to run pretty lean inventories on a go-forward basis, and that will help mitigate some of the truck challenges as we kind of run through that. But net-net, overall positive with new being greater than carryover headwind.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And presumably you've incorporated some rate subvention associated with that 75 basis points you plotted. Is that correct?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Well, we've certainly built that into our baseline set of assumptions; a 75 basis point increase in rates as well as a continuation of kind of what we've seen over the last number of years as incentive spend as a percentage of transaction price. We've seen 60 bps to 100 bps on a year-over-year basis increase in that, so that's kind of the environment we're assuming is going to continue. A tough pricing environment in the U.S.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. And just lastly, you've given in the past a really helpful analysis that basically helped us bridge to breakeven at like an 11 million SAAR. Just could you remind us what some of the cost elements are in your downside scenario? What are the levers that you can pull from a fixed cost perspective, maybe Tier 2 ad budgets, things like that?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. Sure. Again, this is \u2013 the proof is \u2013 this will be a very, very detailed assessment that we would have to go through, but if you look at our workforce today in the U.S. specifically, much more variable than it was in the past, we've got roughly 25% Tier 2 and a few percentage points of temporary, so call it 30% percent overall. Through 2019, we have no caps. We expected that to grow closer to 40% to 50%. So in theory, at a system level, if there was a 10% or a 15% reduction in volume, we should be able to take 10% to 15% of the labor-related costs out over a relatively short period of time. So that's one fundamental driver. Our manufacturing cost for modeling purposes would come out at the same pace as volume.","Number two, we would obviously reduce marketing expense. Marketing expense over a baseline level is highly variable, right? And if you just tag that to a percent of next sales, if there's a 20% reduction in volume, you could reduce marketing expense by at least 20%. And clearly, another significant component would be our compensation structure which is largely variable. And if we're making less money, we're paying less variable compensation.","Those three items in combination \u2013 and obviously, there'd be opportunities on the margin, not insignificant, but opportunities on the margin, those three will drive $3 billion to $4 billion roughly of fixed cost opportunity or cost opportunity in a typical downturn. And that's what's built into our U.S. breakeven or North American breakeven at a U.S. industry level of 10 million to 11 million units.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. That's real helpful.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Couple of questions; one managerial and one more around housekeeping on accounting. The managerial ones is, with the cost reduction efforts both for material and employee-related, you haven't made a big deal of \u2013 unlike some other firms that are reducing costs of big, high-level programs that smell of consultants and program offices. But could you give us a sense of how the material cost saves and how the employee costs saves show up in terms of managerial actions that \u2013 are there ongoing targets? What are the key areas? How do you kind of balance getting the costs out without kind of going back to the old bean-counting reputation of GM?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah, sure. And this all started back in 2013, 2014, and I think we laid that out at the Deutsche Bank Conference the journey we've been on when we looked at the business and looked at the opportunities for the business and where it should be. And we did a lot of benchmarking. We did benchmarking around our material costs and the GM penalty we were carrying. We did benchmarking around harbor, manufacturing costs, benchmarking around world-class levels of SG&A, and we established benchmarks for all of the leads in those areas. And we have fundamentally been executing to those benchmark areas since 2014.","Beyond that, we enabled the achievement of some of these benchmarks through a couple of important initiatives that we've launched: Operational Excellence and Global Business Solutions. Between the two of those, one was GBS. It has taken in a significant amount of work globally in the SG&A space that was very fragmented and not optimal and efficient, and brought it under one roof, common processes, common systems, end to end and drove significant savings in the more transactional side of the business.","Operational Excellence is the way we do business now. When you look at a cost challenge or a business challenge and aftermarket challenge, we use operational excellence tool, Six Sigma, Lean, the whole toolbox to really at an enterprise level drive from where we are today to a target. And I think we do this in a very, very disciplined way. It gets a lot of visibility. The $6.5 billion by key driver, we review it with the management team and Mary on a regular basis. We review it with the Board of Directors.","And I think that as opposed to consulting\/bean-counting exercise, you're seeing it show up in the bottom line results as we continue to generate strong performance in an environment that is tougher than what we expected over the last couple of years. And we're going to continue to do that.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Yeah. I would just add to that. It's really driving the culture of everyone understanding that we need to continuously improve processes. And also, when we see challenges we've got to figure out ways to overcome them. So that's the mindset that Chuck is talking about. When there's a challenge or a target, we need to make sure we have a plan to address it, and every employee has the tools to \u2013 outside the structure tools like Six Sigma to go after those.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So it's more of an ongoing culture than a one-time consulting exercise?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Absolutely. I mean \u2013 and the $6.5 billion that we set up a few years ago and talked about, purposefully, Mary and I talked about that externally to put the stake in the ground, so that we would hold ourselves accountable to it and be transparent around that commitment. And I would expect that, as I said earlier, once we cycle through that, there'll be a next round that we want to be held accountable to and people should build a track to the P&L \u2013 we wanted cost savings, because that would roll through to the P&L. And again, we're seeing that.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. A couple of accounting questions. One, any impact of the FASB accounting rule change around net periodic pension costs in terms of North America EBIT where you're generating pension income? And second around $9 billion write-down of deferred tax asset, you still have about $24 billion left. Can you give us a sense of when you, given your business plan, would likely flip to becoming a U.S. taxpayer, cash taxpayer?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. Sure. On the first question, no impact on North American EBIT, it's just geography both above the EBIT line, so no impact. And I don't know where the $9 billion came from, but it was like $7 billion for the impact of tax reform going from the statutory rate of 35% to 21% on our deferred tax assets. We have about $23 billion left after that adjustment, and I would expect that we would remain a very low cash tax paying in a position for the foreseeable future, 2022-2023 timeframe.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. So any impact of tax reform on cash taxes would be well after that. In the meantime, you're not a significant U.S. cash taxpayer?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. The way I would think about it is, absent that, beyond 2022-2023, we would start to move up into \u2013 closer to a 35% range or 28% range, and now we're not going to \u2013 it's a longer term benefit for us from a cash tax-paying standpoint.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Right. Despite the GAAP adjustments?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing comments.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","I'd like to thank everybody for participating today. I hope you see that GM is a stronger, more focused company than we were just a few years ago, and we have much more work to do. In fact, just last week, we had our senior leadership team together to have \u2013 so everybody is perfectly aligned in what we need to accomplish in 2018 and beyond. We recognize that our industry is changing rapidly and with that, there are opportunities and there are also challenges. But as you look at the strategy that we've been executing, we believe that we will continue to capitalize on those opportunities, minimize the challenges and drive long-term shareholder value. That's what we come to work for every day. So, thank you all for participating.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

Welcome to the General Motors Company Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Tuesday, October 25, 2016.","I would now like to turn the call over to Randy Arickx, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Randy Arickx - General Motors Co.","Thanks, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us as we review GM's financial results for the third quarter of 2016. Our press release was issued this morning and the conference call materials are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. Included in the chart set materials published this morning, we've included key takeaways from each chart in the notes pages in order to provide color on the results.","This morning, Mary Barra, General Motors Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will provide brief opening remarks followed by Chuck Stevens, GM's Executive VP and CFO, and then we'll open the line for questions from the analyst community.","Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the legend regarding forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language. In the room today we also have Tom Timko, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; and Dhivya Suryadevara, Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Investment Officer to assist in answering your questions.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Mary Barra.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Thanks, Randy, and good morning, everyone. Thank you very much for joining. GM delivered strong earnings and achieved several third quarter records that included net income, EBIT-adjusted, EBIT-adjusted margins, EPS diluted-adjusted and adjusted automotive free cash flow.","Here are just a few of the year-over-year highlights. Net income increased 104% to $2.8 billion as net revenue rose 10% to $42.8 billion, which is an all-time record. EBIT-adjusted was up 14% to $3.5 billion. EBIT-adjusted margin was 8.3%, up 0.3 percentage points and EPS diluted-adjusted was up nearly 15% to $1.72. Adjusted automotive free cash flow was $3.8 billion, up from $0.8 billion last year and ROIC adjusted of 30.6% on a trailing four-quarter basis was an all-time record continuing the positive impact of our disciplined capital allocation framework.","Given our outstanding performance this year, we are on track to deliver a record 2016 on top of a record 2015 and a very strong 2014. In addition, we expect to be at the high end of our full-year EPS diluted adjusted guidance of $5.50 to $6 per share.","We also completed our initial $5 billion share buyback commitment a quarter early and we'll be purchasing additional shares in the fourth quarter.","We had very strong performances in North America and China. So let me cover a few of the highlights. In North America, our disciplined retail-focused strategy is paying off. U.S. retail share grew 0.4 percentage points for the highest Q3 share in five years. Chevrolet posted its best Q3 U.S. retail performance in 10 years and Buick's best in 11 years.","Our Q3 ATP of almost $36,000 exceeded the industry by nearly $5,000. On the incentive front, although we are operating in an extremely competitive environment, we remain committed to our disciplined go-to-market strategy with a focus on retail customers and Chuck will have more to say about that in just a few minutes.","We also announced the 2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV range of 238 miles at a price of $37,495 before tax incentives. So the final cost to customers can be under $30,000 depending on their tax situation. We also have eight of the 2017 North America car, truck and utility of the year semi-finalist. We have the Cruze from Chevrolet and the Bolt EV, we have the GMC Acadia, we have the Cadillac CTS and XT5 and the Buick LaCrosse, Cascada and Envision.","I would also say just yesterday, we had very strong results from consumer reports for Buick. Even with the volatility from a market and pricing perspective as we look at China, China was able to post year-to-date retail sales through September \u2013 and through September GM and its joint ventures delivered 2.7 million units, which is up 9% year-over-year. We had six new launches from our Chevrolet, Buick and Baojun brand.","Buick and Baojun set Q3 sales records, driven by the Excelle GT, the Envision and the Verano Notchback and also for Baojun driven by the Baojun 560 and the 730.","In Cadillac, retail sales rose a record 79% in the quarter on strong sales of the XT5, the XTS, the ATSL and our year-to-date retail sales for China are up 35%.","For Europe, through the first nine months of the year, we broke even. In fact, at the end of H1, we were on plan to breakeven for the full year. Because of the UK referendum and the resulting devaluation of the British pound, we continue to expect that we will incur about $400 million impact in the second-half of the year, and the team is working extremely hard to minimize the effect of this headwind. But, even with the Brexit situation, our Opel, Vauxhall brands continue to show strength. Through September, sales are up 5% year-to-date on the Astra's strong performance. And we also have introductions of the refreshed MOKKA X and Zafira that are laying the foundation for future growth.","In addition to the progress I reviewed so far, Q3 \u2013 through Q3, we have realized $3.7 billion of the $5.5 billion target in cost efficiencies by 2018 and this is off a 2014 baseline. These savings will more than offset incremental investments in brand building, engineering, and the technology investments we are making, as we launch new products in 2016 and beyond. Because of the progress we've made, we are confident that we can exceed the $5.5 billion target and we intend to use these additional savings to offset our investments in the future of personal mobility where we see tremendous return potential.","We also are seeing positive results on our strategy to consolidate global architectures and powertrains. Production of the Cadillac XT5 and the GMC Acadia. The first two models on our new crossover platform are nearly fully ramped up and the new Buick LaCrosse, Baojun, (7:20) Malibu on the mid-sized platform and the Chevrolet Cruze Hatchback variant is launching on the new compact car architecture.","Because these new global architectures and powertrains are so efficient from a mass and a fuel economy standpoint, we can use them for multiple lifecycles and this will enable significant reuse of our capital and the ability to deploy elsewhere in the business. From the perspective of talking about personal mobility, we are leveraging our technical expertise in the core business to lead in the future of personal mobility for our customers. We are expanding our EV leadership with the Chevrolet Bolt EV and the Opel Ampera-e. They both go into production this quarter, and they'll surprise a lot of people in terms of performance, range, connectivity and styling.","We are also testing 30 self-driving Chevrolet Bolt EVs on public roads in Scottsdale, Arizona and San Francisco with autonomous vehicle trainers. Our Maven personal mobility brand has seen rapid growth through its launch nine months ago. We expect to be in 15 markets by the end of 2016 with nearly 10,000 vehicles, and we've launched three services on the Maven platform, the City, Residential and Express Drive variants. 70% of Maven's customers are millennials that live in urban areas, and nearly 90 employees, 60 who are from outside of General Motors, 40% are millennials and they have collective experience of launching over 40 startups and as a team hold 117 patents. So, we really have an energized team running our Maven business.","When we look at connectivity, we are building on our 20-year lead with OnStar. We expect to have nearly 12 million connected customers globally by the end of the year, and we've transitioned the OnStar RemoteLink app to our vehicle brands. Customer engagement is up with 150 million interactions year-to-date versus the 135 million we had for all of 2015. And lastly, we have nearly 500 customers that have enrolled in our Smart Driver service since its launch in July. They can use this service to autonomously (9:32) seek insurance discount for good driving practices.","So every winning quarter we continue to demonstrate what the earnings power is of General Motors. The team's performance this quarter is further evidence that we are doing what we say we are going to do. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Chuck.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Thanks, Mary. I'd like to provide some perspective on the quarter and our results through the first nine months of the year. In addition to another record quarter, we also put up some very strong results year-to-date. EBIT-adjusted through September grew to a record $10.1 billion, up $2.1 billion on a year-over-year basis. EBIT-adjusted margin was a record 8.3%, up a 110 basis points year-over-year. The positive results were broad-based with all but one of our automotive regions posting year-over-year profit improvement during the first nine months of the year.","Our strong year-to-date results were led by record results in North America, sustained strong performance in China, and breakeven results in Europe. And our performance year-to-date clearly demonstrates that we're on track to meet our commitment and deliver another year of strong results. In North America, EBIT-adjusted grew to a record $9.4 billion for the first nine months of the year, up $1.2 billion year-over-year. Our EBIT-adjusted margin was a record at 10.7%, up 20 basis points year-over-year, and in line with our target of sustaining strong margins of 10% plus for the year.","In fact, North America has achieved 10% plus EBIT-adjusted margins for five of the last six quarters. The underlying strength of the U.S. industry continues to support our strong earnings in North America. We expect the U.S light vehicle industry to be in the low to mid 17 million SAAR range for the year. And we also continue to expect the industry will remain strong, albeit in a plateau environment over the next number of years.","However, given the recent increased interest in industry incentive and inventory levels, I'd like to spend a few additional minutes to share our view. Cleary, we recognize the industry is increasingly competitive, especially as consumer preferences are shifting away from sedans and more towards SUVs and trucks. We've remained absolutely committed to our disciplined retail-focused go-to-market strategy, and we have demonstrated that by managing supply and demand, and through disciplined pricing. In fact on average, our third quarter incentives as a percentage of transaction price significantly under paced the industry. GM was up 30 basis points year-over-year, but the industry was up 80 basis points year-over-year. Furthermore, our transaction prices increased at approximately twice the rate of industry during this time period.","Q3 incentive levels were influenced by our sell-down of the 2016 model year vehicles, resulting in a model year changeover pace ahead of where we were last year. Current model year product now makes up more than half of our dealer inventory, which is approximately 15 points better than last year's status at this point in time. Our aggregate dealer inventories are up year-over-year, increasing the availability of our recently launched products, like the Cadillac XT5, GMC Acadia, and the Chevrolet Cruze and Malibu. And given our dealer footprint, our days supply is well-positioned at 79 days, as it's important to have sufficient inventory as we move into the strongest seasonal pickup market, coupled with holiday-related downtime in Q4.","Looking ahead to Q4 and beyond, we would expect aggregate dealer inventory levels to remain higher than a year ago, as the industry remains strong and we build dealer stocks ahead of our upcoming crossover launches in 2017. We also expect days supply to fluctuate before moderating by year-end. Having said that, as we've demonstrated in the past, our inventory levels will be dictated by matching supply with demand. We will continue to watch inventories closely, especially cars, and will take actions if and when required. We also expect our incentive levels to moderate in Q4 as we benefit from a higher mix of newer model sales, increased availability of our most recently launched products, and an expected strong finish to the year for U.S. industry SAAR levels.","As you may have already seen, incentives as a percentage of transaction price for the industry are trending down in October, per J.D. Power's mid-month data. And our incentives as a percentage of transaction price are also expected to trend down as we progress throughout the month and the rest of the quarter. It's clear our go-to market strategy is working, and we remain confident in the health of the U.S. industry.","Okay. Let's move on to the rest of the world. China continues to deliver solid results, with equity income of $1.4 billion for the first nine months of the year, about equal to a year ago, with net income margin remaining strong at 9.3%. In South America, as you all know, macroeconomic conditions remain challenging. We continue to work to offset these pressures and take the necessary steps to set us up for future success. Our efforts are paying off. In spite of the challenging environment, worse than what we experienced in 2015, the team has narrowed losses by nearly $300 million this year compared to 2015.","Shifting to Europe. Despite the ongoing effects of Brexit, the region posted breakeven results for the first nine months of the year, an improvement of $500 million year-over-year, and the best performance year-to-date since the third quarter of 2011. Clearly, we have made substantial progress towards our breakeven target in 2016. However, we continue to face headwinds related to the UK referendum. And as all of you know, the British pound continues to fall to lows not seen in decades.","As we indicated back in the second quarter, we continue to estimate that Brexit could have a negative impact of up to $400 million in the second half of 2016, which includes over $100 million already incurred in the third quarter. The team continues to remain focused on making progress on our turnaround plans in Europe, and we will continue working to partially offset these headwinds to the best of our ability.","Turning to cash flow and capital allocation, adjusted automotive free cash flow grew to $5.2 billion for the first nine months of the year, up $2.7 billion year-over-year. These results include an increase of $1.5 billion in capital spending, as we make portfolio investments in our product lineup consistent with our previously communicated plan.","As a reminder, Q4 cash flow tends to be weak due to seasonality, however we remain on track to generate approximately $6 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow for the year. Our strong cash flow generation and earnings growth continues to support a significant return of capital to shareholders, in line with our capital allocation framework.","We've returned $3.3 billion to shareholders through the first nine months of the year, including $1.8 billion in common stock dividends and $1.5 billion in share repurchases, completing our initial $5 billion program ahead of schedule. We expect to repurchase additional shares in the fourth quarter as we work towards the $4 billion in share repurchases we committed to completing by the end of 2017.","Finally, with regard to our outlook for the remainder of 2016. Given our very strong year-to-date results and our current outlook for Q4, we now expect 2016 full-year diluted earnings per share adjusted to be at the high end of the $5.50 to $6 range per diluted adjusted share. It is clear that we've accomplished a lot already this year, and we fully expect 2016 to be another record year for the company.","We're in the process of finalizing our 2017 planning assumptions, and we'll provide you with additional color in January on what to expect for the year. However, we do expect a continuation of strong earnings in 2017, as North America's results will be favorably impacted by our strong launch cadence of new crossovers, as well as a continuation of positive cost efficiencies around the globe.","That concludes our opening comments. We'll now move to the question-and-answer portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli, Citi.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Good morning.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Good morning.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. So, Chuck, can you \u2013 just on 2017, I know, it's early for guidance in detail, I think, the slides do still talk about GM expecting a kind of positive earnings trajectory. So the initial thought is that earnings can still go up next year versus this year, and then maybe if you can give us a little bit more detail on the various kinds of puts and takes to think about when modeling 2017?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. Itay, we'll have more to say on \u2013 at the Deutsche Bank Conference in January, specifically around the details on how we see earnings shaping up in 2017, but with that said, absent an unforeseen economic development either in the U.S. or China, and we certainly don't foresee any, we would expect GM to deliver improved EPS diluted-adjusted in 2017, which is consistent with what we've been talking about for some time now.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. That's very helpful. And then just secondly, can you help us a little bit more to think about how you're thinking about China in the fourth quarter, given the environment and the tax incentives, as well as what you're kind of seeing in terms of inventory levels and pricing going into the fourth quarter?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Well. I would say, there is certainly a little uncertainty around the tax incentive, and the way that will \u2013 when that may end, and that's had an impact on the strength of the Chinese market calendar year-to-date. Absent some announcement by the government, we'd expect Q4 to be strong as well in the range of 9% to 10% up year-over-year. We've seen, so far in October the industry in sales continue to run very well. We still expect to see strong equity income consistent with our guidance to generate about $2 billion of equity income for the year, and pricing continues to be a significant challenge. We've been able to offset that on a year-to-date basis with improvements in mix and continued material cost efficiencies. So it feels to me kind of more of the same in the fourth quarter, consistent with what we've seen in the first three quarters of the year.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","That's very helpful. And just lastly maybe strategic question for Mary. I think, last month, John Zimmer from Lyft kind of predicted that the majority of Lyft's rides will be autonomous within five years. I was curious if that's \u2013 that comment is part of your plan with Lyft in terms of the on demand network partnership? And maybe, if you could give us an update on kind of how you're looking at the trajectory on these efforts going forward?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Sure. We are making great progress on the autonomous development. As I mentioned, we have a fleet now running, not only in San Francisco, but also in Scottsdale, so 30 vehicles on the road. And that's important because it's not just the miles, but it's really the experiences and the scenarios that they continue to learn every day and I'm very pleased with the team's performance.","As we look at launching autonomous into the marketplace, we believe it will first happen in a controlled environment, in a ride-sharing environment, hence the alliance that we did with Lyft, as well as the work that we're doing with Maven. But as we see it going into ride sharing, that's because it will be geo-fenced, you're going to have limitations with speed and other limitations, and that's why the ownership will stay with the company in these first models as we continue to learn.","And so, that path is very much on track, but I will say what is going to gate our launching of autonomous vehicles into the marketplace for consumers is safety. And we are working very hard with the experience that we have to do that in the safest manner possible because it does then really address the issues that we have of over 90% of fatalities in today \u2013 in today's U.S. streets are human error. And so, we think we can make a big dent on that so we'll be gated by safety, but once we feel that we've got the right system, we're working with our regulators, we have the scale to put those vehicles into production extremely quickly.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","That's very helpful. Thanks so much everybody.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. I had a couple questions. One is just, I was hoping you can elaborate a little bit on the outlook for pricing and profitability in North America. Yeah, you've done a very good job of keeping inventories at good levels and have had really good results on pricing. Of course everybody is noticing some increasingly aggressive actions from competitors, Ram (23:50) incentives are at 16% of average transaction prices. This quarter we're seeing a number of retailers talking about margin compression in new. This morning FCA talked about over 600,000 units of additional truck capacity in 2018, and I think, IHS is projecting something like 13% increase in GM production in Q4. So I was hoping, just in the context of all these things that we all see, can you talk about, number one, the GM production outlook and maybe a little bit more on the levers that you can pull to sustain 10% margins in North America as we look out to next year?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah, sure. Let me start kind of at 10,000 feet and work my way down a little bit. I already spoke to our inventory level, and we feel our inventory level is appropriate given our dealer footprint, and what's really driven the increase in inventory which is filling out inventory on newly launched products and new entries that we didn't have before like the CT6 or the Envision as an example. And continuing to work on inventory for our compact crossover so that we have sufficient supply as we look to change those models over in 2017. From a pricing incentive perspective, clearly the market in general is getting more competitive and there is some aggressiveness from a truck perspective, but I step back and look at the overall strength of our three-truck strategy, the light duty, heavy duty and mid-size trucks, we've been able to maintain discipline around that, grow retail share and increase our transaction prices in spite of some of this, and I think, it's fundamentally driven by the very, very strong product, relative to the truck capacity coming on stream. We could sell more vehicles, if we have more vehicles from a truck perspective today, and hence one of the clear focus areas on the retail side of the business. You also need to peel the onion a bit on where are we \u2013 where is the industry actually adding capacity, is it in trucks, is it in SUVs, is it in crossovers, because again we believe we're well-positioned. We have dominant share in full-size SUVs and our full-size pickup trucks continue to perform very well.","To your last point or how do we continue to see earnings be sustained from a North American standpoint, and I think, there's two or three fundamental drivers to that, Rod. Number one, we're running at different play and it's generating different results. We're very focused on retail in a very disciplined way. Our retail market share is up, we're less reliant on less profitable daily rental, and that's showing up in our results.","We also have our very, very strong product launch cadence, so this year we fundamentally rolled over our entire passenger car portfolio, and next year we'll start the strong launch cadence of completely refreshing crossovers, small, compact and mid-size over the next 12 months to 18 months; and that's critical, that's a lot of volume, it's highly profitable and we expect to see that.","We also expect to see continued improvements from a cost standpoint. North America fundamentally enjoys the large benefit of that $5.5 billion of cost efficiency, and as Mary indicated, we're looking to drive that even higher and that's going to be fundamentally from a material performance, logistics performance and we'll continue to streamline manufacturing and SG&A. Taking all that together, we're confident and constructive that under a plateaued industry environment that we can continue to sustain strong margins in North America like we have done over the past couple of years.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. And could you confirm that what IHS is calling for vis-\u00e0-vis GM's Q4 production; and on a separate track, if you can maybe talk a little bit about scenario planning for China? Right now your volume is up 9%, there's been some margin pressure, which you guys have pointed to, but you're keeping earnings flat. I'd imagine that some \u2013 to some degree there is some demand pulled forward. So if we were to think about a flat market in China or something significantly flatter, what would \u2013 how would that effect GM's equity earnings outlook?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. Let me \u2013 when you're talking about fourth quarter production, are you talking about total or trucks or what?","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","IHS is calling for North America production in the fourth quarter for GM, last I checked I think it was an October update of being up 13% year-over-year. I'm not sure if that's correct, but it seems like a fairly big increase just given the trends that we've been observing?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes. We worked through the launch cadence of our recently launched products, we would expect overall production to be up in the fourth quarter marginally from the third quarter, and obviously what plays into that are the Christmas holidays and everything else, but we would expect production to be up. Relative to China and the specific questions around planning assumptions in China, we've been able to maintain strong equity income and strong margins through continuing to launch new products, improved mix, and material performance which is fundamentally offset price headwinds.","Obviously, this year the industry is running stronger than we expected, because of some uncertainty around the purchase tax incentive, if that was to end and the government was to announce an end to that, our planning assumption would be that \u2013 there could be some volatility in maybe the first quarter and second quarter of next year, but then we would still expect the industry to continue on that growth path towards 30 million units and as we've talked before, a little bit more volatile growth pattern and in the kind of low single digit range over the next number of years, again it really depends on what's announced from the government's perspective, we have no insight on that. We certainly expect the pricing dynamic to continue and that's why we're so focused on our product launch cadence and I would say similar to the U.S., our product launch cadence in China is heavily weighted towards SUVs and crossovers over the next number of years as well as Cadillac products which is going to help from a mix standpoint. All that said, more to say in January around specifics, but we would expect China equity income to continue to be strong. We would expect margins over time to be compressed. They're at somewhat unnaturally high levels at from an industry perspective for the foreign OEMs, but still be generating strong overall equity income.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, guys.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Good morning.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a first question on truck pricing, because there seems to be some hyperbole around elasticity of demand to pricing. I'm just curious, when you think about pricing on trucks and what you're seeing in the competitive environment, I mean if one competitor cuts price, do they tend to pull forward their own demand or do they tend to conquest sales, I'm just trying to understand what's going on here, because it really \u2013 there seems to be a belief that price cutting can drive significant conquesting and I'm just curious how you think about that?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Well, I think that you really need to peel the truck market down almost cab type by cab type and trim level by trim level, because price elasticity in our view becomes less relevant the more you move up from a trim level perspective and a cab level perspective. First, truck buyers are the most loyal of any customer. The loyalty rates of truck buyers are north of 60% and generally you are in the 50% range, so that's first, you are dealing with that aspect.","Second, where there seems to be the most elasticity is at the very low end of the market. So, regular cab work type trucks and things like that, and I think that, you saw some of that play out last year when one of our competitors was very aggressive and we were losing share at the lower end, but still generating strong profits and good transaction price growth. And I think that's what we're seeing play out. So, I wouldn't paint the whole truck market pricing dynamic with one brush, you almost need to look and peel that onion back a layer or two layers. We're still performing exceptionally well up-level crew cab \u2013 our new up-level additions and higher trims that we're rolling out, and we've seen improved transaction prices and improved, actually, profitability on the current truck platform on a year-over-year basis and \u2013 despite some of the challenges at the lower end of the market.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, that's very helpful. Then just a second question, could you just give us your leasing levels in the third quarter in the U.S., or sort of a percentage of sales? And what you think the industry roughly was in the quarter?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. The industry was \u2013 and this is broad strokes, John, but I think directionally correct, in the 27%, 28% range, and we're a little bit lower than that from a leasing perspective in Q3. 24% for us, and that's down from highs earlier this year of close to 30%. So, typically we would be a few percentage points below the industry average just because of the mix, less trucks are leased. So \u2013 but that's kind of where the dynamic's at \u2013 and what we're seeing is, lease penetration at an industry level is up kind of the same amount that subvented financing is down, right. As the market is dealing with low interest rates and people are still looking for payments that they used to get through subvented financing.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it, that's helpful. And then just lastly, I mean, on cap allocation, I personally would pretty much agree with the way that you're going after this. But clearly what we're seeing in the stock is there \u2013 the market is maybe disagreeing with cap allocation and where we are in the cycle. I'm just curious, would you ever consider storing more of this cash on the balance sheet to create a larger buffer and maybe calm some market concerns which appear to be out there, given what the stock is doing, and maybe taking advantage of a buyback or redistribution of capital to shareholders as the cycle progresses and maybe goes to the downside, or are you going to stay in the stalwart path of sort of $10 billion roughly of net cash and excess free cash flow above and beyond that will just be redistributed through buybacks?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. We did a lot of work around our original capital allocation framework in the targeted $20 billion of cash. We looked at the business. We looked at what it was going to take to run the business through the cycle, to ensure that we can continue to invest appropriately through the cycle, because that's one of the lessons learned, and to ensure that we could maintain the dividend through the cycle, through a typical 25% downturn. That is the basis for our targeted cash. We will continue to reevaluate that depending on market dynamics, but \u2013 and we do on a regular basis, but there was a lot of work to come up with that $20 billion.","And fundamentally, we're making all the investments that we want to make from a capital spending perspective. We're making the investments we want to make from an innovation technology standpoint. And at the end of the day, $20 billion is what we really need to run this business and manage it through a cycle, maintain the dividends. So under that construct, what's available from a free cash flow perspective should come back to our owners, and we also have a revolver. Obviously, our intent was not to draw that in a downturn, but that's an emergency backstop in the event of some unforeseen issue or a deeper-than-typical downturn, and that's available to us as well.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I am sorry, Chuck, just one follow-up on that. I mean, you talked about $20 billion of gross cash. You didn't mention the net cash. I mean, is there a potential that you would consider taking on some leverage to buy back the stock? I mean, right now the market cap is 2.8 times your trailing EBITDA, it's pretty inexpensive growth basis right now.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. Going back to our overall capital allocation framework. First and foremost, invest appropriately in the business through the cycle to drive, sustain 20% plus return on invested capital and invest in the future for technology and innovation. Second, maintain an investment grade balance sheet, and we're targeting to run the company at a single A rating, because we think that's the right thing to do from a financial risk management perspective and to support GM Financial, which will ultimately lead to significantly improved earnings at the finance company, but also at the car company. So, we don't \u2013 we feel today, when you look at our overall external debt and our \u2013 the position of our underfunded pensions, that we have the appropriate amount of leverage. We do not want to overlay financial leverage on top of operating leverage in this business, because that's another lesson learned from the last significant downturn that we went through.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's very helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for taking my question, which is on Europe. I think that the guidance back in July was maybe $400 million of Brexit impact in the back half of 2016 or $800 million annualized, but it looks like you called out just $100 million in 3Q or more like $400 million annualized. So, with a quarter's worth of results in Europe post-Brexit, do you now have a different assessment of the annualized financial impact? September SAAR in Western Europe, I think, was like the strongest since May of 2009. I wonder if maybe when you guided to the annualized impact back in July, if perhaps you had assumed lower industry volumes that have yet to, at least so far, materialize.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. Let me go back to what we talked about in July, because I think it was you that asked the question, Ryan, when we were talking about the $400 million impact in the second half of the year and you kept pushing me on, what's the calendar year impact. And I think I said early days, but an indication would be, take the $400 million and multiply it by two, right. A full year impact of the second half, pound sterling only, without a lot of insight on what was happening from an industry perspective and everything else.","And I'll circle back to that in a minute, but I just wanted to kind of set the foundation for that $800 million. It wasn't a well-studied kind of guidance. It was a general directional answer to a conservation you and I were having on the last earnings call. We did guide to the second half impact of $400 million. We are holding to that guidance. What manifested itself was $100 million in the third quarter. So, that would leave a residual $300 million in the fourth quarter on the basis of our crystal ball today on where we're landing from a pound sterling perspective. The reason, it was more backend loaded, obviously, we had some hedges in places that helped in the third quarter to mitigate that to a certain extent.","And the pound is we can further, since we provided that guidance. So, we still expect, for the second half of the year, in the range of $400 million headwind associated with Brexit, primarily related to the pound sterling and that's primarily now a fourth quarter issue, about $300 million of that residual would fall into the fourth quarter, which will certainly make our challenge of breakeven in Europe very, very difficult especially when you think about the seasonality of earnings and everything else. Just looking at the pound sterling impact itself. Pick an exchange rate, at the end of Q2, we were at $1.28, $1.29. The last I checked this morning, we are at $1.22. There is a several hundred million dollar headwind on our long pound sterling position that in and of itself in 2017 if I was picking a point today would be significant. But there are number of actions that we're working through with the European team to mitigate as much of that as we can. More to come, in January, but certainly the environment in Europe is challenging and uncertain, and very volatile at this point in time.","From an industry standpoint, I agree with you that performance in Western Europe has been strong and strong through the third quarter and frankly it was even strong in the UK, but again when you look at the sales, there were a lot of fleet sales in Q3, a lot of very unprofitable fleet sales in Q3. We didn't necessarily participate in it, but there is a lot of inventory being kind of unloaded.","I would expect and we still expect to see the industry pull back as we exit this year and go into next year to a certain extend as OEM start to price. We raised prices 2.5% on October 1, our intelligence suggests Volkswagen followed, not to that full level, but followed as well. And that \u2013 in and of itself along with consumer sentiment issues should \u2013 will drive some pullback from an industry standpoint. So, we'll have to see how that plays out.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Very helpful color. Thank you. My final question is on consolidated international operations, looks like the loss there narrowed quite a bit sequentially, that was actually the biggest difference versus our model. So what is the plan and sort of the cadence to walking this region back to say breakeven? Maybe remind us of the timing and the magnitude of the savings coming from winding down manufacturing costs in Australia and if you could share if there are any other catalysts or step changes in profitability in the region that investors might have to look forward to?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Well, I would say, our approach in all of our operations, including the consolidated operation is to put in place, a path to drive these businesses to viability and appropriate returns, and if not to take action. And exiting manufacturing in Australia was one of those. We should be through that by the end of 2017, all else equal that would be worth a $100 million to $150 million a year in savings from a manufacturing cost perspective once we exit that activity. Again scheduled at the end of 2017. We've already exited or significantly downsized our vehicle manufacturing, car manufacturing activity in Thailand. We ceased manufacturing in Indonesia. I would suggest we are looking at all of our operations there and as we've indicated in the Q, there could be additional significant restructurings, depending on whether we can identify the path forward, because we're just not going to absorb the kinds of losses that we've seen there on an ongoing basis. So, I would suggest there is likely more actions to come.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, Mary. I got one for you first and I'd be particularly interested in your answer to this question as an engineer by training and profession. So, as the ADAS \u2013 and the question is about ADAS, cars still with steering wheels but a lot safer, and our dialog with suppliers and regulators, especially as these systems mature in the market and they get the data to show the vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-pedestrian empirical data the reductions are very significant, sometimes 30% or 50% depending on the accident. My question for you is, Mary, how much does it cost per unit to make your vehicles order of magnitude like a third safer, 30% or 50% safer? Is it hundreds of dollars, is it a thousand, or is it in the thousands of dollars, just order of magnitude?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","So, Adam, we don't really disclose that type of pricing from a technology perspective. What I would say is if you look at our vehicles, there's tremendous safety features on them already, whether it's airbags or the lane detection, emergency braking, rear object detection, and even when you back up from a perpendicular perspective. And a lot of the technologies on the vehicle today that we have put on and offset to a large extent the technology for safety are finding cost improvements, material cost improvements and just overall design and efficiency of the vehicle.","And the way I look at it is all this technology is making the driver safer today on the roads. We'll continue on that journey, but I think the real step function happens with autonomous, because you really then get to a point, again, if you've implemented autonomous very safely and really understand all the dynamics that will happen, there's an infinite number of situations that drivers and our vehicles will see and how you respond to those is going to be critical. That's where you get the step function improvement. So I don't see it as it's $300 gets you this, $500 gets you this. That's not really the way we look at it. We continue to look at how do we incorporate the safety technology into the vehicle, looking at affordability today, and I would call that the evolutionary path, and then autonomous is more of the revolutionary path, and we're working to drive those costs down, but again we have ensured those in detail.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. The reason why I ask is because, although fully autonomous is a noble initiative, and it's coming and to get the real 95% to 100% type reductions, it seems we can't \u2013 if there are technologies that are vastly easier to implement and more affordable in an ownership model that can lead to a 50% reduction, that's worth implementing as well. It just raises industry questions about the insurability of the vehicles that you're selling today without these systems and the value that they would have in the secondhand markets. We'll continue that discussion.","Maybe, Chuck, a question for you then lastly. You mentioned the goal of $6 billion of adjusted auto free cash flow. When I look year to date, though, and take the $10 billion of automotive operating cash flow and I take out CapEx, I get a number of $3.2 billion. So I guess when you say adjusted, there are some changes you're making to that number; because you're not implying you're going to make almost $3 billion as free cash flow in the fourth quarter. Is that fair?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. The noise in that is pension. So...","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. All right.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","So we funded that with debt, so you just add the $2 billion, so the $3.2 billion you get $5.2 billion of free cash flow ex-pension contribution.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Because I guess the big investor question we're getting is, that is a competition for the cash, right. And even if it's not every year, they are with some regular frequency. So like last year you made $5 of earnings; but the free cash flow per share, including the pension contributions and a lot of other unusual stuff, was about $1.30. So there was a big gap. You're narrowing that gap this year. Maybe if you include the pension funding, you get to close to half like (49:13) to maybe if you do $6 plus of earnings and you do $3 of free cash flow a share, but you still have that gap. So the question, Chuck, is will this gap be narrowed so that your $6 or so of earnings can really reflect cash earnings as well? And what are the factors you think that can drive the narrowing of that gap? Thanks.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. First, just, let's go back to the pension just to be clear, that was a debt-for-debt funding, right. And for display purposes, on a GAAP basis, it's taking out of operating cash flow, obviously free cash flow would add back in because it's debt-for-debt. So the $5.2 billion is the right adjusted free cash flow number and consistent with our $6 billion target free cash flow at the end of the year and that's what we'll apply to our capital allocation framework.","When you look at our overall difference between EPS and cash, obviously, we have cash taxes, and that's going to be and have been roughly $1 billion a year. Capital spending is higher than D&A, because we've underspent for a number of years and it's going to take a while to catch that up. And pensions; at the end of the day, we have pension income that is non-cash that gets reversed. So I would say that, as we look forward, the way I think about it is our conversion ratio should improve on a go-forward basis, because incremental EBIT is highly levered to cash flow on a go-forward basis and that's what I've talked about before.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So the gap has got to be driven by operational improvement. There is nothing else in the adjustments that you see improving that gap. That's how I'm interpreting that.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Well, over time, there will be puts and takes. D&A is going to obviously catch up, and our cash tax rates or our ultimate cash tax payment will increase versus where we are today over time, and we'll start to accrue GMF dividends. But over the next two years or three years, it's going to be operational improvement and leverage.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, everybody.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Good morning. A quick housekeeping question and then a more strategic question. Housekeeping is, Chuck, you had mentioned fourth quarter production could be sequentially up. Just to clarify, IHS forecasts a lot of (51:53) 14% year-over-year in 4Q in North America. That's down somewhat sequentially just given the holiday. So just wanted to clarify what you're expecting.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","So we expect sequentially 2016 Q4 versus 2016 Q3 to be up slightly, maybe 3% on a FUS basis, right, our factory unit sale basis, which would be production plus imports versus 2015 Q4, it looks like we'll be up 150,000 units or so, all things equal, on the basis of our outlook right now.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. The more strategic question is China over the summer has made more noise about new energy vehicles. Europe, culminating in the German Bundestag floating an idea of eliminating ICE sales by 2030. So (52:57) just three propositions. One, do you think there is a realistic possibility that China and Europe actually get the EV penetrations mid next decade, well ahead of the U.S.? Two, given their penchant for favoring the home team, how are you positioned? And in particular, we hear most of what you're doing around electrification and autonomous for U.S. markets; but how are you thinking about those internationally? And three, how do you think it's going to affect the mid-term to longer term profitability of those regions?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","So clearly, we believe that China is going to lead in the penetration of electric vehicles into the market, and that's why we've announced that we have 10 new energy vehicles coming out. I would say we're also the only OEM that actually manufactures batteries in-country right now. Clearly, we have the strength of the products that we have available to sell globally, with the second generation Volt as well as the Bolt EV and the Ampera-e, along with many other electrified products in China.","So we definitely see that trend. I think one of the things, though, and this is where we also have an advantage with our PATAC Engineering Center, that we can really leverage the supply base and that volume in China to really help us globally from a electrification perspective, and we intend to do that.","I would also say, from a European perspective, we definitely are seeing more of a move, and we'll be announcing the Ampera-e next year that, with some of the different issues associated with emissions, there is a much stronger interest and focus on electrification.","We clearly think the highest market will be China. I think we'll see progress in both the U.S. and Europe. I would also say, though, we've got some very good diesel products that we're launching, both cars and trucks, that are getting very good market reception. And so I think it's too soon to exactly call how the penetration is going to be, but definitely probably more significant than we thought maybe a year or two ago.","And clearly, we've got to get the scale and get the engineering work done, that we can have minimal impact from a margin perspective.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And I guess, similar for autonomy, do you think China will accelerate and, maybe not surpass the U.S., but pull even with it, just given the density of the populations in the urban centers?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Again, there's so many issues that have to be resolved to be able to say who is going to be first. Not only is it getting safe technology deployed \u2013 and I think we're in a excellent position, that we intend to be among the first or the first with safe autonomous vehicles. And then we do have the capacity to build those at scale. But you have to look at how the regulatory environment will impact around the globe, and in China, there are certain restrictions to mapping technology as well. So I think there is a lot to play out to right now call who is going to lead.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And our final question today comes from the line of Joe Spak with RBC Capital Markets.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. The first question was just on the incentive spending commentary in North America \u2013 or in the U.S. I guess, that you mentioned earlier, down as a percent of ATPs in the fourth quarter versus third quarter. And you mentioned the October data point. But, first of all, isn't that always the case at this time of year as the model mix changes? I guess what I was wondering is if you could give us a sense of, if you believe, on a like-for-like basis, incentive spending for the industry and for GM will be flat, up, or down on a year-over-year basis in the quarter?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Well, I guess I would just look at the trend year-to-date. The trend year-to-date is that the industry, the incentive spend as a percentage of transaction price through the first three quarters of the year is up on a year-over-year basis. Off the top of my head, 60 basis points to 70 basis points, so somewhere from a 10.6% to 11.3%, we're generally in that range as well, maybe 11.4%.","I would expect, and you're right, typically, depending on how the model changes are going for all of the competition, Q4 has a tendency to ramp down a little bit, because you've launched the new model of your vehicles, for us specifically, because we're in really good shape from that perspective, but we'd expect the industry broadly to follow that same trend. But I'd also expect on a year-over-year basis, it will be up, consistent with what's happened in the first nine months of the year.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Okay. And then one quick one on the free cash flow guidance, which I know you reiterated for this year; and I think back in January over 16 to 18, you called for a $6 billion to $7 billion range. A, I guess I want to understand if you think that range is still valid? And then I know, Mary, at the beginning of the call, you said some investment might be funded by greater-than-expected cost efficiencies. But can you give us an indication of how much within that $6 billion to $7 billion is actually a headwind from spending on items such as electrification, autonomous, or other ventures?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Well, one, we'll have more specific guidance on beyond 2016 in January, but generally speaking, we would expect to generate strong cash flow over the next number of years, and we haven't changed our perspective on that. And this year's $6 billion is, we're on track to deliver that. Relative to this, the second question, and I'll let Mary speak to it as well. But free cash flow is after we make investments and everything else. So, obviously, if we expect to continue to maintain strong cash flow, that's after we've funded investments in autonomous or engineering for autonomous or future technologies, just as \u2013 broadly speaking.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","That's absolutely correct.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes. I guess what I was wondering is, said another way, how much higher would it have been if you weren't making investments (59:35)?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. I kind of figured that was your question. And I'm not quite ready to \u2013 think we're ready to go out and start to saying, we're investing X on autonomous vehicle or future technology engineering, because you got to kind of \u2013 what technology are you speaking to specifically? I would suggest, versus the previous plan as we really started to ramp up. Our activities around autonomous vehicles, the amount that we're spending does not have a B attached to it.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","And I would also say, the efficiencies that we're seeing when you can reuse our contextures that we have on \u2013 that are launching or have on the road right now and you look at the development costs to do the next-generation architecture versus reusing, that's all as I mentioned, investment that can be redeployed in the transformative technology.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks lot, guys.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Randy Arickx.","Randy Arickx - General Motors Co.","And I'll hand it over to Mary for closing remarks.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Great, thanks. Thanks, everybody, for participating. I hope you can see we are working hard to make sure the core business is operating in a very disciplined fashion and we have the opportunity for continued strong performance. And that is key because we are then investing in the transformative technologies that we've just talked about, building on our leading connectivity, building on the strong options that we have in the marketplace now and we'll continue to launch with the Volt, with Bolt EV and with other electrification products, as well as our work in fuel cells. We are being very aggressive from an autonomous perspective and leveraging the knowledge that we have to do that safely, and then also from a sharing perspective with both the alliance with Lyft and with Maven. So we understand this is a ever-challenging global marketplace, but I hope that you see that we are a very focused and disciplined leadership team and we're going to continue to execute our plans and drive profitable growth.","I really appreciate everybody participating today and I look forward to talking to you next year.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you disconnect your lines. Thank you.

During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded Thursday August 1st, 2019.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Rocky Gupta, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations.","Rocky Gupta","Thanks Stephanie. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us as we review GM's financial results for the second quarter of 2019. Our press release was issued this morning and the conference call materials are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast.","I'm joined today by Mary Barra, GM's Chairman and CEO; Dhivya Suryadevara, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO, and a number of other Executives. Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language.","I will now turn the call over to Mary Barra.","Mary Barra","Thanks Rocky and good morning everybody. Thanks for joining the call. We achieved solid results in our second quarter and the strength of our performance in North America. Overall, we delivered net revenue of $36.1 billion, EBIT adjusted of $3 billion, EBIT adjusted margin of 8.4%, EPS diluted adjusted of $1.64, automotive adjusted free cash flow of $2.5 billion, and a ROIC adjusted of 22.7% on a trailing four-quarter basis.","Strong consumer demand for full-size trucks, crossovers, and SUVs, along with our business transformation actions drove the company's profitability. This helped offset the effects of planned heavy-duty downtime ahead of our launch and industry weakness in China.","We expect our launch strength to continue in the second half of the year as our heavy-duty truck availability improves and as we launch new crossovers and entries from our new global family of vehicles.","Looking at North America, our year-over-year results improved thanks in part to growing truck sales and share and second quarter records for average transaction prices and crossover deliveries. Later this quarter, we'll begin delivering the 2020 Silverado with an optional all-new Duramax turbodiesel engine that delivers best-in-class highway fuel economy of up to 33 miles per gallon.","GM's clear leadership in the large SUV segment continued with deliveries of current generation models up 16% year-over-year with lower incentives than those of our competitors. We also performed well in our crossover segments contributing to profitability.","We unveiled the highly anticipated mid-engine 2020 Corvette Stingray two weeks ago in California to a global audience of nearly 300,000. We plan to increase production of this iconic sports car and begin shipping the all-new models to dealers by the end of the year.","Looking at Cadillac, the brand sold more than 111,000 vehicles worldwide during the quarter. The XT5 continues to be the brand's best-selling model globally. The new XT6 seven-passenger crossover is now on sale in North America and in China, further strengthening Cadillac's position in the high-growth luxury SUV segment.","In the U.S., the XT6 is off to a strong start ahead of its official launch. Dealers and media have given us very good feedback. And the XT6 brings new interest to the brand.","Cadillac is also expanding the functionality and range of its Super Cruise hands-free driver assistance technology in the U.S. and Canada. We are adding 70,000 miles of compatible divided highway. By year-end CT6 owners will be able to operate Super Cruise on 200,000 miles of highway. More than 85% of current CT6 owners said that for future vehicle consideration, they would prefer or only consider a vehicle equipped with Super Cruise.","Dhivya will provide additional details on our business transformation actions shortly. But I would like to update you on the progress toward offering relocation opportunities to hourly employees at U.S. plants that have unallocated products.","There is a job for every impacted employee. To-date about 1,700 of the 2,800 employees have accepted transfers to plants supporting growth segments and we are working actively to place more employees into open positions.","As we look at our international operations, in China, the continued economic slowdown has resulted in a softer industry. GM China headwinds in the quarter include lower volumes, significant pricing pressure, regulatory changes, slower sales of our outgoing models, and shifting customer preferences. Even as we launch new vehicles in Q3 and Q4, we see many of these dynamics continuing. Therefore, we expect equity income in the second half of the year will be generally in line with the first half.","In South America, we continue to work with our stakeholders to turn around the business and capitalize on Chevrolet's 18 years of sales leadership in the region. In addition to the actions we're taking to strengthen our core business, we are also making important strides toward our vision of an all-electric self-driving future.","We recently revealed a new digital vehicle platform that will fully integrate our electric propulsion systems, cybersecurity protection, advanced Active Safety systems; and Super Cruise technology. This platform also enables more systems in the vehicle to receive over-the-air software updates including telematics, chassis controls, and more. This will deliver value and convenience to our customers. Following its debut on the Cadillac CT5 and the 2020 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray it will expand to most of our global lineup by 2023.","We are also working to drive greater customer acceptance of EVs by addressing their concerns about range and charging availability. In addition to earlier infrastructure announcements we've made we've partnered with Qmerit an online platform that links EV owners with GM-approved installers of home charging systems.","Turning to Cruise. In May Cruise secured an equity investment of $1.1 billion from a group of institutional investors including funds and accounts by T. Rowe Price and existing partners SoftBank and Honda and a $700 million investment from General Motors. These additional investments now value Cruise at $19 billion.","We have said from the beginning that the benefit of self-driving vehicles will only be realized by deploying safely and at massive scale. For the past four years, Cruise has been creating the necessary building blocks to do just that. It has expanded its workforce, raised billions in capital, achieved deep integration with General Motors and focused on testing and development in one of the most complex urban environments.","They have recently took steps toward large-scale deployment of an all-electric EVs in San Francisco where driving conditions are 40 times more challenging than in the suburban setting.","In the second half of this year, Cruise will significantly accelerate testing and safety validation of its fleet and increase the number of miles driven. Cruise will also increase its community engagement and continue to scale EV infrastructure build-out.","In addition, hundreds of talented Cruise General Motors and Honda engineers are developing a next-generation purpose-built AV that leverages our leadership and hardware and software integration and related safety validation. It has become clear that to successfully deploy at scale we need to not only win the tech race but we need to build trust with consumers. And that is exactly what we intend to do.","So to recap, we delivered a solid quarter as we begin to demonstrate the earnings power of our full-size truck business and our ongoing transformation. We are committed to our full year outlook that includes earnings per share of $6.50 to $7 and automotive free cash flow of $4.5 billion to $6 billion.","Dhivya will now give you more details and then we'll take your questions.","Dhivya Suryadevara","Thanks, Mary and good morning everybody. We generated Q2 results of $36.1 billion in net revenue, $3 billion EBIT adjusted, 8.4% margin, $1.64 in EPS diluted adjusted; and $2.5 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow. The $1.64 EPS diluted adjusted includes a $0.01 loss from our Lyft and PSA revaluations.","Let's go to North America. North America delivered EBIT adjusted of $3 billion in Q2 and 10.7% margin driven by our light-duty truck performance, crossover performance and the impact to our cost actions. This was partially offset by planned downtime for heavy-duty pickup trucks, lower pension income and increased depreciation.","The light-duty truck performance contributed favorably to volume mix and price during the quarter. As Mary mentioned we're in the early stages of demonstrating the earnings power of our leading truck franchise and see additional opportunity for upside as we complete the launch of the heavy-duty trucks and looking into next year the launch of the full-size SUVs.","The heavy-duty trucks will follow a similar cadence as the light-duty truck launch, focusing first on the crew cabs, followed by the double, and then the regular cab models.","Retail sales of the new Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra light-duty crew cabs were up double digits for the second straight quarter as we continue to shift additional models to dealers.","The retail market share of our light-duty pickup trucks improved nearly three percentage points from Q1 to 36.5%, the highest of the industry. We've done this with a very thoughtful launch strategy and a disciplined use of incentives with share growth concentrated in the over $50,000 average transaction price segment.","We have leading retail share in the crew cab segment. And as we continue the light-duty truck rollout in Q3 and Q4, we expect share in the high value and high volume of the market to increase. We also see opportunity for share improvement, as we tap into profitable fleet business and launch diesel models later this year.","Switching to crossovers, our crossovers performed well in the quarter with U.S. deliveries growing 17% year-over-year, a Q2 record. We're gaining market share in the crossover segment and are seeing positive contribution to year-over-year profitability.","We will keep expanding our crossover portfolio with the 2020 Encore GX and 2021 Trailblazer, which we revealed in May. Cost pressures from increased depreciation and lower pension income were more than offset by our transformational cost savings.","Let's move to GM International. For the second quarter, EBIT-adjusted in GMI was down $200 million year-over-year, driven by lower equity income in China, partially offset by the favorable impact from restructuring actions in Korea and continued business improvement actions in South America.","In China, Q2 equity income was down $400 million year-over-year from record Q2 2018 levels. Industry in China deteriorated further in Q2 and the market experienced significant pricing pressures including pricing disruption from the early transition from China V to China VI emission requirements in many provinces.","We reduced dealer inventory by 10% in Q2 with wholesale volume and production down approximately 25% year-over-year, which more than offset production and retail sales by approximately 12% year-over-year. These headwinds were partially offset by continued material and other cost performance.","In the second half of the year, we expect these ongoing headwinds to be partially offset by vehicle launches. As a result, we expect equity income in the second half of the year to be generally in line with first half of 2019.","In South America, we continue to make progress with the turnaround of our business despite the volatility in the region. We're starting to see cost savings, as a result of business improvement actions that we're undertaking together with other stakeholders. We have a strong franchise in South America with leading market share, strong dealer network and efficient manufacturing operations.","We expect to see improvement as we progress through the remainder of the year as the launch for our global family of vehicles ramp and we deliver a stronger more competitive portfolio of vehicles.","A few comments on GM Financial, Cruise and our Corp segment. GM Financial posted record quarterly revenue of $3.6 billion in the second quarter and EBT-adjusted of $500 million, primarily as a result of portfolio growth. Cruise costs were $300 million for the quarter, on track with the approximately $1 billion communicated previously for the full year as we increase our headcount.","Corp segment costs in the second quarter were $200 million -- unfavorable $200 million year-over-year due to approximately $170 million gain from our Lyft and PSA investments in the second quarter of last year and a loss of approximately $30 million in the second quarter of this year.","We continue to expect the underlying spend in the Corp segment to be about $1 billion in 2019. We have made significant progress on our transformational cost savings initiative achieving $1.1 billion in year-to-date savings, $700 million of which was in the second quarter.","Before I close, I want to reiterate our outlook for the calendar year. At the beginning of the year, we outlined a number of puts and takes in our outlook including headwinds from downtime, depreciation, pension, commodity and weakness in China.","On the tailwind side, we discussed the full year benefit of our truck launch $2 billion to $2.5 billion of transformational cost savings in 2019, growth in adjacencies and a meaningful benefit from crossovers and the rollout of our global family of vehicles.","Since January, we have experienced continued weakness in China and volatility in South America, which is offset by favorability to our previously communicated $1 billion headwind year-over-year from commodity and tariffs.","Therefore, we are reiterating our outlook with EPS-adjusted in the range of $6.50 to $7, and adjusted automotive free cash flow in the range of $4.5 billion to $6 billion. As I have mentioned before, this outlook assumes zero performance from our investments in Lyft or PSA. And any impact from these investments is not included in our guidance.","Regarding cadence in 2019, we expect the second half of the year to be meaningfully stronger from both an EBIT and free cash flow perspective due to a number of launches in the second half as well as cycling past the downtime in North America. In summary, we had solid performance in Q2. And this sets us up well for strong performance in the second half.","This concludes the opening comments, and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions] And your first question from the line of Rod Lache, Wolfe Research.","Rod Lache","Good morning, everybody.","Mary Barra","Good morning.","Rod Lache","Had a few questions about the guidance. Just first of all, the full year guidance for free cash flow is $4.5 billion to $6 billion. There was a first half burn of $1.4 billion. So that implies $5.9 billion to $7.4 billion in the back half. And if we're doing our math right that's excluding working capital maybe $3 billion to $4.5 billion, wanted to know if that sounds about right to you. And my associated question is can we extrapolate from that kind of a free cash flow run rate ex working capital, which would imply $6 billion to $9 billion annualized free cash flow at this point? Or is there is some kind of seasonality or something else that we should be taking into account if we do that math?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yes thanks Rod. And I think directionally, you're correct. As you think about the second half of the year from a free cash flow perspective these trends are going to be driven by EBIT improvement as well as the working capital rewind that we're going to experience as we have cycled past the downtime. And extrapolating, I don't want to provide guidance beyond 2019 but I'll give you the puts and takes. We are going to continue to see benefits from our truck launch. We're going to see the remaining cost savings flow through into 2020. And as you may recall, we also talked about our capital spend tailwind from that in 2020 as well partially offset by lower China equity income dividends flowing into 2020.","In fact, I'd caution you though extrapolating off of the second half there are some timing items like the working capital that you mentioned as well as first half versus second half some payments are lumped in the first half of the year and you can't really do it two times in the second half. But directionally looking at the puts and takes I'd say you're correct.","Rod Lache","Okay. Great. And \u2013 ","Dhivya Suryadevara","And also Rod you heard us say in the beginning of the year, we have an intense focus on cash flow and cash conversion. And as you \u2013 as we go beyond 2019 into 2020 you're going to continue to see us reiterate that as we go forward here.","Rod Lache","Yeah. It sounds like generally those payments are lumped into the first half, which \u2013 that's helpful to get some color on how to think about that. Is it reasonable to assume that CapEx comes towards the low-end of your guidance? And you did comment in your release about the timing of China dividends being a little bit unusual this year. What's included in the back half from China?","Dhivya Suryadevara","We would say the remaining dividends that we have not yet received from China will flow through so it's more evenly distribute this year between first and second half than it has been last year. And from a next year perspective timing and as you know in the first quarter of the year we tend to from a seasonal perspective pay out a number of payments as well as the AR and AP rewind typically happens at that time. So I'd say, those two are the primary adjustments that I would think about. And China dividend you can expect, again a similar kind of cadence in 2020 probably as you will in 2019.","Rod Lache","Okay.","Dhivya Suryadevara","And from a CapEx standpoint, yeah, from a CapEx standpoint I'd say we gave a range of $8 billion to $9 billion. We will continue to do that. Obviously there's timing between among quarters. And I wouldn't read too much into that at this point in the middle of the year.","Rod Lache","Okay. And just lastly your expectations for China, can you just broadly talk about what the inventory situation is for you? And you're talking about that half being flat with the first half. But the first half at least in the second quarter included a significant inventory correction. So what's the underlying business look like for you? And what are some of the puts and takes there?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yeah. Sure. So we did unwind 70,000 units or so of inventory so about 10% of our inventory did unwind in the second quarter. But as Mary mentioned in her comments as we think about the industry obviously, we've just cycled past the China V and China VI transition. There is likely to have been some pull-ahead and we've got to watch that. We just don't know yet. And from a pricing standpoint, again driven by this transition, we experienced more pricing pressures in Q2. That's something to keep an eye on. So, as we look into the second half of the year, a slightly weaker industry an uncertain price environment, but really offset by the launches that we have significant launches into the sweet-spot of the segments with two-thirds of our launches coming from crossovers. So all the positives from a launch perspective we continue to expect. We're keeping an eye on macro.","Rod Lache","Great. Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.","Ryan Brinkman","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the quarter. ","Dhivya Suryadevara","Thank you.","Mary Barra","Thank you. ","Ryan Brinkman","You know, clearly some moderation on your China profit outlook was expected given the softer volumes in the first half. Just curious though if you are now calling for a sequential deterioration in the industry in the back half versus the front half. Because previously you were looking forward for some company-specific catalysts for higher profits in the back half including a freshened lineup introduction of the GEM platform et cetera. I would think too maybe you could cycle past some of the inventory drawdown in Q2 ahead of China VI. So visibility in the market there is low I know. But if there were flat industry sales in 2H versus 1H do you think in that environment you could manage to a higher China profit in the back half?","Mary Barra","I think that that's one element. But with the intense pricing pressure as Dhivya said that we don't know with the intense pricing we saw to move the China V how is that going to carry through. And then from a GM specific these launches are very important because we are seeing the customer preference shifting as well as we have some older models in really popular segments. So I think its -- Ryan it's just too hard to say with all the volatility that we're facing right now.","I would tell you the team is very focused and we have a China team that is very good at looking at every single cost opportunity. We saw that performance in the first half. We'll continue to look for that and to increase that. And then also we're working very closely with our partner to seize opportunities as there are possibly ups or downs to the marketplace. But it's just -- it's too hard to predict.","Ryan Brinkman","Okay. Thanks. And then just lastly for me clearly the earnings power of the new full-size truck platform was on display in 2Q. But it wasn't on full display right? Because there was still lost production during the quarter in the changeover to the heavy-duty versions the SUVs haven't launched.","So to help us sort of better understand what magnitude of the earnings potential of this program was on display in the quarter can you kind of sketch-out what has launched, what has yet to launch SUVs higher-efficiency diesels the even bigger pickups with Navistar et cetera and the relative profit potential of those various pieces?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yes, Ryan I'd say, if you think about the first half we started out with crew cabs as we talked about. And towards the second quarter and really going into third quarter and fourth quarter is when you're going to see the rest of the light-duty start to normalize so the remaining variants whether it's regular or double. And diesel is an important factor that Mary pointed out.","We're excited about that and that's going to be coming up next in the Q3 time frame and followed by heavy-duty. If you think about the first half of the year we took downtime of about 25000 or so units in heavy-duty which to your point was an offset against the light-duty earnings power that we saw. So you're not going to see that in the second half of the year.","And in fact with the additional capacity that we have added for both light-duties and heavy-duties you're going to still start to see tailwinds from volume because we have been constrained on these as we have been in the past few quarters and years here. So plus side would be the remaining light-duty variants including diesel the heavy-duty going into next year obviously the SUVs and the absence of downtime as well as obviously the price and mix benefit that you'll start to see in HD and other variants that we have so far seen in crew cab.","Ryan Brinkman","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John Murphy","Good morning, everybody. Just really wanted to make sure I followed up and got that correctly Dhivya on the truck side. So basically in the first half you had the HD downtime and the SUV downtime. The HD pickups will benefit us some time in the third quarter, but mostly in the fourth quarter. And then the SUV bounces back in the intro is in the first or second quarter of next year. So I mean, it looks like with these truck swing it's something well north of $0.5 billion per quarter once this all gets worked out.","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yes. I'd say the cadence that you've roughly gotten is right. We have not talked about the SUV timing specifically. It will be early next year. But I think directionally you're correct in terms of the tailwinds that we will start to see in the second half of the year. First, you'll see that in light-duty remaining variants and then going into heavy-duty probably in the Q4 time frame and obviously into next year. And then the -- you'll see the SUVs. So I'd say your directionally correct.","John Murphy","Okay. And is there any reason that we should think that second quarter is not a good quarter to walk off of when we think about those improvements? I mean, it seems like this was just a very good operational quarter and then you'll get the benefit of those [indiscernible] going forward. I mean, is there anything unusual that we should think about that wouldn't make this a good base case to work off of?","Dhivya Suryadevara","No, I'd say its a pretty good base case. Obviously, you've got to adjust for the heavy-duty downtime that we took in the second quarter that is not -- you can't extrapolate that into the rest of the year. Cost savings as you know we achieved the $700 million. So that's also on a pretty -- on a kind of run rate that you can continue to expect for the rest of the year. We will probably see some tailwinds as well coming from the XT6 launch, which we're just starting to see. And probably second half of the year will be more of a tailwind than we have seen in crossovers because of that. So I'd say otherwise Q2 is a good baseline.","John Murphy","Okay, helpful. Second question when we think about GM Financial, I mean obviously it's performing very well. We keep kind of following up on this question. But when do you see sort of at a maturation point where it could start taking some capital back up to the parent company?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yes. I'd say that last year you may recall we took about $375 million of dividends from GMF. They're still growing their earning assets and we're close to about $100 billion of earning assets. When we think about steady-state for GMF, we're thinking somewhere in the $125 billion to $130 billion range for earning assets. It's going to take a couple of years for that to take hold. And the penetrations we were running at is in the 45% to 50% range which is something we would like to see continue. And capital we will -- as the leverage ratio continues to grind down with the equity building up and earning assets leveling off, we're going to see the dividend increase over a period of time. And eventually, you're going to see the entire net income from GMF come back to the parent.","John Murphy","Got it. Then just lastly, on suppliers, we've heard a lot of noise about some slight incremental pricing pressure coming into the supply base. I'm just curious as you look at your relationship with suppliers, is there any stress building in the supply base? Or sort of conversely is there any more opportunity to work more collaboratively with them and get more pricing out of the system?","Mary Barra","So we've worked over the last couple of years to build a really strong relationship with our suppliers and focusing on innovation. And then when we focus on price and costs, it's doing it together and looking how can we work together to take cost out that benefits both General Motors and the supplier. We're going to continue to do that and look for those opportunities and build on that. So I don't -- we don't -- I don't see any major change coming. I think you'll see us working even more closely together.","John Murphy","Mary, I apologize if I could sneak one more in. It sounds like you've got 1,700 of the 2,800 UAW folks relocated. I'm just curious when you think outside of the headcount of the UAW, if you could just talk about your hiring in the U.S. maybe more broadly and the growth in the employment base, so I can understand sort of your position in the employment picture for the U.S.?","Mary Barra","Are you talking about from a represented workforce or from a salaried workforce?","John Murphy","More from a total workforce, because it sounds like you've done -- you're about almost two-thirds of the way of reworking -- or should I say relocating these workers. I'm just curious\u2026","Mary Barra","So on this...","John Murphy","Particularly thinking about growth.","Mary Barra","I didn't hear your last comment. I'm sorry.","John Murphy","I'm sorry. Particularly thinking about the growth in Cruise as well, right. I mean, because you have real headcount growth in certain areas.","Mary Barra","So I think you have to look at it in three buckets. As we said, we have jobs for every single hourly employee in the United States that was impacted by the transformation. And we'll continue to do those placements and then look at what is natural retirement. And I predict by the time we get through this we'll be hiring for the needs that we have across the United States. So that's from a represented perspective. On the salary workforce, in general, we very carefully planned the transformation activities, not only reducing our overall salaried headcount, but also making sure we had resources in there with the right skill set.","That went very well. And we are hiring now to replace attrition, but maintaining the lower cost level that we've worked so hard to get at Q4 and Q1 of this year. And then as it specifically relates to Cruise, we have about 1,500 employees there now and we are working hard to hire and get to that level of that 2,000 by year-end. And the hiring is going very well there.","John Murphy","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.","Joseph Spak","Thanks good morning. Just wanted to get back into the pickup truck market dynamics, I know there's a lot of noise out there. But as you just laid out -- you still have a lot more product to go. You've added some capacity. I know you're not giving 2020 guidance.","But at a high level is there any reason to believe that if the market holds up that the volume on the pickups should be materially different than what you expect this year? Like is there anything internally at GM like maybe a quick refresh of a product or something that would reinvigorate some downtime?","Dhivya Suryadevara","No. We're not anticipating any specific downtime related to a changeover or anything Joe. So I'd say probably you can extrapolate normal run rates excluding downtime and plus the capacity we've added. We've been in like a ramp-up-type mode. And obviously you'll get to a full line rate as you cycle past the downtime.","So in a similar macro environment and we think that again the truck market with its percentage penetration of the industry continues to be healthy and we would expect -- I think you're directionally right for the volume.","Joseph Spak","Okay. And then secondly on GMI and China, I know it's still challenged and you sort of mentioned this that there's some I guess encouragement underneath. It looks like it was $200 million better year-over-year. And I'm assuming FX was still probably a headwind within that. So how do you -- how do we think about the opportunity in really Brazil and South Korea as we go forward?","Mary Barra","So if you just kind of cycle through from a Korea perspective, we accomplished what we've set out in the restructuring and now we continue to see that business unit perform. We still have a few markets in GMI that we're evaluating to look at how do we create a successful foundation to build on in a few of the GMI markets.","And then in South America we have a very strong franchise there. It definitely is being impacted by FX and the macro situation. We continue to work with all of our stakeholders though to take cost out. And that team has demonstrated a great ability to do that.","And we can define our plan for that region to take into account we think there's going to just be a continued volatility. I think important to note in many of these regions though is we are just in the process of doing the first global family of vehicles that will be rolling out not only in China, but also South America and then flow to some of these other markets.","So I think we're going to have a very strong portfolio and vehicles in the market to take advantage as South America recovers or to continue to outperform, even if we keep in these market. So there's great focus on all of these markets. We are seeing improvement year-over-year and we'll continue until we get this region to be contributing and covering as best as we can.","Joseph Spak","Just a follow-up. Would you classify the potential improvement in South America more driven by the fixed cost reduction from working with the stakeholders or the launch of the GEM platforms which as you've indicated in the past should be more profitable than the outgoing?","Mary Barra","I think it's both. All of them are significant in helping us achieve where we need to go in South America.","Joseph Spak","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi.","Itay Michaeli","Great. Thank you, good morning and congrats. Just going back to the pickup discussion. Just curious how the Silverado mid-trims, like the LT trims are performing kind of versus your expectations in the market. Because we are seeing some signs that the inventory there has been rising on those particular trims. I know after a while, it is coming off later in the year. But just curious, how you're performing thus far in the middle trims of the LTs?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yes. I'd say Itay, as you know we started out the launch focusing on the crew cabs. And we've been building inventory in the mid-levels really now in the second quarter of the year.","And the -- it's also important to note, we're normalizing our propulsion mix there as well. And during launch -- obviously it's hard to extrapolate out of one data point on what the inventory picture needs to be because we are still rolling all of these out and there will be balancing that happens in the rest of the year as well.","And as we -- as I said once we're rolling out these other variants you will see the inventory picture starting to normalize. And we have a plan looking at the end of the year to get our inventory to exactly where we want our target levels to be.","Itay Michaeli","Got it. I think, that's very helpful. And then switching back to China and I apologize if I missed this, but can you share any year-end inventory targets that you have, as well as just how this year's events might be influencing your longer-term view of profitability in China?","Mary Barra","So when we look at the inventory, we are working to be disciplined with the inventory levels, but also be prepared for the opportunities with that volatility. So at the most senior level discussions with our partner, we're watching it very closely and giving direction to the team. So we're going to manage it to get to the right level as we go forward. I'm not going to share a specific target.","When you look at it over a longer term, we have a very strong franchise in China. We have three strong global brands with Cadillac, Buick and Chevrolet as well as the two domestic brands with Wuling and Baojun. And we think it's a very strong franchise. We think over the long term, there are significant opportunities for growth.","And also, China is a very important part of our electrification strategy, of seizing the opportunity in such a large market to get the scale from an EV perspective that allows us to be better positioned, I believe, in other markets like North America as we launch EV. So over the longer term, we still see a very strong opportunity, especially with our global brands.","Itay Michaeli","That's helpful. I just had a quick one, the last question, Mary. Just given the feedback you cited earlier on the Super Cruise system, any change in plans on number of vehicles? Or how quickly you might roll out the Super Cruise system? Or how you might go to market with the next-generation Ultra Cruise system?","Mary Barra","So, I would just appreciate the question. And we're really excited about Super Cruise. In my career, rarely do you see a feature in technology that has such a strong support from the customers saying, I would strongly prefer this technology to be on my next car or I won't buy a car without it. So that I think is a really good endorsement of the way the technology works and the benefit and value it provides to the customer.","So we are in the process of rolling it out across all Cadillacs and then we'll look for the right opportunities as we roll it out across more segments and brands in our portfolio. And we'll do that as quickly as we can, but making sure that we're focused on the safety and quality of it as we do that.","And then, as you mentioned with Ultra Cruise, this is a technology you saw us continue to improve it with the number of places you can use it. We're going to continue to add capability. And we're very excited about it and the road map that we have. So we'll be rolling it out as quickly as we can, with again having a strong focus on safety.","Itay Michaeli","That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. ","Brian Johnson","Yes. Good morning. Want to talk a little bit about the GMNA earnings walk on the supplement slide. Can you kind of break that $700 million of performance timing? Timing would seem to imply that some of those reverse. So maybe what was that? And then, as we think about how would commodities peak in performance or would that be the material headwind, maybe less of a headwind? And then how do we kind of take the $4.5 billion-or-so restructuring cost saves and kind of look for it in this performance\/timing line model?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yes, sure. So, if you're starting with the $4.5 billion I'll do the total company walk for you Brian, because there's North America versus total company. The $4.5 billion pertain to the total company. In the total company walk, as you can see in the cost bucket, we had performance and timing of $1 billion -- $900 million positive, close to $1 billion.","Out of that -- so the $700 million that I referenced from the transformation cost savings is in the $900 million. There's about $100 million-ish of timing and another $100 million of commercial and technical savings that are coming from our regular material cost initiative. So think of timing as about $100 million.","And as you go into the second half of the year, this is the bucket, the cost bucket is where you will see the performance show up. Obviously, it will be offset by the pension and depreciation and amortization headwinds that we have talked about. But that's the geography of it. And from a material cost standpoint, it will be in the materials line item within the cost bucket as well.","Brian Johnson","Okay. And second question, as we go into second half North America and the lower trim levels of the light-duty truck getting rolled out, how should we be thinking about the mix\/price walks in the second half?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yeah. I'd say overall second half volume will be up versus first half because of the factors that I mentioned on heavy-duty being up, SUV being up and light-duties as well slightly up. So volume will be up. And therefore mix will be -- there's an offsetting factor to your point of the other mix is rolling out. But the heavy-duty negative mix element that you saw in the first half of the year will not repeat it will actually be a positive that will offset some of that.","And obviously, the SUV aspect as well you saw it down in the first half and you're not going to see that. So vol mixed together will be where the bulk of the improvement from H1 versus H2 is going to be.","Brian Johnson","Okay. And just final question, can you put into context the Cruise announcement, which you build as positive in terms of testing and increasing the fleet size? But much of the tech press kind of said -- indicated that robotaxis, whether it's huge Waymo some of the start-ups are still a number of years out. So maybe kind of update us on \u2013 yes, we know that safety is a gating factor, but just how you're thinking about timing?","Mary Barra","Well, I think anytime you're working on something that's never been done before a brand-new technology, a timeline is likely to move around a little bit. But we do -- we have line of sight in what we need to accomplish both from the technology development. We have a very robust milestones that we have to achieve. And we also believe there -- and we're working hard to make sure we have the right regulatory environment as well.","So I'm not going to put a specific time out there. I just would say we have line of sight. And I think the significant work that we're doing to get deeper validation more miles that we'll achieve in the second half of this year, while working on improving public receptivity are going to be very important to allow us to have a large-scale deployment. So that would be the comments I make regarding Cruise.","So I'm very pleased with the progress the team is making continues to make their pushing very hard. And this focus on not only the technology, but the environment and the customer I think is very appropriate.","Brian Johnson","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS.","Colin Langan","Okay. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a good quarter. Can we just go back to pickup? You've lost a lot of, I mean, I know you've highlighted you gained retail share, but you have lost share overall in the segment year-to-date. What is the outlook for the second half? I mean, is guidance predicated on holding your share from where it is now and the benefit of just sort of plants being fully up and running? Or do you expect to regain share in the second?","Dhivya Suryadevara","We do see a growth in share in the lower end of the ATP segment Colin. I'd say that if you look at the increased share that we have had it's been in the $45,000 to $50,000 and $50,000 plus-type segments obviously the more profitable segments. And we expect to hold that, because we were underrepresented in these segments with our K2 product. And what we're really doing is like fixing that under-representation if you will as we go into T1.","So you expect normalization in the lower ATP segments. And obviously, as heavy-duty rolls out that will be the other positive as well and diesels coming in. So we do expect to increase share in the second half of the year between all the other cab variants as well as HD.","Colin Langan","And how about on the commercial side? Because on pickup, I mean, I know retail is obviously always more profitable. But in pickups I imagine the business is still quite lucrative. I mean, do you have plans to try to recapture some of that share? Or is it just not worth the chase?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yeah. No, we do believe that we will grow in that segment as well. And as you point out fleet in pickup trucks continues to be profitable not as much as retail, but profitable. And we will absolutely continue to grow in that market as well. And with all the capacity issues, we've had and with the launch changeover and so on and so forth that is something that has been again underrepresented in the first half of the year. And that's something we will correct in the second half.","Colin Langan","And lastly, any color -- I think you mentioned in your comment that the original guidance had about $1 billion of FX and commodity. Obviously, within this quarter steel price is another key commodity that's really fallen pretty dramatically in Q2. Does that actually result in a tailwind through the rest of the year? Is that one of the factors helping to offset the weakness in China?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yeah, that's correct. So we -- you may remember, Colin, January of this year, we said $1 billion headwind in commodities. We did not talk about FX in that context, commodities and tariffs year-over-year. As we sit here today to your point, we have seen a moderation in steel and aluminum prices specifically. There's a couple of commodities that are still elevated. But on balance we think that the headwind is probably closer to half of what we originally expected and that's serving to offset some of the international volatility that we're seeing and that's how -- that's to your point how the guidance comes about.","Colin Langan","Got it. All right. Thank you very much.","Dhivya Suryadevara","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs.","David Tamberrino","Yeah. Great. Maybe can we just get into very specifically your carryover pricing was I think more positive than most folks would have thought in the quarter, and I didn't know if there are any specific products that you could call out both in North America as well as in GMI, because I think there was $100 million favorable in both, whereas historically that's typically a headwind year-over-year. So I wanted to understand that dynamic on carryover.","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yeah. Good question David. In the international side a lot of that is catch-up FX pricing that you see in Brazil and in Argentina. As you know, we try to price out in Argentina all of our FX headwinds and Brazil in line with the inflation there. So that's the international fees. In the United States, as you see, our carryover, a lot of it was driven by positivity in our car segment. And as you know, we have significantly ramped down our overall car portfolio. It used to be a headwind from a carryover pricing perspective in 2018, and as we have lowering of inventory there we're able to maintain a price discipline there as well. That's I'd say the primary factor. Cadillac is continuing to do really well. So the residual value improvements that we're seeing in Cadillac are flowing through to the crossovers that we currently have on the road as well. Those are the two big factors I'd point out.","David Tamberrino","Okay. I mean on the GMI side, it sounds like that could continue into the back half. But for North America, is that something that should continue even though you've got the wind-down of passenger cars? I mean looking at 3Q of 2018 you had a very strong pricing quarter. So just trying to understand the dynamics there.","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yeah. I'd say, we'd probably continue to see the car discipline as the inventory there winds down over time. Crossover should be pretty strong as well. There's obviously a bifurcation between small and compact crossover versus the mid-size crossover. So, on the mid-size we will see a continued positive but pressures from the compact and smaller side. So, I'd say on balance probably to your point it's a harder comp versus last year. So maybe a little bit more of a headwind from a carryover perspective, but the car and crossover specific segment should continue to hold up.","David Tamberrino","Okay. And then Mary, you had a couple of questions earlier on Cruise. I want to dive a little bit more into that. It's gated by safety and regulation. What impediments are you running into from a technical and regulatory perspective; one, that kind of helped drive this -- I won't call it a pushout but a little bit delayed timing from the 2019 commercial deployment? And then secondly, what's the plan to improve the public receptivity for a large-scale deployment? Is it something like what Waymo's done in Phoenix so far, with a technician still in the vehicle behind it and getting folks used to the technology? Or should I be investing in something else?","Mary Barra","Well, I think, when we talk about deploying our deployment will be when we can have the vehicle operate safely without a safety trainer in the vehicle. So that's point one. I just think to build, kind of, the trust that we're looking for -- a lot of it is communication. And so, we have a very well thought out marketing plan that will be targeted to the first city that we plan to deploy in which is San Francisco, so very focused. For people who see the vehicles on the road today to understand them better to be able to articulate the safety in the vehicle, what we're doing to create this safe environment and that we can really improve road safety and because of the discipline that is -- on AV doesn't drive, follows all the road laws and doesn't also drive under the influence of anything. And so you're going to see us have a marketing campaign to engage the city, so they understand what's happening and they're more I think receptive to what's coming. And then from a technical perspective, I would say just again, as you are developing new technology and you have milestones that you need to meet to ensure that the AV is going to be safer than a human driver you have to keep making those. But clearly, some of the enablers will be as we continue on our hiring getting the best engineers working for Cruise on this. And I think, what also has happened is everybody understands just how complex this is to do well and to truly have the vehicle that can operate safely. So we're on that journey. The rate of iteration continues to be very strong. And we'll do the testing and the validation to achieve our milestones, while in parallel be working on continuing to gain regulatory approval.","And I wouldn't say there's impediments there, it's just work that still needs to be done. I think NHTSA understands the importance of this technology from a safety perspective. And so I think there's a line of sight to be able to get the regulatory approval and then building that trust with the consumer is going to be important. Those are the three paths that we're on together or in parallel. And we're going to continue to work all three aggressively.","David Tamberrino","Understood. And just as a follow-up on the technical side. Is everything underneath your control? Or are you relying upon any step change in technology from a supplier at this point noted [indiscernible]?","Mary Barra","Everything is under our control.","David Tamberrino","Okay. Thank you, Mary. Thank you, Dhivya.","Dhivya Suryadevara","Thank you, David.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Dave \u2013 I am sorry, Dan Levy with Credit Suisse.","Dan Levy","Hi. Good morning. And thank you for taking the questions. I want to start with just a couple of quick financial questions and then a strategic question. Just first on the raw mat side I know you talked to some of those pressures being mitigated. If I go back to call it last year you had I believe in North America something like $1.4 billion in commodity headwinds. And now here we are with steel back at where it was in 2017. Now I know that your raw mat headwinds there's other stuff in there whether its aluminum or precious metals et cetera. And that stuff has changed differently. But why wouldn't most of that headwind that $1.4 billion headwind from 2018 reverse given where steel prices is over time? I know, there's timing around the contracts.","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yeah. I think we are starting to see the tailwinds in a lot of the commodities that you're talking about Dan. I'd say steel we're starting to see pretty significant tailwinds and aluminum as well. There's a few other commodities that I referenced earlier particularly palladium, which is at a level that remains significantly elevated versus even what we saw in January. And against, a relatively smaller purchase value, it's quite a significant headwind. And over time you will see things flow through.","And obviously, there's still uncertainty around tariffs as well. And we therefore, felt it's prudent to get it to a \u2013 to a closer to half type of a number. We had $1 billion earlier and we're getting it now down to $500 million. We will keep watching it and flowing that through as we see the improvements come through. And we also have the lag effect that, we experience since these don't get indexed right away. They get indexed a little later. So you'll see the improvement come through if the market continues to hold up.","Dan Levy","On that lagged effect what's the typical timing? Let's say like steel sort of stays flat where it is right now, how long would it take to fully sort of offset those headwinds? Is it like 18 months?","Dhivya Suryadevara","There's \u2013 we have indexed contracts for a portion of it and we have negotiated contracts for the rest of it. And that's over \u2013 the timing is all over the place. So from an indexed perspective you would see a lag of about three months and having that come through. From a negotiated perspective our contracts roll out a-third, a-third, a-third type on a yearly basis, so some of this might be a bit more nuanced in negotiated. So, not one metric that you can apply across the board.","Dan Levy","Got it. Thank you. And then just as far as the UAW negotiations go, I apologize if I missed it earlier, but have you signaled in sort of what a good placeholder bonus amount to assume in the fourth quarter? Because I know Ford has signaled some kind of amount something that you noted.","Mary Barra","No, we haven't. I mean, we are approaching negotiations looking forward to having productive discussions. There are numerous topics that affect our employees and our business that we need to discuss and talk about which we'll do. And we're looking to do that constructively making sure we can address business challenges in a way that allows us to really build a stronger future for our employees, for our customers and for the company, which will benefit our shareholders. So, that's our approach to UAW negotiations. And we have not signaled any specific financial aspect to that.","Dan Levy","Got it. And then just want to ask a strategic question. When you look around in the EV landscape and you've obviously seen some collaboration amongst automakers trying to thread the investments you've taken a slightly different approach. So, far it's been a bit more go-it-alone approach.","So, I guess my question is -- and you don't have the same considerations in that you don't have to deal with this Europe. And obviously you're not doing -- being forced into this as much. But would you ever consider allowing other automakers to use your best platform sort of what VW is doing with NEV? I mean would that help with scale? Would that help with profitability?","Mary Barra","Well, Dan I would say is what we are doing is we have an arrangement with Honda. So, we have already -- Honda has already partnered with us on the cell technology and some of the electric vehicle components. So, I think we were actually one of the first -- I think if not the first to do that. And as we move forward if it make -- we are open to working with other OEs and leveraging it even further. But we're already doing that with Honda. And it definitely provides savings from an engineering perspective and has scale benefits as well.","Dan Levy","And scale as a crucial part to reaching breakeven I assume on EVs?","Mary Barra","Scale is I'd say one of many. But scale does -- especially as you get to a certain level to drive the right scale as you look at the cell and battery manufacturer for sure.","Dan Levy","Got it. Thank you very much.","Mary Barra","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank.","Emmanuel Rosner","Good morning everybody.","Mary Barra","Good morning.","Dhivya Suryadevara","Good morning.","Emmanuel Rosner","So, first question around the reiterated guidance. It's obviously a lot of moving pieces. And this industry is quite volatile. But it's also fairly wide range despite pretty decent line of sight that you seem to have on some of the GMNA dynamics in the second half.","Can you maybe just remind us what the variance factors are between sort of like the high end and the low end as it relates to earnings and even more so as it relates to free cash flow?","Mary Barra","I would say I think through the call we've highlighted the fact that there's definitely some tailwinds, there's also some headwinds. And I think what at General Motors we try to do is we stated the guidance at the beginning of the year. Dhivya and I both remained very confident that we're going to be able to meet our commitment.","And so we're confident in our full year guidance. But there are -- it's a very dynamic environment when you look at trade and you look at China and you look at macro conditions in some of our GMI markets, then you look at the positives we have with the full-size truck franchise and how we're moving that forward just really early days in the launch also the strength of our crossovers and the growth that we have in Cadillac.","So, there's definitely tailwinds, there's definitely headwinds. And what we're saying is we are committed and we have definitely a line of sight. And we'll work through the variability that we see or the volatility in the second half of this year to be able to deliver and maintain our guidance.","Emmanuel Rosner","Okay, that's helpful. Then I guess turning to your restructuring program. It's nice to see that you're on track for the $2 billion to $2.5 billion benefit this year. There's obviously a whole other chunk of $2 billion to $2.5 billion expected to come next year. Can you maybe point us to specific incremental actions that would deliver these additional savings as we get into next year as a way to get a number on that?","Mary Barra","Well, I think when we laid it out I mean some of them are just timing of when the cost comes out, but we have very detailed plans. We're -- the fact that when we announced it we said, this is how much we'll be in 2019 and the balance in 2020. And we're on track to achieve that. It's just we're systematically executing these plans.","One of the very first accomplished was the salaried headcount rightsizing that we did in Q4 and Q1 of this year. But every single element it was a third, a third, a third between engineering, between manufacturing, and between SG&A. So, those are all on track. And I think -- I guess that you look at what we've been able to deliver so far and that should give you confidence that we're on track to do that for 2020 as well.","Emmanuel Rosner","Okay. And then just finally a big driver of your China outlook seems to be product launches especially in the profitable attractive segment. Can you maybe just remind us specific examples of what's coming out and to the extent that it will be helpful for the 2020 outlook as well?","Mary Barra","Well we definitely have our GEM products that are coming out that are going to be very important. We have some crossover vehicles also Cadillac. The XT6 we think is going to be very significant. We also have some Baojun products in an important crossover-type segment so -- and then also the CT5 that will be launched there. So if you look at it there is a many SUVs crossovers luxury vehicles coming out across all of our brands in Q3 and Q4 that I think will position us well. Because what we have seen why these launches are so important as I mentioned because we are seeing customer preferences shift to more SUV crossover and we also are -- because of the competitive nature having an all-new model will be very significant in the marketplace.","Emmanuel Rosner","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Chris McNally with Evercore.","Chris McNally","Thanks guys. I'm probably going to revisit a little bit of some of the questions already asked. But maybe just try it at a different angle. When we look at the second half, I think everyone's thinking that's a relatively clean view of you don't have the downtime raw mats are probably more rightsized. When we think next year in terms of just the walk you obviously have cost cuts, but just any headwinds that you can call out? You talked about production and the mix. But does some of the UAW cost did they flow through from Q4 to next year? Any inflationary pressures? So like is D&A going to be a significant headwind again next year? And then any launch costs whether that's content or incentives you could call out? Just things that sort of bring the walk down for 2020 even qualitatively would be very helpful.","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yes. Obviously, as Mary mentioned, it's hard to predict what the environment in 2020 is going to look like sitting here in the middle of 2019. I think you've captured the product-related tailwinds really well. D&A and pension income are something -- the two items that we have always said are going to be secularly normalizing to a higher level for D&A and a lower level for pension. So, that's one item that we have actually attributed.","If you remember our cash conversion, one of the factors on how it's going to normalize is the fact that these items will continue to get to their more financial steady-state levels. But other than that, it would be speculation if I were to be thinking of any other items. I think we'll continue executing. And the cost savings that Mary mentioned as well is going to be an enabler as we look into 2020.","Chris McNally","That's great. And then maybe I can just hop to a little bit more of a secular question. It's probably not as sexy as autonomous. But when we think about ADAS particularly in North America not Europe, it's not mandated. And if we look at sort of the Detroit Three you've been sort of slow on the rollout of what's a pretty attractive technology. It's not that it's not available, but it's essentially -- customers are still paying for it versus being standard. Could you just maybe talk about the rollout of some of the low ends not Super Cruise? But I'm just basically thinking AV\/EV. Is there a chance that that becomes a standard offering product similar to the way Toyota and some of the Japanese have rolled it out?","Mary Barra","So we're committed to have ADAS across the entire portfolio. And it's a segment-by-segment question that we look at to see what makes sense because we also want to -- if you have so much safety technology on a vehicle that the customer can't afford it then they don't get the opportunity to achieve that. So we're trying to be very customer-focused segment-by-segment. We clearly have the technology and pretty comprehensive technology, safety technology when you walk around the vehicle. We are -- have done some I think really good work to make sure if it's not standard, it's available in a first package as opposed to a last package being receptive to what -- and really giving the customer choice. So we're going to continue to do that develop the technology, have it available across the portfolio in some cases it will be standard. And then we're going to continue to really work and gain -- I know you said not necessarily Super Cruise, but I think the game-changing nature of Super Cruise also I think is very important that we're committed to and growing the feature and functionality of it.","Chris McNally","Okay. Thank you. Much appreciated.","Operator","Thank you. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing remarks.","Mary Barra","Well, we appreciate that everybody participated in the call this morning. And as I said just a few minutes ago, as we continue in the second half of the year, I remain confident in our full year guidance. It's based on where we're at in the truck launch and the opportunities that lie ahead especially with heavy-duty models yet this year and then the strength of our crossovers as well.","We're also on track as I mentioned to deliver the cost savings associated with the business transformation. And with a good chunk of it already behind us then we continue to have -- execute well-defined plans.","And as we step back we recognize that there are challenges. But as we look at it, the reward for overcoming these challenges and being very disciplined is that we get the privilege of working on the future of transportation of being able to lead the industry as we look at EV and AV and giving customers more accessibility and more choice.","So we are committed and fully working to win the race and make sure that we do create a stronger future for General Motors that will benefit our employees, our customers, and our shareholders. And that's the dedication of the entire GM team.","So thank you all very much for participating. We hope you have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the conference call for today. Thank you for joining."],"9972":["General Motors Co.

Welcome to the General Motors Company Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. During the opening remarks, all participants will be in listen-only mode. After the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Thursday, July 21, 2016.","I'd now like to turn the conference over to Randy Arickx, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Randy Arickx - General Motors Co.","Thanks, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us as we review GM's financial results for the second quarter of 2016. Our press release was issued this morning and the conference call materials are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. Included in the chart set materials published this morning, we have included the key takeaways from each chart in the notes pages in order to provide color on the results.","This morning, Mary Barra, General Motors Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will provide some brief opening remarks; followed by Chuck Stevens, GM's Executive VP and CFO. And then we'll open the line for questions from the analyst community.","Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the legend regarding forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language. In the room today, we also have Tom Timko, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; and Dhivya Suryadevara, Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Investment Officer, to assist in answering your questions.","Now, I will turn the call over to Mary Barra.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Thanks, Randy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining. I am extremely pleased to report that GM delivered strong earnings in the quarter that included record EBIT-adjusted and EBIT-adjusted margins in North America, record sales and strong margins in China, profitability in Europe, and records for net revenue, EBIT-adjusted, EBIT-adjusted margins, earnings per share diluted-adjusted and return on invested capital.","Let's take a look at the numbers. Net income increased over 150% to $2.9 billion as revenue rose 11% to $42.4 billion. EBIT-adjusted was up 37% to $3.9 billion. EBIT-adjusted margin was 9.3%, up from 7.5%. Earnings per share diluted-adjusted was $1.86, up from $1.29. Automotive adjusted free cash flow was $3.2 billion, and we had a record ROIC of 30.5% on a trailing four-quarter basis, and this continues to demonstrate the positive impact of our disciplined capital allocation framework.","Given our very strong first half performance and our current outlook for the second part of the year, we now expect 2016 full year EBIT-adjusted to be in the range of $5.50 to $6.00 per diluted adjusted share, up from the $5.25 to $5.75 range we announced in January.","As I mentioned, our strong quarter was underpinned by outstanding performances in North America, China and Europe, so let me just touch on those briefly. In North America we gained 0.4 percentage points of retail share in the U.S. in the first half of the year. This is the highest of any full line manufacturer and I think it really indicates that our focus on more profitable sales is working. We had the best Q2 light truck retail sales in nine years and the best mid-size retail pickup sales in 11 years.","Average transaction prices on full-size pickups are up $2,700 per unit to date versus the Q2 2015 performance, and our ATPs across all models and brands are up about $1,500 per unit. Expected continued momentum in H2 will be driven by the launches of the Cruze, the Bolt EV, the LaCrosse and the Acadia. And we will also have improved availability of pickups and crossovers.","As we look at China, we are on track to sustain our strong margins this year. Our H1 sales are up 5.3% year-over-year to a record 1.8 million units, and this is really due to a really great mix of MPVs and SUVs, and also luxury vehicles that customers are signaling that they really like. Brands continue to grow. Buick and Baojun set quarterly records, with Buick up 40% and Baojun up 78% year-over-year. And our Cadillac sales are up 16% year-to-date. The GM SUV deliveries almost doubled in the quarter, and this continues to be led by two really strong products: the Baojun 560 and the Buick Envision.","In Europe, the team posted its first profitable quarter since the second quarter of 2011. It was a great team effort across every single aspect of the business. Opel and Vauxhall outperformed the industry with a 7% year-over-year sales increase to 621,000 vehicles in the first half of this year. And we have more products coming in the second half with the new Zafira and the refreshed Mokka X.","In addition to the top line growth we've reviewed so far, we are also on track to exceed our target $5.5 billion in cost efficiencies by 2018 when we look at it compared to the 2014 baseline. This will more than offset incremental investments in brand building, engineering, and the technology investments we're making as we launch new products in 2016 and beyond. In fact, this year alone, we expect approximately $2 billion in cost performance from non-raw materials and logistics. So again, I think you can look at it and see extremely strong performance across the entire business.","We are also \u2013 as we do strong performance and continue to work to improve the core operations, we are moving very quickly to leverage our technical expertise and to lead and define the future of personal mobility with a customer focus. On the autonomous front, we completed our acquisition of Cruise Automation, and we began testing self-driving Chevrolet Bolt EVs on public roads with safety drivers. And this started in the San Francisco Bay Area. Cruise provides the unique software capabilities, and when you take that software technology combined with our own expertise, it is really accelerating our work in fully autonomous driving.","We've also rapidly grown our shared mobility services. Maven city and residential car sharing has grown to now to five markets, including New York, Ann Arbor, Chicago, Boston and Washington, D.C., and GM and Lyft Express Drive on-demand car sharing has expanded from Chicago to Boston, Washington, D.C. and Baltimore. And Express Drive members have driven more than 2 million miles on the platform in just four months. And they are getting to experience the quality, safety and technology that our products and our brands have to offer. Later this year we'll install Express Drive fleets in Denver, Los Angeles and San Francisco.","Our demonstrated commitment to innovation and our autonomous work are really changing perceptions about General Motors and helping us, and specifically our Cruise Automation operations, recruit the kind of talented men and women from the tech sector that we need to really increase and drive our innovation and performance.","So in summary, we had an outstanding quarter, and I am extremely proud of the team. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Chuck.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Thanks, Mary. I just want to take a few minutes to provide some perspective on the quarter and the first half. In addition to the outstanding second quarter that we just posted, we also had a very strong first half for the company. EBIT-adjusted results for the first half grew to $6.6 billion, up $1.6 billion on a year-over-year basis. Our EBIT-adjusted margin was 8.3% in the first half, up 160 basis points year-over-year. The positive results were broad based, with all but one of our automotive regions posting year-over-year profit improvement during the first half of the year.","To demonstrate the strength of our business over time, we have now delivered EBIT-adjusted of $12.5 billion and nearly 8% margins over the last four quarters. Our strong first half results were led by record results in North America, sustained strong performance in China, and a return to profitability in Europe. In North America, EBIT-adjusted grew to $5.9 billion for the first half, up $1 billion year-over-year. North American EBIT-adjusted margins continue to be strong at 10.5%, up 80 basis points year-over-year, and in line with our target of sustaining strong margins of 10% plus for the 2016 calendar year.","As an additional proof point that demonstrates the sustainability and strength of our business, North America has achieved 10% plus EBIT-adjusted margins for four of the last five quarters, and over the last four quarters has delivered $12 billion in EBIT-adjusted with 10.7% margins. And fundamentally supporting our business is the U.S. light vehicle industry that is tracking in the low-to-mid 17 million SAAR range year-to-date, up 1.2% compared to the same period last year.","We continue to believe the industry will remain strong. As for the rest of the world, China continues to deliver solid results, with equity income of $1 billion for the first half, about equal to a year ago, and net income margins were 9.6%. However, as you all know, macroeconomic conditions in South America and many parts of our international operations continue to be challenging. The team continues to work to offset these pressures, and we will continue to take the necessary steps to set up these regions for future success. A proof point is South America. In the first half of 2016, we narrowed losses by $170 million, despite a much more challenging economic environment fundamentally in Brazil.","Moving on to Europe. The region achieved its second straight quarter of break-even or better results. In fact, not only was the second quarter profitable, but the region recorded EBIT adjusted of $131 million for the first half, up over $400 million on a year-over-year basis. Of course, one of the largest uncertainties we have in Europe is the impact of the referendum in the UK.","And let me provide some commentary on Brexit. Clearly, things are still fluid, and there are a lot of unknowns. It is important that negotiations on the UK's future relationship with the EU are concluded in a timely manner, and all businesses will certainly benefit from free movement of goods and people, and continued free movement of goods and people.","Certainly we've made substantial progress towards our target to break even by taking advantage of a recovering industry, cost optimization, and recent launches like the Astra and Corsa. Prior to the result of the referendum, we were on track to break even for the year, as evidenced by our positive first-half performance. The result of the vote has adversely impacted the British pound, and the uncertainty has put a strain on the UK automotive industry. If current post-referendum market conditions are sustained throughout the remainder of 2016, we believe it could have an impact of up to $400 million to the second half of 2016. However, it's important to note that the team remains focused on making progress on our turn-around plan in Europe.","Shifting to the balance sheet and cash flow. Adjusted automotive free cash flow was $3.2 billion for the second quarter and $1.7 billion for the first half, both about equal to a year ago. Important to note that capital spending was $1.1 billion higher in the first half of this year versus 2015 as we make investments in our portfolio in line with our previously communicated plan. Adjusted automotive free cash flow is expected to more than double in the second half of the year, and we remain very much on track to generate approximately $6 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow for the year.","We also remain focused on investing in the business and increasing shareholder value for the long term. As Mary discussed earlier, our strategic investments in Lyft and Cruise Automation help us to build the foundation to lead and define the future of personal mobility for our customers. We're pleased to report that we closed on the acquisition of Cruise Automation during the second quarter. The deal consideration at closing was approximately $600 million, with $300 million paid in cash during the quarter and the remaining $300 million paid through the issuance of new common stock.","Additionally, we entered into other agreements associated with retention of key employees and performance-based awards contingent on continued employment and\/or reaching certain milestones from a technology and a commercialization perspective. Despite nearly $800 million in cash outflows associated with our investments in Lyft and Cruise in the first half, as well as higher CapEx, our automotive cash balance increased $1.6 billion to $20.1 billion, bringing our balance back in line with our target.","Turning to our capital allocation framework, we continue to focus on driving shareholder value in the short and long term. We returned $1.5 billion to shareholders during the first half, including $1.2 billion in dividends and $300 million in share repurchases. Please note, because of the seasonally challenging cash flow in the first quarter and our desire to get back up to our target cash level of $20 billion by the end of the second quarter, we expected that our stock buyback program would be heavily weighted to the second half of the year.","Because we are in a seasonal cash flow business, I would focus less on smaller levels of stock buybacks in a quarter and more on the overall plan. We will deliver on our commitment to buy back $5 billion of stock by the end of 2016. In fact, we intend to complete the $5 billion stock buyback commitment within or ahead of the original timeline.","Finally, with regard to our outlook for the remainder of 2016, as Mary indicated earlier, given our very strong first half performance and our current outlook for the second half of the year, we now expect 2016 full year diluted earnings per share adjusted to be in the range of $5.50 to $6.00 per diluted adjusted share. We expect the second half of the year to be strong but slightly below H1 results, primarily due to uncertainties associated with Brexit.","As we've shown, we've accomplished a lot already this year, and we are in great position for improved full-year profit and margin growth versus 2015, which would be another record year for the company.","That concludes our opening comments. We'll now move to the question-and-answer portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everybody. Congratulations. Had a couple questions. First, on North America, clearly some very strong pricing positives this quarter. Just wondering if you can comment on how we should be thinking about that for the rest of the year, and specifically what's the thinking behind the more aggressive posture on pickup incentives. And then on Europe, presumably you've got some hedges that are offsetting the pound impact this year. So how should we be thinking about the kind of carry-over effect as some of those hedges begin to roll off?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. Thanks, Rod. Starting with North America. Second quarter, strong pricing on both new launches as we expected and guided earlier in the year, as well as carry-over pricing and we took advantage of continued strength in trucks and SUVs.","I would expect to see overall pricing moderate on a run-rate basis in the second half of the year. We'll continue to have strong pricing on our new product launches, but carry-over pricing on a half-to-half basis will be a typical headwind. I would talk about that in the context of we still expect very strong performance in North America in the second half and are still driving to 10%-plus margins. But that's kind of the big picture on that","Relative to truck incentives and the incentive programs in early July, I want to just make sure, that is absolutely not a shift in our focus and discipline around incentives. That was nothing more than a tactic to kick off the model year 2016 sell-down as we get ready to launch both the model year 2017 trucks and SUVs as well as new products. So that's more of a tactic versus anything else. And again, you have to look at that in the context of our expectations for the second half of the year.","On Europe relative to hedges, we did have some hedges in place that we put in place earlier this year that would cover some of the pound sterling exposure. The guidance that I provided on the second half of the year, kind of the up to $400 million headwind, reflects our \u2013 if the current economic conditions were to be sustained for the rest of the year. And the biggest driver of that is really the weakness of the pound sterling. That reflects any impact of the hedge roll-off as anything else. So that's an all-in number right now. Again, assuming that the current conditions persist through the rest of the year.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Is there any carryover effect as we think about the hedges rolling off into next year? Does the impact worsen?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Well, look. It is early days, and very uncertain. The way I think about it is, in the second half of the year, again, with no mitigating actions or anything else, the biggest impact is the pound sterling. That could be up to $400 million. It's roughly in the $1.30, $1.31, $1.32 range. You pick the day. I think, all other things being equal, multiplying that by two would be kind of a calendar year impact just looking at that specific driver.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And just lastly on mobility. How should we be thinking about GM's position regarding any future investment in Lyft at this point?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","So Rod, I'm not going to \u2013 there's been a lot of speculation. I'm not going to continue to speculate. But what I would say is that with the Lyft alliance, it is accomplishing everything we set out for it to do. In fact, it's exceeding our expectations. When you look at Express Drive, and I talked about how we're expanding the launch, that's something that is obviously positive from a Lyft perspective, but very positive for us because it gives us an opportunity to take vehicles coming off lease or coming off rental and put them into this, which is a better place to put the vehicles and also allows us to grow our residuals.","Also, we are very committed to being among the leaders or leading in autonomous technology. Clearly the Cruise Automation was a big piece of that, and the fact that we've already got cars on the road I think speaks to that. And we do believe that autonomous will first be tested out in the marketplace in a sharing type environment, and the alliance provides us the opportunity to do that. So the alliance is delivering what we need it to.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Good morning, Itay.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","So maybe just one financial and one strategic question. First, Chuck, just on the financial side, back to the $400 million Brexit impact. Can you just talk to what you're assuming for the UK and overall European auto market in the second half of the year?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. I would say, again, very early days. But if I was sizing up the $400 million, I would say it's primarily the pound sterling. The UK market, our initial assessments for the second half, it could be up to 5% to 10% reduction. But it's very, very early days. And I would say our perspective, again, is the largest majority of that potential impact is pound sterling-related.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great, then just a quick one on North America. What is the net impact from the auction sales in the quarter? It looks like it probably helped your volume delta on slide 14, but hurt the mix. Do you have a rough number of what the net of those two are?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. I mean, obviously, one of the reasons that we're executing to the retail-focused strategy is retail vehicles are more profitable than daily rent, and there's all kinds of long-term benefits, so \u2013 which would imply daily rental are not very profitable. And as I looked across the whole EBIT bridge, I'd say it's close to a push, Itay. The favorable volume is offset by unfavorable mix and some unfavorable costs that winds its way through just the variable manufacturing associated with that. So, close to a push.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Then, maybe one strategic question for Mary. As you roll out the autonomous Bolt EVs in San Francisco for the testing, can you give us sort of an early sense on what the game plan is in terms of deployment of your shared level for vehicles in the Lyft network? Initially with the driver, maybe the size and the timing and magnitude of this initiative?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Yeah. We haven't announced the exact timing because we're going to make sure as we develop the technology, we're being gated by making sure that we have safe autonomous technology to put into the marketplace.","We expect when we do that and we're working aggressively \u2013 I mean, I think the fact that we have the vehicles and we're able to so quickly integrate the Cruise Automation software into the vehicles I think speaks to the speed at which we're moving. But we do believe it'll be in a shared environment. There will be a safety driver in the vehicle as we demonstrate with miles earned and also customer acceptance. But we haven't put specific timing or quantity on that, more to follow on that as we continue to develop the technology.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. Thanks so much, everyone.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Thanks, Itay.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Thanks, Itay.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, guys. Just a first question on slide 14 on North America. I mean, as we look at the daily rental pressure easing in the second half of the year, is that the kind of thing that could actually become a little bit of a tailwind on a year-over-year basis as we get into early next year? And also in the context of these vehicles that you guys will hang on to on the leasing side, I just wondered if you could talk about lease penetration in the quarter, where you can see that going and how you might deal with a much higher level of lease return in the coming years?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. Again, I would look at all of these in the context of we're driving this business for sustainable 10%-plus margins. We expect the second half to be strong like the first half was from a North American perspective. Clearly, one of the benefits of the cycling through the daily rental is some of the challenges that we had on daily rental auction losses. So I think that ultimately there is a number of moving pieces in the second half but certainly we would expect to see strong performance.","Lease penetration thus far in the first half of the year for us has run in the 28% range or so, a little bit above historical levels. We would expect to see that moderate over time. And one of the reasons that we're so focused on building Express Drive, reducing daily rental and everything else is because we know that lease returns are going to increase, the used car market is going to normalize, and we're taking proactive actions to improve our residuals, improved our used car values for that timeframe.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's very helpful. And then a second question on the buybacks. We have the $5 billion commitment by the end of 2016. I'm just curious if you could just remind us where you are to date on those buybacks? And as we think about the potential to do more with the incremental $4 billion authorization, what sort of is the timeframe we should think about for the incremental $4 billion on top of the $5 billion?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. So we've purchased, to date, $3.8 billion. As I just noted, we are committed to completing the initial share buyback of $5 billion per the committed timeline, which was the end of 2016. We will do that as quickly as possible here in 2016. The increased authorization was through the end of 2017. Again, our capital allocation framework, relatively transparent to the extent that we are appropriately investing in the business and we maintain our $20 billion target cash and our strong balance sheet, available free cash flow will come back to shareholders. So, that will be the gating on how quickly we execute the second $4 billion.","I'd also point out, and I tried to make note of that in my comments, we are dealing with seasonality from a cash flow perspective, so we always need to think that share buybacks will generally be weighted towards the second half of the year versus the first half, just because of the low seasonality in the first quarter.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Incredibly helpful. And then just lastly, Mary, GM has got a long track record of coming up with great technology way ahead of what is generally perceived in the market, but then, the commercialization and monetization of that technology doesn't always really come through. OnStar is a great example of a product that is now gaining steam, but it's been around for a long time. As you're working on all these new projects, I'm just wondering how you think about ultimately, really commercializing and monetizing above and beyond what you're doing right now. I mean, it seems like you're way ahead of the curve on sort of the testing phase, but just curious how you think about commercializing and monetizing these efforts going forward.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Well, I think you can look across a couple of technologies. First, we continue on the journey with electrification, and I think launching the Chevrolet Bolt EV later this year, getting that into the marketplace, seeing the customer reception, when you really start to erase range anxiety with a 200-mile drive \u2013 200-mile capability and with, we believe, the industry's lowest cell cost. So that's something we're putting into the marketplace, capitalize on the fact that we think we have, in partnership with LG, demonstrated the cell technology \u2013 which, by the way, we own the IP for our cell chemistry \u2013 putting that into the marketplace. We're going to look to see how quickly that expands from an electrification perspective.","From an OnStar, agree, I think we've in the last couple years really accelerated, have a true leadership when we look at having OnStar with that connectivity across four continents. And we're continuing to look at ways to monetize that and that's something that's accelerating. And then with autonomous, to your point, that's one of the reasons we did the Lyft alliance is we recognized early that the fastest way to get the technology into customers' hands, and to really learn and be driven by what customer expectations are is to get it into a ride-sharing fleet and get it out there. So I think we're demonstrating different behavior with how we're getting the technology and the innovation and the technological advancements we've done into the marketplace more quickly. And I will also tell you, that's something I focus on every day.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. A couple of questions, somewhat related. First, it was kind of a soft SAAR last month. DSRs have been down on a year-over-year basis three months in a row. How are you seeing sort of the sales outlook just in terms of U.S. SAAR for the remainder of this year and then flowing into 2017?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. We have maintained our view that the U.S. industry is going to remain strong, in the mid 17 million kind of range through the rest of this year and kind of into next year. When we look at the leading indicators from an economic perspective and those indicators that really drive the auto SAAR, they continue to remain strong and favorable. And again, we would expect to see this improve in the second half and then continue to be strong in 2017. That's our baseline assumption, Brian.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And secondly, thinking ahead to a potential eventual downturn, what is your commitment to the dividend that you're paying now? You didn't buy back stock in part, we understand, because you wanted to maintain a $20 billion cash balance, but in a downturn, that might go down. Just how committed are you to the dividend through a downturn? Or would you seek to maybe limit the dividend and focus more on share buybacks?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","I think that's a hypothetical question, Brian, because it depends on the downturn, the depth of the downturn, the perspective on the view of the downturn. Clearly, as we think about a moderate downturn and we think about our cash balance and everything else, what we would like to be able to do in a typical moderate downturn, maintain investment and maintain the dividend without drawing on the revolver. All right? If those are the facts and circumstances at that point, I think that would be a guiding behavior or a guiding tenet that you can think about. But it really depends on the facts and circumstances of the downturn.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And kind of moderate, are you thinking sort of minus 10%? Minus 20%? Minus Great Recession numbers?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Well, Great Recession isn't moderate. So I would say, if you look historically and from a U.S. perspective, a moderate downturn is 20% to 25%.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. But so you would be willing to have cash go below $20 billion and use the balance sheet cash?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","That's why we have it.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes, that's why we carry it.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And I guess it gets to when I think of your slide on investment case, and maybe this is a question more for Mary, should investors be looking at you more as an earnings growth play, or more as a dividend yield investment?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Yeah, I really think it's both. I mean, I think when you look at our core business that we continue to invest in, the fundamentals of having great cars, trucks, and crossovers that customers are signaling they want to buy, we're segment leading, winning a lot of awards, continuing to look at how do we capitalize on adjacency, on connectivity, on GM Financial, so strengthening the core businesses, and growing with using adjacencies and also in some other key markets.","And then on top of that, being very selective in those estimates we're making, so we can take and build on the expertise that's fundamental in this company of integrating technology into vehicles and putting them out on the roads, that potentially have the opportunity to dramatically change \u2013 I'll say, the current business from an earnings perspective of what that new business is worth. So we are working on both. I would be very happy if people thought of us as delivering and doing both.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.","Neel N. Mehta - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone. This is Neel Mehta standing in for Adam Jonas. Just two questions for you. First, taking a look at the broader industry, it seems like GM has been fairly disciplined with respect to capacity additions in North America. Wanted to get your assessment on the overall industry's discipline. Is there any concern out there that we could see pricing headwinds down the road if there's too much capacity in the industry, even if SAAR remains relatively healthy and stable?","And then the second question is, there's a growing concern out there regarding off-lease supply, particularly as we head into the 2018 timeframe. Can you talk about GM's potential remarketing strategy around these vehicles? And could your Express Drive or Maven programs be disposition channels for off-lease vehicles in the future? Thank you.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Thanks. Relative to industry capacity, pricing, and everything else, as you look over the last number of years and just track incentive spend as a percent of transaction prices, it's inched up a little bit as we look at the trend over the last number of years. Nothing alarming. It appears that, from our perspective, the industry has continued to be rational from that perspective. Our base case is that's going to continue. As a matter of fact, one of your colleagues just wrote a research report that would indicate that the OEMs are displaying a lot of incentive discipline, and that could ultimately have a bit of a headwind from an overall SAAR perspective going forward.","So we still continue to see that. Obviously, there's puts and takes. There's always puts and takes, strong pricing in trucks, SUVs, crossovers, weakness in passenger cars, but by and large, we continue to see overall discipline. We're certainly going to remain disciplined. We're certainly going to continue to focus on capacity utilization. Hence, our focus on profitable retail growth versus fleet.","Relative to off-lease supply, I think I answered that question, indirectly or directly, earlier. We are focusing on reducing our daily rental just to make sure that we are not adding to the used vehicle market, because that has a tendency to impact residuals, which then impacts off-lease vehicles.","We have our Express Drive program, which specifically will use vehicles that are coming from rental and\/or off lease, as the supply for Lyft drivers. And we think that's going to have a pretty significant take up. We have our factory pre-owned collection as well, where we're trying to go directly to customers instead of through the auction, and make available a used car fleet from General Motors Company cars, daily rental, et cetera. All of those are really to make sure that there's good supply\/demand balance looking forward. And early days, but generally on track.","Neel N. Mehta - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Colin Langan with UBS.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my question. I apologize if I missed this, but any color on the purchase price for Cruise Automation? And any color on what you \u2013 the factors considering in making that kind of acquisition, since it's really more of a technology today?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Well, from a technology perspective, as we look at autonomous, Cruise Automation is the company that we have been following for a couple of years now. And as we saw the progress, and a very specific technology from a \u2013 call it machine learning or artificial intelligence, that coupled with all the work we were doing, we felt it accelerated our ability to be first or among the leaders as we implement fully autonomous technology into vehicles. And so it was very specific. It was something we'd been watching for quite a period of time. And strategically, we thought it was appropriate and we did a complete make\/buy analysis but we thought the work that we had observing would integrate very well and accelerate our efforts.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","And how much was the final price? I saw some different varying headlines on it?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","$581 million at deal.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then just a follow-up, not to belabor the UK $400 million cost; that was a little bit higher than I was expecting. Are you including in there any offset from the fact that you have facilities in the UK that now have, at least in the near term, a cost tailwind as you sell into Continental Europe? Or any possible pricing offset as a lot of people in the industry will be facing challenges as you import into UK?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","We have certainly factored in our footprint and manufacturing footprint. The fact is we import a heck of a lot more units into the UK than we export \u2013 manufacture and export out, so we're long pound sterling.","There is very little pricing mitigation assumed in that $400 million for the balance of the year specifically because, number one, it's early days. Number two, before you can take pricing action, you have to sell through inventory and the overall inventory levels in the UK are reasonably high across all of the OEMs. And that will certainly be one of the items as we work through this and see how it develops that we will be looking at it, as I'm sure other competitors will as well, as well as cost and other mitigating actions. So primarily, as I said earlier, the $400 million, looking at our overall position, primarily weakness in the pound sterling and some industry headwind.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","And lastly, when I'm looking at slide 14 with the North America walk, any color \u2013 you kind of highlight in the comments that mix is mostly the rental impact. I thought with SUVs being so strong, that mix would be positive. Did that more than offset that impact? And any color on the fixed cost and other, the $800 million, is that a run rate we should consider going forward or is this something unusual in the quarter?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Well, I'd say first off, mix for trucks and SUVs, this is a period-to-period adjustment and we've been in a pretty strong mix condition for the last year and a half, two years from a truck and SUV perspective. So the year-over-year comp is relatively flat from a mix standpoint. So, I would look at this mix number as being primarily related to the daily rental volume that rolled through volume.","Fixed costs, that is very consistent with what we talked about. Incremental D&A because of our launch cadence and new investments, product launches, incremental launch costs from a marketing standpoint as we launch new products, incremental engineering, again in support of our very aggressive launch cadence. And in the second quarter we had pretty significant manufacturing launch-related costs and manufacturing costs associated with the earthquake as we were running a lot of weekends and everything else to try to make up some of that volume. So I would not take this $800 million and multiply it by four from a run rate perspective. I would expect to see fixed cost on kind of a year over year basis improve in the second half of the year versus the first half, year over year.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a good quarter.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. On China, I know the margin is still strong, down year-over-year. And I think you called out significant pricing pressure. And it also seemed like the Baojun brand really stepped out, so that probably didn't help mix. I was wondering if you could just talk about if there's any change to the outlook there for the year. I think originally you said 2016 would be fairly flat with 2015. And then again, plans to make those margins sustainable beyond this year.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah, we have not changed our outlook for China. We continue to expect strong performance in China, equity income in the range of $2 billion consistent with last year, margins in the 9% to 10% range. Going forward, as we've talked about since early last year, the market is more volatile, the competition is obviously from a price perspective stepping up. We continue to believe that we can execute our plan including our product launches, improve mix from an SUV perspective, continuing efficiencies to maintain strong margins and strong equity income going forward. And we'll have more to say about 2017 early next year. I would say from where we're sitting today, we would expect to deliver the performance that we talked about earlier this year in China.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then, Chuck, I think you mentioned some European cost savings to be put in place to offset some of the changes from Brexit. Can you provide little bit more color there? Does that involve sort of changing the footprint? Is it sort of straight tightening the belt, or what do you have in mind?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Well, first \u2013 again, I'll go back to the initial comments I made. This is early days, there Is a lot of uncertainty. We wanted to size up again based on the current economic conditions, what the impact would be for the rest of this year. And, you know that I think, based on today's assumptions, is not a bad planning assumption. We will look across the business, as we've demonstrated that we would do not only in Europe but in other parts of the world, to ensure that we are taking the actions that are necessary to drive these businesses to the kind of performance that we need to generate.","The whole laundry list. We will look to optimize channel mix in the UK. We will look to pricing, and to the extent possible, price to offset any lingering FX exposure. We will look to optimize our overall cost structure, whether it's in the UK or Europe, to mitigate these things. And that may or may not involve footprint and others actions it will take. We'll look to optimize our material cost. I mean, we will go through the whole list of drivers. And the team has been doing that for the last three of four years, and we'll continue to do that. And this is another speed bump along the way, but we're just going to have to deal with it.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then last one, sticking with Europe. I think you mentioned UK, again early stage, but could be down 5%, 10%. But based on your comment just now about the inventory levels there and how it's going to take a while for a price increase, is it possible or even likely that demand maybe gets a little bit better before it tails off?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","I guess I'm not quite sure on your question. You mean demand...","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Well, if consumers wanted to get ahead \u2013 if consumers wanted to get ahead of a price increase?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. Who knows, right? I mean, I think they're probably still digesting a lot of what's going on as well. The indications I'm seeing and reading, housing market has already kind of stalled a little bit over there. Consumers are sitting on their wallets. It's just very early days, and something that we're going to have to monitor very closely.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks. Congrats again, guys.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Thank you.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.","Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. This is Samik on behalf of Ryan Brinkman. I have two questions. The first one is on China. You had, I mean, pretty strong margins there. But what we are also seeing is the regulators push that market towards investing and launching new energy vehicles. So I just wanted to check with you how you're positioning your product portfolio for these incentives that are available on new energy vehicles going on a continuing basis. And also if you have any view on the extension of incentives on smaller engine vehicles in China in 2017.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Well, from a new energy vehicle perspective, we already have vehicles into the marketplace. And we have a launch cadence that we plan on putting out that will continue to expand on that. Again, leveraging the technology that we have, the low cell cost. So I think you'll see us looking and having a comprehensive portfolio from an electrification perspective, taking advantage of the incentives and the opportunity there, but also very important to meet the regulatory environment. So that is work that's well underway. And then, as it relates to the...","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. Look, the announced program is through the end of 2016. Clearly, we're staying engaged to the extent possible to get intelligence on whether that would be extended into 2017 or potentially terminated early. I think there's a lot of uncertainty around that point in time. So again, we have not changed our view that it's going to come off December 31. But that's something that we closely monitor. And if there's something meaningful to report at that point in time, we will.","Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, and the second question I had is there are some early signs here emerging over the last couple of days that the midterm review for the CAFE standards, you might get some relaxation there as well with authorities, sort of acknowledging that the 2025 targets are difficult to achieve with the current mix of vehicles that are being sold. Any updated thoughts there, any discussions, and is that likely to be a tailwind compared to your expectations?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","We continue to work with the government and provide input from \u2013 as we do this mid-term review, which I think was a very important step when the program was put in place with the new targets to have this mid-term review. We clearly have identified a portfolio where we can meet. But a lot \u2013 what everyone has to remember is that it also depends on what customers actually buy. And when you look at the current environment, that drives it as well.","So I think we're going to have a good discussion as we do this interim review. But I want to reiterate, we have done a lot of work to have the right portfolio. But I think we also have to make sure that the targets comprehend that customers ultimately choose what vehicles they're going to buy.","Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for taking our questions. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from James Albertine with Consumer Edge Research.","James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Great. Thank you so much for taking the question, and congratulations again. Wanted to ask on South America, if I may. Just an update on the endgame there. It looks like you've done a great job with respect to cost controls. Seems like there's some cushion there. You've narrowed losses over time. But it also seems, at the same time, that you're transforming into this business of new technologies and potentially some new monetization channels. So wanted to understand the prioritization of GMSA as it relates to maybe the next medium-term five-year period or so.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Well, over history, South America has been a very important business for us and has delivered strong performance. We have a very strong product portfolio there and with a lot of model year refreshes that happened this year that are very, I'll say, economically done from a capital deployment perspective. We have a very strong distribution network. I think the strongest dealer body. When you look across the globe, the Chevrolet brand is incredibly strong.","So we have a very strong core business franchise in South America and I think the team has done a very good job over the last couple years of really looking at the market conditions, taking cost out, again on all drivers. It gets to the point that Chuck made when we were talking about Europe. We've run that play. We've demonstrated success in South America of really looking at how to take cost out and how to drive an increase from a revenue perspective.","So we see that business as important. Obviously, disappointing right now with the macroeconomic conditions that no one knows for sure how long they last, but they're lingering. But we're well positioned and have seen improvement in the first half of this year from the first half of last year even in a more difficult macroeconomic environment. So, very important business for us and we know that it has huge potential as we move forward.","As it relates to technologies, whether it's connectivity we've already deployed and we'll continue to grow that over the next couple of years. We'll continue to also see what the receptivity is from an electrification perspective, and from an autonomous perspective. But it will be customer-driven. Clearly, we have the technology and the capability to do it.","James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Great. I appreciate that color. Just two quick housekeeping items, if I may, as a follow-up. First, do you have any plans similar to your peer, key peer in Ford, to break out your digital strategy or technology strategy as a separate segment? And then secondly, as we're thinking about fixed versus variable cost assumptions, I think Chuck alluded to this earlier, but if we're doing a break-even analysis for the next few years in your U.S. business, what are the right percentages to bake in now considering all the improvements you've engineered over time? Thanks so much.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah, relative to segment reporting, we have no plans at this time to change our segment reporting. Obviously, that's something that we continuously evaluate as the characteristics of the business changes. So the quick answer is, no, on any change to segment reporting at this time.","I'm not going to give you our fixed variable perspective on a go-forward basis. I would say from \u2013 our real focus is to continue to maintain break-even point in the U.S. at a 10 million to 11 million SAAR, and that is driven by variable profit improvement and the overall level of fixed cost. I would say, importantly, when you look at cost, look at North America in either the second quarter or the first half of the year, factor in what we categorize as fixed cost versus the material performance, the commercial performance, cost performance is relatively flat. And we grew our margins, which means that variable margins improved as well. And that is supportive of maintaining a low break-even point. So, I kind of think about cost overall, both variable costs, especially the performance aspects of that, the commercial performance against fixed cost increases.","James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Well, thank you so much and best of luck in the coming quarters.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Thank you.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our last question for today will come from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with CLSA.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Hi.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Hey.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","So just a point of clarification first on, I guess, your implied guidance for the second half when you sort of \u2013 essentially guiding to a little bit of a softer earnings in the second half? Is that entirely the risk from Brexit which you quantified? Or is there anything else that you're looking at, and in particular is there anything in North America sequentially?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah, okay. First, we're going to \u2013 our expectations are we're going to have a very strong year. We had a very strong first half, and when I look at second half versus first half, the fundamental driver is seasonality, which is largely, even pre-Brexit, was a European issue. We were shut down in Europe, to a large extent, in the third quarter, and then there's the holidays and Brexit. Those are the two biggest factors of the second half versus first half.","North America had a great first half. We expect North America to have a great second half, continued strength. And again, our overall expectations, improved profitability year-over-year, improved margins, improved earnings per share, $6 billion of free cash flow, another record year. And the performance that we generated in the first half is supportive of that, and that's why we took our guidance up as well.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","Great. That's helpful. And then I guess on the Lyft partnership, obviously seems off to a pretty good start. Can you share with us what sort of milestones or maybe concrete obligations of the partnership we could expect over the next few years? Are there any specific things we should be looking for?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Well, I think when we put together the alliance it was built on four aspects. One was what we're already doing with Express Drive. Two, the power of using the vehicles that have the capability that OnStar provides. That's already underway. There's an opportunity to cross-market, and I think that's something we're just beginning to look at. Clearly getting Lyft's customers into our vehicles through Express Drive gives them exposure to the cars from a styling, from a technology \u2013 the whole value proposition that we have across our brands in GM products, and then demonstrating autonomous capability in a sharing environment. So those were the four pillars the alliance was on. As I said, those are all on track and are accomplishing exactly what we intended to do.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","That is great to hear. Thank you.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mary Barra.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Thank you, operator. And I want to thank everybody for participating on the call today. I think if you step back and look, not only this quarter, but what we've demonstrated over the last several quarters, we really have very strong earnings power in this company, and I think, that demonstrates why GM is a compelling investment opportunity. We know the industry well. We know it comes with challenges and twists and turns, but we also know it comes with opportunities. I think we've shown in this quarter and quarter after quarter that we have the right mindset and are holding ourselves accountable to overcome headwinds, to seize opportunities and to meet our commitments with no excuses.","The leadership across the company, which I'm very proud of, are pushing themselves to beat the targets we put in front of us. They want to win and they want to continue to drive value for our customers and for our owners. So we'll continue to execute our plan with discipline to keep driving profitable growth, generating strong returns on invested capital, and creating shareholder value as we really focus on putting the customer at the center of everything we do. So thanks again for your participation in our call today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Tuesday October 29, 2019.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Rocky Gupta, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations.","Rocky Gupta","Thanks Dorothy. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us, as we review GM's financial results for the third quarter of 2019. Our press release was issued this morning and the conference call materials are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast.","I\u2019m joined today by Mary Barra, GM's Chairman and CEO; Dhivya Suryadevara, GM's Executive Vice President, CFO, and a number of other Executives. Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language.","I will now turn the call over to Mary Barra.","Mary Barra","Thanks, Rocky, and good morning everybody, and thank you joining the call. As you know, we have a ratified labor agreement and I am very glad that our highly skilled employees are back to work building winning cars, trucks, crossovers and components. From the outside, our goal was to reach an agreement that works for our shareholders, our employees and our company as we confirmed the realities of our rapidly transforming industry.","A contract does the right thing for our employees without compromising competitiveness or flexibility. It includes improve half forward for our in progression and temporary workers that will create more engagements and a motivated team. This is foundational for our improving job satisfaction, health and safety, quality and productivity, all of which will strengthen the future of this company and creates shareholder value.","The contract also affirms our commitment to a strong U.S. manufacturing base with planned investments totaling $7.7 billion. We'll secure the future of our Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant with an all-new electric pickup truck that builds on established truck leadership. We\u2019re also moving forward on an effort to bring battery cell production to the Mahoney Valley in Ohio, which will create 1,000 manufacturing jobs.","Before I continue, I want to thank our dedicated suppliers. They were in constant contact with us throughout the work stoppage and ensuring as they would be ready for a prompt, safe restart once the new contract was ratified. And I'd also like to thank our dealers who helped us sustain our momentum in the marketplace and they worked very hard to minimize the inconvenience to our customers caused by our limited ability to shift service and repair part.","To speed up recovery and get cars flowing to dealership, comprehensive plans are in place to allow the network to recover as quickly as possible. So now, we are moving forward as one team. However, we have a lot of work to do in many areas, as the loss profits from the work stoppage were significant. In a few minutes, Dhivya will talk about the financial impact of this drive and our full year outlook.","Overall in the third quarter, we delivered net revenue of $35.5 billion, EBITDA adjusted of $3 billion, EBIT adjusted margin of 8.4%, EBIT, EPS diluted adjusted of $1.72, automotive adjusted free cash flow of $3.8 billion, and a ROIC adjusted of $21.9 on a trailing four quarters basis.","Looking at North America, we delivered strong business performance in the quarter which was unfavorably impacted by the strike in the United States and increased warranty and retail cost related to our previous generation full size pickup trucks and full size SUV. Overall, retail deliveries rose 6% year-over-year led by double-digit gains and light-duty Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups and strong demand for our all new heavy-duty pickup trucks.","Cadillac continues to capitalize on its expanding crossover portfolio in the United States and China. In the US, Cadillac crossover deliveries increased by 67% in the quarter led by the segment leading XT4 and the all-new XT6 which is gaining momentum in the market.","In China, the XT4 and the new XT5 helped drive deliveries up 11%, amidst lower industry sales. With the XT6 joining the lineup, we expect Cadillac will further strengthen its position in China's growing luxury SUV segment. Our luxury sedan portfolio updates continue with the launch of the all new CT5 midsize luxury sedan in China this quarter by early next year by the U.S. built CT5 and CT4 in North America.","Finally, as we look at meeting customer demand, our U.S. dealerships finished the third quarter with a healthy level of inventory. As the strike continued, our teams work tirelessly to ensure we could ship as many vehicles as possible to our dealers. However with no additional vehicles in the pipeline for many weeks, our dealer inventories will be temporary leaner than we'd like. The team is doing everything that's powered to restore our supply of vehicles back to normal levels.","Regarding our international operations, in China, the business environment remains challenging and volatile. Year-over-year, industry vehicle sales declined nearly 11% in the quarter. We underperformed relative to the industry mostly because of segment shifts and lower demand for outgoing models, partially offset by growth in Cadillac delivery.","In addition to taking appropriate cost actions, we are improving our product mix. We launched seven new models in third quarter with plans to launch five new and refresh models in the fourth quarter. In addition, the team continues to focus on accelerating cost reduction initiatives to improve performance, given the business environment.","In South America, we continue to take steps to improve the business and protect our strong franchise while navigating FX and other macro challenges. In September, we launched the all new 2020 Chevrolet Onix plus in Brazil. It is the first model in South America from our new global family of vehicles and carries a five star safety rating.","During its initial month on sale, customer demand greatly outpaced available supply and we are doubling our production this month. The Onix hedge back follows next month and together, we believe these new vehicles will further strengthen our Chevy brand leadership and Onix position as the region's bestselling vehicle.","As we execute our turnaround plan for international operations, we continue to take decisive steps to achieve sustainable profitability in every market we participate and cease operations that are not. Earlier this week, we announced our intent to cease selling Chevrolet vehicles in Indonesia over the coming quarters.","Turning to our EV progress, Chevrolet is launching the 2020 Bolt EV with battery improvements that enable an EPA estimated 259 miles of all electric range at a full charge at the same price. The more powerful battery pack is the same size and weight as previous year's models, but its greater energy density delivers 21 additional miles of range and that's more value to our customers.","It's built on our industry leadership and improving battery range and reducing battery cell powers per kilowatt hour, and we expect this progress to continue. The 2020 Bolt also retains what our customers love about this vehicle, instant torque, excellent riding handling, and a zero to 60 times of just 6.5 seconds.","And on the AV front, Cruise increased its testing and validation mile during the quarter and increased its community engagement and relationship building. In addition to Cruise, GM and Honda continued their joint development of a new purpose built shared autonomous vehicle.","So to recap, our strong operating performances in the quarter were supported by a robust sale of trucks and crossovers in the United States. We've also made significant progress at our transformational cost initiatives. GM has achieved 2.4 billion and transformation cost savings in 2018 and is on track to realize our 2019 targets.","Because of additional planned investments in U.S. manufacturing, we will revise our year-end 2020 cost savings started to arrange between $4 billion and $4.5 billion. We will take all of the necessary steps to achieve as much as possible to our original savings target. The strike did have a big impact on our Q3 EBIT adjusted results and will also significantly impact our Q4 results.","Most of our 2019 strike-related production losses will not be recovered in 2019 because of capacity constraints. Therefore, we are revising our 2019 EPS-diluted adjusted in automotive, adjusted automotive free cash flow guidance. Our full year, updating EPS diluted adjusted outlook is now on the range or $4.50 to $4.80, and our new adjusted automotive free cash flow guidance is zero to $1 billion.","I have asked the GM team to find every offset, now that production has resumed and I'm confident they will find many opportunities.","So with that, I will turn it over to Dhivya.","Dhivya Suryadevara","Thanks, Mary, and good morning everybody. Today, I want to discuss our performance for the quarter, the impact of the strike, the labor agreement, and finally our outlook for the year.","In the third quarter, we generated $35.5 billion in net revenues, $3 billion in EBIT adjusted 8.4% margin $1.72 an EPS diluted adjusted and $3.8 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow. The EBIT adjusted impact of the strike in the third quarter was $1.3 billion on a gross basis.","This reflects lost production of a richer product mix as we launched our high content, high margin heavy-duty crew cab, as well as the impact of last aftermarket sales. This impact was partially offset by approximately $300 million and strike related favorable of timing items.","Net of these turning items, the EPS during the quarter was lowered by approximately $0.52, and the adjusted automotive free cash flow was lower by approximately $400 million due to the strike. Adjusting for the impact of the strike, EPS would have been $2.24 an all-time quarterly record. The $1.72 EPS diluted adjusted also includes a $0.15 loss from Lyft and PSA revaluation.","Now let's take a closer look at North America. North America delivered EBIT adjusted of the $3 billion, up $200 million year-over-year, and 10.8% margin driven by our heavy-duty truck performance, our crossover performance and the benefits from our cost actions. This was partially offset by the impact of this strike, warranty costs and lower pension and health.","Our newly launched heavy-duty trucks contributed favorably to volume, mix and price during the quarter. Market share for our large pickup trucks continues to improve, up 5 percentage points in Q3 year-over-year. We started deliveries of our heavy duties in Q2 and we have gained 6 percentage points in market share since the launch.","Our light duty pickup trucks improved 6.8% at retail in Q3 year-over-year to over 40% as we rolled out diesel and other cab variants. We will have the same launch gate and strategy for the heavy-duty as we did for the light duty with the rollout of double cabs next, followed by regular cab.","Switching to crossovers, U.S. deliveries grew 29% year-over-year with a Chevrolet Blazer and Cadillac XT6 providing strong contributions to our results.","Let\u2019s move to GM International. For the third quarter, EBITDA adjusted in GMI was down $200 million year-over-year driven by lower equity income in China. Continued industry weakness and pricing pressure resulted in Q3 equity income down $200 million year-over-year from record Q3, 2018 level. We did see slight benefits from improved mix partially due to our recently launch vehicle.","A few comments on GM Financial, Cruise in our core segment, GM Financial posted record quarterly revenue of $3.7 billion in the third quarter and record EBT adjusted of $700 million primarily as a result of portfolio growth. Cruise costs were $300 million for the quarter on track with approximately $1 billion communicated previously for the full year as we increased our headcount.","Core segment costs in the third year -- sorry third quarter were $500 million, unfavorable $400 million year-over-year primarily due to net loss of $280 million from Lyft and PSA investments in the third quarter of this year compared to a $170 million gain from our PSA investment in the third quarter of last year.","We have made significant progress on our transformational cost savings initiative with $2.4 billion achieved since 2018. We\u2019re on track with our 2019 target of $2 billion to $2.5 billion, achieving $1.9 billion year-to-date and $800 million in the third quarter. Let me update you on our outlook for the calendar year.","The recent strike is obviously had a negative impact on our financial performance in Q3 and more so in Q4. We estimate the calendar year EPS diluted adjusted impact to be approximately 4$2 per share and adjusted automotive free cash flow impact to be approximately $5.5 billion including the impact of working capital unwind. The $2 in EPS reflects lost production of a richer mix, lost after-market sales, start up and ramp cost, and is net of a higher U.S. tax rate on last earnings.","While we continue to work on strike recovery efforts, we anticipate that we have small portion of the losses sustained during this strike can be recovered this year due to capacity constraints. Factoring in all of this, our updated 2019 EPS diluted adjusted outlook is in the range of $4.50 to $4.80.","Catching on CapEx, we expect 2019 CapEx of approximately $7.5 billion this year due to timing and early achievement of commitment. Updating for this and the impact of the strike, we expect adjusted automotive free cash flow guidance in the range of zero to $1 billion. I would like to provide some additional perspective on this guidance. The underlying EPS and free cash flow guidance is consistent with the range given in January.","We have experienced the highly unusual situation with the shutdown of our North American operations for six weeks. We are restarting our operations very close to year end and the speed of production ramp and timing factors are very difficult to predict at this point. We have provided the best estimated outlook given the information that we have today.","Next, I want to briefly talk about the impact of our new labor agreement. The new agreement preserves our competitiveness, manufacturing flexibility, and balance sheet strength without compromising earnings power.","We have maintained the mix of our North American manufacturing footprint, maintained ability to adjust our work force in response to changing industry levels, protected the balance sheet with no increase to define benefit pension obligation and no payments or increase obligations to retirees.","We maintained breakeven levels in the 10 million to 11 million unit range in the U.S. and therefore preserved our ability to navigate through a downturn. It is important to note that while this labor agreement is inflationary, we expect to offset incremental economics over the contract period with productivity initiative.","Finally, I want to briefly touch on 2020. While we will provide full guidance in February, let me help frame the year by outlining a number of puts and takes. Headwinds for 2020 include likely lower industry volume, downtime and ramp up for the launch of our full-size SUVs, higher depreciation and continued volatility in China and in South America.","Opportunities in 2020 include full year of heavy-duty truck production, transformational cost savings, and product launches including the Corvette, Encore GX, Trailblazer and our global family of vehicles. The ability to recover loss production during the strike in 2020 will depend on industry performance and our capacity availability as we already run our full size truck plans at maximum three ships capacity.","Lastly, as a result of our decision to invest in our Detroit-Hamtramck plant, we will incur operating costs that were outside the scope of our original transformation plan. While this slightly revises are year-end cost savings target to $4 billion to $4.5 billion, we will work to find every opportunity to maximize the cost savings potential. We're committed to our capital plan of approximately 7 billion annually, and our long-term financial trajectory, including 10% core EBIT adjusted margin, and improving our free cash flow conversion.","In summary, the underlying business remains strong, and our guidance is consistent with the range given in January, excluding the impact of the strike. We have a labor agreement that preserves our competitiveness and flexibility and we expect to offset economics over the contract period with productivity. The environment is more challenging than just a few months ago, but the entire team is focused on our execution, both over the short and long-term.","This concludes our opening comments, and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.","Joseph Spak","Just to start on maybe some of the cash flow dynamics you mentioned, the CapEx lowered this year. That was on part on timing and then early achievement. Can you -- can we get some color on each factor? I guess I probably want to gauge how much of the timing could impact 2020 on free cash flow. I know you said, on average, $7 billion per year, but it seems like maybe 2020 might be a little bit higher than that. And then also related to free cash, with the working capital unwind in the fourth quarter, how much do we expect to recover into 2020?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yes, Joe, I would say from a CapEx standpoint, the early achievement of the CapEx commitments and 2019 does not impact our commitment to achieve $7 billion in 2020. So that commitment remains intact. From a timing perspective, even though we pull forward in 2019, we still think we can achieve that.","To your question on free cash flow impact, obviously, there's the flow through from the profit impact into free cash flow. In addition to that, we've seen working capital and sales allowance and policy and warranty and so on timing items are driving the remaining amount there. So, the 5.5 comprises of the lost profit and the working capital unwind. CapEx remains intact, and that's the map to get to the 5.5.","Joseph Spak","Okay, and then I know that you said recovery a volume next year is dependent on the market and as you noted, you're running all out on the trucks. But if we assume an environment in 2020, similar to '19, like just back in the envelope, I was sort of just looking at the calendar and counting days and make some assumptions. It seems like you might be able to get back 50% to 60% of it, is that reasonable?","Dhivya Suryadevara","I think it's really hard to call that now, Joe, partially because you also need to figure out what the trucking industry is going to be like i.e. the segment share within the industry. And to your point, we are running those all out. It's difficult to add over time and travel overtime. So, we will recover every unit that we possibly can. It's just difficult to predict now at this point, what that would look like.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research.","Rod Lache","I had a couple questions. First, looks like the adjusted free cash flow with the adjustments you're making would have put this year's free cash flow at $5.5 billion to $6 billion, if it wasn't for the strike. And it appears that you've got another $1 billion to $1.5 billion of savings for next year. The original number was closer to $2 billion and it sounds like the variants there was Hamtramck. So, what's evolved in your thinking on Hamtramck since earlier in the year?","Mary Barra","So when we made the transformation announcement last year, although we had a battery electric truck in our plan. As we continue to evolve that and looked at the full range of what we can do there to really maintain our truck leadership position and grow that into battery electric trucks. We look at Detroit-Hamtramck is a great opportunity and company now getting an appropriate labor agreement there. And so, we think this is a good investment in positions as well to lead in battery electric trucks as well as internal combustion trucks. And so that is that portfolio as we further planted, it became clear that we can be more efficient doing that work there.","Rod Lache","North America and GM Financial look like they were very strong this quarter. Obviously, there's unusual items that affects both of those right now. Could you just talk a little bit about those, aside from just the things like launch, but did you make any adjustments to pre existing warranties in North America? And how should we be thinking about the cadence for GM Financial going forward and what that might, may mean for releasing cash from that business?","Dhivya Suryadevara","From a North American standpoint, yes, it was a very strong quarter. The cadence of our heavy-duty lunch helped a lot from a mix 10 points since we're rolling out, crew cab for the most part. And that will normalize as we roll out the other variants as well. To your question on no warranty, we had a $700 million year-over-year unfavorable and that was primarily driven by the K2 warranty cost that Mary mentioned in her remarks as well as there was a onetime favorable item in 2018 of last year which does not repeat in 2019.","So, from a year-over-year Delta perspective, that impacts as well. And in Q3, I'd say rather that we go through a normal tour process from a warranty perspective and there were some top ups relative to that as well, but that was on the smaller side of things, that you capture that. From a GM Financial perspective, the biggest item I'd point to is the fact that residual values have been coming in stronger than what we had previously accounted for.","So as you go forward there you may want to think about some kind of normalization there. The offset to that would be continued growth in the size of the book as we move closer towards forecast. Those are the normalizing items from GM Financial perspective.","Joseph Spak","And just to clarify in North America, I was asking about the incentive accruals yet over 700,000 units of inventory, and I would have presume that you have make some adjustments just given that prospects for declining inventory. Was there anything unusual there? And can you tell us what\u2019s expectation is for Q4 production at this point?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yes. I\u2019d say nothing specifically on the incentive side, we\u2019ll obviously \u2013 it will be vehicle-by-vehicle driven by market dynamics and nothing specifically to point out there from a true or whatever perspective. From a Q4 production, we are now back up and running and all of our plans are running all out. Like we said, we\u2019re going to take the opportunity to get any excellent that we can and that\u2019s all we can comment on at this time. And since we\u2019re still in ramp up and we\u2019re trying to maximize the number of units, we\u2019ll have more to share about that when we report Q4.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America.","John Murphy","First question just around the labor agreement and the special attrition buyout program. It looks like it's only targeting about 2,000 workers, but based on sort of what I\u2019ve been able to dig up, it seems like half of your workers are senor, meaning they're getting defined benefit, pensions and natural attrition on an annual basis is about 2,000 workers. So just curious why that even the special attrition program that buyout might not target more workers? And then overtime in the next three years before the next contract, would that impact sort of natural attrition, meaning would be still expect to see 2000 per year? So first is why is it a larger program? And second, what kind of impact would it have on natural attrition overtime?","Mary Barra","I think a couple of things here to think about it. First of all, one big component of the special attrition program was to give people choices. Although, we have job for everybody that was impacting by the un-allocation of three plans, we wanted to give them options and so there is a target there from that perspective. And the other thing is, you can -- we think that again people wait and look and see if there is going to special attrition program, but then we also do see the natural attrition over the course of the agreement. So, I would expect that to continue and that\u2019s how we size what we thought the SAP should be.","John Murphy","And Mary, when we think about those attritions whether it'd be special or sort of natural over the next few years, what is your plan as far as back feeling for those workers? I mean, would there be replaced one-for-one with in-progression workers or entry level workers? Or could there be folks then get hired out in California to work on cruise? Just trying to understand sort of the thought process of what, how to size the labor for us going forward?","Mary Barra","Well, I think it's a -- there is many different components of the labor force. There is a Cruise labor force. There is our salary workforce and then there is our representative workforce. And I think your question is directed as the represented work force, we\u2019re going to continue to work on productivity and we have opportunity there. We also have a lot of opportunity continue to improve our manufacturing processes. We\u2019ve done a lot of work this year and complexity optimization, and we\u2019re driving that in from a design for manufacture ability perspective into how we design vehicles.","We\u2019ve also been able to find more and more opportunities to reuse without impacting our customers view of vehicle is being all-new especially when you look at some of the architectural components. We also have a program we've been working on for many years call built-in quality level 4. And by the end of the year, virtually all of our plants will have achieved built-in quality 4. Our built-in quality level 4, which leads to first better health and safety and better quality as measured by two months and 12 months warranty performance.","So, we see, I'll say traditional productivity improvements. We see efficiencies on how we designed vehicles and components from the DFMEA perspective. And then, we see the results coming from our built-in quality level 4. All those things are going to help us make sure we optimize the workforce and optimize our manufacturing costs. As we need to hire additional workers, we\u2019ll utilize both temps and I'm very proud of the fact that we provided an appropriate path to permanent employment for our temporary workforce and then also maintain the in-progression flow. So, we'll utilize both of those depending on the plan and the situation at that plant.","John Murphy","Got you, that's helpful. Then just on the SUV launch. Is there any change in timing for next year on the SUV launch given what's happened with the strike?","Mary Barra","We haven't specifically said when those launches they will occur and will roll out all three versions next year. And of course, the team is working to do everything possible to make sure we have successful high quality launches with minimizing the impact of the acceleration curve. So those we still we'll get all those done this year and I'm not going to give any more specifics on timing.","John Murphy","Okay. And then just lastly, there's been a lot of negative comments on pricing, and some came from one of your cross-town rivals but also sort of in the press. Yet the quarter, on your majors, you put up a $400 million positive, but more importantly you put up a $200 million positive on your carryovers. What do you see in the pricing sort of competitive landscape for pricing? I mean, is that $200 million positive from carryovers was that benefited by some shortages during the strike or you actually seeing some real net positive price on carryovers?","Dhivya Suryadevara","From a majors perspective, I'd say it's mainly driven by our heavy-duty and the variance of the light duty, that we\u2019ve recently launched. So those were strong, and that's really the truck franchise that\u2019s driving that. On the carryover side, the outgoing model from a car perspective, we reduced our incentives on that quite a bit. From a crossover standpoint, we were disciplined as well.","So overall, I would say positive, carryover a net price. That's going to be quarter-to-quarter John, it's going to vary based on seasonality and so on and so forth. But it's our intention, stay disciplined. And as you can see in the quarter, with the net majors mechanisms that I just talked about, we have grown share for both light duties as well as heavy duties. We plan on continuing on that path of being disciplined.","John Murphy","And Dhivya, in a competitive environment, have you seen any deterioration there? I mean, I understand you guys are pretty disciplined, but I mean, are you seeing sort of any kind of warning signs out there?","Dhivya Suryadevara","I think there's definitely months where you see some competitive activity and then it normalizes and so on, but we're launching, we're going with our cadence. And we're, the strength of the products that we put out are driving our market share gains this time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi.","Itay Michaeli","So just first question with inventory now being leaner, can you talk about opportunities you might have in Q4 and beyond to optimize for mix and pricing? Should we expect mix to get richer over the next several months as you try to kind of manage the inventory situation?","Dhivya Suryadevara","We're going to try and build everything that we can get Itay from a mix perspective. We will continue down the path of rolling out the richer mix from an HD standpoint. LD as low, we will, try and maximize it will make sense that our most profitable and as we go forward. So we're going to be opportunistic as we go along.","And the other aspect is, obviously, from a country mix standpoint, there's places where we, there's places that are more profitable and there are places that are less profitable, and we're going to direct the amount of inventory that we have towards the more profitable places as well. So, we will be opportunistic, it's hard to obviously sites that at this time, and we will provide more detail in Q4.","Itay Michaeli","And just second Dhivya, on the 2020 puts and takes I think you mentioned lower industry volume as a headwind. Can you put the more detail what you thinking regionally and globally? Does that include the truck franchise, pickup truck industry and sales there still do not be strong throughout 2019. Any additional color would be helpful there.","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yes, I think we still have another couple of months here to go to see what happens here. But in 2020, we do think that China will remain volatile. South America will remain volatile. And here the United States with the economic growth are moderating here in the recent past and in the next year or so we're anticipating. We're still planning for a lower industry, so healthy industry but a lower industry in 2020. And we're going to have to, as we move forward here in the next few months before we get guidance, we'll put more specifically around that but any more than that it's too early to tell.","Itay Michaeli","But just lastly on Cruise, I think back in July, Cruise mentioned they would accelerate testing and validation in the balance of 2019. Any update that you can share in terms of miles driven and the overall activity that Cruise is undergoing in the second half?","Mary Barra","I would say we're not going to give you a specific mileage, but they are doing exactly what they indicated, they would do in the summer timeframe. Everything's going really well, as they need their milestones and as they continue to develop the economist technology. So very much on track and not only on the technology, but also the work that they're doing in San Francisco in the community to make sure that the consumer is ready understands the technology and trust the technology. So, both of those plans are perfectly on track.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.","Adam Jonas","Mary, over the next five years, will GM spend more R&D and CapEx dollars on EVs or internal combustion vehicles?","Mary Barra","I believe it'll be EV.","Adam Jonas","Thank you. And do you think that do EV is require less labor then internal combustion vehicles, all else equal?","Mary Barra","I mean I think you have to look at the entire vehicle. Clearly from an electrification perspective, it's simpler from a component perspective than it is from an internal combustion engine. But you know what the key things that we've done is light-weighting because light-weighting is so important across every component and from a body structures perspective, that light weighting generally requires a little bit more labor. So, overall, I think it's somewhat last but I think you've got to look at the whole vehicle, not just the propulsion system.","Adam Jonas","Thanks, Mary. And just, I wanted to have a couple questions on Corvette. And I Mark is not on the call here. So, maybe we can follow up with him. But Mary, what do you think of a Corvette SUV?","Mary Barra","I appreciate that you think our core franchise is very strong. I\u2019m not going to talk about future\u2026","Adam Jonas","I do.","Mary Barra","Thank you, I can\u2019t wait for the world to be able to drive the CA because its\u2019 an outstanding vehicle and the value, the performance is I think just set the new bar and then the affordability I think is something we\u2019re really proud of and is very true to the Chevrolet brand. So I will just share with you we look at a variety of things as we move forward, but we recognize the strength of the core brands right now we\u2019re focusing and getting the CA out and then the other variants including the convertible. So, very excited about that product and what it will for us.","Adam Jonas","I appreciate it. Then I won\u2019t ask about electric core that either right now, we can say that for later. Finally then just you mentioned on China, I think when you were talking about 2020 expect that China that we\u2019re headwind. Can you elaborate a little bit more there on what was the market, what was the volume assumption or mix or price assumption within that, any other color on the China headwind, if I got that correctly for 2020 versus 2019? Thanks everybody.","Mary Barra","Yes. Adam, I think it\u2019s early to call it, I mean there is so much going on right now as you look at the volatility in China, look at where we\u2019re still in the middle of where we\u2019re trying to understand where the trades stocks are going to land and how that\u2019s going to impact the overall economy. So, we are seeing a vital environment and we\u2019re also seeing a lot of pricing pressures. And then as we look forward as we rollout more EVs, initially we\u2019re going to see some margin headwind there. So, I think when you look at all those things in 2020, we\u2019ll have more color for that as we do that February earnings call for Q4, but those are the things that we\u2019re seeing right now that we think we\u2019ll carry into 2020.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman of JP Morgan.","Ryan Brinkman","Could you provide an update in terms of the impact of the new labor accord on your downturn resiliency in North America? Can you remind us of your latest estimate of North America breakeven expressed in terms of U.S. light vehicle SAR and whether the contract changes that breakeven while?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yes. Ryan, what we\u2019ve previously talked about is the breakeven level of 10 million to 11 million units for the U.S. This contact will not change that and how wide that is, is basically the comment that Mary made about productivity and other efficiencies offsetting the economics of the contract will certainly blame to that.","In addition to that from a flexibility standpoint what we\u2019ve model in our downturn assumption is the ability to adjust the level of workforce based on what\u2019s happening in the industry. And a certain levels of supplement unemployment benefits to go with that and that just not change based on this contract which is primarily the driver the maintaining the downturn assumption of where they are.","Ryan Brinkman","And I was encouraged in the release that you attributed the software banned industry sales in China to demand, to lower demand for your outgoing products. Could you please provide us an update on the income and products in China like earlier in the year you were relatively optimistic about the sales and prospect potential from new launches including the first office, I think so called GEM Architecture. Can you talk about how the sales and cost of the launch vehicles has extended relative to your expectation in China? And then finally it would be great if you could update us with regards to the extent which you have or have not detected any perceived bias against U.S. based brands and the aftermath trade or other attentions in that market?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Sure, sure. And Ryan first of all, we haven\u2019t really seeing and we monitored that we really haven\u2019t seen any negative settlement. So we think that\u2019s very positive. And we are in the middle of the launches for the year. We had 11 majors including the Buick, which is a battery electric vehicle, the Buick Encore, Buick Encore GX, the Chevrolet Onix, the Chevrolet Trailblazer, and Tracker and then the Cadillac XT6 and then some Baojun products as well. And then, there were several very important MCMs with across Buick [indiscernible] as well as the Chevrolet Monza and the Cadillac XT5.","So I think as you look at all of those vehicles into a market with the uncertainty and the economic issues or the macro issues in China, and say they're all on track, you were correct to note that we did have our first of Chevrolet Onix, which is the global family. It's one of many launches in China and it is on track. However, we did mentioned in my remarks that it is doing exceptionally well in South America because it's at the heart of the market and the biggest segment.","So, I think we need to see these vehicles get into the marketplace. And I think a lot we'll see as we get into next year as well, but the launches are on track. I do think, though, and some of them, as we did see a more significant drop off than we thought we would with the outgoing vehicle.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, hi, good morning. This is Steven [indiscernible] on for Brian Johnson. Just wanted to drill that down on the potential recoup, some of the loss production took on the T1 pickup truck side in the 2020. I guess assuming kind of an overall stable large pickup market into 2020. Is it fair to say that GM is already running at max capacity? And that's from a production schedule standpoint tentatively, as you think about 2020 is really no pretension that make up that loss production, especially if we get upside with large pick up market? Or is there any kind of scope so we can work as we think through 4Q and into 2020?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yes, I would say that your assumption is correct in an industry level and a truck penetration level that similar to what we have today, where we already have scheduled, we can time and a lot of other overtime. On a regular basis, we have these plans working max overtime. So, the ability to add additional days is limited. We will obviously try and find any voluntary opportunities to do overtime beyond that, but it's not something I would call my baseline at this point.","Unidentified Analyst","Understood, thanks for the clarification. And then in terms of the revised UAW contract impact, we outside in kind of got you about $115 million gross labor inflationary impact in 2020 ramping up to about 350 in 2023. Just wondering, if that's kind of ballpark correct, and then also can you quantify the buckets of the dollar savings offsets some attrition buyouts absenteeism and other productivity initiatives?","Mary Barra","Yes, yes, I think we -- given I said more broadly is that we really believe the inclinatory elements of the contracts or the economics that we can offset with productivity and there is plans well established. We don't know yet exactly how the special attrition program is going to play out. People have till the end of the year and find out for that. So I think what you here from us though as a team that is committed to finding the right offsets to go forward and maintain and improve our competiveness.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, just in terms of the gross inflationary labor cost in fact was that, is that ballpark directionally correct in terms of $100 million in 2020 ramping up 350 in 2023?","Mary Barra","Well, I mean, I think if you look at that, there's some parts of the contract, they're easy to do the math on. And but I think there's others that, we will look to see how it plays out. And some of that depends on the workforce, depend on how many people take the special attrition program, depends on the industry as we go forward, so I'm not going to put projections that far out.","Unidentified Analyst","And then, just a last clarification question. In terms of the revised transformational restructuring savings, the $4 billion to $4.5 billion, does that include the productivity initiatives you've outlined? Or would that potentially provide some upside to get back to the original target of $4.5 billion?","Mary Barra","I think first we're going to work to offset and then we're going to keep going, we won't stop when we get there. So I think over time, there's upside, especially, and the broader elements we've talked about how we continue to improve, how we design vehicles that affect the demand, your manufacturing costs and our ability to continue to build quality institution and improve our quality system.","So all those things are going to contribute and although we revived it based on the decision we made, largely related to Detroit-Hamtramck. We're going to continue to push the organization to continue to find cost opportunities. And I would say that's the goal we set for the end of 2020. It's not like after that we stop. At that point, we'll evaluate the business and look for the next round of cost savings that we can drive into the business and commit to from an improving shareholder value perspective.","Operator","Your next question comes from a line of Dan Levy with Credit Suisse.","Dan Levy","Just wanted to follow up on the question on this productivity gains. Could you give us some color on what initiatives you might be able to pursue or timing? And more specifically, you've obviously been pretty successful with cost saves in the past. I think probably one of the reasons why your earnings level has been rather elevated. Just wondering how much the low hanging fruit may already be exhausted. And you're going to have to dig in a little harder and it's not going to be as easy to some of these gains?","Mary Barra","Well, I think, when we look at our comparison that Harbour or I guess, if Oliver Wyman does from productivity. We still have opportunities to improve. And it's not just, minutes per hour of and the way we design a job, it's much broader than that. And I think we have a lot of opportunities to tap into as we really optimize our complexity and we leverage reuse. And so, those are things that I'm very pleased that the organization has taken to a new level this year, and that will play out over multiple years because a lot of it is if you design the vehicle for design for manufacturer ability, doing that now will play out in years, when we actually launched the vehicle be it two, three, four years from now.","And don't underestimate the work that we've been doing on built-in quality level four, because for the plants that are already there, we definitely see just the fact that more vehicles are built in station means they spend, no time and repair. And that's that savings as well. So I believe, although I'm very proud of the manufacturing team of what they've already accomplished, and working across with the engineering organization, I think there's still much more to tap into and that's what we do.","Dan Levy","And then just as a second question, one that's more existential and sort of touching on one of the prior questions. Obviously, one of your publically stated goals, zero emissions future and that's probably requires a smaller footprint and what you have in place today. So first of all, does this current agreement have any limitations on specifying limitations on what you can build for EVs? And then just more broadly with your zero mission future roll, how aligned is your labor partner with you on this goal? Will they ever service partners with you along this transition. Sort of similar to what we see in Europe and Germany to addressing or future or is there interest simply look this is a four year agreement and once it expires than we\u2019ll deal with the future as it comes?","Mary Barra","Well, I think in this Europe agreement we are dealing with the future, if we look at from an EB perspective we already build the Chevrolet Bolt EV in our Orion plant in Michigan, very significant discussions that we had as it relates to the battery electric truck with our UAW as it relates to what we\u2019re going to do to tracking and trading. So, I think what we\u2019re trying to do is, and first of all, there is no limitation. So I want to make that very, very clear, but we are committed to the United States and committed to manufacturing in the United States.","We see a huge opportunity adding electrification and that's why we\u2019re investing and I think in among the leaders in the EV space. I think we are technology roadmaps that we have for sale development, we\u2019re going to well position that and with the equipments we\u2019ve made for the better are next generation or architecture which we call the BEV3. So, this was all part of the discussions and I think as signifies but what we\u2019re doing in Orion and what we\u2019ll be doing into Detroit-Hamtramck.","Dan Levy","I guess more specifically you have other engine and transmission plans out there that presumably in an EV world are deemed unnecessary. Has there been any sort of discussions with the union in the future on how to deal with these plans that could potentially beyond necessary?","Mary Barra","Yes. I think that\u2019s over a very long horizon. We still see, you know, even when you look at the multitude of projections by 2030, is it 15%, is it 30% all in, that means the bells of the vehicles being sold in the country into rail combustion engine vehicles. We\u2019re well position because we\u2019ve renewed all those architectures and we\u2019ve invested in very efficient instead of combustion engine technology that will continue to improve.","So, I think this is going to play out over a number of years and there are components in the drive unit from an EV perspective that needs to be build somewhere. So, I think we\u2019re looking to do the right thing from a company perspective to drive shareholder value to leading EVs and do the right things for our manufacturing footprint and for our employees.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank.","Emmanuel Rosner","I was hoping you can provide a little bit more color on your underlying performance this year excluding the strike to the extent that's possible? Your, the revised guidance just and then you add backs sort of this strike impact seems to be fix it 60 to 80 maybe the lower end of to reflect original guidance. Is there anything? Are there any like specific factors that you see that are playing that maybe on the softer end of what you have expected before? I mean again, excluding strike, is it at the international? Or is it China? Is there anything you\u2019re seeing in the U.S. that would account for that? And as part of that question also just trying to understand better the tax rate impact, the new guidance is at the lower tax rate, is that correct?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yes. So, number of questions there, so let me address them one-by-one. The new guidance $4.50 to $4.80, you\u2019re correct, we've subtracted the $2 and arrived at, so it\u2019s the original guidance we gave in January less $2 on the upper end we clipped it by $0.20 as you\u2019ve seen we\u2019ve -- its\u2019 been quite a volatile environment in China as well as the microeconomic of volatility we\u2019re seeing in South America as well the FX environment that we saw earlier in the year, when we gave our guidance was very different from the FX picture that we have today, which is offsetting some of that as well.","So I would say that the weakness is predominantly more on the international front, the volatility that we're seeing. And from a North America perspective as it seeing the performance quarter after quarter, it continues to be strong. From a just from the tax rate perspective, the revised rate is primarily because the strike impact is you got to apply the U.S. tax rate to that strike impact, which is about 25% effective tax rate, that we're applying there. So if you take our original tax guidance, subtract out the higher tax rate that's applicable on our strike impact, you get to your UN revised tax guidance. So it's consistent. It's just that you're applying a different tax rate than the weighted average tax rate on the strike impact.","Emmanuel Rosner","Okay, that's great color. And then just I was hoping can you give a little bit more color on the puts and takes for 2020. And in particular, a few discrete items, you're talking about downtime and ramp up for the full size SUV, anything you're able to quantify in terms of specifically in the downtime there? And then you did not mention raw materials as a potential tailwind, I was curious if you can give an update on what is represent this year and then how to think about it for next year? And then the sort of discrete items would be warranty, obviously a fairly big charge which you explained, for the quarter. Does that have a carryover impact as we move into next year?","Dhivya Suryadevara","So, on the 2020 side, the puts and takes that I gave predominantly, a lot of industry uncertainty around the globe, that's what I would characterize as a primary headwind. From a downtime standpoint, this is a complicated SUV full size SUV launch. There's a significant amount of change that's happening from the current generation to the next generation.","So from a downtime perspective as well as more importantly, the line rate ramp up post the downtime, we're anticipating an additional headwind year-over-year, for full size SUVs. I don't want to quantify that now since we're still working on how we can optimize the number of units that we're going to be able to put out in 2020. So I will quantify that further in February. But it is safe to assume that there will be a year-over-year headwind from a full size SUV perspective.","There will also be higher depreciation. That's something has been consistent with in the past several quarters as our depreciation caches up to our CapEx level and we've been seeing a secular increase every single year. And that's going to continue into 2020 as well. And obviously this is non-cash, if you will know.","From a raw material and tariff perspective to your point, I said this before in prior quarters, there's puts and takes, it's hard to look at just one number and paint it all with the same brush. But steel and aluminum we have seen tailwinds offset by precious metals, tariff as well as fuel costs, which impacts our logistic spend.","And so net-net, we are still at 500 million year-over-year headwind from a 2019 standpoint, we don't see that moderating, necessarily into 2020, since the headwinds that I mentioned are likely to continue into 2020. And it's obviously hard to predict the tariff environment that we're going to be in.","So that's generally the headwind, tailwinds the remaining cost saving so far, we've achieved close to $2.4 billion of cost savings and the remaining cost savings are going to be realized over a period of time, according to our revised guidance. You're going to have a full year of heavy-duty trucks and the product launches that I talked about. Hopefully this gives you some color.","And finally on the warranty question that you had, we do see that a specific to Q3 of this year, I don't see a tail event into 2020 on that.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Chris McNally with Evercore.","Chris McNally","Just wanted to jump in on maybe the impact from a working capital standpoint on the change and the free cash flow guide? So just really quick of the 5.5, it looks like 2.8 was worse than just the operations. You back out the CapEx, it looks like something like a $3.5 billion or $4 billion drain on working capital. Can you just confirm that it was all working capital and there's not any other sort of one time drivers for the cash flow because we're trying to think about the reversal next year?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yes, I would say that your EBIT impact seems to be on the low end maybe you're talking about the net income impact so from an EBIT prospective set up for, you going to talk about growth number there. That, plus the working capital unwind, constitutes most of the 5.5. There's no other like one time item or whatever else that's out there but the profit impact that you talked about us that sounds a little understated but it's potentially because of tax rate.","Chris McNally","And then if we could talk about the without giving numbers like when we think about the reversal at some time in the first half. I know you want to give guidance, but could you just sort of walk through the timing of how that would play out from an inventory standpoint?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Are you talking about the reversal of working capital or the recovery of profits or both?","Chris McNally","The reversal of working capital?","Dhivya Suryadevara","So, reversal of working capital, we think that the low point is probably going to be sometime in November, as we cycle to the rest of the unwind, and payables and receivables will start back up 15 days after we start shipping, that cadence will continue. So we do anticipate that you think part of the recovery in the second half of November and into the December. And Q1, as you know, it tends to be a negative cash quarter because of our shutdown and the reversal after that. But what you would see from a cash balance standpoint is that recovery starting in the second quarter of next year, into the rest of 2020.","Chris McNally","That's perfect on the timing. And then maybe this is more of like a from a communication standpoint. I mean 2020 was already supposed to be sort of a better free cash flow year. I think we asked that question a couple of different times on the call. But you're already getting improvement of CapEx the reduction attention from a cash flow and income statement and then the FinCo dividend. If we get this working capital benefit in 2020, is it the type of thing that you will actually be able to call out, so that we can start to understand what is the true because working capital wasn't one of the working, one of the benefits that we were expecting in 2020 and 2021, which likely will now be sort of core operation? So is that something that you could fact out for the street as we go into 2020 and 2021?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yes, we will be very clear about how much of our 2020 free cash flow guidance comes from the working capital rewind and we will also be clear about how much of the cash based earnings i.e., the operating cash flow if you will and what that is year-over-year. So from a communication standpoint we\u2019re certainly be clear about that and beyond that you\u2019re right we don\u2019t want to take much more about magnitude of that until February.","Operator","Thank you. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing comments.","Mary Barra","Thank you very much and thanks everybody for participating this morning. If you look for several years, the team at General Motors has been making tough decision to make our business more resilient and more agile. This discipline will help us overcome the impact of this strike we continue launching our heavy-duty trucks, the new Cadillac sedan.","And as we move forward, the upcoming launches such as mid engine Corvette and the next generation of full-size SUVs. This leadership team has a proven track record of successfully navigating complex business issues, confronting headwinds and capitalizing on opportunity. And I believe we have the best employees in the industry across the board. They want to work and they come to work every day to do their best. And they want General Motors to succeed and they want to be a part of that successful future.","So as we move forward together, we\u2019re going to continue to build on the strong foundation we\u2019ve laid and share and allow them to share on the future success of the Company. But let me be clear, we\u2019re also working hard to lead in both the core and EV and AV world and creates significant shareholder value. And before I close, I want to let you know that we will host our Capital Markets Day in New York on February 5th, 2020. This year in addition to providing our 2020 outlook, it will include our Q4 and our full year 2019 earnings results. And we\u2019ll share additional details about the Capital Markets Day in the near future.","So thanks everybody very much.

Welcome to the General Motors Company First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. During the opening remark, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, Thursday, April 23, 2015. I would now like to turn the conference over to Randy Arickx, Executive Director of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Randy Arickx","Thanks, operator. Good morning. And thank you for joining us as we review the GM\u2019s financial results for the first quarter of 2015. A press release was issued this morning and the conference call materials are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast and the Internet.","As noted on our earnings conference call announcement, we are changing the format of our earnings calls. Included in a chart set materials published this morning, we\u2019ve included the key take ways from each chart in the notes pages in order to provide color on the results. Our intent is to have a more efficient call with the majority of time allocated to answering your questions.","This morning, Mary Barra, General Motors\u2019 Chief Executive Officer will provide some brief opening remarks and then we\u2019ll open the line for questions from the analyst community.","Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the legend regarding forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language.","In the room today, we also have Chuck Stevens, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Tom Timko, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer and Niharika Ramdev, Vice President, Finance and Treasurer, to assist in answering your questions.","Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mary Barra.","Mary Barra","I see that everybody being on the call today. I mean if I \u2013 I mean I can look at our Q1, it was very solid performance and was in line with our expectations and we are on track to achieve our 2015 commitments. Really if I look at the first quarter it was another example of doing what we say we\u2019re going to do. Our revenue was about $35.7 billion, our consolidated EBIT-adjusted was $2.1 billion, our earnings per share adjusted was $0.86 and for the first time we\u2019ve shared our ROIC andover the last four quarters it\u2019s nearly 20%, despite the intact of recall. Finally our adjusted automotive free cash flow was in line with our previous guidance and there was an outflow of $1.7 billion due to three reasons, first, an extra supplier payment, two, restructuring payments, primarily [indiscernible] and then recall-related payments that drove the $1.7 billion outflow.","Also important to note is immediately we have started the share repurchasing after we made the announcement on March 9. And so through yesterday, we had actually repurchased 20 million shares for about $750 million. And that\u2019s an addition to the stock repurchases, we\u2019ve also returned about $5 million to our owners through the dividends in the first quarter. So again it has been a solid start to the year and we believe it provides a very firm foundation for our 2015 commitment to improve our EBIT-adjusted and also to approve our EBIT-adjusted margins versus 2014.","If I just provide a few comments as we go through the world and took at company performance, let\u2019s start with North America. First, our demand for the full-size pickups and SUVs remained very robust. The strong demand for the pickups full-size SUVs and our mid-sized truck help GMNA achieve its seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year EBITDA margin improvement. We also shared some very significant products. In New York we released \u2013 revealed the Malibu, the Spark and the CT6 and we\u2019ve got a very good response on all three of these products the Malibu Spark, again very important segment for us in the car segment. And then with the CT6, it\u2019s very important as it represents a lot of our advanced technology and specifically our material strategy for structures to optimize math, but improve performance. These are very important vehicles that will play a significant role in helping achieve our targets not only for 2015, but for 2016 and they are a part of it. We have more significant launches that we\u2019ll be dealing throughout the year.","If I look at China, the industry does remain strong and we expect the auto industry in China to grow about 6% to 8% in 2016. As expected our results for in Q1 were impacted by product change over and launch cost. The product that we are launching is the Buick Excelle and the Chevrolet Sail 3 and also the Buick Envision. And we also launched a new plant the Buick Excelle is built in our new Wuling plant and this plant will have an annual capacity of 240,000 units, so again very important launches that will fuel our results through the rest of the year.","In Europe, we had improved year-over-year performance and we\u2019ve reduced losses, despite the headwinds in the Russia market. So our total European sales were up 3.1% versus the industry growth of 2.8% and we improved share in 11 European markets. The demand for the Corsa is very strong and we are seeing the variable profit improvement that we talked before we launch this car, so again very good reception in the marketplace for the Corsa.","In South America it remains challenging given the macro economic conditions, especially in Brazil and Venezuela. The company is taking several aggressive actions across all aspects of the business to make sure that we continue to be able to meet our goals. And in GM International, we demonstrated year-over-year performance improvement, we\u2019re narrowing the loss in the first quarter with roughly a $100 million and these are the results of several actions we have taken in the countries that make up GMI.","And finally GM financials continue to grow its active presence among GM details and has successfully rolled out the lease capability and exclusivity with Buick, GMC, Cadillac, and Chevrolet dealers.","Finally, as you\u2019re aware the company provided details of the disciplined capital allocation, our framework and I hope you see that the actions that we\u2019ve taken to change our business model in Russia, the restructured announcements that we talked about in Thailand, in Indonesia demonstrate that we are going continue to make decisions that allow us to allocate capital to generate the right returns for our owners.","If I look at the remainder of 2015, clearly we expect trending robust year-over-year improvement in EBIT-adjusted in our margins in North America, we are on plan to achieve the 10% EBIT adjusted margins for 2015.","In Europe, with the improved year-over-year performance expected to continue, we are on a path for profitability next year. And in China, as I already mentioned we expect results to improve when we look at the new products that we invested in this first quarter and the new plant, we\u2019ll continue to see an expansion in Cadillac and then the \u2013 our launch cost and a change over cost that we incurred will be behind us.","In GMI, we improved the top line performance and are benefiting from the restructuring and we expect to break-even in performance this year excluding restructuring. And finally in South America, the environment is more challenging and has changed rapidly in this first quarter, but as I mentioned we are taking aggressive actions to mitigate this and we expect to improve our profitability, so we are not changing our guidance for South America at this time. We\u2019ve also are reaffirming our guidance for adjusted automotive free cash flow, which is expected to be flat to slightly up, compared to 2014.","So if we look across the business, we are on track to achieve not only our 2015, but our 2016 financial commitments, and 2015 that is to improve our EBIT adjusted in our margins versus 2014 and in 2016 it\u2019s North America EBIT adjusted margins of 10%, but in Europe to profitability and sustain strong margins in China.","So with that, I would like to turn it back to Randy, who has been open it up for questions.","Randy Arickx","Okay operator we are ready when you are.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache","Good morning everybody, can you hear me?","Mary Barra","Hi, Rod.","Rod Lache","Hi, couple of questions. First, in North America, I\u2019m hoping you can give us a little bit more color on your pricing expectations kind of that a high level. Obviously, you\u2019re going to start comping [ph] against the strong pricing from the trucks right now. So it looks like the tough pricing on the 700,000 or 800,000 cars and small crossovers that you sell is starting to come through. You did say in your comments that you think that\u2019s going to improve as the cars get renewed.","Skeptic would say that improvements in passenger car pricing from new products really, it just won\u2019t lacks very long, because the segments over capacitize in facing currency advantage to competitors. Do you see something different there that makes you feel like that could be sustainably improved once the products launch?","Chuck Stevens","Yes, Rod let me talk about Q1 pricing first from a North American prospect and make sure there is some clarity around the $600 million headwind. But first that\u2019s primarily cars, clearly the carryover pricing includes whatever carryover impact there was from full-size trucks and SUV, but that\u2019s relatively marginal. About one-third of that $600 million is retail-related and it\u2019s primarily related to the passenger cars that we\u2019re going to be launching or replacing here over the 12 months to 18 months.","About two-thirds of that $600 million is fleet specific and wants a bit of explanation. We\u2019re in a unique situation where we had a significant volume of past model vehicles going to auction in the first quarter of 2015, up about 50,000 units, versus the first quarter of 2014. And this is caused by recall events where we prioritize customer repairs over fleet resulting and carrying inventory longer. So had passed in our vehicles that we carried longer into the cycle and clearly as option values dropped the longer you go in a model that had an impact. Our expectation is it that we\u2019re going to strike a lot of this in the first half of the year.","Talking about the year in total, we still expect pricing and retail overall to be relatively flat for the year. Carryover pricing headwinds will be offset by our new major launches later in the year. And a portion of that obviously will be the impact of our next generation products like the Malibu that we\u2019re going to be launching. On the bigger question that you asked on, do we expect pricing to able to hold on new model launches? We have one proof-of-point so far and that\u2019s the Corsa in Europe as an example where we sid the next generation because it\u2019s significantly better vehicle than one it replaced, would generate incremental profitability and thus far that\u2019s holding. When you look at the next generation Malibu we\u2019ve got a larger car than the one that is replacing, you\u2019ve got a car that weighs 300 pounds less and drives significantly higher fuel economy. And our expectation is for that car and others is we\u2019re well over the Chevrolet portfolio that we will be able to hold back price when we have clearly segment-leading vehicles that we\u2019re launching into the market.","Rod Lache","The content costs are starting to turn positive here, does that start to moderate when these new launches kick-in, is there significant amount of additional content there?","Chuck Stevens","Well, there will be more content in the next-generation vehicles. Based on our assessment we will be able to price to recover that. What you\u2019re seeing especially in North America, but also globally the material performances on carry over models. We have $300 million in the first quarter, run rate that for the rest of the year that\u2019s $1.2 billion, globally. We\u2019re very much on track to that $2 billion of savings that we talked about in October and January from our carry over material performance perspective.","Rod Lache","Okay, and then just two more China there\u2019ve been quite a few reports about some softening and deterioration in pricing in the luxury end. You\u2019re not really mentioning that. I was hoping you can comment there. And then lastly, in Europe, last year, you took almost $700 million of restructuring. Assuming that the doesn\u2019t recur and you get some savings from Bochum and from the new products, well, do you think the year-over-year improvement this year in Europe could be greater than that $700 million?","Mary Barra","So, first, on the China pricing question, I mean, it continues to be a very competitive pricing environment across all markets. And then we just returned \u2013 we had the whole executive leadership team in China. We\u2019re at the show. I think you\u2019re seeing some very capable OEMs. So, we expect that to continue. And that\u2019s built into the forecast in our plan, so not unexpected.","Chuck Stevens","And relative to Europe, as we talked about before, yes we expect to see improvement in 2015 versus 2014 on our path to breakeven. We indicated that it wouldn\u2019t be a straight line, and that the biggest driver of that improvement year-over-year would be the absence of restructuring. I think you\u2019re seeing that play out in the Q1 results, but also, we would have launched costs associated here in the first half year with the Corsa and then the back half of the year with the Astra. And then once we cycled through that and headed into 2016, you would see the full benefit of the Corsa and Astra, which represents about half the volume in Europe really driving improved profitability.","Rod Lache","Thank you.","Operator","All right. And your next question will come from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John Murphy","Good morning, guys.","Chuck Stevens","Good morning.","John Murphy","Just a first question, Chuck, to follow-up on the hit that you got from the rental car auction number here, it sounds like it was about $400 million. On an after-tax basis, that would be about $0.17 a share if we just applied your tax rate and your share count. Is that about right and that is in the ballpark and that is something you might expect to recur in the second quarter, but then not in the third and the fourth? I am just trying to understand the magnitude of the impact to the bottom line, as well as the reoccurrence or lack thereof.","Chuck Stevens","Yes, first, I would start out by looking at overall North American results. And in North America, in the first quarter, we generated $2.2 billion of profitability and 8.8% EBIT margins, which is, again, some straight quarter up 110 basis points on a quarter-over-quarter basis versus the first quarter of last year so, clearly, on the path to 10% margins. If you look at a specific driver of Q1 impact, clearly, the auction impacted our Q1 results. But in the overall framework of North American results, it was offset elsewhere. Yes, we expect to cycle through this as we go through the second quarter, would expect that magnitude of impact to be lower.","And then, finally, John, within \u2013 this was not an unexpected outcome from a North American perspective, as we provided guidance for 2015 and looked at our business. But this is certainly an issue that we\u2019re factoring into our outlook, which, once again, higher aggregate EBIT and higher margins in 2015 versus 2014.","John Murphy","Okay, but if I am doing my math correctly, absent that, your margin was about 10.4% in North America, which is pretty strong and a little bit better than what you are even talking about getting to. Just kind of backing that out, which it actually happened, so it is tough to back it out\u2026.","Charles Stevens","Yes. That...","John Murphy","But the ongoing number looks pretty strong.","Chuck Stevens","Certainly have a hard time arguing with your math on that one driver of the business for sure.","John Murphy","Okay. And then just a second question. I just got back from Shanghai as well and we met with SAAC, as well as VW and they did highlight the risk to pricing, but they also highlighted the fact that you, as well as Volkswagen, as well as most of the international players, are pretty tight on capacity utilization. So it just seems a little bit curious that the pricing is getting pretty weak over there. So just trying to understand, are you seeing the local players becoming much more credible in the market in creeping up and pressuring pricing? I\u2019m just trying to understand where the pricing pressure is coming from with CAPUT that sounds like it\u2019s pretty tight.","Chuck Stevens","Yes. And looking at capacity utilization, it\u2019s kind of a tale of two different dynamics. One the foreign OEMs are running 90-plus percent capacity utilization. The locals are running at about 70%. And I would suggest that the capability from a local [indiscernible] and you were there, so you saw it. It\u2019s certainly improving. But the pricing dynamics that we\u2019ve seen and that we\u2019re anticipating this year, negative 3-plus percent net price on carryover, that\u2019s the same dynamic that we saw last year and the year before. The market\u2019s slowing. There\u2019s a lot of competition. It\u2019s maturing.","Importantly, what we said, and recognizing that that was a headwind, was our launch strategy, more SUVs coming into the market, Cadillac, and continued cost efficiency was going to offset those pricing headwinds and enable us to maintain margins. And we\u2019re executing that. I\u2019ll give you an example, the Envision. It has just been outstanding performance since we launched that as well as the Chevrolet Trax, and when we look at crossovers and SUVs versus passenger cars, they\u2019re more profitable by $1,000 and $1,500 a car.","So, I think the pricing dynamic is going to continue to be challenging. In China, we\u2019re planning around it being challenging, but we\u2019re executing to the plan that\u2019s going to offset that.","John Murphy","Okay that\u2019s helpful. Then on free cash flow, negative $1.7 billion. I\u2019m just curious though if you can outline what the exact numbers are for the extra week of supplier payments? And then as we think about the recall and restructuring cash used in the quarter, if you can just of delineate those three items for us just so we can understand.","Chuck Stevens","Sure. Yes. The extra payment cycle was worth roughly $1.9 billion, and that\u2019s a typical cycle payment that we have. The recall and restructuring combined about $800 million, $400 million each for the year. What we had talked about before was roughly $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion of recall-related cash, so we\u2019re kind of on run rate for that as I think about the rest of the year and restructuring cash payments north of $1 billion for the year. And I think as you run through the rest of the year, that will start to diminish as we cycle through Bolcom [ph] and some of the other ones. But that\u2019s kind of broad strokes, John.","John Murphy","So, horseshoes and hand grenades, it was basically more like a $1 billion positive free cash flow quarter if you adjust for those numbers. That\u2019s just our numbers.","Chuck Stevens","Yes. If I look at it on an apples-to-apples basis versus the first quarter of last year and excluded some \u2013 the extra payment cycle and the restructuring recall, I ended up with the same math you did.","John Murphy","Okay. And then just lastly, the buyback, you guys are being reasonably aggressive in the market and the pay seems to be a lot faster. It seems to be a bit faster than we would have expected. Is there any potential that you\u2019ll blow through this buyback during the course of this year and we seen an up-sizing by the end of this year or the beginning of next year?","Chuck Stevens","Well, when we announced the initial share buyback, what we said was within the context of the capital allocation framework, one, we wanted to get to our target cash balance of $20 billion as quickly and prudently as possible.","And depending upon other contingencies, unknown issues that could result in acceleration of our share, we\u2019d like to buy back the shares as quickly as possible, but I think you need to factor it into the $20 billion target cash level and how other things develop.","We will monitor it, John, very closely on a month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter basis as we go through the year. And another important point, what we said was an initial $5 billion share buyback. So, depending on execution, we would expect this to be the first tranche.","John Murphy","Thank you. And what your shares are doing today, it seems like it will be a great time to accelerate it. But I appreciate the help. I appreciate the help, guys. Thank you.","Chuck Stevens","As soon as we exit the window period, perhaps.","John Murphy","Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi.","Itay Michaeli","Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Mary Barra","Good morning.","Itay Michaeli","Just want to start with South America. Maybe a little bit more color on some of the actions you\u2019re taking that give you confidence you can still meet the full-year plan. And then, secondly, on the FX hit for the quarter, was that a balance sheet measurement? Want to get a little bit more color on that FX impact.","Mary Barra","Sure. If you look at South America, the team has moved very proactively. Looking at all aspects of our cross-structure, there\u2019ll be production cuts. And in line with that, we\u2019ll look at our labor costs, there\u2019s already active programs going on as it relates to our salaried workforce, and the appropriate adjustments will be taken from an hourly as well, and again very significantly. And then, I would say it\u2019s really a detailed approach of looking at every single cost, a zero-based budget approach looking at indirect purchasing initiatives where everything is questioned. So, they have really gone to, I say, a very austerity approach.","The other element on the revenue side is the price as appropriate because even though the market has shrunk dramatically, we still have a very strong portfolio, and are getting our share and a little bit higher share growth, it\u2019s just the market is so much smaller. So, they\u2019re looking at every aspect and cost element of the business, building on what they\u2019ve done over the last two years.","Chuck Stevens","And on your foreign exchange question, Itay, which aspect are you asking about the impacts on revenue or the EBIT [indiscernible]?","Itay Michaeli","The $200 million EBIT, Chuck.","Niharika Ramdev","Yes. Fundamentally, that\u2019s transaction exchange. And the biggest driver of that, the ruble in Russia, the real in Brazil. And then, we have a one euro interaction where the euro was weakening faster than the won and we still import a certain number of vehicles into Europe. Largely, on the ruble and real side of it, we\u2019re trying to offset that with price. That\u2019s why you saw that improved EBIT performance on year-over-year basis. But that\u2019s fundamentally worth that.","Itay Michaeli","Great. And then a question on the product cycle. One of the increasingly popular disclosures in your 10-K is the variable profit by segment that highlights cars, crossovers and trucks relative to the weighted average. I think it was about 40% for cars last year. As we think about the next couple of years, maybe first do you have an early rough estimate of what that might be this year for cars and maybe where that was historically in the last time you refreshed some of the small and midsize cars?","Tom Timko","Yes. We haven\u2019t changed our outlook on that, 160, 140. I believe 2010, 2011 timeframe, it was closer to 50, 100, 150, as we went into that launch cadence of the current generation of vehicles. I personally haven\u2019t looked at the dynamics associated with this as we go through the launch cycle, but I would certainly expect those gaps to narrow on a go-forward basis based on our expectations on the next-generation product. But clearly, trucks and full-sized SUVs are always going to be most profitable, crossovers are going to be close to the average. And passenger cars, on a relative basis, are going to be least profitable just because you have all the small and compact vehicles in there.","Itay Michaeli","Great. And I\u2019d love to get an update too, Chuck, on raw material costs. We\u2019ve seen steel prices continue to come down. Any incremental benefit that you might see from raw materials this year and at what point, if raw mats stay where they are today, might you begin to lock in some savings for 2016?","Chuck Stevens","Yes, we expect right now, based on our view on raw materials were to be relatively neutral on a year-over-year basis, there\u2019s puts and takes. Steel, resins and other raw commodity prices are down. Aluminum, some rare metals, rare metals are up. And again, you have to look at what\u2019s indexed versus what\u2019s tied to specific supply agreements. But broad strokes, I view that as relatively flat on a year-over-year basis. Relative to raw material, I would say this, and we talked about it before. As we were looking at 2015 versus 2014, we thought commodity pricing was going to be a headwind. Now, we view it as more neutral. And I\u2019ve indicated that it\u2019s several $100 million, not billions of dollars but several $100 million of the tailwind.","Itay Michaeli","Great. So, that\u2019s incremental. Okay. Great. That\u2019s all I had. Thanks so much, everyone.","Chuck Stevens","Thank you.","Mary Barra","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Michael Ward for Sterne, Agee.","Michael Ward","Good morning.","Mary Barra","Hi.","Michael Ward","Thank you for taking my question. Two questions, first on Russia, I think if you include FX, it looks \u2013 sounds like it accounted for about $100 million loss in the quarter. Can you talk a little bit about the timing of the shutdown and when we might see some of those costs taking out of the pre-tax calculation?","And the second thing on GM financial, I assume the equity line that we see now in the GM financial results is from the Chinese joint ventures. Is that joint venture in China similar to the automotive? Is it a self-funded joint venture and it\u2019s an after-tax impact?","Chuck Stevens","Okay. Yes. First on Russia. No. That was your math on the $100 million. I would suggest out of the losses in Europe, there\u2019s a fairly significant Russian headwind in the first quarter. I don\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m not going to provide specifics. But I would suggest as we go through the rest of the year, there\u2019s going to be some roll-through impact in Q2, Q3 and Q4 on a diminishing basis as we wind that operation down and then we should get the benefit absent to those losses in 2016. And on GMF, yes, that equity that\u2019s included in GMF is the joint venture now in China.","Michael Ward","Okay. And is that a self-funded joint venture or can they fund themselves?","Chuck Stevens","Yes. It\u2019s a self-funded joint venture. And that is at least from the equity perspective after-tax in China rolling in to our equity line in GMF.","Michael Ward","And can we expect similar type performance or expect it to grow as it gains some share?","Chuck Stevens","Well, our initial view is we would expect that to grow because the market is going to grow and more and more people, as the market matures, are going to start financing vehicles. We\u2019re penetrating right now at about 20% of SGM sales, and we would expect to see it grow over years. So, that\u2019s certainly one of the strategic initiatives that we have.","Michael Ward","Thanks, Chuck. I appreciate it. Thanks, everybody.","Chuck Stevens","Thanks, Mike.","Mary Barra","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question will come from Matt Stover with FIG.","Matt Stover","First question is, during the quarter, you folks announced that you are considering increasing capacity on SUVs in North America. I'm wondering if you could address two things in this. One, what is the scope of the increase that you would envision? And number two, how do you think about this internally increasing the capacity of the product once you are getting such terrific yield when maybe in a longer-term perspective, the regulatory environment that could emerge post-2020, that might make that addition excessive?","Mary Barra","Yes. So when you look at the full-size truck capacity, so right now, our primary focus is on breaking bottlenecks, not only in our plants but also in supplier plants to make sure that we\u2019re providing not only the maximum capacity without installing any new brick-and-mortar because I think there\u2019s still a lot that we can do there, but also get the mix to be exactly what customers are looking for.","And so, we have a very \u2013 a dedicated team that works on that. We\u2019ve already made tremendous progress. And I know you asked about full-size trucks, I will say though that in mid-size trucks, we are \u2013 because of strong demand for both the mid-size truck and the vans adding the third shift to Wentzville again, focusing on what we can do without capital and spending brick-and-mortar. So it\u2019s really a breaking bottleneck strategy and then the shipped addition in Wentzville.","Matt Stover","Do think you could add 10% to the capacity of this facility?","Chuck Stevens","Which facility? Are you talking about full-size pickup and...","Matt Stover","Full-size. Full-size.","Chuck Stevens","We\u2019re running pretty close to max line rate capacity. We\u2019ve got opportunities from overtime perspective. And we will continue to look at efficiencies. At a system level, we\u2019ve got capacity to meet demand from a trucks standpoint, a 17-plus-million industry at a 12.5%, 12.6% segment share. So, I think we\u2019re in pretty good shape overall. And same thing from a full-size SUV, a segment share that\u2019s running at 2.5% to 2.6% of industry.","And as Mary indicated, our intention is to not to add necessarily fixed capital investment like brick and mortar. It is really to optimize where we can in the supply base and assembly. With the \u2013 and by the way, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing over the last number of years. No brick and mortar. We add shifts. We continue to drive line rate efficiencies. And we\u2019ll continue to look at that as well.","Matt Stover","The second question is on international operations. Over the course of the last few years, you guys have restructured Australia and in this year, Thai and Indonesia. There is one more big operation there that seems to need some fixing. I'm wondering if we should expect to see something in Korea in 2015 or 2016, or is that just a putt that is too long.","Chuck Stevens","We continue to work to optimize and drive efficiency in all of our operations. And Korea is one where we have that opportunity on a go-forward basis. In the 2015 plan and in the restructuring that we talked about already included in our plan is a small portion related to Korea on a variable separation program. And that\u2019s just an ongoing activity we do there. But I would \u2013 certainly will not expect any significant restructuring in Korea in the near term.","Matt Stover","Okay thanks very much.","Chuck Stevens","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the Emmanuel Rosner with CLSA.","Emmanuel Rosner","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Mary Barra","Good morning.","Emmanuel Rosner","I have a question on mix, both in China, as well as in North America, but starting with China, a lot of the noise that is, I guess, coming out of China now is that a decent amount of the growth in demand comes from the lower end, essentially a recovery in demand at the cheaper or Chinese made minivans or small SUVs. I wanted to know if you are seeing that in your numbers with either Wuling outperforming or the growth of Wuling outperforming the rest of your brands and if that constitutes a negative mix impact that we should look into. And at the same time, I would like an update on how Cadillac \u2013 where you are in the rollout there in terms of volume numbers and if that is offsetting some of the mix impact.","Mary Barra","So, let\u2019s start with China and especially, if you look at the lower end, what we\u2019ve seen, first off, we have SGM Wuling, it\u2019s a very, very strong local competitor. And it has successfully shift from not only a leading in commercial vehicles, but also, the launching very successful passenger vehicles. We have the Baojun 730. It\u2019s a MPV in the C-segment. And it\u2019s quickly becoming one of the best-selling models and its segment. And then, we have a very important launch, the Baojun 560 SUV that is very competitive.","So, I think when you look at the lower end, our Wuling operations have successfully bridged to where the market is going in and looked out ahead of it and are participating in a leading position. So, that\u2019s from a China perspective, I think, is how we\u2019re seeing that opportunity.","Chuck Stevens","Yes. And overall, again, Cadillac, we expect to sell close to 100,000 units in Cadillac this year, up significantly year-over-year in China. And that is part of the overall between the Baojun SUV launches, the SGM SUV launches in Cadillac that we\u2019re going to drag much improved mix, which will offset the pricing headwinds that we talked about before.","Emmanuel Rosner","Okay. And then on the North American operations, excluding recall expense, essentially the biggest driver of your year-over-year improvement seems to be the positive mix, which you attributed to full-size \u2013 to trucks in general. When I look forward at your goals for 2016, how much \u2013 do you rely on mix sourcing just as positive as it is now, or if the mix normalized or the markets were normalizing or the competition heating up in some of these full-size segments. Would you still be able to achieve the midterm goals?","Chuck Stevens","Right. So, let\u2019s talk about Q1 mix for a second. Q1 mix on a year-over-year basis, very robust and it\u2019s consistent with the EBIT bridge and how we talked about 2015 developing. Q1 specifically, very strong full-size SUV mix. But remember, last year, we were launching the full-size SUV. So, we\u2019re at run right now in Q1 versus Q1 last year. So, that\u2019s driving that big mix number. We expect mix to be favorable as we go through the year, but certainly not at the same level as Q1.","Looking forward, in the 2016, the biggest drivers in 2015 to 2016, number one, launching products and segments that we had not historically competed in like the mid-size trucks, like Chevrolet trucks and other products that we haven\u2019t announced yet plus the improved passenger car profitability. So, we certainly don\u2019t anticipate the mix continuing to improve.","And I think it\u2019s important also if you look year-over-year ultimately from a volume perspective between full-size trucks and full-size SUVs, they\u2019ll be up but not significantly up on a year-over-year basis. So, again, strong mix in the first quarter, expect that to moderate as we go through the rest of the year. The real driver of catalyst for earnings improvement in our product perspective will be products that we have not sold before plus the replacement of some of our core Chevrolet portfolio.","Emmanuel Rosner","Perfect. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.","Ryan Brinkman","Hi thanks for taking the call. You mentioned a 20% ROI hurdle as governing some of your strategic actions in recent years, presumably including Australia, Chevrolet Europe, Russia, Indonesia, etc. Now those are places where you are retrenching, right? So I am curious relative to some of the very big investments that you are making like the $12 billion in Cadillac, the $16 billion in China, how you think those investments stack up in terms of return potential.","Chuck Stevens","Yes, let me talk about China first because it\u2019s easier. China is self-funded by the joint venture, so we\u2019re not putting incremental capital, and obviously, that\u2019s absence of dividends we could be taking but I would say that China earned significantly higher return on invested capital because they have very strong margins and a relatively low invested capital base. So, I would suggest that that\u2019s very accretive from an overall perspective.","The $12 billion for Cadillac, that is a kitchen sink number from an investment perspective over the next number of years. It\u2019s not just capital spend. The actual kind of North American or consolidated operations capital spend portion of that\u2019s about 50% of the overall $12 billion or $6 billion relative to the product portfolio. And our expectations are that we\u2019re going to drive better than 20% returns on Cadillac products as we should. They are more profitable than some of our mainstream products.","Ryan Brinkman","Okay. That's great to hear. Then just a couple questions on your cost structure in the United States. Firstly, there was a study recently I think by the Center for Automotive Research, maybe you saw it, that concluded GM had the highest hourly wages amongst Detroit-based manufacturers. They suggested one cause was a lower percentage of tier 2 workers. Is that consistent with your understanding? And then secondly, a Ford executive recently commented that they would look to close this year their cost disadvantage relative to Chrysler. Is that an objective and realistic objective of yours too, to get your cost in line with the competition there?","Chuck Stevens","One, we are not the most expensive or the highest-cost OEM in the U.S. relative to an average cost per hour, so \u2013 and that\u2019s based on Harbor Report data. Two, our objective, and it continues to be our objective, is to continue to drive efficiency and drive our costs, employment costs closer to the overall competitive benchmark. And we will work very, very closely with all the stakeholders including our UAW partners to try to close that gap, but that\u2019s certainly our objective, and it hasn\u2019t changed within the overall constructive, maintaining or improving our breakeven point in North America.","Mary Barra","And we\u2019ve been very clear in all of our conversations that improving our competitiveness is a key item that we\u2019re going to be taking through all of the discussions as we get into negotiations.","Ryan Brinkman","Great. Good to hear there too. And then just lastly, Sergio Marchionne commented recently he was looking for a merger partner for Fiat Chrysler and he mentioned your company, amongst a couple others, as potentially being logical. I think the message from you though in recent years is that you don't need to merge with anyone else, you need to merge with yourself and you don't want to distract from that. But I am curious what your latest thoughts are with regards to strategic partnerships, or even more broadly the likelihood or need for consolidation in this industry.","Mary Barra","So, specifically, about General Motors, I think, we\u2019ve been very clear. We laid out a very comprehensive plan that takes us through the early next decade with milestones next year and beyond. There\u2019s \u2013 as we communicated, we think there\u2019s tremendous opportunity for us within the business as we look at efficiency measures, as we look at truly achieving the scale that we should have, because we\u2019re already in that top tier of the auto industry among the largest OEMs. So, we have a very well-articulated plan. We\u2019re in the middle of the executing that and we\u2019re not going to entertain anything that distracts us from accomplishing that. So, that is the way we look at it and that\u2019s how we\u2019re executing.","If you look more broadly from an industry-consolidation perspective, I mean, there are \u2013 the technologies that we need to invest in from a \u2013 whether it\u2019s from a propulsion perspective, whether it\u2019s some of the new emerging technologies, as we look at connectivity or even different business models as it relates to urban mobility, those are all \u2013 all require investments. We have a plan well in place to accomplish and to be in front of the change that\u2019s going to occur in this industry over the next five to ten years. We\u2019ve already made several significant announcements as it relates to autonomous specifically. And we\u2019re already leading from a connectivity perspective when you look at our deployment of 4G LTE in the United States, which is now moving through Europe and through China. And we have more coming in those spaces, as well.","So, I think there may be some need as other OEMs, states, the change that is happening. But again, we\u2019ve got a very well-developed plan and we\u2019re all 100% focused on execution.","Ryan Brinkman","Perfect. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Spak with RBC Capital Markets.","Joe Spak","Thanks everyone. I guess in the past you\u2019ve talked about, as we go forward here, and I think it is embedded in your plan, having to add more and more content to your vehicles and that being a headwind. And I guess in light of some global competitors announcing a significantly lower cost of entry to features like active safety or in some cases even standardizing it, if you think that trend is happening quicker than you anticipated, if it's on pace and also how you are going to respond competitively?","Mary Barra","Well, I think if you look at it, you have to look at every vehicle by segment to really understand what the customer is looking for because, I think, the key is getting the right technology and function and features on the vehicle by segment by market. And clearly, in the Shanghai 2015 show that we were just at, there is a lot more content being added, but you\u2019ve got to look at the right content again for the segment.","But, I think, again, this is why it\u2019s so important that we continue to execute our strategy. As Chuck mentioned, we\u2019re on track to the $2 billion goal from a material cost. I still think there\u2019s more opportunity as we continue to execute there. Doing that allows us to then have the most efficient cost structure to be able to put the right features and functionality on the vehicles. And that\u2019s our plan.","So, we think we\u2019ve got more opportunity in that area. And we\u2019ll continue to work at it.","Joe Spak","Okay. Are you surprised at all by I guess the pace that you see some people adding content, or it's sort of in line with what you guys were thinking?","Mary Barra","I mean, I think, overall, I\u2019m not surprised by it. I mean, there\u2019s kind of two types of content. There was the content that you have to add from a regulatory perspective, and then there\u2019s the features and functions that, I\u2019ll say, create the customer delight and enthusiasm. And we have aggressive plans for both. I would say the one area where it is moving very quickly is with the domestic OEMs in China, big OEMs , saw that and being very significant. But again, our SGMW, Wuling is right in the middle of that and very much focused on the right content for the vehicles.","Joe Spak","Okay. And then obviously the TPP agreement has been in the news a lot and I was wondering if you were willing to say what GM's stance is? Obviously it's important for auto and if you have any insight to how you think it plays out. Obviously it sounds like maybe the Japanese are looking to get some of the tariffs dropped, but in return maybe there's some language there are about currency manipulation. So any color you could provide there would be helpful.","Mary Barra","Well, generally, General Motors, as I would \u2013 we believe in free trade. And I think our record evidenced that. Again, as you look at this, the key is in the details, clearly, something that puts some controls from \u2013 currency manipulation are important to us, and we\u2019ll continue to evaluate that and work productively to provide input, because, generally, we\u2019re very supportive of a free trade.","Joe Spak","Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Your next question will come from Brian Johnson with Barclays.","Brian Johnson","I just want to follow-up on some of your comments about executing your plan with a question around plans are set, you execute sort of long-term plans, but the market is evolving very rapidly. So I'd like to get a sense just how you as a management team maybe are making midcourse corrections, maybe specifically around three things that have changed even since the investor day. The first is the collapse in oil prices and the impact on really weakening demand in the North American car market. You already talked about your SUV adds.","Second, the deteriorating conditions in Russia and third, how do you pay for the content costs, particularly around connected car, where good news the take rates are accelerating faster than expected? Mixed news is some of the competitors are beginning to price things like 8S quite aggressively?","Mary Barra","I didn\u2019t hear your very last comment as you talked about competitors. I\u2019m sorry.","Brian Johnson","Competitors price to gain as aggressively [ph], so just things that might have been different than when you \u2013 unless you had perfect foresight \u2013 than when you set out your plan.","Mary Barra","Right. But if you could just go through those three items, I think we\u2019ve been very agile in making sure we have the right full-size truck, full-size SUV, midsize truck SUV capacity and capability to put those products in the market and I think you\u2019re seeing us do that. So, we\u2019re going to respond and be opportunistic of what the customer wants to buy. And I have been very aggressive in that space. So, I think we\u2019ve demonstrated that we can adjust there and we\u2019ll continue to do so.","As it relates to Russia, we took actions to change our business model in Russia reacting to this situation in the point that we were at again, wanting to make sure we\u2019re staying true to our capital allocation framework and deploying capital where we are committed to generating the return for our shareholders.","And then as it relates to content, I mean, especially if you look at \u2013 you mentioned connectivity. There\u2019s also revenue opportunity associated with the connectivity, and I think we are just starting to scratch the surface as we look at additional functions that can be accomplished now that we\u2019ve got the pipe into the car and that ability to communicate. And we have several initiatives of new features and functions that we\u2019re going to be putting that utilize that. So, I think there\u2019s a revenue opportunity there.","And then finally, as it relates to the cost piece, again, I think with the \u2013 the plan we have this year for $2 billion in performance, I think we still have more room to go and that\u2019s a GM-specific opportunity that we truly leverage our scale and have the right working relationship with our suppliers across-the-board, longer-term relationships and seize those opportunities.","So, I would say \u2013 I don\u2019t know, Chuck, if you have anything to add to those three.","Chuck Stevens","And to the cost and continuing to drive efficiency. A few weeks ago, I was in New York and talked about across the broad dimensions of the business where we will continue to focus. And clearly, material and logistics is an opportunity that we talked about, Mary talked about. There are still opportunities to drive productivity and efficiency in manufacturing.","And as I indicated, just our productivity on a year-over-year basis from a manufacturing perspective is worth $800 million or $900 million a year. We still are pursuing overhead cost reductions with global business services, our IT transformation that will generate significant savings on a run rate basis.","And then to the opportunities with OnStar connected car, again, I said, just as Mary did, that we are just scratching the surface there. But even so, we had $350 million worth of improved profitability built into our plan based on what we have taken advantage of so far, and I think there\u2019s significant upside to that, as well.","Brian Johnson","Just final question, could you maybe drill down on that in terms of what has already been realized with that $350 million, what the \u2013 you had some categories in the slide deck, but kind of what is already really set in place to collect versus what is going to require either partners in terms of revenue sharing from apps or changing consumer behavior to realize?","Chuck Stevens","Yes. I would like to avoid getting into the details of those specifics and that $350 million improvement. Broad strokes. So, obviously, our agreement with AT&T and revenue-sharing opportunities are, one, avenue of improved earnings.","Number two is vehicle health, maintenance and diagnostics and how that can drive improved warranty customer satisfaction on a go-forward basis is another opportunity. And then, ultimately, the application framework and how you deploy that on a business-to-business and business to consumer standpoint is another opportunity.","But as I said, we\u2019re just scratching the surface. There\u2019s opportunities to leverage GMF [ph] as we grow them to full captive to link in better with our after-sales operations to drive service retention. So, significant opportunities that we\u2019re going to continue to take advantage of.","Brian Johnson","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our final question will come from Dan Galves with Credit Suisse.","Dan Galves","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First one has to do with the new vehicle architectures, which are really important to the outlook. You have already said that we will have increased content, but you expect to price for that. In terms of like-for-like material costs, how much savings can you achieve from globalizing these architectures maybe from a material cost perspective or engineering savings?","Chuck Stevens","Well first, we\u2019re starting to see some of it roll through in last year and this year. Last year, we generated roughly $1.2 billion of material cost performance and carryover, this year, $2 billion. Now with capturing carryover, our recently launched products like the K2XX platform.","As we went forward, remember what we said about the Corsa and the Astra and the next-generation Malibu, and he next-generation Cruise that we expect is roughly one-third of the profit improvement in those vehicles on a variable basis to be coming from material efficiency. And part of that is getting more scale and leverage bringing the suppliers in early.","So, I believe that there is still significant opportunity on go-forward basis as we execute our vehicle set strategy and ultimately get down to a handful of global architectures, so, more to come on that. But I wouldn\u2019t just size it. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the number ultimately ends up being 2% to 3% of material cost in kind of a run rate basis.","Dan Galves","Okay, thanks. And then I have two questions on North America. The first one has to do with truck pricing. Some of the external groups that estimate pricing were reporting pretty large ATP increases on full-size pickups, and particularly the SUVs. Was there evidence in your year-over-year bridge of these increases? I guess was it buried in the $200 million of retail negative, or was this all due to mix or offset by content?","And then the second question relates to North America costs. I think in January, you said that overall costs would be up in 2015 where fixed cost more than offsetting the material cost tailwinds. In Q1, you had a benefit of about $200 million from cost. How does that trend in the balance of 2016? Thank you.","Chuck Stevens","Yes, let\u2019s talk about general pricing from a pickup, full-size SUV. What we talked about and we\u2019re seeing play out versus a relatively aggressive environment in 2014 is a more moderate pricing environment from a full-size pickup and a full-size \u2013 specific to full-size pickups. With that said, we have taken action already. This year, we have raised prices in full-size pickups and full-size SUVs as we look at the opportunities that are being presented. I would expect on a go-forward basis that we would certainly look towards trying to hold some of that.","In other words, kind of the base price increases more than offsetting any increase in incentives. It\u2019s still a bit early in the year. And we actually \u2013 how the market develops, but I\u2019d say overall, the pricing environment is certainly more constructive this year versus last year from a truck and SUV standpoint. What was the second part of your question, Dan?","Dan Galves","Just on the costs, between fixed costs in North America or structural costs in North America and material costs. I think you said in January that overall costs would be up a bit. You had a tailwind in the first quarter between these two items. Just wondering how that trends in the rest of 2015.","Chuck Stevens","Well, I think the material performance is going to trend pretty close to our performance in the first quarter of the year. For the rest of you \u2013 from a kind of fixed cost perspective, our expectation was that engineering, in events of the product launches and marketing, was going to be up on a year-over-year basis. I would still expect that to play out. With that said, we continue to drive the efficiencies in the other parts of the business from a fixed cost standpoint overhead manufacturing.","So, we\u2019ll have to see how that plays out. But generally I would say we are very much in line with the guidance that we provided back in October and in January.","Dan Galves","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot for the color and for the new format of the call. Appreciate it.","Chuck Stevens","Thanks, Dan.","Operator","Thank you. I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to Mary Barra.","Mary Barra","Thank you. So, I\u2019ll be brief here. But I think if you look at it, we had a very solid first quarter. We\u2019ve got a strong foundation to go through the rest of the year. We\u2019re going to continue to build on this positive momentum, and I\u2019ll reiterate that we are on track to achieving our 2015 and 2016 financial commitments. Also, you can see that we are already executing the capital allocation framework, and we\u2019ll continue to do that, as Chuck said, month-by-month to look at what is the right strategy recognizing some of the uncertainties and open items that still need to be resolved. But we\u2019re on track.","And we will continue to look to maintain an investment grade balance sheet and the $20 billion balance and then invest in profitable growth opportunities and then return value to our shareholders. So, we\u2019re continuing to execute our strategies. So, we look forward to talking to you at the end of Q2.","Randy Arickx","Thanks.

Welcome to the General Motors Company Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Wednesday, October 31, 2018.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Rocky Gupta, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations.","Rocky Gupta - General Motors Co.","Thanks, Dorothy. Good morning, and thank you for joining us as we review GM's financial results for the third quarter of 2018. Our press release was issued this morning and the conference call materials are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast.","I'm joined today by Mary Barra, GM's Chairman and CEO; and Dhivya Suryadevara, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO; and a number of other executives.","Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language.","I will now turn the call over to Mary.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Thanks, Rocky, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining. Our performance in the quarter was strong, demonstrating our determination to deliver strong business results in a dynamic environment, while also focusing on the innovation that will drive our work in the future of mobility.","Looking at the numbers, we achieved a net revenue of $35.8 billion, EBIT-adjusted of $3.2 billion, EBIT-adjusted margin of 8.8%, EPS diluted adjusted of $1.87 and our return on invested capital adjusted of 25.6%. Adjusted automotive free cash flow was $400 million. In the quarter, we capitalized on the high demand in the crossover, luxury and truck segments in addition to record performance by GM Financial.","As we continue to strengthen our automotive vehicle business with recently-announced partnership between Honda, GM, GM Cruise to develop and deploy a purpose-built autonomous ride-share vehicle, based on the current rate of iteration, we continue to target commercialization in 2019 in a dense urban environment with safety as our gating metric.","Now let's turn to North America, where in the U.S. our go-to-market strategy drove record Q3 average transaction prices. In Q4, we intend to stay disciplined, but we will compete for every sale with our freshest products in years, including our all new full-size pickups.","We entered the quarter with lean inventories of our 2018 model year full-size pickups and focused on selling a very strong mix of SUVs, crossovers and midsize pickups with lower incentives. We expect retail sales volumes will increase in Q4 and beyond as we ramp up production of our new pickups.","The launch of our new trucks continues to be ahead of schedule and response to our truck-for-every-customer strategy has been positive. Sales of the new high-margin Chevrolet Silverado LTZ and High Country crew-cab models are more than 30% above forecast, and the new GMC Sierra SLT, Denali and AT4 crew-cab models are selling within two weeks.","Popularity of our new crossovers from Chevrolet, Buick and GMC continues as the sales of Traverse, Enclave and Terrain grew in competitive segments.","Cadillac's product offensive continued in September with the launch of the all-new XT4 luxury SUV in North America and China. The brand is capitalizing on Chinese consumers' growing preference for luxury vehicles with sales in China up 20% year-to-date. Cadillac is introducing a new model every six months through 2020s, including the upcoming three-row XT6 SUV.","Moving to China, where we have more than 20 years of strong market presence, we achieved record third-quarter equity income. This performance results from an improved mix of vehicle sales and a continued focus on cost and productivity improvements. Our earnings have been resilient as we benefit from the growth of important brands like Cadillac and Baojun. As we focus on electrification and launch future vehicle programs, we have opportunities to continue to improve our competitive position.","During two visits to China this month, I've had a chance to take a closer look at the macro conditions affecting industry performance. The recent weakness has been more significant in Tier 3 through 5 markets that have less of an impact on our financial performance in the third quarter. Additionally, our growing strength in luxury and premium segments helps offset the impact of the industry weakness.","We continue with our plan to introduce 10 new and refreshed models in the second half of the year, including the Cadillac XT4, the Baojun E200 BEV, the Chevrolet Orlando MPV and the Wuling Rong Guang in the third quarter.","In addition, in our international operations, we are beginning to realize cost reductions as a result of our restructuring actions in Korea. And in South America, we have managed the effects of foreign exchange headwinds as we continue to drive efficiency into the business and we remain very confident in the strength of our Chevrolet brand there.","As we look forward through the rest of the year, we expect full-year EPS to be at the top of our previously-communicated guidance range with potential for further upside. This is due to our strong operating performance and a favorable tax rate outlook for the year.","Before I turn the call over to Dhivya, I want to assure our owners that we are focused on creating shareholder value. As we closeout 2018 and prepare for 2019, we are committed to improving all aspects of the business by accelerating the pace and driving capital efficiencies due to our global vehicle development process improvements, while allowing us to continue to improve quality and speed to market, and by taking steps to transform the workforce to ensure we have the right skill sets for today and the future, while also driving significant efficiency. We will continue to update you on our progress in the near term.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Dhivya.","Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.","Thanks, Mary. Our execution was extremely strong in the third quarter even as we faced expected challenges from commodity pricing and significant currency devaluations in South America. As a result of our focused and disciplined execution, we generated $35.8 billion in net revenue, $3.2 billion in EBIT-adjusted, 8.8% margin, and $1.87 in EPS diluted adjusted, which is a Q3 record.","Favorable tax rate and performance of PSA warrants contributed to approximately $0.30 of EPS impact, while our strong operating performance contributed to the remainder. Q3 adjusted automotive free cash flow improved by $1.3 billion year-over-year net of our decision to opportunistically pre-fund $600 million of certain mandatory contributions related to our international pension plans.","Let's take a look at North America. GMNA generated $2.8 billion of EBIT-adjusted and 10.2% margins, up 190 basis points year-over-year. The execution of the all-new full-size pickup truck launch is going very well. We produced 45,000 trucks in Q3 and expect to deliver another 75,000 to dealers in Q4, consisting primarily of highly-profitable crew-cab. This contributed favorably to volume, mix and price during the quarter.","Our crossovers continue to perform across every vehicle segment. We will continue this momentum into 2019 with the launch of our all-new Blazer. As a result of matching supply with demand and disciplined pricing, passenger car results improved year-over-year in Q3.","Light-duty pickup performance combined with our crossover and passenger car results more than offset mix and downtime taken in Q3 for heavy duty trucks, which positions us well as we head into 2019. And as expected, commodity headwinds and increased vehicle content for newly-launched vehicles was partially offset by strong material performance.","Moving to GM International, EBIT-adjusted performance in GMI was down $300 million year-over-year driven by significant devaluation of the Argentine peso and Brazilian real. China delivered record Q3 results with equity income of $500 million for the quarter. As Mary mentioned, this was driven by cost performance, as well as strong mix of vehicles led by record Cadillac sales, which offset challenges from continued pricing pressure.","A few comments on GM Financial, GM Cruise and our Corp segment. As we continue to progress towards full captive, GM Financial posted an all-time quarterly record revenue of $3.5 billion and record third quarter earnings before tax adjusted of $500 million. Credit and residual performance remained constructive.","As a result of strong performance, we have initiated an ongoing dividend payment from GM Financial. In the fourth quarter of this year, GM Financial will pay a dividend of $375 million, well ahead of our original plan. Through dividends from GMF, we have the opportunity to strengthen the long-term cash generation capability and narrow the gap between earnings and free cash flow on an ongoing basis.","GM Cruise costs in the quarter were $200 million as we continue progressing towards commercialization. We expect to spend approximately $1 billion in GM Cruise for the full year.","Corp segment costs in the quarter were better than expected, primarily due to continued favorability from valuation of our PSA warrants. We expect the Corp segment cost to be lower than the full-year expectation of $1 billion.","We project our 2018 full year effective tax rate to be approximately 17% as a result of fluctuation in earnings geographies and favorable resolution of various tax positions.","Moving on to our outlook for the full year. Due to our strong operating performance and favorable tax rate outlook for the year, we expect the full-year EPS to be at the top of our previously-communicated guidance range with potential for further upside.","In North America, we continue to expect a full-year EBIT adjusted margin of 9% to 10% as we launch our all-new full-size trucks, while we still experience commodity-driven headwinds.","In China, we continue to expect strong equity income of approximately $2 billion this year. With the majority of our launches occurring later in the year, we expect higher launch costs in the fourth quarter.","Moving to South America, we continue to monitor and work to offset the impact of currency volatility. The structural cost actions we've taken have lowered our break-even point by approximately 40% relative to where we were just a few years ago, and our underlying franchise remains very strong.","Regarding GM Financial, while we will experience traditional seasonality in Q4, we continue to expect significant year-over-year profit growth. And we continue to expect core automotive free cash flow of approximately $4 billion before the impact of pre-funding non-U.S. pension contributions.","So, to sum up the quarter, our Q3 performance is a demonstration of the team navigating through a challenging environment and delivering very strong results. As Mary mentioned, we're intensely focused on improving our cash generation. Following our new architectural launches, we expect a meaningful decline in future capital spending. Combined with the ongoing GM Financial dividend and our focus on cost reduction, we see significant opportunity to improve cash generation.","We are confident in the opportunities ahead of us and continue to expect strong performance over the short term as well as the long term.","This concludes our opening comments and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you. Good morning, and congratulations, everyone.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Thanks, Itay.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","First, Dhivya, just to clarify on the GMF dividend of $3.75 in Q4, is that going to be \u2013 kind of sustainable at that quarterly rate going forward?","Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.","Yeah, Itay, we do expect that this will be an annual dividend. The exact amount will be driven by leverage ratio at GMF as we go forward. And when we get to a full-captive state early in 2020s, we expect that the entire net income from GMF will be dividended up to the parent.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. That's very helpful. And then as we think about your progress going into 2019, love to get the latest sense on commodity costs directionally as you renegotiate some of the one-year contracts, as well as just the ability of the business to continue to offset as you've been able to do, of course, here in Q3, in terms of the opportunities you're seeing to offset some of these headwinds.","Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.","Yeah, Itay, we had mentioned on the last call that on an unmitigated basis we see a $1 billion year-over-year impact in 2019 over 2018. Again, I would reiterate that that number was based on the spot prices that existed at the time of our second quarter earnings call and there's been puts and takes since then. There's some tailwinds in commodities. There's some headwinds in the form of tariffs and so on. But I think net-net, you should think about it as that number continues to be valid on an unmitigated basis.","But as we think of 2019, you should look at that in the context of all the other puts and takes we have, including largely completing the transition of our light duties. And, as I mentioned, we have taken downtime already in 2018 as it relates to our heavy duties. So, we do not anticipate a significant year-over-year volume decline in our heavy duties, so that should help offset as well. So, think of commodities in the context of the broader overall picture that's happening.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. And then just maybe lastly on GMI, kind of your latest thoughts there. Maybe a year ago at this time we thought GMI would move to profitability. Maybe an update on the GEMs platform and the Korea restructuring and kind of how you're thinking about that segment now in the next couple of years excluding China.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","I think as I indicated from a Korea perspective, we're starting to see the cost savings flow in. A lot of those were in this segment, so we see that and are very much on track for what we communicated as it relates to the Korea restructuring.","I think when you look, there's progress being made in each of those markets, but GEM doesn't launch until next year and so that becomes an opportunity there. We have continued in South America to improve the business, taking additional costs out, have a very strong franchise there. So, we see improvement coming across the board in GMI.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. That's all very helpful. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just to turn to the free cash, I mean, originally you were saying $4 billion for the year. Then, you have the $600 million discretionary pension. Now, you're adding back $375 million. So, where do you think we should end up here for the full year?","Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.","Yeah, Joe, I think about our free-cash-flow guidance as consistent with the $4 billion that we alluded to in the second quarter. If you look at the pension pre-funding, again, we took the opportunity to risk manage that and get some of the mandatory contributions over with in 2018.","But if you look at the underlying cash-generation capability of our core business, it remains at that $4-billion level, which is very strong. And as we look into Q4, we expect that quarter to be where we are going to generate a significant portion of our cash. It's going to be a very strong free-cash-flow quarter. So, I think about it as free-cash-flow guidance remains intact, as well as the ongoing GMF dividend initiation. You're going to see the impact of that as we go forward into 2019 and beyond.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So, just the $4 billion inclusive of the pension.","Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.","The $4 billion is before the mandatory contributions. It's $3.4 billion net of pensions. We guided to $4 billion on a core automotive basis and that continues to be the cash-generation capability.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then just in GMNA, I think in the past you were sort of pointing us towards that fourth quarter would be the strongest quarter of the year. Obviously, there was good performance here in the third quarter. Is that still the case or was there some timing between the two quarters?","Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.","We expect fourth quarter to continue to remain strong, Joe, and the favorability we're seeing in Q3 as it relates to our T1 launch should continue into Q4. From a factory unit sale perspective, we expect that Q3 and Q4 will be roughly in \u2013 Q4 will be roughly in line with last year and Q4 will actually be up versus Q3 from a factory unit sale perspective. We're continuing to expect strong crew cab penetration within our sales as well. So, if you overall look at the 9% to 10% guidance for North American margins, I would expect Q4 to be on the higher end of that range.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then just last quickly. In China, I know there was this over 3-million-unit recall. Does that impact that guidance at all? And if so, in which quarter?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","No. No. From a \u2013 it was not a material impact.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","And it's happening \u2013 underway right now.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research.","Rod Lache - Wolfe Research","Good morning, everybody. Congratulations.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Thanks, Rod.","Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.","Thanks.","Rod Lache - Wolfe Research","I was hoping to get a little bit more color on China. Your wholesales this quarter were down 4%. I think your retail was down 15%. So, I was hoping maybe you can give us a sense of the components of the earnings bridge and how things are playing out. So, in other words, if we were to have a plus or minus 5% from volume, what does that imply for the impact on GM? And what do you have kind of in the pipeline in terms of positive mix that's offsetting that?","Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.","Yeah, so, typically, Rod, just from an earnings bridge perspective, we experience about mid-single digit type pricing pressure on a yearly basis in China. And on a high level, how I would think about that is, offset roughly half by mix and half by cost. And that's sort of been the trend over the last several years and what we're seeing from a mix perspective, especially as Mary mentioned, as we launch our new Cadillac entries here, that's been particularly strong.","And from a volume perspective I think it's important to highlight where the volume comes from, would have a different impact on profitability. For example, Tier 3 to 5 where we're seeing a bunch of the weakness that Mary alluded to, that tends to be our less profitable portion of the market. Tier 1 to 2, we're seeing less of a decline there and luxury, again, the market is actually up year-over-year. So from an overall puts and takes perspective, I would continue to think about this as a strong performance in cost as well as mix continuing to be a tailwind from a Cadillac perspective as we continue our launches.","Rod Lache - Wolfe Research","Can you provide us with some kind of a sensitivity at this point on average for what a 5% move in volume would be? You guys have done that in the past. But this obviously has changed a lot.","Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.","Yeah, it's, again, difficult to predict because it matters where it comes from as well. So I wouldn't go into that level of detail. And as I mentioned, it's too mix-dependent. So if you're in a backdrop where volumes are declining but, again, luxury is holding up, you get a different answer. So it's hard to handicap that.","Rod Lache - Wolfe Research","Okay. And can you just give us your kind of high level, maybe 30,000-foot view on China? There's been a lot of discussion lately about a stimulus of some kind that's maybe coming, maybe a purchase tax cut. Obviously, there are a lot of other elements that are going on in China as well vis-a-vis credit and so forth. So, how do you see this playing out from a high level?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Obviously, Rod, we're watching it very closely as I mentioned. I've been there twice in the last month and we have a very strong joint venture in China with SAIC and have very strong brands. We're seeing growth in Chevrolet. We're seeing very good growth from a Cadillac perspective and we have a very good launch cadence of products coming out that are getting really strong reception from consumers. We have not seen any negative view toward our brands and I think that's very positive.","So I think we continue \u2013 we have an organization there that is extremely disciplined on taking costs out and seizing opportunities to improve our go-to-market and then the products that we have from a mix perspective. So, we're watching it carefully and we're very hopeful that both sides will have dialog and get to the table to work through some very important issues that both China and the United States have as it relates to trade. And we're hopeful that will \u2013 there will be a foundation laid and they'll continue to do that. But I think when we look at our positioning, we have many levers that we can pull to continue to have strong performance in China.","Rod Lache - Wolfe Research","But at a high level, are you expecting China to recover at some point as a result of \u2013 I understand that there's some company-specific positives, but are you expecting China to start to look a little bit better as some of the stimulus measures start to have an effect?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","We're watching that closely. I can't predict. We all read the article that came out that they're considering the incentives. Obviously, that would be a very good measure from an industry perspective. But I don't know \u2013 I can't comment if that's going to happen or not. I think they're looking at it closely and we expect to see actions taken that are going to allow the market to continue to be \u2013 I wouldn't say maybe growth that we saw a few years back, but continue to be at a important level. And let's not forget, even at a 27-million-type unit market, it's the largest market in the world.","Rod Lache - Wolfe Research","Okay. And just lastly, was hoping you can just describe how you're setting the level of a dividend from GMF, that business is now starting to generate something like $2 billion a year of earnings. So to the extent that you're not dividend-ing that all out, obviously you're building the equity base there. Is that something that gets ratcheted up over time?","Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.","Yeah, that's correct, Rod. So the way we set the dividend level is a number of factors but primarily driven by leverage ratio at GMF. We have a managerial leverage ratio target of 10 times earning assets to equity and we're still growing the business. The year-over-year rate of growth is starting to stabilize but it's still growing. And as we think about the balance sheet leveling out in a couple of years down the line, that's when you will expect that the net income from GMF will be fully dividended to the company. And what we've done basically here is taken advantage of the fact that our strong performance at GMF has contributed to a lower leverage ratio than what's in our managerial target. So we're taking advantage of the upside there to be able to start the dividends early.","Rod Lache - Wolfe Research","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, everybody. Just a couple of questions. First, on China strategy, the BMW Brilliance arrangement where BMW increased its stake as JV to 75%, that kind of caught the market's attention. I was just wondering from the lens of GM in China, are you satisfied with your 50% type stakes in your JVs there or is there a potential to take this higher, given now you have the opportunity, as part of maybe a broader plan to change internal combustion capacity to electrics in that region.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","So, Adam, we have I think the strongest partner in China with SAIC. We've \u2013 through the past 20 years have worked together quite well \u2013 doing work such as the joint development of the GEM product as well as our work on the next generation of the electric vehicle. So, I think we have a very appropriate relationship and at this current time we're not looking to change the 50\/50 structure. It's served us well and I think the strength of our results demonstrate that.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, Mary. Just one follow-up on electric vehicles. So, you currently sell one pure EV at least in the U.S. right now, the Volt, sales are down around 17% year-to-date. I think you're annualizing maybe around 16,000 units, that's just for the U.S. market. I realize you do sell it globally. But just on the U.S., Tesla makes about as many Model 3s in three weeks as your whole year worth of Volt sales in the States.","So, I guess the question is, when are we going to see \u2013 when could we expect to see \u2013 and again, taking nothing away from the efforts of the Volt and really you stand apart from a lot of your Detroit brethren from really going heavy on EV, so I think it is an appropriate question to say given your lead and your experience with this technology, when can we see GM bring out like a couple hundred thousand unit type product that could really clean house in the ride-sharing fleets and turn heads and be a real headache for Tesla? Thanks.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Adam, thanks for the recognition on the Chevrolet Volt EV. We have announced that we are increasing capacity there. We've been opportunistic as to what markets we are allowing the current production to go to, but I think you'll see our sales in the United States increase. And although I don't have a specific announcement to your question, we have announced that we have several EVs coming in the next few years, so we believe in an all-electric future. I think you'll see that will roll out over the next couple of years. And then very importantly, we're working on our next generation, which we're calling EME 1.0, that we're looking to make sure we have EVs that are affordable, obtainable, desirable and have the right range.","We're also working actively from an infrastructure on several fronts to make sure that the charging infrastructure is there to support the growth of EVs. And even most recently, which was announced, we're working with Delco Electronics on a fast-charging technology because I think as we look at it from a customer perspective, what do they need to really get the growth to make the EV their only car as opposed to their third, fourth or fifth car. You need to solve the charging infrastructure. Fast-charging is a big piece of it. So we're very optimistic and we're 100% committed but I'm not going to \u2013 I don't have specific volume announcements to make today.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, Mary. Thanks, team.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, guys.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Good morning.","Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.","Good morning.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a first question on slide 11 on the North American bridge. Probably, I think the most important thing in the quarter is that you got positive pricing on carryovers, as well as majors. I think that's probably the first time I've seen that in 20-plus years of looking at your financials. What's going on with the pricing there? I mean, that's a wild positive action that you were able to get positive pricing on carryovers.","Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.","Yeah, John, it's across the board I would say. If you look at the components of that, a lot of our recently-launched crossovers are now falling in the carryover category, so we continue to see pricing strength there, especially in the mid-SUV segment. We have remained disciplined from a passenger-car perspective as well, as we have matched supply and demand. So, I would say it's not just in one area, John. It's across the board.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And Dhivya, do you think this is the kind of action, though, that could be sustainable going forward? This isn't sort of a one-time blip, this is a real focus and change in philosophy?","Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.","Look, you'll see it, obviously, go up and down every quarter, but our intent is absolutely to stay disciplined.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's great. Then, second, as we look at the rise in rates, there's a lot of concern around what that's going to do to the value chain, particularly on the demand side, but it's helpful on pensions. So, I'm just curious what you're seeing on sort of pension pre-measurements and funding status and really thoughts there, Dhivya.","Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.","Yeah, on that, John, absolutely a rising rate environment tends to be a tailwind for pensions. Especially in the U.S. we have made a ton of progress in closing our underfunded gap over the last several years and we remain leveraged to the upside as rates increase.","I think important thing to note is the mandatory pension contributions in the U.S. do not start until the mid-2020s, so you're really talking about a good seven, eight years of a runway here for us to benefit from potential market moves before we're going to have to take any mandatory contribution actions.","But, again, we're risk managing this. We're making sure that we're also downside protected as we move forward. But, you're right, we'll see tailwinds there. And we remeasure pensions, as you know, at the end of the year, so we'll have more to say when we report our calendar-year earnings.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And can you also just remind us when we think about the demographics of the work, the active workforce, how many are legacy workers and how many are your entry levels? What's the mix right now roughly?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","No. I don't have...","Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.","I think it's about roughly 50\/50, we should say.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Okay. Yeah, and we can confirm that.","Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.","Yes.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just lastly, Mary. When you talk about safety as the gating factor on the Cruise commercialization and real widespread launch, how do you measure that safety? I mean, obviously, not hitting things is obviously a very critical one. That's a very simple one for us to see.","But not to make light of this, but I mean how do you really get comfortable with sort of the risks in the real world? Because they're always going to be out there, particularly when we're in a world of some of these regular human crazy drivers that the cars have to deal with. I mean, how do you think about that and when do you just let it go?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Well, I think the fact that we're doing our development in downtown San Francisco gives us probably the most exposure to those types of situations, not only drivers but bikes and all sorts of activities. We did release our kind of guide to safety that was part of the guidelines that NHTSA is looking for.","But I would say we've also \u2013 and we haven't released details because we think it's a competitive advantage. We have done extensive work to understand how we will measure through actual road performance, simulation. We've gone back and looked at historical patterns as it relates to safety and we have a very well-defined plan of what we have to demonstrate to demonstrate that the AV is safer than a human driver, and that's the path that we're on. And so, when we talk about gated by safety, we are measuring ourselves against that plan that also had external input.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And that gate will get lifted with the commercialization in 2019; is that a fair statement or assumption?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Yes. So, our intent is based on the progress and the rate of iteration that we're making that we see a path to be able to do that. But as we demonstrated with Super Cruise, we will make sure we hit our safety metrics before we launch and commercialize. But right now, the rate of iteration says that we're believing we can do that in 2019.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, great. Really good looking quarter. Want to dig into a thread from earlier on free cash flow, because I think there's some confusion on this. The original guidance was for, the last quarter's guidance, was for $4 billion. You took a $600 million prepayment contribution on pensions, so roughly $3.4 billion. Does that $3.4 billion include the dividend from GMF? Or would that be on top of the $3.4 billion, getting you back to around that $4 billion?","Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.","It includes that, David. What we were not able to preannounce was the dividend because we had not \u2013 the GMF Board of Directors had not declared it at that point, but it was contemplated in our guidance. So you're correct, $4 billion core automotive free cash flow generation. When we pre-fund the pension piece, that comes down to $3.4 billion, both of which already contemplate the GMF dividend.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Just under-communicated. Understood. On the Cruise Automation spend, this year you're only about $500 million. I know I've asked this like two or three quarters in a row now. You're still expecting $1 billion for the year. What's the ramp-up that you're going to be seeing that you're going to double year-to-date spend in the fourth quarter?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","So we are hiring and continuing to do that development to the plan. Right now, we're looking at still we'll be roughly around $1 billion as we previously communicated, but the team is being smart about it and if they can achieve what they need to achieve at a lower level, they will. But we're still holding at that level and it's due to a lot of hiring and continued work from \u2013 accumulating miles and experience.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. But there's not like a large increase in the fleet that's coming or an expansion in a new city that's going to drive that incremental spend?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","No.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Because that's all we can think of that could kind of get you there.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","No.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And then for the quarter, commodities headwind in North America was $300 million. I know this was asked a little bit earlier, $1 billion for next year unmitigated. What was this quarter's gross unmitigated and how much were you able to essentially mitigate? Just trying to get a sense of how effective you've been.","Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.","So I would just \u2013 from a bridge perspective, you can see that for the total company we experienced $400 million of commodity headwinds. And what we've been trying to do, David, as you're aware, we have our $6.5 billion target that we committed to in 2014 as it relates to commercial and technical savings and we've been continuing to execute on that and we remain on track to achieve that by the end of this year. And you see material performance in our bridge of $300 million that serves to offset some of the commodity headwinds we're talking about and obviously there's broader puts and takes outside of commodities as well where we've seen strength in a number of other areas that have offset commodities. And looking into 2019, again, too early. Our purchasing team is having those discussions as we speak and we'll have more to share early next year.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. To clarify that point, though, earlier in the year you talk about gross impact and what the mitigated impact was and I believe this $400 million is the mitigated impact. What would have been the gross impact for the quarter before you took any mitigating factors?","Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.","Just to clarify, the over $1 billion stands at over $1 billion still. So we had $1.4 billion and we're roughly in that zip code currently from a commodity headwind perspective and $400 million is what you're seeing of that $1-ish billion flowing through in this particular quarter and the mitigation is after that and which is the $300 million of material performance that you see flow through in our bridge.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Very clear. Thank you very much. Great looking quarter.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Thanks.","Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Sure.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Firstly, another one on China. The latest speculation as was discussed is that the sales could rise from here if the government reduces the purchase tax on new vehicles and I hope that does happen. I wanted to ask, though, if you have done downturn planning in that country similar to what you have done in the U.S. So, for example, in the event that there were a material downturn in China, I know there hasn't been before, but something on the order of magnitude of like 25% peak to trough like you discussed in the U.S., what would that mean for your operations there? Do you think you would be profitable in that type of a scenario? I think you would be given you just generated a record profit on a 15% volume decline. But curious if you could dimension how a material downturn might impact you in that region and if it is any harder or easier to pull cost levers on, say, the people side in China in comparison to, say, in North America.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","So we have done that planning at both a moderate and severe levels. That's something that I just reviewed this past week and it's something we update on a continual basis. It's hard to completely quantify it based on tell me what's driving it, tell me what the mix will be, where's the impact most from a Tier 1 to Tier 5 city perspective. But we have done that with a wide range of sensitivity analysis based on those factors. So I can't really share a specific number. We do have flexibility with the workforce. As you know from a U.S. perspective, one of the things that benefited us from the 2015 contract was the ability to have a more-flexible workforce and so we are \u2013 every year we grow and have I would say that increases from a North America perspective. We have that with the workforce in China as well especially as we look at the temporary workforce that we have there. So been very well modeled, continually monitored.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And can you just speak to the degree to which the record GM Financial results in the quarter were helped by structural factors that we can expect will continue like portfolio expansion, et cetera, versus maybe, I don't know, some more temporal factors such as presumably stronger auction prices during the quarter. What is your outlook for GM Financial going forward and how should we expect this business to fare in an environment of higher interest rates?","Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.","Yeah, I think from a GM Financial perspective we have talked about roughly doubling the EBT from a couple of years ago to, I believe, we said 2019. That remains on track. A lot of it is the portfolio growth that you're talking about. We continue to increase the penetration within GMF as well as just grow the overall size of the balance sheet and you've seen those results come through.","The other points worth highlighting are credit losses; they remain within range and so we're constructive there as well. And residual prices, as you're well aware, they remain constructive also. So I would say it's all of the above and we're, again, continuing to risk-manage this business and this is going to be a strong contributor to earnings as we move forward.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then just lastly from me, can you provide some color on how investors should be thinking about the new heavy duty pickup trucks due out next year and the profit potential they might provide. And I'm not even thinking here about the CK2500s, for example, in Flint North but the even bigger trucks I think are going to be built in a plant in Ohio with Navistar. Could this be a very meaningful profit contributor for you?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Well, I think it's an important truck that we have and one of the things that is important is for some of those buyers having the full suite we think will also increase our heavy duties as you mentioned that we'll be launching next year from a Flint perspective. So it's the adjacencies that I think are going to drive the overall business up. So that's the way we look at it. I don't have specific figures to give you. But, we'll have that opportunity but what it drives in heavy duty is more significant.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Thanks. Congrats on a great quarter.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Thank you.","Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on a great quarter.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Thank you.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Looking through the model, can you explain some of the weakness that is expected in Q4? Because I think you mentioned North America is fairly stable. I guess Cruise gets a bit worse. Maybe Other gets a bit worse. But what is the big driver that's sort of implied even at the high end of guidance, seems like there's a core deterioration quarter-over-quarter.","Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.","So, I would say, Colin, a few things. One, we expect in Q4 all the core operating segments to continue to be strong. I already talked about North America where we're going to continue to see tailwinds from T1 as well as the crew-cab mix that I alluded to. So North America will continue to remain strong. I did mention the launch cost related factors that we're factoring in to China but again the $2 billion equity income is reiterated.","In South America, the FX continues to be the question mark over there. We've seen some tailwind after the elections but we're going to have to see what happens in Q4 from an FX perspective. GMF tends to be, from a Q4 perspective, the seasonal low point. But again, you've seen \u2013 to the prior question as well \u2013 significant profit growth year-over-year in GMF.","So if you take a step back, the core operating items remain intact. What we really want to be mindful of is non-operating items such as PSA warrants for example, we saw tailwinds during this quarter and that's really going to be driven by what the stock price does there. And that's a non-operating item. And FX-type macro items that we want to be mindful of. But, we will see continued strength in Q4 from the operating side.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And I noticed in the walk, you mentioned crossovers as negative mix. In the past, that used to be cars. Is that \u2013 there's a lot of concern about SUV profitability. Are crossovers getting less profitable or is it just the mix now of cars is so small that crossovers versus pickups is the bigger drag?","Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.","I think it really depends on which segment within crossovers. I think if you look at small and the compact segments, you're probably well aware, Colin, there's a lot more competition there and there's pricing pressure there. The mid-SUVs continue to perform really well, so it's really segment by segment within crossovers.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","And, lastly, there's a recent article on Cruise highlighting people saying there's technology challenges there. Any comment on that media report? And is the 2019 launch in San Francisco still on track? Or is that at risk of being delayed?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Well, we haven't explicitly said where that launch is going to be, but we are doing our testing in San Francisco. But, look, we continue to iterate rapidly. When you step back and look at this, this is really \u2013 I think what is happening is people are realizing this is really hard. And so, when we take the work and the expertise that we continue to grow at Cruise along with the auto expertise and combine that, we're working hard to solve that challenge.","I mentioned before we have a well-defined plan on how we'll look at safety and we'll be gated by that. And really launching in one city is just the first step in what will be a multiyear, probably over decades, transformation of how people move from point A to point B. So, I think we need to keep that in perspective.","There was also comments made about miles and I want to remind everybody that a mile is not a mile when you're doing AV testing. Clearly, the most complex miles that we're gaining experience in in San Francisco are very valuable, and so we're being efficient in driving the miles that we need to drive, getting the maximum learning as we move forward.","So, I think that's the way we're looking at the business and I think it's a balanced view. But as I said, with the rate of iteration we're doing, we still believe and are continuing to target 2019 deployment.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing remarks.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Well, I want to once again thank everybody for participating on the call. And to sum up the quarter, I'd like to point to the fact that our strong results demonstrate our commitment to execute our plans amid industry headwinds. We continue to adapt and take actions necessary to create shareholder value through our strong and growing franchises, as well as our leadership position in the future of mobility.","The management team is resolved to take actions to strengthen the business and we have driven downturn protection and disciplined capital allocation into the business and we also have an intense focus on generating cash. As we continue to operate in a dynamic business environment, we are fully focused on increasing our speed of execution as we transform GM and the future of the industry.","So, thanks again for joining today.

Our press release was issued this morning and the conference call materials are available on the Investor Relations website. We\u2019re also broadcasting this call live on the web.

In the room today, we also have Tom Timko, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; and Jim Davlin, Vice President Finance and Treasurer to assist and answer your questions. Now I'll return the call over to Mary Barra. ","Mary Barra","","Thanks, Randy and thanks for everyone for joining the call today. We did lot of hard work with GMT have made stronger than it was with just one short year ago. With all that headlines, I don't ever repeat them here. And surprise to say, during the last 12 months, we've received a flurry of great moves from Moody, J.D. Power, Consumer Reports, the automotive instant guides, (inaudible) and more.","All of this element can help through the way for GM to this S&P 500, achieve an investment grade rating to clear out common stock dividend and report larger earnings in North America. These are all important milestones, but they are just milestones. We have more work to do and our sense of urgency will not let out one day.","Our plan remains the same, we need to operate profitably everywhere we can change, deliver compelling design, excellent quality and a great ownership experience, strengthen and grow our brand, further strengthen our focused balance sheet and generate the kinds of financial returns that earn confidence of our long-term investors.","All right, let\u2019s turn to slide two and a take closer look at our 2013 financial results. To start, we delivered a record 9.7 million vehicles which is up 0.5% from 2012. Deliveries in United States and China combined increased by more than 0.5 units, although this was partially offset by declines in other markets, include Europe, parts of South America and in our consolidated international operations.","Our global market share was even with 2012 and that revenue increased by more than $3 billion to just over $155 billion. Net income to common stockholders was $3.8 billion, that\u2019s down from 2012, largely due to incremental tax expense and special items. Our automotive business meanwhile generated $11 billion in net cash from operating activity, that\u2019s a 14% increase from 2012.","Turning to EBIT adjusted, we earned $8.6 billion, which is a $700 million increase, we now have delivered EBIT adjusted totaling almost $32 billion over 16th consecutive profitable quarters.","As I indicated before, we are not really want to be in terms of profitability but our solid and consistent profitability combined with our focused balance sheet has allowed us to level our capital budget at roughly $8 billion annually. It\u2019s been a long time since our products and plant teams have been able to work in such a stable funding environment and believe me it\u2019s a very welcome change.","[And the insurance] in and of itself has made us more efficient and it help us deliver more award winning products with higher quality. Beginning to our EBIT adjusted results, you can see on the slide that we were up in North America, Europe reduce the prices and our international operations in South America were both down.","North America in particular is riding the wave of new products, with our Cadillac and truck launches helping to drive higher earnings. The transition to our all new light-duty pickup was well executed. Especially a very orderly and profitable sell-down of the old models and the CTS from Cadillac was the smoothes launch in our GM carrier.","(Inaudible) GM financial increased its earnings and forecast in addition to helping us sell more cars and trucks. Finally, our adjusted automotive free cash flow was $3.7 billion which means the end of the year with just over $38 billion of liquidity.","If you turn to the next slide, I\u2019ll review some additional highlights to provide more contexts. Let\u2019s start with Cadillac. We have a long journey ahead of us with Cadillac to increase favorable opinion and such as consideration. But the early results of our global growth strategy are encouraging. Last year Cadillac leveraged the all new XTS and the ATS which was the 2013 North America Car of the Year become the best selling full line luxury brand.","Now we are launching the CTS, the ELR, the ATS Coupe and the Escalade and these vehicles represent some of the finest designing engineering work that General Motors has done. At year end, our dealers in China and America delivered more than one million cars and crossovers were the best year in the brands 110-year history.","Chevrolet delivered more than 5 million vehicles which was enough for the brands third consecutive year of record sales. Market share was up in Brazil and Mexico, and the retail market share was up in United States.","Some of the key drivers in United States was the Impala which was named consumers report Best Sedans, the Corvette Stingray which was the 2014 North American Car of the Year and the Silverado which was the 2014 Northern American Truck of the Year.","This year GM is launching 15 new products in United States and four of them are high volume Chevrolet Truck and SUV. In China we have announced plans for four new or redesign Chevrolet in 2014, including a new compact SUV for that fast growing segment. Finally, Opel\/Vauxhall delivered more than one million vehicles and ended 2013 with it\u2019s first European market share increase in 14 years, thanks to the Mokka and the ADAM.","I\u2019ll share just a few more highlights, so you can see how these milestones really drove our business results last year. To start, Chevrolet, Buick, Cadillac and GMC all increased their retail market share in the United States where we earned record transaction prices that drove an EBIT adjusted margin in North America of 7.8%, that\u2019s up from 7.2% in 2012 so we made good progress on profitability, especially in the second half of the year as we expected. In the third and fourth quarter our margin was 8.4% which is up a bit more than two-third percentage points from the same period a year ago. ","In the South America we had another profitable year. We\u2019re getting traction both the cost and the revenue sides of the equation in South America. For example, we ended the year with higher market share in Brazil and we were able to reduce our material and logistic costs through localization. We also reduce overcapacity in high-cost parts of the country and launched new products with higher margins. Heading into 2014 about 75% of our sales in Brazil will be from new or redesigned products of the Chevrolet (inaudible) up from about 25% in 2011. ","Sales in China set a new record with more than 3 million deliveries, that\u2019s up 11.4% from the year ago. One of the highlights that the Chevrolet Malibu fleet sales nearly doubled. In Europe we record had year-over-year revenue increase in the second half and this shows that (inaudible) are making a tremendous progress. And as I mentioned earlier we achieved an investment grade rating from Moody\u2019s ratings. That\u2019s a lot of momentum which we will build on in a number of ways this year. In North America for example our entire pick-up and full sized SUV line up would be all new designs. ","Our 2015 model year Chevrolet and GMC full sized SUVs are on their way to dealers. And our 2013 heavy duty pick-up launched in the quarter and finally our new mid-sized pick-ups launching this fall. Later today, we unveil the new Chevrolet City Express small cargo van at the Chicago Auto Show. It will also be on sale this fall. Across Europe and South America meanwhile GM Financial will start to contribute to grow as it consolidates consumer revenue businesses we brought from LA. And in China, we are expecting a higher sales in 2014 and a richer mix over time, going in part from Cadillac growth. ","All right, let's move to the next part of the call. Chuck I\u2019d like to turn the flow over to you for a detailed look for the year and the quarter. I\u2019ll return at the end for some closing comments.","Chuck Stevens","","Thanks Mary, on Slide 4 we provided a summary of our 2013 calendar year GAAP and non-GAAP results. Net revenue for the year was a $155 billion, up 2.1% from prior year. Excluding the impact of FX translation, revenue was up 3.6% for the year. Our GAAP operating income was $5.1 billion, up from a large loss in the prior period due entirely the special items. Net income to common stockholders was $3.8 billion and diluted earnings per share came in at $2.38. As Mary indicated, the decline from the prior year was largely due to increased tax expense and unfavorable special items. Our automotive net cash from operating activities was a $11 billion or $1.4 billion increase from 2012. ","For our non-GAAP measures, EBIT adjusted was $8.6 billion in 2013 and EBIT adjusted margin was 5.5% as improved as an core operating performance across most of the business was partially offset by challenging environment and consolidated international operations. Finally, our adjusted automotive free cash flow was $3.7 billion for the year, $600 million decrease in 2012 largely due to the timing and sales allowances. ","On Slide 5 we provide the EBIT adjusted by region for 2012 and 2013. GMNA\u2019s EBIT adjusted from significantly the $7.5 billion driven by new products. GME had an EBIT adjusted loss of $800 million, an improvement of more than $1 billion from 2012 driven by lower depreciation and amortization, and material and logistic savings. GMIO get EBIT adjusted at $1.2 billion, down significantly from the prior year as the challenging environment and consolidated operations more than offset the improved performance in China. ","GMSA\u2019s EBIT adjusted was down slightly to $300 million for 2013 due to FX headwinds. GM Financial had record earnings before taxes of $900 million and corporate and eliminations was $500 million expense. This totals to an EBIT adjusted of $8.6 billion, an increase of $700 million from 2012.","On slide 6, we provide an explanation of the $700 million increase in year-over-year EBIT adjusted. Our EBIT adjusted was $7.9 billion for 2012. Volume was a $100 million as the impact of increased wholesale volumes in GM North America will partially offset by declines in GMIO and GM Europe. Mix was unfavorable $400 million, primarily due to unfavorable country mix in GMIO and unfavorable vehicle mix in GME, partially offset by favorable vehicle mix in GMSA. Price was $2.4 billion favorable for the year due to the strength of our new vehicle introductions in GM North America and price actions to offset FX impacts in GM South America. Total costs were flat as lower fixed costs in Europe were offset with higher material costs in North America associated with recently launched products. Other was $1.4 billion unfavorable, primarily due to FX challenges in South America associated with the Venezuelan bolivar, Argentinean peso and Brazilian real.","Slide 7 identifies special items for the fourth quarter and calendar year that had an impact on our earnings per share. I am not going to go through the entire list, but the items in 2013 primarily relate to strategic actions we announced in GMIO, the wage litigation in Korea, as well as the sale of certain non-core assets. At the top of the slide, our net income to common stockholders in the fourth quarter of 2013 was $900 million and our fully diluted earnings per share was $0.57. The special items listed had a net $200 million unfavorable impact to net income to common stockholders and a $0.10 unfavorable impact on earnings per share. For the 2013 calendar year, our net income to common stockholders was $3.8 billion and our fully diluted earnings per share was $2.38. Special items had an unfavorable impact on net income to common stockholders of $1.3 billion and $0.80 unfavorable impact on earnings per share.","Moving on to the result for the fourth quarter on slide 8, our net revenue was $40.5 billion, a $1.2 billion or 3% increase from the prior year. Excluding the effect of FX translation, fourth quarter revenues increased approximately 4.8%. Our Q4 2013 GAAP operating income included $1.4 billion of unfavorable special items as detailed on chart 7. The prior year GAAP operating income performance also included significant unfavorable special items in the quarter. Net income to common stockholders was $900 million, flat compared to the prior year periods. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.57 on a diluted basis, compared to $0.54 for the same period in the prior year and our automotive net cash from operating activities improved significantly to $2.8 billion, primarily due to the absence of the pension settlement contribution made in the prior year. Our EBIT adjusted was $1.9 billion for the fourth quarter, including $200 million in restructuring costs, overall a $700 million improvement from the prior year. An EBIT adjusted margin was 4.7%, up 1.5 percentage points from Q4 2012. Our adjusted automotive free cash flow was $1.1 billion, flat compared with the prior year period.","On slide 9 we provide the EBIT adjusted by region for the fourth quarters of 2012 and 2013. GMNA EBIT adjusted was $1.9 billion. GME had an EBIT adjusted loss of $300 million, GMIO had EBIT adjusted of $200 million and GMSA EBIT adjusted was at breakeven for the quarter. GM Financial earnings before taxes was $200 million, double the prior year period. Corporate and eliminations was $100 million expense. This totals to an EBIT adjusted of $1.9 billion for the fourth quarter of 2013, up $700 million from the same period in 2012.","Slide 10 shows our consolidated EBIT adjusted for the last five quarters. At the bottom of the slide, we again show the revenue and margins for the quarter. Our consolidated wholesale vehicle sales were 1.7 million vehicles in the fourth quarter, essentially flat compared to the prior year and our global market share decreased 0.2 percentage point to 11.4%.","On slide 11 we provide an explanation of the $700 million increase in year-over-year consolidated EBIT adjusted for the fourth quarter. In Q4 2012, our EBIT adjusted was $1.2 billion. Volume was flat as wholesale volume increases in GM North America were offset by decreases in GMIO and GM South America.","The mix is $300 million unfavorable primarily due to country mix and increased whole sale of both passenger cars in GM North America and unfavorable in country mix in GMIO partially offset by favorable mix in GM South America. Price was $1.4 billion favorable for the quarter due to the strength of our recently launched cars and trucks in GM North America and actions we\u2019ve taken to offset FX in GM South America.","Total costs were flat as lower fixed costs in Europe were offset by higher material costs in North America associated with our recently introduced cars and trucks. Other was $500 million unfavorable primarily due to FX challenges in GM South America associated with the Venezuelan Bolivar, Argentine Peso and the Brazilian Real. This totals $1.9 billion for the fourth quarter.","We now move on to our segment results for the key performance indicators for GM North America on Slide 12. For the fourth quarter of 2013, our total U.S. market share was 17.2% and our retail share was 15.9%. Retail share increased two tenth of a percentage point from the prior year as our fleet market share decreased due to the repositioning of the Chevrolet Impala and generally lower fleet sales. Our incentives for the quarter were 10.6% of average transaction price, which put us at a 107% of the industry average.","Slide 13 we showed GMNA\u2019s EBIT adjusted for the last five quarters. At the bottom of the slide, revenue is $25.1 billion in the fourth quarter up $2.3 billion from the same quarter of 2012. GMNA\u2019s EBIT adjusted margin was 7.5% for the fourth quarter and 8.4% for the second half of 2013, an improvement of over 200 basis points compared to the second half of 2012. This is a clear inflection point as it democrats strong progress toward our mid-decade goal of 10% margins. ","Our U.S. dealer inventory was 748,000 units at the end of the fourth quarter. The increase from the prior year due to industry growth and the continued launch of our all new Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra. We\u2019re closely watching U.S. industry and our own inventory levels and we will maintain our disciplined approach to balancing supply on demand. GMNA whole sale vehicle sales were 863,000 units for the quarter, 37,000 vehicle increase from the prior period.","Turning to Slide 14, we provide the explanation of the increase in GMNA\u2019s EBIT adjusted which rounds to 700 (inaudible). North America\u2019s EBIT adjusted was $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2012. Volume was $300,000 favorable associated with the 37,000 unit vehicle increase in whole sales. Mix was $300 million unfavorable primarily due to country mix and increased whole sales of passenger cars. Price was $1.2 billion favorable driven by our recently launched vehicles. Costs were $500 million unfavorable which can be more than explained by increase in material costs associated with recent advanced vehicles. Other was $100 million favorable due to FX. This nests some EBIT adjusted of $1.9 billion.","On Slide 15, GME reported an EBIT adjusted loss of $200 million for the fourth quarter, a $400 million improvement from the prior year. Revenue was $5.3 billion for the quarter, up $100 million from the prior year and the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year quarterly revenue growth. The EBIT adjusted margin in region was negative 6.5%. Europe\u2019s wholesale vehicle sales for the quarter stayed constant at 269,000 units and market share in the fourth quarter was 7.9%, a 0.4 percentage point decline from 2012 driven by lower sales of Chevrolets.","On Slide 16, we provide the major components of Europe\u2019s $400 year-over-year increase in EBIT adjusted on a rounded basis. Volume was flat with the prior year. Mix was $100 million favorable driven by increased sales of the Malta and Insignia. This is an encouraging sign as this is the first favorable European mix in several quarters. Price was $100 million unfavorable due to competitive pressure in the region. Cost was $500 million favorable primarily due to $200 million in lower depreciation and amortization, $100 million in favorable material performance and $100 million in savings and fixed costs. Other was $100 million unfavorable primarily due to FX. This totals the GME\u2019s EBIT adjusted loss of $300 million for the fourth quarter of 2013.","On slide 17, we show GMIO\u2019s EBIT-adjusted for the most recent periods. In the fourth quarter, EBIT-adjusted was $200 million including equity income from our joint ventures of $400 million, partially offset by a loss of $200 million in consolidated international operations.","At the bottom of the slide, GMIO's revenue from our consolidated operations was $4.9 billion, down $1.4 billion from the prior year. GMIO\u2019s EBIT-adjusted margin from consolidated operations was a negative 2.2%, a significant decline from the prior year as we continued to encounter challenging dynamics across consolidated international operations.","On average, net income margin for our China joint ventures was 7.6%, a 1.5% decrease from the prior year, primarily driven by higher competitive pricing pressures and increased manufacturing costs associated with two new plants coming on line in the near future.","GMIO had wholesale vehicle sales of 259,000 for its consolidated operations and 865,000 for the China JVs. GM market share in the Asia-Pacific region remain constant compared to the prior year due to the continued growth of China market, offset with declines in the balance of the region.","Turning to slide 18, we provide the major components of GMIO\u2019s $500 million decrease in EBIT-adjusted. The impact of volume was $200 million unfavorable, primarily due to decreased wholesale units in the Middle East and RGM countries. Mix was $200 million unfavorable due to country mix and price was $100 million unfavorable due to pricing pressure in the Middle East.","Cost was $100 million favorable because of materials and logistics savings. Other was $100 million unfavorable due to foreign exchange and a slight decline in equity income from our China JVs. This totals the GMIO\u2019s fourth quarter 2013 EBIT-adjusted of $200 million.","On slide 19, we move on to GMSA region and look at EBIT-adjusted for the last five quarters. At the bottom of the slide, revenue was $4.1 billion in the fourth quarter, a $300 million decrease from 2012. The EBIT-adjusted margin in the region was 0.7%, a significant decrease from the prior year period.","South America\u2019s wholesale vehicle sales were 260,000 units, down 20,000 units compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. Although, our market share in the quarter rose to 17.8% on the strength of our sales in Brazil and Argentina.","On slide 20, we look at the components of the $100 million year-over-year decrease in South American operations. Volume was $100 million unfavorable due to the decline in wholesales. Mix was $100 million favorable, primarily due to increased sales of our successful new products in Brazil such as the Onix, Prisma and S-10.","Price was $300 million favorable due to actions we have taken to offset unfavorable foreign exchange and the sustained strength of pricing on our new products launched in Brazil.","Cost was $100 million unfavorable due to charges related to the decision to terminate production of our legacy product. Other was $300 million unfavorable due to the Venezuelan Bolivar, Argentinian peso and the Brazilian real currencies.","Slide 21 provides a look of adjusted automotive free cash flow for the fourth quarter. From our net income to common stockholders of $900 million, we add back the impact of non-controlling interests, preferred dividends and the undistributed earnings allocated to Series B and then deduct GM Financial earnings to arrive at an automotive income of $900 million for the fourth quarter of 2013.","We had $200 million in non-cash special items and our depreciation and amortization was a $1.5 billion expense. Working capital was $200 million source of cash. The $1.3 billion decline in the prior year was due to a decline in payables as we experienced more payment cycles in the fourth quarter of 2013.","U.S. pension and OPEB cash payments exceeded expenses by $300 million in the quarter. The prior year period included the $2.3 billion contribution to settle and annuitize our seller retention plan. Other was a $200 million source of cash, a $700 million improvement from the prior year largely due to an increase in deferred taxes and an increase in dividends from our China joint ventures.","This total was down to automotive net cash provided by operating activities of $2.8 billion. We have $1.8 billion of capital expenditures in the quarter. In addition, we exclude the interest associated with the prepayment of the Canadian Healthcare Trust debt. This totals to our adjusted automotive free cash flow of $1.1 billion, flat compared to the prior year.","The positive cash flow helped improve our liquidity position on Slide 22 to $38.3 billion including $27.9 billion in cash and marketable securities. Debt increase to $7.1 billion compared to the prior year and due to our recent $4.5 billion refinancing transactions. $3.2 billion of the proceeds from the new debt was used to redeem Series A preferred shares that had a book value of $2.4 billion.","The remaining $1.2 billion was used after the fourth quarter end to retire the Canadian Healthcare Trust notes. Series A preferred stock is $3.1 billion after the most recent redemption. Our total U.S. qualified and non-qualified pension plans are underfunded by $7.2 billion, a significant improvement versus a year ago which we will further discuss in a moment. Our non-U.S. pension plans were underfunded by $12.4 billion at the end of the fourth quarter and our global unfunded OPEB liability is $6.3 billion.","On Slide 23 we will take a look at the funded status of our global and U.S. pension plans for the past four years. At the end of 2013 we had a global pension benefit obligation of $99 billion. The first time our global PBO was under $100 billion since 2002. Our global pension underfunded position improved $7.9 billion to $19.9 billion from 2012 to 2013. The first time our global underfunded position has been under $20 billion since 2007. As I relate to our U.S. pension plans, our underfunded status at the end of 2013 improved to $7.3 billion, nearly half of the underfunded amount in 2012. The timing and combined effects of raising discount rates, asset returns and other items partially offset by interest and service cost resulted in a $6.7 billion improvement to the funded status in our U.S. clients. ","Slide 24 provide the summary of our auto financing activities. GM Financial reported the results this morning and will hold their conference call at noon. Our U.S. sub-prime penetration in the fourth quarter remained constantly to prior year at 7.2%. Our U.S. lease penetration is 20.8% in Q4, up 6.1 percentage points from the prior year as we continue to [distant] average. Lease penetration in Canada is at 20.4%, an increase of 14.3 percentage points. GM New Vehicles as a percentage of GM Financial loan and lease originations grew significantly as our financing subsidiary continues to grow its leasing and subprime footprint. GM Financial\u2019s percentage of GM\u2019s U.S. consumer sub-prime finance and leasing remained fairly constant at 19% in the quarter. GM Financials annualized net credit losses improved to 2.1% and their earnings before tax were $225 million for the fourth quarter.","I will now highlight a few items of note for Q1 2014 on Slide 24. January 2, this year we indicated that we do not expect our quarterly earnings scale to follow a typical seasonal trends in 2014. We expect Q1 earnings to be approximately 10% to 15% of total 2014 calendar year earnings. Restructuring charges included in Q1 EBIT adjusted are expected to be approximately $300 million primarily related to the bulk plant closing in Germany and the strategic actions we\u2019ve announced in GMIO. We expect a weaker GM South America Q1 result giving extremely volatile conditions in Venezuela, reducing production in the quarter. Additionally, given the governmental policy actions and currency fluctuations within the region over the past few weeks, a risk profile has increased. We also have increased marketing process associated with supporting our vehicle launches. Additionally, we will have volume and mix headwinds in GMIO as we change over for the launch of the full-size truck and full-size SUVs in the middle of these.","On Slide 26, we remind you the slide that we shared at the conference in January. Q1 as we discussed, will be significantly weaker than seasonal trends. Q2 and Q3 we expect to be similar their trend. However, Q4 will be stronger as restructuring costs are front loaded in the year and China will benefiting from their new vehicle launches.","Finally on Slide 27, we remind you of our 2014 calendar year outlook. We plan to take the advantage of the strength in North America and China to fund our restructuring efforts around the globe. We expect EBIT adjusted for 2014 to be modestly improved over 2013, while EBIT adjusted margins are expected to be similar to last year on a consolidated level.","Restructuring charges for the calendar year will be significantly higher than recent historical trend. We expect to incur over $1 billion in restructuring expense and cash payments in 2014, primarily related to the Bochum plant closure in Germany and the strategic actions we announced in GMIO.","Now here is Mary with her closing remarks.","Mary Barra","Thanks Chuck. In summary, we expected a year of modest growth in automobile industry volumes and followed GM results. More importantly, we are working to accelerate and work under wage to improved results on our way to becoming profitable everywhere we do business.","As you know, our medium-term objective include earning 10% EBIT adjusted margins in North America, achieving breakeven results in Europe by mid decade, delivering mid-single-digit EBIT adjusted margins in South America, posting higher earnings in China and turning an improved results at our consolidated international operation.","We clearly have a lot of work ahead to make all of our regions viably and consistently profitable. This is going to be a multiyear journey that we will see brand building, significant reductions in material and logistics cost and overall lower fixed cost.","We are working on all of these things simultaneously in a very coordinated and fully aligned way. For example, about 70% of our Chevrolet volume in the United States will be delivered through unabated dealership by year end, up from about 60% today.","The global business services team is beginning to implement strategies that are designed to significantly reduce our administrative cost. And we expect that this year we achieve through our product development, purchasing and brand strategy will improve every year. Rest assured, we are confident that we have the team, the product and the plans in place to get it done.","I know we\u2019ve covered a lot of ground today and I\u2019m eager to hear what\u2019s on your mind. So let\u2019s turn out to the Q&A portion of our call. Randy?","Randy Arickx","Okay. Operator, we are ready for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","Good morning everybody. Could you hear me?","Chuck Stevens","Hi, Rod.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","Hey. Couple of things, first just focusing on North America. In Detroit, I think you suggested that the earnings improvement from \u201813 to \u201814 would be similar to what we saw from 2012 to 2013. It\u2019s around a $1 billion. It looks like you got a couple of percent volume growth, maybe 3% volume growth that could be $800 million. You just did $1.2 billion of positive pricing a quarter. So was hoping you can just give us a little bit more color? Are you essentially saying that maybe because the market share isn\u2019t where you like it to be, pricing will come down or are you a little bit more cautious on volume or mix?","Chuck Stevens","Rod, we haven\u2019t really changed our outlook from what we shared back in January at the Deutsche Bank conference. And New York is the key driver year-over-year from a North American perspective. Industry, we still expect to be in the range of $16 million to $16.5 million, notwithstanding some of the challenges we had in January associated with weather.","We expect mix to be a tailwind of year-over-year really driven by new vehicle launches. Pricing and new product will be up year-over-year with pricing on material will be down as we continue to see more competitive actions specifically impact carryover product. And we expect cost to be up year-over-year. Engineering D&A will be up. Advertising will be up to support brand building and launch and the material content on new products.","As I indicated back in January, there actually, we would expect another step function improvement year-over-year, really being driven by the improved industry and our new product launches and some pretty favorable pricing on new products.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Can you talk a little bit about the first quarter in North America. Obviously, you got these two big launches, how significant they -- headwind is that and maybe just thinking longer term into 2015 or beyond. You are talking about getting the 10% margins by mid decade, is it reasonable to assume that you see that kind of progressing positively from '14 to '15 and then beyond. And what are some of the things that we should be thinking about is elements of improvement when we look at next year?","Randy Arickx","Okay. Yeah, first to the first quarter results or expectations for North America, clearly when you shut down full size SUV and go through a launch along with heavy duty pickups that has an impact on overall volumes and mix. On the other side, we're filling out our pipeline, with a new CTS and continue to get good traction on trucks. So I would say that the big kind of headwinds in North America really related to the launch cadence associated with wholesale utilities and heavy duty trucks as well as some incremental marketing expense related to the Super Bowl in the Olympics along with launches.","Relative to our journey to 10% EBIT margins, nothing has changed versus the discussions we had in the past along with that. It is a three to four tranche phase in journey, the first, in 2013 was really driven by new products and improved margins associated with that and improve retail share we got. In 2014 we expect another step really driven primarily by product with some efficiencies on manufacturing and SG&A starting to filter into the latter part of the year. Going into 2015, we really start to expect to get some traction on cost, material, logistics, as we start to launch new products.","And then, the last piece is really business model leverage and that's really all about driving improved retail share and improved loyalty, taking full advantage of global connected customer and that's can be kind of a last pieces as we moved through the cycle, so nothing to really change from what we've discussed in the past.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","So just to clarify, you would think that 15 would be better than 14 even though when you look at new products, are probably going to be a record is a percent with the overall portfolio in '14?","Randy Arickx","Our expectations -- we were on our continuing upward trend in margins from \u201813 through mid-decade. Nothing has changed versus that.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","John Murphy - Bank of America","Good morning. Just the first question on Slide 26, Chuck, you alluded to with the first quarter there being $300 million of restructuring charges. But given the cadence that you\u2019re strong there, it would have appeared that actually went higher in the first quarter. Do you think it sort of aided for the restructuring charges through the course of the year?","Chuck Stevens","In general terms, we talked about $1.1 billion. In Q1, we\u2019re looking at this on a year-over-year basis. In Q1, I would expect that 30% to 35% of those restructuring charges were hit and then kind of worked its way down on the timeline through the rest of the year. The big restructuring items in Q1, number one there\u2019s going to be a fairly significant charge associated with the bulk enclosure. We\u2019ve got ongoing activities, their hidden restructuring and GMIO primarily related to severance payments as we start to look to hold an employee. And then the impact of the San Jose closure in Brazil and the severance enclosure related costs associated with that. So those are the three big items along with Chevrolet Europe in Q1. And you know again, as I think about the year, I would say that you know, more front -- of the $1.1 billion more front end loaded in the first quarter and then mitigating going through Q2 to Q4 coming down from there.","John Murphy - Bank of America","","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Then a second question on Slide 17. You kind of -- had alluded to when you\u2019re talking about IO that there was a lot of competitive pressures on pricing. Are you seeing the Japanese taking advantage of the weaker yen outside of North America, in other markets? Is that kind of what you\u2019re getting at there?","Mary Barra","And we\u2019ve seen that trend all year starting back in the first quarter of 2013 and it really is market specific. So we\u2019ve really seen a lot of price pressure in Australia. For instance, Japanese are pretty strong and they primarily import from Japan. We\u2019ve seen price competitiveness in South East Asia again; another area where the Japanese dominate and we\u2019ve seen price pressure there. So it appears to me that they\u2019re more overt about taking advantage of the weaker yen in those markets that they have been here in North America or the U.S. specifically.","John Murphy - Bank of America","Okay. And then just last, Mary, obviously product is a key focus of yours and the company\u2019s now and it sounds like you\u2019re making bigger and bigger investments in the product cadence is good here in the short-term and this is really seems to be the sweet spot in your product cycle. But as we look out into \u201915, \u201916 and \u201917, once we get through the pickup trucks and the SUVs and the small and mid SUVs are launched in the next couple of years.","I mean, do you think you be able to keep this very significant product cadence going forward or we are going to see a low after we get through this search? I mean, can you guys kind of commit, replacing 15% to 20% to 25% of your product portfolio, I am talking about the U.S. sort of on a consistent basis, let something you think you have the product engine to do now?","Mary Barra","Absolutely, I mean, I think its -- most of our product cadence is really well product through the next four or five years. In addition to strong products and looking at what are the opportunity to commit significant changes whether it\u2019s a powertrain, whether it\u2019s electrification as we look at what the marketplace and what really the customer is looking for in the vehicle. So I feel very confident that we\u2019ve got a good product cadence as we go out through the next several years and specifically with (Inaudible) in the vehicles that are on power train.","John Murphy - Bank of America","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Colin Langan from UBS. Please proceed.","Colin Langan - UBS","Oh! Great. Thanks for taking my question. Any color in China, the margin was down rather significantly, I mean, is that, do you feel confident, you could get back those margins back where they were because you indicated was the combination of both pricing which sound like something that might be lingering for awhile and also about the new plans creeping up?","Chuck Stevens ","","Yeah. For the fourth quarter specifically, the biggest driver that was the incremental cost associated to bring two clients. And we\u2019ve talked about the pricing dynamic in China all year and that is a pretty competitive market.","Looking forward, we expect to see continue margins in North -- in China in the 9% range. And then continuing price competitiveness, but our mix is going to improve substantially as we launch a number of SUVs in that market.","So and Cadillac, we\u2019re going to triple sales of Cadillac in China between 2013, 2015. So we would expect to continue see price headwind but we\u2019re going to offset that with much improve mix and our expectation is, we hold margins somewhere in the 9% range.","Colin Langan - UBS","Okay. And then thinking in GMIO outside of China, is it look like the GMIO consolidated got slightly worst from Q3. I thought, Q3 have some higher launching costs that were headwind. Why the sequential weakness in the region?","Chuck Stevens ","One, there is restructuring charges in GMIO in the fourth quarter of roughly $17 million. Two, as we start to prepare for the launch of the full-size SUVs and the trucks in the Middle East there was a lying down take there because they are selling down the GMT900 inventory that they have. So that\u2019s was the headwind to large extent and mix and price from that standpoint. So those were the two big drivers quarter-to-quarter.","But, I can say actually this, the region outside of China very, very tough dynamic there. We made a couple of road -- took a very decisive actions with the Chevrolet Europe decision that we made and the Australia decision and the whole purpose of that was to improve the foundation for growth going forward and there is more work to do in the number of other countries.","Colin Langan - UBS","And then, GM South America, what was the size of the product termination impact, anymore specific and in fact there were product that were not effect your volume in the region going forward?","Chuck Stevens ","Yeah. I would like to avoid giving the specific product because we still sell them. So it was in the ballpark of $60 million to $70 million in Q4 on that product termination, fundamentally it's writing off the two and this is normal, that\u2019s why it\u2019s not restructuring and it\u2019s not special. I mean when we end production, normal production of a vehicle, there is many unamortized herein, we write it off. So that\u2019s was the impact there.","Colin Langan - UBS","And why the decisions there to terminate the product all of the sudden?","Chuck Stevens ","As we look at our, again, the 2012 plan, we saw actually four legs to that, rationalize portfolio and sell new products, where we make more money than the product that replace and this is just part of the rationalization of reducing our reliance or eliminating legacy products, we don\u2019t make very money on those.","Colin Langan - UBS","Okay. Just one last question, the $600 million GM clear wage. Was that approved and how much of that will be cash and the very implications from your cost structure, obviously that\u2019s a settlement, then I think the wager there now is kind of changing going forward?","Mary Barra","Yeah, we accrued similar liability in 2012 when we had an unfavorable ruling and this specific litigation. We reversed it fundamentally because a very related case had a favorable ruling and internal and external counsel deemed the probability of exposing that to be low. So we reversed that. One part of the ruling that we\u2019re still working through is the go forward provision. So this is the retroactive piece as the ruling came down in the (inaudible) case, the impact on go forward wages, you would improve bonuses et cetera and the calculation of (inaudible). So that could have a headwind on a go forward basis from a wage perspective, but we\u2019re still working through the details on that.","Colin Langan - UBS","And from the cash perspective, there is no cash outflow from the --","Mary Barra","Not specific to the special item at all. No, it was a total non-cash transaction both sides.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Please proceed.","","Brian Johnson - Barclays","Yes, good morning. I want to ask a question that\u2019s really kind of targeted at Mary using the pickup truck market share is kind of a microcosm of how you might be thinking about pricing and promotion, how that might differ from -- for our management teams. So if you look at it, you\u2019re trailing three months large pickup truck share was around 34%, 35%. That\u2019s like 300 basis earnings below the 2012 headline. I certainly remember in the mid-2000s that withdrawal would be time for employee pricing for everyone. So I want to understand -- you know it is actually 33.9%. How are you thinking about that share? Is that your target given the new trucks at least in the half ton segment of the market? And what leads to change vis-\u00e0-vis product and or your pricing and or competitor actions to reboot that or it\u2019s share kind of fine where it is?","Mary Barra","Well, a couple of points; first the truck has gotten great review from a multitude of sources externally in one North American truck of the year. So we\u2019re very confident in the product. We are still getting all the plans online that build that vehicle. If you look at it there has been -- you know, our new product is very effective in selling out the old product. And so there are still 13 to 14 out in the market place. So I think we still have room to get going. We will maintain our pricing discipline, but we will also walk in and react to the market to make sure we\u2019re competitive within the market. But I\u2019m very confident that we have solid full truck out. If you look at -- as I mentioned before, we have the heavy duty trucks coming out.","In the first quarter, we\u2019ve got the SUV and then the third part of our strategy is the mid-sized truck that will be coming out in the fall. So there\u2019s just still a lot of going forward and we have a lot of confidence in these product and we\u2019ll still maintain our pricing discipline.","Brian Johnson - Barclays","And on the CV side, I asked this question a few quarter ago. But maybe you have a different perspective. It seems like we\u2019re seeing kind of a global CUV boom. You\u2019re talking about some product actions that kind of put you in that. But I guess the question is why do they seem somewhat late to some of these regions and is there a lesson learned there either around cycle time or getting the right balance between global platforms and local market demands that you\u2019re going to kind of make different -- try to do differently going forward?","Mary Barra","","I think we have success with the Chevy Trax and the (inaudible) and the Opel Malta making that a very good success story. We have an SUV coming in China. This is a setting of the market that continues to grow and we\u2019re going to get in and seize that. In some cases, I wish we were a little faster in getting the product into the market place. But we have a complete cadence that we\u2019re working through and you know we have I think very good products that we\u2019ve announced and are out in the market and what we\u2019ll have upcoming. Again it\u2019s a significant part of the market and I think we\u2019ve got the right products cadence as we go forward.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley","Thanks everybody. I\u2019ve got a couple of questions. The first question is for chuck and then one for Mary. Chuck, any guidance on the pension expense year on year given how you finished up?","Chuck Stevens","We're looking at overall relatively flat year-over-year. This year, we looked at all for 2013, I had one, but as I look into 2014, relatively flat, nothing material one way or the other.","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley","Great. Chuck, what's for Chinese JV dividend now, meaning on trailing 12 months, how much you pull out of the business, it used to be around a $1 billion just curious, how much higher or similar it is?","Chuck Stevens","Fundamentally, we will end up giving dividends relatively equal to the equity income over time.","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley","Over time but any delay -- because I know it's based on the prior year and there's certain payout, I'm just curious can you quantify how much came out last year?","Chuck Stevens","I'll have to get back with you on that Adam, I think it was slightly below the equity income in 2013, which we expect to catch-up this year.","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley","Great.","Chuck Stevens","$1.7 billion was the number in 2013.","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley","So slightly below that?","Chuck Stevens","No, that was the number that we got which was slightly below the equity income.","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley","Okay, thank you. And then lastly, Chuck, GM Financial, you guys are guiding for stable profit this year, but I'm curious why when we're getting all these new consolidated operations coming in, any kind of one-offs that don't repeat or is it new headwinds that you're allowing for?","Chuck Stevens","Yeah, I think there's incremental costs in building out the platform to help grow in the U.S. to take that business to 20% across all of the different aspects of the business lease financing. And also some integration in systems costs in the international business, there's a lot of work to do, over there from the systems perspective, so I would call it a non-recurring one-time investment in the business.","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley","And Mary just lastly if you were to isolate the single biggest challenge or threat facing the company, both in your domestic market and then separately in your international markets, I'd love to hear your thought and if you were to highlight the biggest threats, for us?","Mary Barra","I guess I will -- ","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley","I'm a glass half empty kind of guy, so sorry.","Mary Barra","Okay, and I'm a glass half-full kind of person, so I would characterize it as opportunities, I mean clearly I think we've got a strong product themes, I think we're getting the recognition in the product cadence that we need to continue to build our brands. I think we all know that there's a multi-year activity, you don't, recovering one year or two -- from a historical perspective, when we look what's in the car park, that's a huge opportunity. So winning products and my goal is that everything that we choose to compete in and around the world, we're going to win in those product.","As we continue to do that we've got to work on the other three [Ps], as it relates to making sure we go to the market strongly, continue to build the brands. I still see there's tremendous opportunity in China, we have the three brands there, Buick is being very strong, Cadillac is a huge opportunity and there's a still a lot of room for Chevrolet in China so obviously those are great opportunities.","Third, you've got to really focus on maintaining our cost structure. I think we've got a lot of good activity going on in very coordinated way to make sure we're not just looking at cost here or cost there, but systematically looking at our overall cost structure, whether it's been the fixed cost of the business or the material cost of the logistics, so I think that's another huge opportunity and we'll keep our focus on each of those.","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley","Thank you very much, indeed.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","Yeah, Thank you for squeezing me in. Couple of questions, just on the outlook. I know that the Trade Auto Show wasn't a long ways away but since then you've had a bit of a currency crisis, which has clearly impacted fourth quarter results, likely to impact fourth quarter and it's likely to be a big impact to your point?","And first, Europe, especially considering you had a -- I think was it $100 million of restructuring in the number, it seems to have come in pretty well. Even though the outlook hasn't changed, would you consider the upside-downside regionally to have shifted a little bit, in particular the question would be for Latin America and Europe?","Chuck Stevens","","I think that's a reasonable characterization, as I indicated in the comments earlier. The risk profile on South America over the past several weeks has increased significantly. We still see, no line of sight and a resolution to the business operations in Venezuela, and at the same time Argentina seems to be a bit more -- significantly more fragile. So I would say the risk profile has increased and in South America I would say emerging market, currencies that move sideways pretty significantly across the world over the past several weeks. All right were not just sitting back and watching this happen, we\u2019re taking you know aggressive actions where we can from both the price and cost perspective to address that. So I would say you know more downside risk now than we had you know a month or so goal on South America and I would say on the basis of how we finished in some of the momentum that feels like we\u2019re starting to get into new year if I was more bullish on outlook versus you know two or four weeks ago I would say Europe feels like you know there could be some upside there.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","And thank you, and particularly on the price increase of Europe I think if, I don\u2019t have the page in front of me but you know it was sort of may be a slight negative but you know how would you characterize the pricing environment I mean with volume starting to pick up there, is that something that you anticipate is getting better?","Mary Barra","","No, and let me go back and make sure that we understand that the reference to outside of Europe let\u2019s start with the foundation for 2014 because we need to declare on that. When we talked about 2014 versus 2013 we said that was going to be a transition here in Europe. Number one, our new key launch is in the most critical segments the GMC segment don\u2019t happen to the latter part of 2014 and 2015, so you know we think that that\u2019s going to be a dynamic that they are going to have to manage to. We also said that we expect a continued price headwinds in the market and I think in our case it's estimated by you know the age of the portfolio in the GMC segment. We\u2019ve got significant year-over-year restructuring charges as a headwind in Europe as well and Russia. Russia is consolidated and part of European operations now with the weakness of the ruble gets created as a talked about back in January and not really a year-over-year headwind. So in the context of say you know we had that a lot and European results are as I indicated before are going to be down year-over-year and margins are going to be down year-over-year primarily driven by restructuring charges in Russia I think that you know my senses from that foundation that is probably some outside but it\u2019s still going to be down year-over-year because of the restructuring primarily.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful to frame that and last question for me is just on the North America walk. You know I guess one thing that I didn\u2019t sort of expect was the negative impact of mix I mean obviously was offset by tremendous pricing but you know can you just explain that a little bit I mean I guess you said country mix which I suppose would be Canada and Mexico but and sort it's the price just given the truck production that that would have been negative.","Mary Barra","","Yeah, you know I would say the mix results in the fourth quarter a bit of anomaly I mean we had indicated for the year that we are going to be flat to slightly positive on mix in North America, we ended up flat. We indicated for 2014, next it was going to be a tailwind and we continue to see that. The fourth quarter one, we had compared to year-over-year, every proportion of production allocated to Canada and Mexico so that had a headwind. Number two, in general, our passenger cars versus struts as a percentage of total sales or total production were up year-over-year, and then the last thing which really was a significant impact, there was a number of full-size pickups in blue from Mexico to United States but didn\u2019t get passed that pay point or recognition point before in the year and that created another anomaly in mix, I would be view this as more than anomaly than a trend.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","Okay, so those trucks will get recognized in the first quarter.","Mary Barra","","Yep.","Operators","Thank you, next question comes from the line of (inaudible) please go-ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Another question regarding the North American walk-in so what do you mean for the 2014 outlook, your cost headwind on year-over-year basis worsened little bit to assist the run rate that we had seen in the past couple of quarters that about you know 500 million or so and you are pointing specifically to its being the materials included and then you the new products that you\u2019ve been launching, so how should we think about that on the go forward basis, is that sort of run rate you think about the cost increases or was that a little bit more because of the launches?","Chuck Stevens","Well, I think it's time to -- launch is the one you recognized, I\u2019m talking specifically about Q4. Pricing and new products primarily, the new trucks that is well the Impala, the Corvette, CTS was favorable over a $1 billion and pricing on new products. The materials cost that goes along with that, so there is new content, right, features on the vehicles were $600 million to $700 million. So that's a big portion of the cost headwind in Q4.","But net-net, it was accretive to earnings at $300 to $400 million or 30% to 40% variable margins. And that's the kind of dynamic you typically have when we launch a new product. So as I talked about 2014 before similar to 30, price was going to be up, primarily on new and major, material costs will be up and newly launched products but net of those two is positive to EBIT and that trend will continue.","","Unidentified Analyst","Understood. That's very helpful. And then more strategically maybe for Mary, as you sort of settling the renewal, what are your strong near-term priorities and specifically if you can highlight if there is any sort of directional change that you would like to implement from the previous management?","","Mary Barra","Sure. There is no right or left turn. I think our growth opportunity is to accelerate the -- from a focus perspective is keeping a strong customer focus. We've got to continue to make sure that we've the right vehicles out there with the right quality. We have work to do but we're on it and building strong brand. We need to continue to maintain our focus balance sheet and again, one of our key areas of focus is to operate profitability everywhere we operate.","And we know we have to work to do on that. So we are focused on that. I think one of the opportunities, that\u2019s creating the President position and I was very involved in putting that role together. I think there are opportunities across our regions that we can seize more quickly to have a very stronger go-to-market strategies also to make sure that we are seizing the opportunities in the product portfolio more quickly and really managing on a global basis. So, again, it's really to move forward with the plan and I think we've got a strong foundation, but we really need to now take advantage of it.","","Unidentified Analyst ","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Ryan Brinkman - J.P. Morgan","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I know you don't host monthly sales calls in the U.S. any longer. So, I got to ask in this form, whether you have any comments on the slower start in software GM sales in January? Are you able to quantify the impact of weather on your sales and shares, I think some of the regions in the U.S. where you share was a bit lower like California or maybe less impacted by the winter storms? It looks like you're maintaining your full year start outlook, so just maybe comment on how much of January slowdown industry wide and for GM is related to potentially one-off factors?","Chuck Stevens","Yeah. I would say, the impact for us in December and January and it look like, at least if you are seeing here so far in February, was really primarily weather related. The SAAR in the month of January ran at $15.1 million and it was actually down year-over-year. And we over index to the Northeast, North Central, Midwest and that's where the bad weather was. And I would say by and large that had the impact in not only in our sales, but also on the SAAR. The good thing is January is the lowest month of sales from an industry perspective. So you can have a $15 million or $15.1 million SAAR for the month of January and quickly recover.","And we would expect to recover most of the sales that we lost in the January as we go through the rest of the first quarter, assuming the weather behaves and into the spring selling season. And we're still holding on our prior view of U.S. industry $16 million to $16.5 million like. So we're going to -- obviously, we're going to continue to monitor our industry and our own inventory levels. And make sure that the industry does recover and it's not, as Mary said earlier, we're going to continue to apply our disciplined approach to managing supply and demand. But right now, nothings really changed based on January results.","","Ryan Brinkman - J.P. Morgan","Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And obviously you're returning a lot of capital to shareholders with your new dividend. But I'm curious what your thoughts are relatively to repurchases and if you were to implement the repurchase plan at some point, whether it might make sense to do it sooner rather than later, it gives them the pullback in your shares in your characterization of 2014 as a transition year with much better results to come suggesting that you may not get a another chance to buy your shares so cheaply in the future.","Chuck Stevens","Yeah, I think back in January we laid out a pretty clear planning level -- capital allocation for 2014. One, we\u2019re going to continue to support the capital spend that we need to maintain that product pipeline and continue to enhance that going forward. We\u2019ve got the one plus billion dollars of restructuring that we\u2019re going to have to fund. In 2014, we\u2019ve got the rest of the Ally International Acquisition in the front for $700 million in that business. We did the rest of the Series A redemption which will be a call of $3.9 billion of capital and $2.2 billion of dividend, 1.8 times and $400 million Series A. So that\u2019s $16 billion of capital allocation. And we think that\u2019s a pretty good plan and the dividend really made a strong statement around how we plan to return capital to shareholders.","With that said, I think we\u2019ve proven to be opportunistic in the past, you know situations arise and we\u2019ll monitor that we go through the year. The facts, you know fundamentally, the plan that we\u2019ve laid out that we\u2019re executing till this year.","Ryan Brinkman - J.P. Morgan","Great, thanks. Then just last questions if you could elaborate on the lower cost in Europe. That looks like overall cost there, hoped to be -- $500 million. And I think restructuring was a drag year-over-year. Can you just remind of that so maybe the underlying costs improved even more sort of pocketed, where did that come from, your distribution bench with PSA, salary personal reductions commodities et cetera? Just trying to -- anything that can help us gauge the sustainability of cost improvement in Europe because people really ask; can you sort of maintain that as volume returns? Thanks.","Mary Barra","Yeah, looking specifically at Europe from a cross perspective, overall in the quarter, half a billion -- purchasing, so material performance and some of this will be associated with the Gefco logistics -- alliance that we have our partnership. It was about $100 million in savings, engineering with $100 million in savings. (Inaudible) and D&A $200 million savings offset by -- partial offset by the restructuring. This is not -- extrapolated on our run rate basis going forward when we look at year over results obviously, you know a lot of the actions that was taken over the past couple of year that reduced our roll of fixed cost base, the next big step, once we get past 2014 will be the ongoing savings associated with the call that $200 million to $250 million a year in savings.","But I think another thing that maybe underappreciated in some of the views on Europe; we had that significant impairment that we took in 2012 that fundamentally rolls down most of the assets and significant savings in D&A. We\u2019re investing \u20ac4 billion or $5 billion, much of that going into tooling. And that depreciable base has started to increase. And we think over the next three or four years, year-over-year we\u2019re going to have increased D&A versus where we were in 2013 as we launched new products. So not all of these are run rate savings. I think we\u2019ve fundamentally driven the business at least on a fixed cost perspective to the right level, we\u2019ll continue to look at streamline that, but not material changes until we get past the bulk enclosure. And then beyond that as it was indicated from the PSA alliance, a lot of material savings will eventuate when we work on the joint programs going forward which are later over the next two or three years.","Ryan Brinkman - J.P. Morgan","","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The last question for today comes from line of Itay Michaeli from Citi. Please proceed.","","Itay Michaeli - Citi","Great, thank you. Good morning. Chuck, a question on the North American margin past 10%; I think when you outlined it initially, it was (inaudible) seven to 10 was a third -- product and then two thirds cost savings, split the material logistics. Just wondering how far along are you now on the fixed cost and logistics and perhaps how far along will you be (inaudible) when we close out 2014?","Chuck Stevens","Yeah, think about this in a kind of three big tranches I would suppose. Roughly 100 basis points of the product related -- 100 basis points of material and logistics and 100 basis points kind of business model leverage over time. I think that we -- as we refine this from 2011, 2012 to now, the fixed cost efficiency we\u2019re going to drive and administration SG&A and manufacturing, fundamentally we\u2019ll offset incremental D&A and incremental marketing cost. So the way I think about it -- a good outcome for us would be flat fixed costs as we continue to grow the business. So I\u2019d say, as we get through 2014, kind of the first tranche of product-related margin expansion. We will have fundamentally played out and then the material and logistics piece will start to kick in with the next generation programs. Because that\u2019s where you are really get an opportunity to drive scale and leverage that scale with global architectures and business model leverage as I have talked about earlier would be the latter piece, not in the \u201815 and \u201816 timeframe.","Itay Michaeli - Citi","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then the question on the 2015 outlook that GMIO consolidated, I think in Detroit you do specifically referred to improvements driven by product launches and restructuring benefits, hoping you could perhaps quantify the restructuring benefits we should expect there in 2015 as well as to have what kind of product refresh rate might you have next year versus this year there?","Chuck Stevens","Yeah, I would just say, eliminating the -- we don\u2019t talk about specific operations within our regional results but we lose money in Chevrolet Europe. So that would be one of those benefits once we get passed that transition. We are looking to significantly improve profitability or reduce our losses in Australia.","So those are the two benefits of the actions that we\u2019ve taken that should help improve. We think about product launch cadence, I mean just think about the Middle East, full size SUV, full size pickups, four launches of those products in the Middle East. We have significant work to do in the other markets as well from a launch cadence perspective we\u2019ve talked about. The B-SUV, the Trax, Encore and Mokka, there is more of those coming down the pipeline. And fundamentally, in the emerging market, the BC-type vehicle is going to be very-very important for those markets looking forward. So I think we talked about 2015 being improved from 2014. We didn\u2019t quantify it.","Itay Michaeli - Citi","Great. Just quickly lastly, any updated thoughts on the tax rate for 2014?","Chuck Stevens","From a book tax perspective, its going to be in the low 30% range. We made a change in including equity incoming to denominator to be similar with \u201814 industry practice which should take us to 30%, 31%, 32% from where we were in 2013.","Itay Michaeli - Citi","Perfect. Thanks so much.","Chuck Stevens","Yes.","Operator","Thank you Mr. Arickx. I will now turn the call back to you. Please continue with your presentation or closing remarks.","Randy Arickx","Thank you, Operator, and thank you everyone for your time today.

Welcome to the General Motors Company First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). ","As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, April 24, 2014. Your speakers for today are Randy Arickx, Chuck Stevens and Mary Barra. I would now like to turn the conference over to Randy Arickx, Executive Director of Communications and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Randy Arickx","Thanks, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us as we review the GM financial results for the first quarter of 2014. Our press release was issued this morning and the conference call materials are available on the Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call live via the Internet. Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the legend regarding forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language.","This morning, Mary Barra, General Motors' Chief Executive Officer will provide opening remarks followed by a review of the financial results with Chuck Stevens, Executive Vice President and CFO.","After the presentation portion of the call, we'll open the line for questions from the analyst community. Marry Barra will then conclude the call with some closing remarks. In the room today, we also have Tom Timko, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer and ","Niharika Ramdev, Vice President Finance and Treasurer, to assist and answering your questions.","Now I'll turn the call over to Mary.","Mary Barra","Thanks, Randy. And thanks to everyone joining us today. It\u2019s an understatement to say that the first quarter was challenging for General Motors. As you know we recalled approximately 7 million vehicles in North America and we faced economy instability in some markets across the globe.","Nevertheless, the company remained profitable and I am very proud of the way the team has kept its focus on the customer. Now a day goes by that we don\u2019t ask and do what we think is best of our customers, what they need and what they deserve when they buy a GM product. I will touch on all of these points as I review the quarter and update you on the status of the ignition switch issue. After that, Chuck Stevens will take you deeper into our results. Then we will answer as many of your questions as we can.","If you turn to Slide 2, you\u2019ll see a summary of our first quarter results. To begin, we delivered 2.4 million vehicles around the world, up 2%. So for the Europe we\u2019re up and we saw record sales in China. This was offset by lower sales in North and South America and in GMIO outside of China.","Our global market share was 11.1%, which is down to 2\/10 of a point, from a year ago. However, Opel Vauxhall gained its share in 10 European markets including Germany. We also gained one tenth of a point of market share in China, based with the growth of Cadillac in the ongoing success of the Buick and Wuling brand.","Turning to net income, we earned approximately $100 million despite $1.3 billion pre-tax charge for product recalls and 400 million special items due to a change in the exchange rate, which we used to measure the financial statements in our Venezuelan subsidiary. Looking next at our EBIT adjusted results; we earned $500 million in the quarter. EBIT adjusted in North America was $600 million which is down from the $1.4 billion we earned a year ago; decline is more than explained by the $1.3 billion recall related charge.","Europe incurred incremental restructuring expense this quarter versus a year ago, and lost money as expected. However, Opel Vauxhall was getting stronger, for example revenue in the region was up 7% and Opel\u2019s revenue was up 9% and operating losses had been reduced.","Looking down the road, we continue to be encouraged by improving customer sentiment and economic growth in the U.K and key Eurozone market. All of keeps us on track to achieve breakeven the results by mid-decade.","In China, our equity income was up about 9%, compared to a year ago, however our consolidated international operations lost money. Stefan Jacoby and his team are actively addressing the issues in this part of the business and we expect improved performance as we move forward.","GM South America lost money in the quarter due primarily to restructuring cost in Brazil and the ongoing challenges of Venezuela. Once again, GM Financials delivered strong results earning $200 million before tax and finally our adjusted automotive free cash flow was $200 million, which is significantly up from a year ago.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 3, where we have summarized highlights from the quarter. They include our common stock dividend and other examples that underscore the momentum we have in key markets around the world. As I mentioned earlier, GM sales in China set a new record in the first quarter and our 2014 deliveries surpassed 1 million units early in April. This is the earliest that we have moved into the seven figure range.","Buick and Wuling are doing particularly well in Cadillac sales more than doubled. At Chevrolet we expect sales growth to accelerate with the introduction of a Trax Crossover, which launches this quarter. The Trax is a key product because Crossover and SUV demand in China is expected to grow at about a 10% annual rate and reach about 7 million units by 2020.","In Europe, our improving market position can be traced directly to Opel Mokka and our new Insignia flagship. Cumulative Mokka orders have now surpassed 215,000 units since its launch in the fall of 2012 and the Insignia has topped 85,000 units since its launch in the fall of 2013.","In the United States, meanwhile, we earned record average transaction prices in the quarter, which reflects a significant 5,000 year-over-year increase in full size pick-up ATPs according to JP Power estimates. For our plan we\u2019re selling a much richer mix of crew cab and premium contended truck today than we were just a year ago. We\u2019re also starting to see the benefit of the new heavy duty Chevrolet and GMC pick-ups that launched in the first quarter along with our all new full size SUVs.","I know many of you are concerned that negative publicity surrounding our recent recalls will slow our momentum in United States. Although it is early it appears we have not experienced the meaningful impact on sales and we continue to be optimistic about 2014 because our award winning new products are performing well and we have more on the way. Our dealers are an important part of this equation as well and we just received more third party proof of just how good they are. And its 2014 U.S. customer service index study JD Power ranked all four GM brands above industry average. Not only that Cadillac was the highest ranked luxury brand and Buick was the highest ranked mainstream brand.","Let\u2019s talk more about the recall. I want to begin by stating in no uncertain terms of the ignition switch recall and the factors led up to it are unacceptable to me, to my leadership team and to our Board of Directors. It doesn\u2019t matter if the roots of the issue are more than the decade old. This leadership team is responsible for making things right and we will. To get the job done, we have some of cross functional team of experts to focus on the recall issues, so that rest of the organization can drive the business forward. The Recall team is been thorough aggressive and proactive on behalf of our customers and our stakeholders.","As you know former U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas is leading our internal investigation and his investigation is on track. When the facts are in we will be transparent and we will hold ourselves accountable. I also expect to have recommendations from Kenneth Feinberg in approximately the next 45 days. Mr. Kenneth Feinberg\u2019s company will help us evaluate our legal and civic duty. We will work through the issues and update you as soon as we can. As has already been reported we began repairing vehicles earlier this month and we expect our ability to supply repair parts will continue to increase throughout the spring and summer. Consistent with our recent communication to NHTSA, our plan is to produce enough repair parts by October 2014 to have the ability to repair the majority of vehicles impacted by the ignition switch and ignition cylinder recall.","Until their vehicles are repaired, we have advised customers to remove all items from their key ring leading the vehicle key to keep option of the window. We have conducted more than 80 individual ignition switch test to demonstrate that the vehicles can be driven safely if these steps are followed. We have also advised customers that when they exit their cars to make sure it is in park or for manual transmissions in reverse gear with the parking brake on. Of course our dealers are empowered to put people in courtesy vehicles or rental cars if that is the right thing to do for the customer.","Today GM has provided more than 36,000 loaner or rental vehicles through dealership. Based on the expected timing of customers coming to the dealership and the need for loaners should be significantly reduced by the end of the third quarter. The cost to replace the ignition switches in the cylinder and pay for the loner cars accounts for about $700 million of the charge we took in the quarter. The balance of the charges for the other recalls we announced in that quarter as well.","The overarching objectives for this recall are to repair the cars as quicker as we can win back the full trust and confidence of our customers, our regulators and other stakeholders. That\u2019s why GM's goal is to have the best product safety practices in the industry. In July 2012, we simplified our product development leadership structures to remove side loads and complexity. In January 2013, we launched a comprehensive program to retool our product quality and durability validation process. To accelerate our drive to leadership we organized and restructured our global product development team during the last six weeks.","In March, we promoted Jeff Boyer to the new position of Vice President for Global Vehicle Safety and he is leading a stronger more aligned and cohesive global safety organization. Jeff\u2019s job includes oversight of the safety development process for GM\u2019s vehicle system, the confirmation and validation of safety performance and the post sales safety activities such as recalls. His team will also be creating new methods in analytical tools to help us identify safety concerns earlier and assess them more effectively.","We also know that a big part of putting the safest vehicles on the road is to ensure we have a culture where every employee knows vehicle safety issues and other ideas forward. This lets us to create the Speak up for Safety program which launches in May. Speak up for Safety we will recognize employee ideas that could make our vehicle safer, we will also recognize them for speaking up when they see something that could impact customer safety. The program will include a global 24\/7 hotline and a micro site dedicated to vehicle safety. This will provide a direct conduit to our safety organizations and our problems-tracking system to ensure a closed-loop reporting and review process.","This week we also rolled out fundamental changes in the way we develop vehicles. Going forward our global vehicle engineering organization will consist of a global vehicle components and sub-systems team and a global product integrity team. The objective is to improve cross systems integration and deliver more consistent performance across vehicle programs and ensure functional safety and compliance of all our vehicles. As Mark said when announcing the restructuring. A vehicle is a collection of 30,000 individual parts, when we integrated those parts into a cohesive system with industry leading safety and quality is the key to winning in this customer driven business.","Finally, we will now require all engineers to have their design for six sigma black belt study in the 2015. I hope you can see that all of these changes and initiatives will help us accelerate the momentum we carried into this year and throughout the quarter. Sure, there have been set back that\u2019s part of our business nevertheless our overall progress has been sure and steady. Our cars, trucks and crossovers are winning awards and new customers around the world. Our product launching is going to make us an even more affordable competitor as we move forward in our largest and most profitable regions are strong. The parts of the business that had weighed down our results are turning around and third parties are recognizing something we have known for a long time.","We have got great dealers who deliver exceptional customer service. This is the payout for years of hard work and it shows the resiliency that our company now has. With that I\u2019d like to invite Chuck Stevens to take you through the quarter in a bit more detail.","Chuck Stevens","Thanks Mary. Slide six provides the summary of our first quarter GAAP and non-GAAP results. Net revenue for the period was $37.4 billion, up $500 million due primarily to the acquisition of Ally International business while automotive revenue was flat year-over-year. Our operating income decreased to a loss of $500 million primarily due to the $1.3 billion charge associated with product recalls and the Venezuela currency devaluation charge of $400 million. Net income to common stockholders declined $700 million to $100 million and diluted earnings per share came in at $0.06. Automotive net cash from operating activities was $2 billion, $1.5 billion increase from the same period in 2013. For our non-GAAP measures including the impact of the $1.3 billion of recall related charges EBIT adjusted was $500 million in the first quarter and the EBIT adjusted margin was 1.2%. Our adjusted automotive free cash flow was $200 million for the quarter, a $1.6 billion increase from 2013 primarily due to improved working capital.","Slide seven identifies special items for the first quarter that had an impact on our earnings per share. At the top of the slide our net income to common stockholders was $100 million and our diluted earnings per share was $0.06. As we advised in our March sales filing with the SEC we had a $400 million charge associated with the devaluation of the Venezuela and Boulevard in the first quarter of 2014 and a $200 million charge in the prior year\u2019s first quarter? This charge had a $0.23 and $0.09 unfavourable impact on earnings per share in each of the quarters respectively.","On slide 8, we remind you of our consolidated EBIT adjusted for the last five quarters. At the bottom of the slide we list the revenue and margins for the same periods. Our EBIT adjusted margin was 1.2% which includes the negative impact of the $1.3 billion and the recall related charges and an unfavourable 3.5 percentage point impact on margins. Consolidated wholesale vehicle sales were $1.5 million vehicles in the first quarter, down about 5.5% from the prior period. Our global market share decreased 2\/10 of a percentage point to 11.1% for Q1 2014. ","On slide nine, we provide an explanation of the $1.3 billion decrease in year-over-year consolidated EBIT adjusted. We are in $1.8 billion in the first quarter of 2013 compared to EBIT adjusted of $500 million in the first quarter of 2014. Volume was $400 million unfavourable primarily due to lower wholesale volumes in GMIO, GMSA and GMNA. Mix was $300 million unfavourable primarily to country mix in GMIO and product change over in GM North America associated with Q1 launches. Price was $1.8 billion favourable due primarily to the strength of North America. Total cost of $2.1 billion unfavourable due primarily to incremental recall related charges of $1.2 billion, increased material costs associated with new products of approximately $1 billion and $200 million in incremental restructuring cost. Other was $400 million unfavourable primarily due to foreign exchange.","Slide 10 gives our year over year EBIT adjusted performance by segment. I would like to highlight that we changed our reporting structure to reclassify the results of our Russian subsidiary previously reported in our GMIO segment to our GME segment. The prior periods have been revised for comparability. GMNA EBIT adjusted was down $900 million to $600 million in the quarter including $1.3 billion in recall charges. GME came in at a $300 million loss including $200 million of incremental restructuring costs. GMIO decreased to $300 million and GMSA recorded a loss of $200 million for the quarter. GM Financial continue to deliver solid profitability with $200 million in earnings before taxes and our corporate sector was a $100 million expanse for the total of 500 million EBIT adjusted in the quarter.","We now move on to our segment results with the key performance indicators for GM North America on slide 11. For the first quarter of 2014, our total U.S. market share was 70%. Our retail incentive levels on an absolute basis are up marginally compared to the prior year period. On a percentage of ATP basis our incentives for the quarter were 10.9%. This puts us in a 106% of industry average levels for the first quarter of 2014. This is down from 115% of industry average in the prior year period as we manage through the sell down of the prior generation of full-size trucks.","Turning to slide 12, we showed GMNA\u2019s EBIT adjusted for the most recent five quarters. At the bottom of the slide revenue in the segment of the business was $24.4 billion, up $1.4 billion from the same quarter in 2013. That\u2019s an increase of over 6% driven by record average transaction prices. GMNA\u2019s EBIT adjusted margin was 2.3% for the quarter which included the negative impact of 5.4 percentage points associated with recall related charges. Our U.S. dealer inventory was 815,000 units at in the first quarter, or about 83 day supply, which is basically flat on a day supply bases compared to the same period last year. GM North America\u2019s wholesale vehicle sales were 807,000 units for the quarter, but 22,000 units decrease from the first quarter of 2013 and North American market share came in at 16.5%.","On slide 13, we provide explanation of $900 million year-over-year decline in GMNA\u2019s EBIT adjusted. GM North America as EBIT adjusted was $1.4 billion for the first quarter of 2013. Volume was a $100 million unfavorable due to the lower wholesale vehicle sales. Mix was $100 million unfavorable, primarily due to limited availability of some of our full-size SUV\u2019s such as the Escalade as many of the new models launched later in the quarter. Price was $1.7 billion favorable driven by recently launched products such as our full-size trucks Cadillac CTS and Chevrolet Impala. Cost was unfavorable $2.3 billion, primarily due to $1.2 billion in incremental recall related charges, 1 billion in material costs associated primarily with recently launched products, and increased promotional expenses associated with the winter or Olympics. Other was 100 million unfavorable, primarily due to FX. This makes to EBIT adjusted of $600 million.","On slide 14, GME reported an EBIT adjusted loss of $300 million for the first quarter, including $200 million of incremental restructuring costs. Revenue was $5.6 billion, up over $300 million and 6.6% due to the success of our recently launched products and improving market conditions as the industry increased 1.5% compared to the prior year. EBIT adjusted margin in segment was a negative 5.1%. Europe\u2019s wholesale vehicle sales for the quarter were 291,000 units, up 16,000 units from the first quarter of 2013. Our European market share in the first quarter was 7.3%, a slight decrease from the prior year driven primarily by the wind down of the Chevrolet brands.","On Slide 15, we provide the major components of GME\u2019s $100 million year-over-year decrease in EBIT adjusted. Volume was favorable $100 million driven by sales of the Opel Malta and new Insignia flagship. This impact of mix was flat quarter-over-quarter. Price was unfavorable at $100 million as we continue to see competitive pressure in the European market. Cost was $100 million unfavorable as incremental restructuring cost of $200 million was partially offset by favorable material performance. Other was flat quarter-over-quarter as the unfavorable FX impact of the Russian ruble was mostly offset by the favorable impact of the British pound. This totals to GME\u2019s EBIT adjusted loss of $300 million for the first quarter of 2014. Overall it continues to improve when all things considered.","We now move onto GMIO\u2019s profitability for the prior type orders on slide 16. In the first quarter of 2014, EBIT-adjusted was $300 million including equity income from our joint ventures. This was down $200 million as weakness in consolidated operations, more than offset the strong performance of our China joint ventures. At the bottom of the slide GMIO\u2019s revenue from our consolidated operations was $3.2 billion. This was a $1.1 billion decline from Q1 2013, primarily due to lower wholesale volumes and approximately $200 million in unfavourable foreign exchange primarily associated with the Australian dollar and South African rand. GMIO\u2019s EBIT adjusted margin from consolidated operations was a negative 8.8%, down 6.9 percentage points from the prior year. This was primarily due to unfavourable mix in the Middle East related to product launch timings. Our net income margin for our China joint ventures was 11.2%, down 0.5 percentage point from the prior year. GMIO\u2019s wholesale vehicle sales were 162,000 units for its consolidated operations and 934,000 units for our China joint ventures where the number of deliveries in the quarter reached a new record. Our market share in the region was 10%, 0.2 percentage point increase from last year. Or market share in China remained a very strong 15.2% for the first quarter, up 1\/10th of a percentage point from the prior year period.","Turning to slide 17, we provide the major components of GMIO\u2019s year over year performance Volume is $200 million unfavourable, primarily due to lower wholesale volumes in the Middle East, India and Thailand. Mix was $200 million unfavourable, primarily due to lower sales of full-size trucks and as you reach in the Middle East, due primarily to launch timing. Price was flat compared to the prior period. Cost was favourable, $300 million primarily related to reduced manufacturing, lower depreciation expenses, in savings related to the wind down of the Chevrolet brand from Europe. Other was $100 million unfavourable primarily due to Korean non-controlling interest and FX. ","On slide 18, we look at GM South America, EBIT adjusted for the last five quarters. At the bottom of the slide, revenue was $3 billion in the first quarter, a 700 million decrease in 2013. This was due primarily to unfavourable foreign exchange associated with the weakening of local currencies in Brazil and Argentina and reduced volume in Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela.","The EBIT adjusted margin in the segment was a negative 5.2%, unfavourably impacted by instability in Venezuela and restructuring in Brazil. GM South Americas wholesale vehicle sales were 208,000 units, 25,000 less than the first quarter of 2013. South America market share was 16.3% in the quarter, 0.9 percentage point decline from the prior year, primarily due to Argentina and lower production in Venezuela.","On Slide 19, we look at the components of a $100 million decline in profitability in our South American segment. And that impact the volume was unfavourable 100 million due primarily to reduce wholesale vehicle sales in Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela, mix was flat. Price was 200 million favourable we took action in Argentina and Brazil to partially offset foreign exchange into those markets.","Cost was flat compared to the prior year period. Auto was 300 million unfavourable primarily due to unfavourable foreign exchange in Brazil and Argentina, these totals to $200 million loss for GM South America in the first quarter. ","Slide 20 provides a walk of adjusted automotive free cash flow for the first quarter. After adjusting for non-controlling interest, preferred dividend on Series A and deducting GM financial, our automotive income was $100 million for the quarter.","We had 400 million in non-cash special items and our depreciations and amortization expense was $1.4 billion expense. Working capital was a $400 million source of cash. The $1.3 billion increased in this category is primarily related to one less payment cycle and increased vehicle production in the quarter.","Auto was 100 million uses of cash, and that 700 million improvement from the prior year, in primarily to the incremental recall accruals these totals down to automotive net cash provided by operating activities of 2 billion. We have 1.8 billion of capital expenditures in the quarter for a total adjusted automotive free cash flow of 200 million.","On Slide 21, we provide a summary of our key automotive balance sheet items. We finished the quarter with $27 billion in cash and current marketable securities and $10.4 billion in available credit facilities for a total available liquidity of $37.4 billion.","Our book value of that was $7.2 billion and the book value of our Series A preferred stock remained at $3.1 billion. Our U.S. qualified and non-qualified pension plans are under funded by $7.2 billion and our non-U.S. pensions are under funded by $12.2 billion. Our unfunded overhead liability decreased to $6.2 billion in the first quarter. ","Slide 22 provides a summary of our auto financing activities. GM financial reported the results this morning and we will be holding and earnings conference call at 12:00 o\u2019clock. Our U.S. subprime penetration in the first quarter came in at 7.9% modestly increase from the prior year period and slightly above industry penetration.","Our U.S. fleet penetration increased 3.2 percentage points to 24.2% in Q1 as we took advantage of higher residual value on our recently launched new products to begin closing the gap to competitive leasing levels.","This penetration in Canada was at 23.4% up 13.3 percentage points from the prior year, as we move to a level of more aligned with industry averages. GM new vehicles as a percentage of GM financial originations closed at 70% and GM financial percentage of GM U.S. consumer subprime financing and leasing was 21% in the quarter. GM financials annualized net credit losses remain low and improved to 1.8% and the earnings before tax adjusted were $221 million for the first quarter, up $41 million from the prior period. ","Turning to Slide 23, although our overall results were overshadowed by the impact of recall charges, we have very strong financial results this quarter, setting aside the recall related charges with total company core operating performance is on plan for the year. GM North America is on plan in early results indicate that our recently launched products have been well received in the market. We continue to expect light vehicle start to be in the 16 million to 15.5 million unit ranges. Consolidated international operations are on plan as we continue to work through the expected challenges of managing the launches of our full size trucks and SUVs in Middle East, as well as the restructuring efforts in the region.","Europe is performing ahead of plan as the industry continues to improve in the success of our recently launched products continue to deliver results. Product such as the Mokka and the redesigned Insignia led by Opel and Vauxhall brands to their highest market in several years this past March.","China is also performing ahead of plan, where we continue to set sales records. GM South America is considerably weaker, as the environment Venezuela and other markets continue to be challenging.","Additional challenges that we\u2019ll need to manage include our known market impact in the U.S. to do the recall actions, foreign exchange headwinds in Russia and South America and political end market volatility in several emerging markets.","Needless to say we have much work to do; the Q1 was strong all things considered. Now Mary and I will take your questions after which we will have some closing remarks. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen we will now conduct the analyst question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","","Okay. Well, I have a couple things that I will throw out there. One is, North America; can you talk about that $1 billion of content cost increase in the quarter? Should we be netting that against the $1.7 billion of price to basically conclude that 35% of that pricing is dropping to the bottom line? Do you need to have that level of pricing going forward? Or do you expect to have $1 billion a quarter of content growth? And then secondly, at one point, Chuck, you had indicated that you were expecting a net cost reduction of around $1 billion in North America in 2015 versus 2014; and there were a few components of that: fixed costs, and logistics, and purchasing. Is that still the case? Or are some of the changes that are being made to product development or warranty accruals going to have an effect on some of those cost-savings expectations?","Chuck Stevens","","Let me take your first question or the first part of your question first Rod. As we\u2019ve talked about before a lot of the net pricing on new products and remember net pricing that we show is the impact in the current quarter for those products that have been launched in the last 12 months. So you\u2019re right the $1 billion of material cost related to content really needs to be netted against the 1.7 billion or so or net price associated with the newly launched products are resulting in kind of a net roll through to the bottom line of 700 million. I think we\u2019ve talked about this before. We would expect to see in the first half of the year pretty significant year-over-year improvement and pricing driven by launch products and then we see it tail off in the second half of the year because we\u2019ll be through the full 12 month launch cycle of the full size pickups. At the same time you\u2019ll see on a year-over-year basis the material cost associated with content drop off as well. So that\u2019s how to think about that.","On the cost reduction billion dollars I don\u2019t recall saying that was all in 2014, I think I indicated that in our glide path going forward to 10% EBIT margins that we expected to pick up about 100 basis points of cost between \u201914 and \u201915 driven to a large extent by material and logistic savings primarily material cost optimization, with fixed costs over that timeframe in the next couple of years being relatively flat the efficiencies and non-marketing related SG&A like global business services, IT and some manufacturing efficiencies offsetting headwinds and incremental marketing in D&A. And I would say that plan still holds and that\u2019s what we\u2019re executing too.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Johnson - Barclays","","A couple of questions and I think the two are related. The first represents, is around kind of the price versus costs trade off you are making, or you made first quarter in pick-up trucks and the second has been overall cadence to GMNA and overall. So the first question your share in pick-up trucks represent 4% to this 35% first quarter. But it looks like you had very good price even net of contract cost. Is that the kind of trade off you\u2019re going to be looking to make going forward through the year? Or do you see stepping up on the volume and down a bit on the price as we go into the spring selling season.","Chuck Stevens","I would say first and foremost we\u2019re going to continue to demonstrate incentive and pricing discipline and I think we\u2019ve seen that through the launch of the full size pick-ups thus far and it\u2019s rolled through our results. At the same time we\u2019re going to be competitive when we talked about the February 6, call that we had the need to address some of the competitive challenges at the lower end of the market, especially Silverado. If you actually look at share year-over-year Sierra is up year-over-year Silverado was down and that\u2019s primarily at the low end of the market. We\u2019ve taken action in March and April to address that so far based on early 10 reads we\u2019ve picked up about 160 to 170 basis points a share, on a retail basis full size pick-ups, so we\u2019re starting to get traction. But we need to do that Brian in a very balanced way, we do not want to give up the gains that we\u2019ve made on mix moving our crew cab mix up and the higher contended premium vehicles that we\u2019re selling. And we think we can accomplish both if we\u2019re smart about our go to market execution.","Relative to earnings cadence I think it\u2019s fair to say back in February and January for that matter we indicated that Q1 was going to be in the range of 10% to 15% I think it\u2019s safe to say we performed better than the 15% as a percentage of our total earnings for the year. Broad based across the board improvement versus our expectations across all of the regions fundamentally cost driven so I think we\u2019re going to see the rest of the year for both North America and the Corp is more normalized Q2 through Q4 earnings.","Brian Johnson - Barclays","So does that imply that there is a step down off of the seasonality? That is, those are going to be seasonally weaker, hence you are maintaining your overall guide? Or you are going to see how the year goes and there might be room to move up? ","Chuck Stevens","Yes I would say that we have not changed our view for the year which was overall excluding the impact of recalls we expected earnings to be up in aggregate relatively flat margins what I\u2019d say is we changed the shape of the curve. We performed better than we expected in the first quarter so we\u2019ll have to trim some of the expectation to Q2 through Q4.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. First question is a two-part question. First, on the recall, 7 million units obviously creates an enormous amount of showroom traffic and an opportunity to convert that traffic into new sales. So could you outline, perhaps, how successful have you been so far in getting folks coming in and holding the hand and obviously helping them with a real issue, but also perhaps helping to convert a sale in the process? The second is, following the expiry of the NOL rights program under Section 382, could you confirm whether General Motors has any more poison-pill type of mechanisms in place that could be used as defense in case of any stake pulling? Or is there no such thing at this point? Thank you.","Mary Barra","Adam I think the first question as it relates to the 7 million unit recall and actually it\u2019s 6 million actual vehicles but when we and when you look at the total amount of issues that were recalled we do see that as a huge opportunity it\u2019s a little too early we\u2019re in the early days it\u2019s just a couple of weeks ago that we started having part kits coming so we can do repairs. Our dealers are well positioned to do that we\u2019ve had excellent dealer communications and actually really reworked our processes to be very responsive to the customer in that we\u2019re shipping part kits by then to dealers to make sure that we get to the customers so we don\u2019t have one dealer that have excess cars and another that\u2019s waiting for cars we\u2019ve also put the tools in the hands of the dealer that they can offer employee pricing to that individual or someone in the household.","And I\u2019d say anecdotally right now we\u2019re getting feedback from customers that in fact there is supposed to one last night that had their vehicle repaired and from the note to me send our loyal GM customer so again your point is well taken it\u2019s going to how well we manage it I think it\u2019s just our dealers have been externally recognized for the type of customer or services that is actually that they\u2019re providing they\u2019re geared up to do this and I am confident that they\u2019re going to be demonstrating our focus on the customer as we go through this and it will have positive results.","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley","Thanks Mary.","Chuck Stevens","And Adam on the second part of your question we don\u2019t have poise until.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup ","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So maybe shifting over to Europe, it looks like, excluding restructuring, GM Europe was pretty close to breakeven. I know Russia is now included in there. So first can you quantify the Russian impact? And could GM Europe actually be profitable excluding Russia? And if so, what does that mean in terms of the outlook for breakeven in GM Europe, perhaps outside of Russia, for the next couple of years?","Chuck Stevens","First, we haven\u2019t changed our guidance on breakeven in Europe including or excluding Russia it\u2019s mid-decade. Second, I am not going to provide country level profitability Itay the regional results in Europe we lost excluding the impact of recalls we lost 100 million which is a 100 million improvement versus the first quarter last year. I would say that certainly a good sign. We\u2019re starting to get traction. The industry has performed better than we expected and we\u2019re performing better than we expected. And I indicated in the other considerations section of the debt that we expect Europe to perform better than planned for the year and I think we\u2019re seeing some of that in Q1 but from an overall perspective mid-decade breakeven is still our objective.","Mary Barra","Yes, in fact I\u2019ll just add to that I mean I think if you really look at the stress in Europe is really product driven and I think Karl-Thomas Neumann has done a good job of shifting the conversations and some of the issues at over to the product to me a really important single is the strength of the Insignia which is the flagship and that\u2019s been very well received. So I think that is a very strong signal but it\u2019s a product driven recovery and the shift in the method you have there is to the product.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup ","Absolutely. And a quick clarification on North America, if I may. Is target still to gain market share for the full year? I think that was the target you laid out in January. Is that still part of the pricing plans and how you go to market for the rest of the year?","Chuck Stevens ","That is still one of our objectives for the year to grow market share year-over-year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy with the Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. Just a question for both of you, two aspects on the recall. Mary, I just wonder if you could comment on what impact you think your recall and maybe the recalls throughout the industry might have on product development costs and speed, basically the cadence of product intros. Then Chuck, it looks like there is not a lot of this that was added back, so it looks like a lot of the cash was spent in the first quarter. Just trying to understand the timing of the cash conversion of the accrual of the $1.3 billion for the recalls during the course of the year.","Mary Barra","","If I understand your question correctly is the product development, I think if you look at the announcement that was made on -- I see the organization acting more efficiently. When you look at the way the Jeff Boyer organization and the global vehicle safety and then the product integrity team is going to pull it together. We have had the chef engineers very involved as we\u2019ve looked at this structuring change that Mark just announced recently with the product integrity team and the team devoted to the components and sub-systems. So I think it will -- I don\u2019t see it changing the engineering cost to develop new vehicles.","And then when you look at these safety organization and our ability, people are putting in place in the way we\u2019re going to work across the organization and I think it\u2019s going to allow us to increase our speed once we understand an issue. And ultimately if you discover an issue and you first discover most likely and then cause it more quickly, overall that\u2019s going to be a lower impact as well. So I don\u2019t see an increase related if in understood your question correctly.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, that's it. Then, Chuck, just on the timing of that cash payment? ","Chuck Stevens","The Q1 cash flow did not include a significant level of cash costs associated with the recall of the pretty minimal primarily related to any payments that we made on currency transportation and or loner. The fundamental cash associated with the recall will start to fall current vehicle sale. If I look at the cadence it\u2019s going to be weighted Q2 to Q4 pretty evenly for the rest of the year that\u2019s when the cash costs are going to roll through the results.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay and then just one follow-up question on North America. On slide 13, mix was a slight negative. Obviously, we had the HD and the large SUVs launch. When do we actually start to see the benefit from those flowing through on mix? I would imagine we'd have seen some of that in the first quarter. But is the bulk coming in the second quarter? ","Chuck Stevens","I would think that we\u2019re going to see improved mix on a go forward basis, Q2 forward but a lot of the improvement associated with the full size utilities and HD will fall into price in Q2 on a year-over-year basis and we\u2019ll start to see favourable mix again on a year-over-year basis in Q2 being driven by full sized pick-ups that were launched last year in the later part of Q2.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your questions.","Ryan Brinkman - JP Morgan","","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I believe that a member of the Canadian General Investment Corporation recently discussed potentially divesting their GM stake this year. So I know you said before that you don't intend to approach either Canada or the UAW relative to their stakes; but that if they came to you, you would be a good listener, like in the case of the U.S. Treasury. So I am curious if you can say whether they have approached you. And then if you can't, maybe just more generally, what are your feelings about whether you think there is currently a buying opportunity in GM's stock for either the Corporation or for investors? ","Chuck Stevens","The Canadians have not approached us yet; we read probably the same press release that you did. I think the best way to answer that question Ryan is we\u2019ve demonstrated the willingness to be opportunistic in past and we\u2019ll have to see how this develops with the Canadian share sales. I think your second question was around, do we think from a General Motors perspective it\u2019s appropriate to go into potentially the open market buyback stock. And I think there is a number of other issues that we need to deal with right now before we think about that, and I\u2019ll leave it at that.","Ryan Brinkman - JP Morgan","Okay, then. Great. And then just on China, very strong margin there, 11.2%. I had thought over the last couple calls that we'd discussed that you were experiencing some headwinds there relative to new facility expansion expense; the investments that you are making to drive Cadillac sales could pressure margin near term but help medium term. Should we think about that differently now? Have you cycled past that?","Chuck Stevens","Well I think what we said for China for the years we expected margins to be similar to 2013 levels, somewhere in call it the 9% to 10% range. Q4 the margins were 7.6% and that was driven by some start up related expenses and we\u2019ve kind of cycled past that. Generally Q1 is a richer margin quarter, if you think about the cadence but I think we\u2019re still feeling pretty good about margins in the range of 9% to 10% or relatively flat year-over-year in China.","Ryan Brinkman - JP Morgan","Okay, great. Thanks. Just last question, follow-up to that. I know that your consolidated I\/O EBIT walk doesn't really breakout the drivers within China, but sort of lumps equity income together. Can you maybe talk about how those pieces are moving over there? How is price changing year over year-end for the full year? Or however you would like to break out price and mix and costs, etc., just high level. Thanks. ","Chuck Stevens","Yeah. High level volume is favourable, mix is favourable as we start to saw more Cadillac and SUVs price is a headwind, the net pricing dynamic in China the holistic is generally been around 3% per year, negative 3% per year, so we expect that to be. Headwind material costs will be a tailwind and fix cost will a headwind as we continue to expand our manufacturing footprint.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","Yes, a couple. Just on the charges, housekeeping. It sounded like what you took, the $1.3 billion applied to 6 million vehicles in total. As I understand that this is something that is evolving, but as far as you can tell with all the issues and costs that are visible now, is this largely behind us as a one timer in the first quarter or you know would you expect if you know subsequent catch up charge in following quarters?","Mary Barra","You know as well look at the whole process, what we\u2019ve got is, is we really redoubled our effort to make sure if there were issues that had been lingering, that we got in, we understood it. We put more people in that organizations to make sure we quickly get to issue. I can\u2019t predict the future to say, what will happen as we go forward, but what I can say is, we will respond to big or small issues as quickly as we can. And in doing that with the speed of responding, allows us to I think really minimize the impact as you get to a smaller population. So that what we\u2019re going to do going forward and we\u2019re going to remain focused on the customer as we look at this issues.","Chuck Stevens","And Patrick, relative to your question. The 1.3 billion that we took in Q1 covers what we think is going to be the overall cost to repair and courtesy transportation for the recalls that we announced in the first quarter.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","Okay. No, that's helpful. And just on South America, maybe we can spend a little bit of time there. Obviously, it is very little visibility on the macro front. But are you -- I know you have been restructuring Brazil; but are you considering maybe more assertive actions? Like potentially rethinking the Venezuela manufacturing footprint, even if you are not rethinking sales in Venezuela, or stepping up the level of restructuring activity in the region. Because it does sound like -- and then maybe if you have a sense of what -- your expectation, even if it is something with wide parameters around it, what your expectation for that market might be that you are rolling with. That would be helpful.","Chuck Stevens","Yeah. Let me start, kind of, 10,000 feet I am working my down a little bit. At the end of 2011, early 2012 we embarked on, kind of, a four pronged approach specific to Brazil, but also cuts the rest of the region and how to take and continue to drive improvement in the region product. But the real launch on, our real focus on product launches and I would say that the most recently launched products are doing extremely in Brazil and in the rest of the region. They now account for about 75% of our volume. So we\u2019re very pleased with how we\u2019ve approached that. Second was to really work on our fixed cost and we continue and will continue to make progress and take actions from a fix cost perspective both SG&A and manufacturing. In the Q1 results we had a roughly $50 million charge for continuing restructure we closed, finished up the closure of the San Jose passenger facility. We just got an agreement with Gravatai and our three-year labour deal with 0% real economic associated with it. So we continue to work through that. The third piece was really to work through our material cost, localization and logistics and we continue to work through that. I would say, it\u2019s unfortunate we\u2019ve made significant progress in Brazil and other markets over the past couple of years. But the economic environment has moved, just as rapidly as we\u2019ve been making changes or make an improvement, and we\u2019ll continue to do that. We\u2019re very strong in Brazil we have a great deal in network. We\u2019ve got a great portfolio now a very a strong brand and that\u2019s the place that we\u2019re going to focus on to win. Relative to Venezuela, we like Venezuela when it\u2019s running normally; it hasn\u2019t run normally for the last three quarters. Clearly, that\u2019s weighing down our results. We see no resolution in the near term we continue to work very, very closely through the Brazilian government and also directly with the Venezuelan government to try to determine when the things will return to some level or normalcy, there so we can build and sell vehicle. It can be a very constructive market. So we are weighing our options very, very carefully there. If there\u2019s an opportunity going forward for some normal business we certainly don\u2019t want to pull out and go back in, we\u2019ve shown before when we do that, typically it\u2019s not a good outcome, but we need to discontinue to monitor that.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","That's helpful. And just on the market, one of the suppliers that reported earlier had a 10% down light-vehicle estimate for the region, which struck me as pretty severe. Any kind of ranges as to what you guys are thinking about in your base plan now?","Chuck Stevens","Yes, as I indicated on the other considerations chart we expect South America to be weaker than expected so if we go back to January our view at that time three months ago was that South America should be improved year over year that\u2019s not going to happen we\u2019re not going to have improvement year over year in South American we seeing a resolution in the near term to Venezuela and I would say I don\u2019t necessarily agree with the 10% industry down take but I would say the industry is softer than we expected in Argentina and Brazil.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Colin Langan - UBS ","Great. Thanks for taking my question. You commented earlier that you are still targeting higher market share in North America, and that April was coming in strong. Are you not anticipating any market share loss following the recall? How are you thinking about the near-term market share impact with all the negative headlines?","Mary Barra","Well, as we look the trades of the product portfolio that we have that\u2019s coming out we\u2019re just on the really in the middle and so bringing out the full size trucks the heavy duty trucks the SUVs we have more launch products coming and we see strength both from the reception and then also from external assessment of those vehicles and we haven\u2019t seen anything meaningful to-date and we plan on continuing to serve these customers well as they come in and that coupled with our products we\u2019re going to focus on that to minimize if any impact occurs but right now we haven\u2019t seen anything meaningful.","Colin Langan - UBS ","Okay. And any colour on a potential civil settlement, at least maybe in terms of the timing you might announce something have been probably [indiscernible]?","Mary Barra ","As I said we expect to have recommendation from tenant in 45 days or so, so I don\u2019t have anything more to comment as you imagine it\u2019s a complex situation as we evaluate both the legal and civic aspects of this but we are working with him and as soon as we have something to share we\u2019ll get it out.","Colin Langan - UBS ","Okay. And then just thinking about restructuring, what is -- is the $1.1 billion that you initially guided to, is that still the right number? How should we think about that, how it plays out through the year?","Chuck Stevens","Yes, the 1.1 billion is still the right number and as we indicated the majority of that is really related to the planned closure of the our facility in Bochum with the balance been spread and the other regions outside of North America we indicated that the weighting would be more front end loaded we had all in about 300 million of restructuring in Q1 so I would expect that to as we move through the of the year to start to come down a bit but still in that 1.1 billion range.","Colin Langan - UBS ","Any actions in GMIO? Because obviously the consolidated operations remain a bit weak and you did have the exit of Chevy. Is there any plans in place there? And when should we expect a restructuring in that region?","","Chuck Stevens","Yes, okay, first obviously a big one is the wind down of Chevy Europe we also announced the succession of manufacturing operations in Australia and we\u2019re working through that as we speak that has a bit of tail on but as we\u2019re going to continue to wide that down over the next two or three years Stefan Jacoby and his team have went country by country and started to work through some of the issues that we have and the way I think about consolidated operations outside what I just talked about the Chevy wind down in Australia is we\u2019ve got to get the portfolio right. We recognize that we\u2019ve got portfolio weakness in Southeast Asia and in India, in South Africa and some of these other markets that we need to deal with.","So that\u2019s first and foremost that starts and ends with great products. And then we need to put in place the right business model around that which means manufacturing footprint dealer network the right level of localization, the right commercialization or industrialization of that portfolio and that\u2019s all work in process. I would expect to see as we move from Q1 to the rest of the year some improvement primarily driven by improved results in the Middle East the rest of the improvement in the consolidated operations that\u2019s going to fall into 2015 and 2016 this is going to be a multi quarter journey.","Mary Barra","I would just add though and I just went through with Stefan of this countries yesterday and if you look at it in addition to everything that Chuck talked about we\u2019ve got the right people. I think you all know this is a detailed business that trucks that you got to have the right product, you got to have the right understanding of the marketplace and go into market every single day. I feel very confident with several country leaders that we now in place under Stefan\u2019s leadership we\u2019re just going to keep and get us in it\u2019s a multi quarter journey but they\u2019re definitely on the journey and they\u2019re looking at it the right way. So I think you\u2019ll see positive momentum there.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Joe Spak with RBC Capital Markets. This will be our last question.","Joe Spak - RBC Capital Markets ","Thanks so much. One quick one. While I wouldn't expect it to be large, are there any costs associated with dealing with the suppliers related to the recall?","Chuck Stevens","What do you mean costs associated, related to the suppliers?","Joe Spak - RBC Capital Markets","I mean, I guess, how are you handling that transaction with the suppliers?","Chuck Stevens","Yeah. What we\u2019re doing is doing everything that we can do to ensure that we\u2019re getting parts produced, the right parts produced as quickly as possible so we can take care of our customers. So we are paying and funding, one needs to get done in order to make sure that we\u2019re getting supply.","Mary Barra","And I would say we take tremendous cooperation with the suppliers, you know working right under the senior leadership of the company. Great participation and they are completely supporting our goal to get parts as quickly as we can to get this vehicles repaired it as quickly as we can. So it\u2019s been working quite well.","Chuck Stevens","And just, the technical point the cost associated with that part that\u2019s in the 1.3 billion.","Joe Spak - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Perfect. And then just as we think about some of the other regions, and I harken back to your comment and North America with the pricing, but then offset for some of the content thing. And you have talked about how improvement in other regions of the world needs to be product-driven as well. So -- and I realize each of these markets are different, so I don't know if you want to go market by market or maybe we specifically could focus on Europe, which I think is the closest to a turnaround. Should we also expect that sort of relationship, where you are able to get a little bit of price, but then you have to pay for it a little bit on the content side? Or is it such -- is that market such that you are not actually going to be able to fully price for the content to be competitive?","Chuck Stevens","What I think that\u2019s the question that you need to answer on a specific product level for instance, as an example. The next generation Insignia, depending the content technology that we applied to that vehicle has, the ability to recover more price than the next generation courses, so we have to be very smart about how we apply content? How we industrialize it? How we make sure that we\u2019re getting cost of product, those possible cost because not every segment can afford the kind of pricing improvements that we see on full size pick up or full size SUVs or CTS vehicle like that.","Mary Barra","I would just add to that, I think it\u2019s getting the right content on the vehicle for the segment and that\u2019s -- there has been a tremendous amount of work done so you have a much better revise segment by market. What is the pre-content that is going to be valued by the customer and therefore they\u2019re willing to pay. And then to look at that there, specially as we look at some of the products that are going to continue to be launched over the near term, a lot I would say better work done to leverage our global scale in the material cost aspect of those product. So it\u2019s a balance between the two, but it\u2019s the right context and then really leveraging our scale on a way we hadn\u2019t done in the past.","Joe Spak - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And then Chuck, just one point of clarification. When you say Europe is tracking ahead of plan, is that sort of core Europe or Europe as we used to think of it? Or is that net of Russia which is now inclusive and you have indicated that could be potentially a headwind?","Chuck Stevens","Yeah. Just to be clear, that\u2019s Europe which includes Russia, we\u2019ve restated our prior results and ahead of plan is versus what we talked about back in January from a Europe perspective, so that\u2019s versus our plan, mid decade breakeven.","Operator","I will now turn the call back over to Mary Barra. Please continue with your presentation of closing remarks.","Mary Barra","Thank you very much. Well, first of all I really appreciate everybody\u2019s question today and I\u2019d like to close this call with a simple message that, I think really encapsulate everything that we covered today and everything we\u2019re doing as we moved forward. If you look at General Motors, as we move half the bankruptcy we have really been a company that had demonstrated being proactive at every turn, and we continue to do that. And I will tell you I have, I have been in many global employee forums and talking to employees you know if they email and other mechanism, there is definitely the culture and I see this as an opportunity, even accelerate our culture change to make sure that we are fast to responding and truly integrated organization really dedicated to having great products. We will continue to save down every issue we have both internal and external and also more aggressively pursue the opportunity, because the sales is in the market place, there\u2019s opportunity to market place. And we\u2019re going to continue to minimize the challenges and really go after opportunity to think in a way we have and almost done. So I hope today's discussion gives you more confidence in our customer focused strategy we are leaving it. And it\u2019s easy to say and put it on the piece of paper as you go through difficult time you have to prove and we are demonstrating that every single day. Our 20, I hope you also have confidence in our 2014 outlook and our long term potential. So thanks for your time and I turn it back to Randy.","Randy Arickx","Thank Mary.

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Randy Arickx, Executive Director of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Randy Arickx","Thanks, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us as we review GM's financial results for the second quarter of 2015. Our press release was issued this morning and the conference call materials are available on the GM investor relations website. We're also broadcasting this call via webcast on the Internet. Included in the chart set materials published this morning we have included the key takeaways from each chart in the notes pages in order to provide color on the results.","This morning Mary Barra, General Motors' Chief Executive Officer, will provide some brief opening remarks, followed by Chuck Stephens, GM's Executive VP and CFO. Then we will open the line for questions from the analyst community. Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the legend regarding forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language.","In the room today, we also have Tom Timko, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer, to assist in answering questions. Now I will turn the call over the Mary Barra.","Mary Barra","Thanks, Randy. Welcome, everyone, to the call. I'm glad you can join us today. I'm really pleased to be able to talk about our second quarter. As we look at it, we have delivered strong earnings growth in the second quarter and we've posted a net income of $1.1 billion and an EBIT adjusted of $2.9 billion. And if you look across our regions from North America, it was strong year-over-year performance in the quarter that was anchored by a record $2.8 billion EBIT adjusted and a 10.5% EBIT adjusted margin.","In Europe, we demonstrated a near-breakeven quarter which gives us confidence as we move forward and in China, we continued with strong performance despite, as we all know, a much more challenging market.","For the calendar year, we're on plan to increase our earnings and margins and consistent with that, we expect our EBIT adjusted for the second half to be higher than the $5 billion EBIT adjusted we've posted through June. So with this foundation, we're confident in our ability to achieve our 2016 target.","To just quickly look at the quarter, our revenue was $38.2 billion, our EBIT adjusted was $2.9 billion and this is the second-highest quarterly result on record. Our earnings per share adjusted was $1.29, up 122% over last year and our adjusted automotive free cash flow was $3.3 billion, very strong, up from $1.9 billion a year ago.","We have also committed that each quarterly broadcast or earnings broadcast we will talk about our return on invested capital. Our trailing fourth-quarter average is 23.4% and I think it demonstrates our disciplined capital allocation is paying off as we look across the globe on how we invest.","With our strong performance in the cash we have generated it has enabled us to return more than $3 billion to our owners so far this year through the share buybacks that we announced early this year as well as dividends. And I am also pleased that Fitch reaffirmed our performance by raising GM and GM Financial to investment grade.","So before we get into the Q&A, I want to couple with this strong financial performance and just give you a couple of examples of things that we're working on and continuing to do to achieve the strategic priorities that we laid out last year.","First, as we look at technology and innovation, we do have a lot going on. One example that I don't think a lot of people know about is we have just completed a ridesharing project at Google's headquarters where we had 50 Chevrolet Spark EVs. We learned a tremendous amount of ridesharing from a whole ecosystem perspective and a lot of those learnings are going into the CarUnity car sharing app that is being launched with Opel in Europe which allows consumers to rent their vehicles to others. So that's just one example in what the urban mobility space, as people call it.","From a connectivity space, we continue to grow OnStar and 4G LTE and we have over 1 million vehicles on the road today with 4G LTE. We will also see OnStar enter Europe with the launch of -- when we launch the Opel Corsa and with OnStar we'll enter Brazil as we launch the Chevrolet Cruze.","I think another important area in this space is with our GM smartphone integration technology. It allows your smartphone, whether it be Apple or Android, to project certain things that you are very used to using on your phone on to the car, not everything, but some key areas. This is really listening to customers and putting them at the center. And you are going to see us expand this to global markets very quickly.","So I think you can expect to continue to see General Motors be very aggressive when we look at the technology and innovation we're bringing into the vehicle and for the whole ownership experience.","Let's move to another one of our strategic priorities or actually two, earning customers for life and building strong brands. Let me just give you a couple highlights here. From a quality perspective, North America we won four J.D. Power initial quality segment awards for the Chevrolet Malibu, Equinox, Silverado light-duty truck and the Spark and Chevrolet had 10 models in the top three of their segments. Just this week they also announced the J.D. Power APEAL Study. Again, we [Technical Difficulty] performance with four segment award winners and demonstrating continued improvement.","From a sales momentum perspective, with Chevrolet and GMC full-sized pickups that momentum was continuing. Share was up to 38.5% for the quarter and that is a 2.9% year-over-year improvement. We also revealed additional products with the 2016 Chevrolet Cruze, the Camaro and the Camaro convertible and they all received very positive reviews with those vehicles.","In China, we achieved record first-half retail sales of 1.7 million vehicles and we gained market share. I think it's very important and I know we will have the opportunity to talk more about China as we go through the call here, but very important an 83% increase in SUV sales and record sales for Buick, Cadillac and our Baojun brand.","And just an interesting fact with the Baojun brand and this actually is a launch that is in July, so third quarter. But the Baojun 560 which is an SUV, within the first 24 hours of launch we had 15,000 orders. Again, we will talk more about China, but some important progress was made in the second quarter. At GM Financial our North America retail penetration grew to almost 30%, up from 10% a year ago and it's important to note the second quarter marked the first full quarter in which we have positioned GMF as our exclusive lease provider. So I think it demonstrates we're well underway with the GMF strategy that we have outlined.","As we look at driving core efficiencies, you will see through the deck and also in the comments that Chuck and I will make as we go through the Q&A, there has been a lot of work done just to continually have discipline in driving efficiencies into every aspect of our business. But another way to drive core efficiencies is partnering.","A very good example of that is a recent agreement with Isuzu in the U.S. to produce the low cab forward trucks for Chevrolet and this will begin next year. This is really important because it gives us a broader suite which is very important for the commercial customers that they want one-stop shopping. So have this not only as an opportunity to have this truck, but also we believe will help us sell more full-size pickups.","So before I turn the call over to Chuck, I would like to spend a minute or two talking about our 2016 targets. We believe the results in the first half of the year demonstrate that we're on track to achieve the 2016 commitments we have made.","If you look at North America, our potential for achieving a 10% EBIT adjusted margin in 2016 is evidenced not only by what we did in Q2, but with eight straight quarters now of year-over-year margin expansion. And on top of that we've got some important launches. We also project that there will be continued high demand for trucks and SUVs and our three-truck strategy is reaping strong benefits. That is even before the refreshed Silverado and Sierra pickups with new powertrain enhancements hit the dealerships later this year. As we look at 2016, our launch schedule again is aggressive.","We will have replacements for the high-volume Chevrolet Cruze and the Chevrolet Malibu. And remember, as we talked about, those have an estimated variable profit improvement of about $1,500 per unit. When you talk about Europe and achieving our goal next year to have breakeven performance, again we're getting closer to that goal. With the Astra launch later this year, we will have full availability of both our high-volume Corsa and Astra in 2016.","And to look at that, those two models represent about 50% of our volume in Europe. And, again, we expect that the estimated variable profit improvement will be about $900 for the Corsa and about over $1,200 for the Astra.","Chuck is going to talk about China a bit more, but I want to make a couple points. First, we expect a more volatile market in China as growth moderates. It hasn't changed our long-term view of China. We continue to believe that the market will grow. There's estimates to about 35 million units over the next 10- to 15-year period.","We're well-positioned right now in that market and we want to continue to be well-positioned to capitalize on that growth. We have a very strong partner with SAIC. We're seeing the benefits of what we're doing with Cadillac and the growth -- even additional growth. We have substantial growth opportunities with the Cadillac brand and you will see across all of our brands we're going to continue to have a very aggressive product cadence.","Having said that, though, I think as we look at a market as it rapidly matures we need to look at other ways to continue to drive performance. And in China we're also doing that the captive finance capability that we're growing, our increased after sales and OnStar. Again, we're going to look at multiple ways to continue to drive the momentum in China, recognizing that there has been a change.","In summary, a very strong quarter with an EPS adjusted of $1.29. We're confident as we execute through this year and into next year. I will look forward to your questions, but right now I'm going to turn it over to Chuck.","Chuck Stevens","Thanks, Mary. I just wanted to take a couple of minutes this morning to provide some perspective on the quarter and the first-half results. In addition to a great second quarter, we also had a very strong first half for the company.","Profitability EBIT-adjusted results for the first half grew to $5 billion, up $600 million year-over-year when adjusting for the impact of recalls last year. And, importantly, EBIT-adjusted margins for the first half were at 6.7%, up 110 basis points year-over-year, again adjusting for the impact of recalls. Great results and results that are very much on plan.","The results were broad-based, with all but one of our automotive regions posting year-over-year profit improvement during the first half of the year. And although we're very pleased with the strong performance year-to-date, we continue and will continue to take actions to further position the company for long-term success.","For example, the second quarter included a $300 million asset impairment charge for GM Thailand. This charge was largely related to ongoing strategic actions to reconfigure and restructure our business, including focusing on core truck and SUV business in Thailand.","We believe that these actions will position the country for long-term, sustained profitability and drive return on invested capital to the target levels that we want to achieve. The restructuring action in North America announced during the quarter is another example of us reconfiguring the business to improve our long-term profitability.","I would like to spend a few minutes on China. By far, that is the biggest concern being raised by our investors and the biggest concerns are around, obviously, the moderating growth in China and its potential impact on GM. So let me provide some commentary on that topic.","At the beginning of the year, we had a really planned for some industry moderation and increased price competition. Our initial assumptions as we entered 2015 were 6% to 8% industry growth overall and 3% price deterioration on a year-over-year basis. It has been clear to us for some time that the moderation is stronger and the pricing environment more challenging than we anticipated.","However, I think it's important that despite these developments, we generated very strong performance in the second quarter and the first half of the year. $1 billion in equity income in the first half of the year with 10.1% net margins which represents margin expansion on a year-over-year basis and a much more difficult environment in China.","We were able to generate these results specifically because we had been very proactively managing the market risks with several actions, such as further optimizing mix by increasing productions of our SUVs. Mary mentioned year-to-date SUV sales are up 83% versus 2014. The teams in China have been aggressively reducing costs by rolling out cost-down\/efficiency-up initiatives and we have been working closely with our dealer body to manage inventory levels.","Clearly, on the back of these proactive measures, based on the results that you saw in the second quarter and the first half, we were able to offset market and price pressures to continue to deliver strong earnings. I think it is important also to point out that GMW's Baojun portfolio continues to expand and that provides General Motors with a unique opportunity in the China market to compete strongly with domestic OEM portfolios and particularly in the Tier 2, 3 and 4 cities and particularly in the fast-growing SUV and MPV segments.","Looking forward, we're expecting continued moderation of industry growth and we expect the macroeconomic volatility to continue. Frankly, based on the current environment, we now expect the industry in China to grow for the full year in low single-digit range versus 2014. And despite somewhat anemic growth in the first half of the year, from an industry perspective around 1%, our low to mid single-digit growth forecast is underpinned by several factors.","First, the launch cadence by several OEMs, including General Motors, that will introduce new models in the second half of the year which should spur demand. Next, seasonality. Typically the second half in China is the stronger half, driven by national holidays in the fourth quarter of the year.","And then, finally the potential recovery from the current reaction to the volatilities in the stock market. Clearly, June and thus far in July there's been pretty significant headwinds on a year-over-year basis. We don't anticipate that that is going to continue through the year, but that is something we're going to have to monitor. Despite our revised industry outlook, we expect to sustain our first-half performance throughout the rest of the year. Specifically, increase market share and similar equity income levels.","There are a number of drivers that give us confidence in our outlook which include our new launches, like the Buick Verano and Baojun 560 SUV that Mary mentioned, continued success of the Envision which is exceeding our expectations and continues to grow on a year-over-year basis, and further growth in Cadillac.","Second, improved mix again driven by recently launched products like the Buick Envision, the Baojun 730 and the Baojun 560. Again, as we mentioned, SUV sales are up over 80% year-over-year and the Baojun brand sales are up 370% on a year-over-year basis.","Third, further cost actions and efficiency improvements. I think the team demonstrated in the first half of the year the ability to be agile and address headwinds and actively, proactively mitigate those. Again, based on our results.","I think it's also important to remember that our first half results and we talked about this in the first quarter -- were negatively impacted by plant downtime and launch costs ahead of new product introductions. We also recognized one of the areas causing elevated concerns in China relates to pricing and let me provide some context in how we think about that as it relates to GM.","As I mentioned before, in the past we had experienced carryover price reductions of about 3% on a year-over-year basis and generally we were able to largely offset that through material cost performance. For 2015, given the increased pricing pressures, we're expecting price reductions in the 5% to 6% range, give or take and obviously this is something we will monitor closely.","As a general rule of thumb, a 1% carryover price reduction at SGM is worth about $100 million of equity income for GM, absent any mitigating actions. And I think that's important, absent any mitigating actions. Similar to Q1 and Q2, we will continue to look for opportunities and we plan to find opportunities to offset those price headwinds, including improved mix and cost efficiency.","As I mentioned, you'd expect the team is working hard on the cost side to ensure we protect our profitability. We're highly focused on that. So bottom line, we recognize the market has become more challenging, but we're confident in our plan and we're taking the necessary actions to help mitigate these headwinds.","Finally, with regard to our total company outlook for the balance of the year, we're very much on plan for improved full-year profit and margin growth versus 2014, very much on plan in the first half. This will translate into EBIT adjusted north of $10 billion on a total company basis and our expectations are the second half is going to be greater than the first half.","And there will be assuredly puts and takes versus our original expectations as we move through the year. There have been already puts and takes versus our original expectations, if you look at South America and some other developments, but, overall, we expect a very strong outcome for the company for the full year.","So that concludes our opening comments. We will now move to the question-and-answer portion of the call, thanks.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache","Was hoping you might just clarify a few things for us. One is, Chuck, that 1% is about $100 million. Last year that was a $44 billion revenue business unconsolidated, so I would think that 1% is over $400 million and we might get half of that. So what are we missing there?","I would imagine that your fixed costs is up a little bit just given the increasing capacity. Can you maybe comment on maybe what the sensitivity is for every 1% movement in volume for you, just given how your mix has shifted today?","Chuck Stevens","Yes, let me talk about the price first. The price and the price impact is largely isolated to SGM. Given SGMW's position in the market, their strength in the commercial vehicle segment, we're not seeing the same kind of headwind. It's really around SGM, so I think that carves off a piece of the $44 billion.","Secondly, that is carryover price. So, similar to all other markets, as we launch new products they are not faced with a year-over-year price impact. So that would be the other driver of that, Rod, why that is $100 million versus just taking 1% of $44 billion. I hope that answered your question.","Clearly on your fixed cost side, yes, as we mentioned in the first quarter and even in the first half, there's some incremental costs around manufacturing associated with the launch, incremental D&A, but there's still opportunities to drive improvement in fixed costs in indirect, in SG&A, in driving overall efficiency. And that is what the team is very focused on in China.","Again from an overall industry perspective, it really depends on ultimately how that plays out. Our view right now is that in that low single-digit growth in industry, we will see a reasonable improvement in passenger vehicles and more headwinds in commercial vehicles in the context of that overall.","So that has a bit of an impact on muting the impact on our overall results. My perspective, Rod, when looking on a year-over-year basis, the biggest risk to us or the biggest risk from a China perspective is really pricing more than industry when we look at the overall picture.","Rod Lache","What's the sensitivity for a 1% move in volume? And can you give us maybe a little bit of insight into? You mentioned two sources of growth. One is the Tier 2 through 4 regions and some of it is coming from the new product. What is the exposure today to Tier 2 through 4 and what kind of volumes would you expect from some of these new products?","Chuck Stevens","If you look at our overall volume in China, roughly half of it is SGM and half is Wuling, broad strokes. And within Wuling is Baojun, so the vast majority of Wuling sales are in Tier 2, 3 and 4 cities and Baojun brand is up 370% year-over-year. So that kind of gives the idea of the opportunity that we have in those cities and the expected improvement there. The pressure in the Tier 1 cities is really where the foreign OEMs dominate. That's where the price pressure is and that's where some of the volume pressure is as well.","Rod Lache","So what is the sensitivity for a 1% move? Is there a rule of thumb that we could use?","Chuck Stevens","I would think, if it translated into a full dollar of revenue it's going to be kind of similar to the price sensitivity. Hard to look at that without factoring in mix and I can't come up with a general rule of thumb, Rod, on that because there's different drivers. It depends again where that 1% would fall.","Rod Lache","Okay, one last thing, if I may. I know I'm taking too much time here. But in North America you are doing some pretty impressive margins, especially in light of the fleet pricing and restructuring costs and recall that you had.","There are a number of things that you have said before that are in your control, like product material cost declines and some of that seems to be coming through. What should we be thinking, if you can just refresh our memory, in terms of the cost reduction expectation, net cost reduction for this year and next in North America?","Chuck Stevens","I will talk about material costs on carryover thus far and overall [indiscernible]. From a corporate perspective, we generated about $1.1 billion of year-over-year improvement, roughly $600 million to $700 million of that was in North America. Our expectations would be we would see that continue into the second half of the year.","Overall fixed costs, again from a company perspective, year-over-year look to be relatively flat to slightly up. We continue to drive a lot of efficiency with operations excellence. So overall cost, again excluding the material costs on new major kind of product programs, will be down, from a material cost perspective, relatively flat fixed. And I think that is also consistent for North America.","Rod Lache","Same cadence into next year?","Chuck Stevens","We will talk about next year when we come out and talk to you in January.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America.","John Murphy","Just a first question on slide 14 on North America. I think you guys had alluded to about a $300 million hit in auctions for some recall action, similar to what we saw in the first quarter where it was a little bit larger. If we were to back that out, that would probably add about 1.1% to the 10.5% that you guys printed. Is that about right, Chuck? Is that where you shake out?","Chuck Stevens","The math is correct, John. When you look at just that driver of the business, look, the results in North America, 10.5% margins. I think margin speak for themselves and clearly one of the headwinds that we had to offset in the quarter was that auction issue and the loss at auction issue on fleet. But as we move through the rest of the year there will be puts and takes as well, but clearly the core operating performance in North America was very strong in the second quarter.","John Murphy"," I'm just trying to understand, if we were to back out those recall actions, as well as the restructuring, you probably would've been doing more like a 12.4% margin in North America. Obviously, there will be puts and takes as we go through the rest of the year and go into 2016, but I mean the ongoing underlying performance is even stronger. Although 10.5% is impressive, it looks like the underlying performance is even stronger than what is generally perceived and I'm just trying to make sure we understand that right. But I think that's kind of about where the math shakes out.","Chuck Stevens","I certainly wouldn't dispute your math. My message would be first half of the year North America generating 9.7% EBIT margins which to me demonstrates that we're very much on the path to a sustained 10% margin objective in 2016. So we're very pleased with the results so far.","John Murphy"," Okay. And then just a quick second question, if we think about South America, a 23% drop in volume, yet there was almost no change in EBIT. I'm just curious, for that EBIT line to turn in the right direction, what would it take. Because you are holding the line on a 23% drop in volume, could we be seeing some small conservation coming from South America on a very small volume recovery?","Chuck Stevens","This goes back and we've talked about this before. This goes back to the actions we started to execute in 2012 and have been consistently executing and that is to continue to drive efficiency in the business model in South America. And the team in South America did an outstanding job earlier this year when we saw the industry performance and the growth and some of the headwinds in Brazil specifically but now kind of spreading through the rest of the region, took very, very proactive action. We talked about that a bit with the Q1 release.","We've cut our workforce, hourly and salaried, by 20%. We're going to see the benefit of that in the second half of the year and going into 2016. Frankly, I would expect for South America to see second-half results kind of similar to last year which is relatively close to breakeven, even under the current economic situation.","Hard to predict what's going to happen, but under the current economic situation I think you're going to see kind of the same cadence as last year. And my take away is we're highly leveraged to any recovery in South America and I think the actions we have been taking over the last few years will put us in position to quickly get into a positive profit position there.","John Murphy","Similarly on Europe, it was a good performance but there's a product launch in the second half of the year and maybe some more restructuring that might go on. How should we think about the remainder of this year? Because it looks like you are getting to breakeven already and just curious if you could hold the line on that in the second half or are there other events that might change the picture there.","Chuck Stevens","Again, second quarter results is another proof point that the underlying business has the capability and we're very much on track to our 2016 commitments. Typically, if you look at Europe seasonally, Q3 is generally weaker than the second quarter just because there's broad-based shutdowns across the whole industry and all the countries. So seasonality would suggest some headwinds in the second half versus the performance in the second quarter.","And as we talked about, big launch with the Astra, so there will be some launch-related costs, both manufacturing and potentially marketing, as we tail out of the year. But for me it was very, very promising and very optimistic based on the results in the second quarter that we're developing and executing to our 2016 commitment. The results are starting to be a proof point around that.","John Murphy","And then just lastly on the buyback program. I just wanted to make sure you guys have a 10b5-1 program in place so you can buy through the blackout period. Also, is that runoff sort of a grid or is there a real program in place so when the stock drops there is significantly more buyback? Just trying to understand how that program is being run and if there's any blackout period or you can just run straight through the quarter.","Chuck Stevens","We have a 10b5-1 program. It will run through the next window which will open somewhere around July 28. We do have somewhat of a built-in flexibility where we can increase the amount of shares that we're buying within that program depending on the performance of the stock.","Overall on stock buyback, consistent with the commitments that we made when we rolled out the capital allocation framework, we've been aggressive. We've been aggressive within the overall objective to drive our target cash down to $20 billion, bought back $2.1 billion thus far of a $5 billion program and we're going to, as aggressively and prudently, as possible continue to act because clearly our stock is undervalued.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays.","Brian Johnson","In China can you give us a sense? You commented on retail versus wholesale in the quarter in the comments, but just how that breaks up from brand and any visibility you can give us into dealer inventory.","Chuck Stevens","What clarity are you looking for on retail versus wholesale by brand, Brian? ","Brian Johnson","Which brand? Yes, in the second quarter which brands did wholesales run ahead of retail? Where did it lag and just how are you thinking about that balance between the two?","Chuck Stevens","If I look at quarter-over-quarter broad strokes in the second quarter, retail was down slightly 1.4%, wholesale was up slightly 1.4%, so reasonably balanced. Where we're seeing good performance on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter on retail, importantly Cadillac and Baojun and in SUVs which are up north of 80%. And that same dynamic holds on wholesales.","But from a dealer inventory perspective, clearly at the end of second quarter as sales kind of trailed off our inventory picked up. We're not way out of range of our target that picked up about 20,000 units and we will work as we go through the second half of the year to make sure we align supply and demand.","We want to make sure that we proactively manage that with our dealers and we have been doing that in the first half of the year, so a little bit out of balance at the end of the second quarter but not significantly.","Brian Johnson","Okay. Second question on China, you have talked about new GM kind of operating models and the discipline we're seeing coming through in North America and Europe. How is that different in China, given the JV structure? And then how do you -- in terms of the cost reductions you need in light of the deteriorating pricing situation, just how quickly can you get your JV partner on board with some of those moves and how does it actually work?","Mary Barra","I think it works very well. The partners work day-to-day, even the -- the senior leadership of the team is very close to our SAIC partners. And so we very proactively, as we started to see things change, together worked to look for efficiencies, looked to seize opportunities in the SUV market. Again, with the portfolio that we have.","We just launched the 560 which is a very important product for Baojun, an SUV. So from the portfolio to managing mix to looking for opportunities, we work on an integrated basis day-to-day with a very strong relationship, so there's no extra hurdle there to go after that.","Brian Johnson","Are you able to move quickly should you need to adjust staffing levels?","Mary Barra","I'm sorry, I didn't hear the question.","Brian Johnson","Would they be able to move quickly to adjust staffing levels or [indiscernible] enterprise to other barriers there?","Chuck Stevens","SAIC is a great partner and very, very commercially minded, so -- and we have demonstrated that. We have regular meetings, they were just in Detroit early in June for the SGM Board meeting and we were there in April, so we're totally aligned on where this business needs to go.","Mary Barra","What I would also say is, in addition to having a great relationship with a partner where we aggressively look at the challenges in the marketplace and how to manage the business appropriately, our head of China, Matt Tsien, was in town last week. And Chuck, myself, Dan and others spent an incredible amount of time making sure we have a good read of what's happening, what to expect and the actions we need to take again to stay in front of it.","Brian Johnson","Okay. And then final question, North America. Just a little bit of rental car accounting. Wholesales were ahead of production. Was that the return of the rental car? Did that actually contribute to EBITDA net of the price impact or was that kind of a wash?","Chuck Stevens","Well, you're right on the first part, wholesales being greater than production largely was driven by auction disposals of rental vehicles. Generally, if you look at the overall EBIT impact, the rental vehicles don't contribute a lot to the bottom line so that extra wholesale was not real accretive to earnings in the quarter. In fact, obviously the auction loss had a bit of headwind impact for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi.","Itay Michaeli","Just a question on China again. Chuck, with the outlook I think for kind of flattish equity income second half of the year, what does that come to in terms of the China margin for 2015? And then any updated thoughts around the prior 9% to 10% mid-decade and beyond targets that I think you talked about for China at the investor day?","Chuck Stevens","So our outlook for the year, you're right with the math once again that it's going to be -- sustained performance in the second half of the year would put our equity income in the range, give or take, of $2 billion. We have not moved off of our margin objectives in China of 9% to 10% net margins. First half of the year we generated [Technical Difficulty] percent, so we're not moving off that.","And we have not moved off our longer term guidance, mid-guidance on continuing 9% to 10% margins. Clearly, we will continue to closely monitor the market in China. We will closely monitor the developments through the rest of this year and potential implications over the next couple years, but we haven't changed our view either on this year or going forward yet.","Itay Michaeli","And then just moving along to Russia. Any update on how that wind down is going, maybe how we should think about roughly modeling that into 2016?","Chuck Stevens","The execution is going very well, very much according to plan. And as I talked about in Q1 when we announced this, I would expect the impact of Russia and European results to diminish as we go through the year. And, frankly, looking at Q3, Q4 it's going to be relatively immaterial based on our current view. So we will have wound through those implications as we finish the sell down and the regular commercial operations that are still impacting EBITDA adjusted.","Itay Michaeli","And then just last question on CapEx and cash flow, it does seem like CapEx is running I think below the original guidance for the year. I know you got some product launches in second half of the year, but love an update there. And also you're still looking for free cash flow to be kind of flattish this year versus last year. I'm not sure if there is an update there as well.","Chuck Stevens","Sure. Capital spend first half of the year $3.4 billion which was relatively consistent with last year first half. We've got pretty significant launches as you think about the rest of the year, Astra, Cruze, Malibu. We certainly expect capital spending and the cash associated with that to increase in the second half of the year. We're not moving off of our $9 billion guidance for the year yet, Itay. We will continue to monitor that as we go through the year.","As I talked about free cash flow before, I said flat to slightly up. Based on the performance we've seen so far, I wouldn't necessarily change that perspective, but I might underline or emphasize slightly up on a year-over-year basis. Our performances on cash flow is a bit ahead of plan, so we're optimistic that we will be able to do better than we anticipated, but we're not changing the overall guidance yet.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.","Ryan Brinkman","Maybe just to hone back in on China again, but kind of dovetailing on that earlier South America discussion. You have proven very skilled at taking out cost in South America when volume declines and the team there is clearly very used to that. But in a downside scenario in China, what do you think decremental margins look like? I don't know that there's really a precedent that we can point the investors to.","So I'm curious whether you engage in the type of downturn planning in China like I know that you do in North America. Any color would be helpful whether regard to flexibility of labor, ability to re-time the capacity expansion, stuff of that sort in the off-chance that we do see not just a slowing but, in fact, a real potential downturn.","Chuck Stevens","First, as Mary mentioned earlier, Ryan, we continue to expect China to grow. We haven't changed our long-term view of China to be somewhere in the range of $35 million and we're not the only ones that do that.","Yes, clearly we look at downturn scenarios. We look at potential implications that growth isn't as aggressive as we thought it was and in a rapidly maturing market there's going to be increased volatility. We're not anticipating a year-over-year sales decline yet, but clearly that is something that we model and we look at the opportunities to offset that and what that would be. I'm not ready to share that at this point in time, but we do that across the whole company across all the regions.","I would say that we have not moved off our guidance for the year and we have not moved off our 9% to 10% guidance for 2016 and beyond at this point in time. And, as I mentioned earlier, we will continue to monitor the situation there and if something changes then we will communicate it appropriately.","Ryan Brinkman","And then how do you think GM is positioned in China relative to some of the changes taking place in the market? You talked about the trend toward SUVs and CUVs. What about the trend toward a greater portion of the sales taking place in those Tier 3, 4, 5 cities or interior of the country, away from sort of Shanghai where you are really, really strong?","Perhaps you can share are you building out your dealer network any differently? Did you already anticipate these changes? What are you doing to remain as successful in China as you have been but in a different environment?","Mary Barra","I think if you look even a couple years back, I think the SGMW team was very good at looking to see the shifts that were coming with the creation of the Baojun brand and then not only passenger vehicles from the commercial vehicles that they are so good at building to the SUVs and with the MPV that we will rolled out and now the SUV that coming out.","So I think it was anticipating where the market was going and that something also, with the partner and the senior leadership. We look and try to look over the horizon to see where the market is going to be, where the opportunity is. Then that is a very capable team from an execution perspective. They have a very good, strong brand reputation across the country.","If you look at this Baojun 560 SUV, it has I would say, some pretty substantial technology in it when you look at connectivity, when you look at crash, when you look at the material strategy with high strength steel. So I think we're very well-positioned and I think somewhat uniquely positioned in that we have such a very important partnership with a very strong domestic maker in the China market.","Ryan Brinkman","Okay. And then just last question. I know you are often limited in what you can say relative to labor negotiations, but I would just observe that it seems like you announced in 2Q a tremendous amount of investment in jobs and factories in the United States.","And I couldn't help but notice that these were ahead of, rather than in conjunction with, the labor negotiations and sort of stood in contrast to Ford which actually during the period of time that you were making these announcements, talked about moving small car production to Mexico.","So maybe you could just comment as to whether this is a reflection of your strong relationship with UAW that you don't need to tie these negotiations in conjunction -- these announcements in conjunction with the negotiations and that you do expect a good outcome with the partners that maintains or even enhances your competitiveness?","Mary Barra","Again, I'm not going to comment on the specifics, but I think when you look at it, we're working with the UAW and having conversations on a daily and weekly basis. And so we're going to look at where we have capacity announcement expansion, new product investments to make and we look at doing that at the right time. It's a continual cycle.","I would say one of the takeaways is it's a continual discussion, and I think we have improved the relationship and both parties work hard to do that. That is not to say that there is not issues that we have got to solve. We're actively working and doing that and using our creative and constructive problem-solving to look at the issues and find the right solution that is going to be good for the company and help us improve our competitiveness, as well as be something that is good for the workforce because the UAW, as you step back aside from the negotiations, we work jointly together on safety and I think our safety leadership represents that, the quality work we're doing. And we're taking that to the next level.","When you look at the scheming that we have done our plants to be able to get more midsize trucks and every single full-size truck and SUV out, again that's doing that in partnership. So that is the fundamentals of the relationship. We'll work through the issues.","Again, we're constantly talking so it's not as it may have been in the past that it's saving things up for the negotiation. But I don't want to underemphasize that we do have some important work to do and we're on it.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs.","Patrick Archambault","A couple of China questions and then one kind of broader product question. Just I think it was hit on a little bit in Ryan's question, but the mix impact, how we think about it net-net some of the trends that are going on? It's obvious that you are having a lot of success in the Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities where Wuling and Baojun are doing very, very well, right? But on the flip side, you have the more traditional SGM products that are more coastal that one would think are higher margin -- they are certainly higher revenue -- that are flattish and down in certain months.","And then I guess overlaying that you have this SUV trend. So I'm just trying to think as we -- forgetting about cost saves for a second, just as we think about the variable implications of those trends, where does that push margins as we go forward?","Chuck Stevens","And let's bifurcate just a bit between SGM and SGMW and we talked about it before when we talked about 2015 and what we expected to do. Pricing headwinds -- and, clearly, they are more challenging than we thought -- would be offset by mix, mix driven by SUVs and Cadillac growth. We're seeing both of that in the SGM channel, the growth in SUVs up 80% and Cadillac is up year-over-year. We always looked at that not only for 2015, but beyond as a way to continue to maintain the margins in China.","SGMW, I think you have two implications. You have the passenger car growth in the Baojun brand that is really going to help us in Tier 2, 3 and 4 cities and you have SUVs. And the SUV market is split between kind of premium SUVs, like Buick Envision, the Trax as an example, Encore and other products sold in the Tier 1 cities and the lower cost SUVs which are a big growth dynamic in Tier 2 and 3 and 4.","So SUVs apply to both Tier 1 and Tier 2, 3 and 4 cities. Cadillac applies to Tier 1. That mix is what is going to help us maintain those 9% to 10% margins, assuming conditions normalize as we expect they will and get back on a growth trajectory in China.","Patrick Archambault","Okay. It sounds like, despite the fact that some of the local-oriented stuff is doing way more than you would have thought, it's still within the realm of being able to stick with that mix statement. One other question, just the impact of credit in China. I take it that's captured in GMF rather than in your China operating segment. Have you guys kind of disclosed an order of magnitude there? Because I can imagine that that is probably starting to get important.","Chuck Stevens","On the finance company equity income?","Patrick Archambault","Correct, yes.","Chuck Stevens","Yes, that will be in GM Financial's results and it will be GM Financial's results that they publish later today. Broad strokes, it's about $25 million of benefit in the second quarter on our equity share in GMF.","Patrick Archambault","And then, Mary, maybe more of a product question. There is no question that from a technology perspective there's a tremendous amount happening, everything down to the 4G LTE stuff that's being rolled out aggressively to the Super Cruise for next year. But there has been a lot written in the last week actually just about some of the security concerns and so I was just wondering how you were thinking.","You guys probably have the most aggressive rollout of connected cars of almost anybody and was wondering just how -- what kind of security protocols you are able to put in place to make people comfortable that those risks are manageable.","Mary Barra","Good question and it's something we have been working on for a couple years now and very actively in the way that we look at the whole system and the levels. Really when you look at cyber security you've got to look at levels of security, because you look at vehicles on the road today, they are on the road for 11 years.","And so as we move into a world that has more connectivity you've got to make sure not only do you have many layers of protection in the design of the vehicle, but then also what's very important is our over-the-air capability as well. That if something happens you are able to quickly go in and prevent and correct if that's necessary.","So we named last year our champion, naming a Chief Product Security Officer, Jeff Massimilla, who is on our team, who lives and breathes this every day. We've partnered with external experts. We regularly do testing, but this is an area you have to stay diligent on and keep looking because it's across all of industry. We take it very seriously, we work hard at it every day and it's a key focus.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with CLSA.","Emmanuel Rosner","I wanted to ask you first about the pricing environment in the U.S.. Obviously in your North American earnings work it seems like, focusing on the retail side, pricing was sort of slightly north of flat which is obviously a pretty good performance.","At the same time, when I look at slide number 12 and you bring back the ATP incentive information from J.D. Power, it seems like your incentives are sort of like just been steadily, but fast increasing throughout the quarter from like 10% of ATP in the first month, 11% and then 12% finally in June.","And then from what we heard so far in July, there's been also increased incentives, particularly on the truck. Would you be able to comment on are you seeing sort of a deterioration of U.S. pricing or a need to add incentive in specific segments?","Chuck Stevens","I will give a broad perspective. Overall, in the U.S. industry this year our expectations are, on a retail basis, a relatively benign pricing environment. We talked about that when we talked about carryover pricing back at the beginning of the year and that's playing out.","And I would expect to see pricing improve as we move through the rest of the year and start to launch some of the new products. In Q3, Q4 or early Q4, the carryover pricing dynamic will continue as it has been in the first part of the year.","From an incentive spending perspective, that will -- as a percent of transaction price, that will toggle back and forth depending on specific go-to-market strategies at any point. My expectation, Emmanuel, for the rest of the year would be that we will be at the run rate we have been for the entire year, somewhere in the range of 10.5% to 11% for the balance of the year. Overall industry has been disciplined. We have been disciplined and we're going to continue to be disciplined, but there can be some volatility within an individual month for sure.","Emmanuel Rosner","And then my second question is on China actually. When I think about China I totally agree with you there is some volatility now and obviously still a very exciting market for the long-term.","The part that sort of worries me in the midterm is more the amount of capacity that's coming in into China. And so when I last met your China team, it sounded like you wanted to increase your capacity from 4 million units to 5 million units over the next few years. Is that still the goal? And to the extent that you would see a pronounced slowdown, do you still have room to sort of pull back on some of these capacity additions?","Mary Barra","Absolutely. Actually adding capacity in China is something that we can do quite quickly. So we will continue to monitor the situation and look at, as we have our plans to add capacity, to do it prudently with a daily read on where the market is and then looking over that horizon from a trend of where it's going. So we will be monitoring that closely and we will only do when we think it's prudent to do.","Emmanuel Rosner","Is there a rule of thumb that you could point to, like how many months or years in advance the plans that are in place will have to happen, let's say in the next six months, a year? And how far out can you actually sort of pull back some of these plans?","Mary Barra","I think there is a lot of different ways to add capacity. You can add capacity by increasing line rate which is more equipment changes or smaller expansions, all the way to an all-new plan and each of those have different timelines. But I would also say China is one of the quickest across all of those aspects of being able to add capacity. Again, those are all the levers we have.","Just a for-instance example, if you see you still need capacity but it might be slightly less than what you thought, you can pick an option of expanding an existing plan or increasing line rate, etc. So we will be looking at all of that, that is something we have a lot of experience from around the globe that we bring to the table as we work with our partner. Again, it will be very dynamic and based on not only the day, the month, but what we see and what we predict the trend will be as we go forward.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Mike Stover with Susquehanna Investment Group.","Mike Stover","Most of my questions have been hit, but a housekeeping item on the cash flow. Could you give us a sense of any cash used for funding restructuring actions and then any cash that would've been impacted by recall-related outflows?","Chuck Stevens","We indicated at the beginning of the year that we expected roughly $1.2 billion of restructuring-related cash and about $1.5 billion of recall-related cash to impact the results this year. Still generally in line with that first half, and second half will be about half. And so very much according to plan on both restructuring and recall-related cash.","Mike Stover","Okay. So if I'm just trying to pencil in backing out what happened in the first quarter. If I assume that half of both of those items occurred in the first half that would be about right, Chuck?","Chuck Stevens","Yes, that would be broad strokes, about right.","Mike Stover","Okay. And then the second thing was on the ramp of the new product in North America. Do you expect for that to have a bigger impact on the incremental cost at the beginning of 2016 or should that begin at the end of 2016? Sorry, end of 2015 rather?","Chuck Stevens","I think there are two aspects of that. There's preproduction start up and launch from the manufacturing perspective and I think that will primarily hit in 2016 and then there's launch-related costs which would be advertising.","On any major program, when you look at both of those, they are roughly about the same. The launch manufacturing costs and the marketing launch costs are roughly the same. So again, thinking about the launch cadence -- the Cruze, Malibu and everything else I would think there is going to be some manufacturing primarily in the fourth quarter and marketing primarily in kind of the first quarter and second quarter next year, broad strokes.","Operator","And our final question will come from the line of Dan Galves with Credit Suisse.","Dan Galves","I had a couple questions on North America for the back half. Is there any way you can help us with wholesale shipments? Typically it looks about kind of even first half versus second half, but maybe with the increased rental disposals in the first half it would be a little lower in the second half. Any color you can give us there?","Chuck Stevens","Typically second half of the year generally in line. I would suggest that as we cycle through the third quarter there we're going to work our way through these auction losses. Then you have the fourth quarter with the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday. So for planning perspective, I would think relatively flat to slightly down in the second half of the year versus the first half on wholesales. Again, just given the seasonality in the fourth quarter.","Dan Galves","And then just going back to January, one thing on North America you said was that it looks to me that you were expecting fixed cost increases related to launches to offset to more than offset the reductions in material costs. It looks like through the first half you are way ahead on that metric with material costs down a lot, fixed costs basically flat. Should we be expecting that still, like some really significant fixed cost increases in the back half or has there been a change in the view?","Chuck Stevens","I think the fixed costs in the second half of the year will be up versus the first half associated with the launch-related costs. The team in North America has just done a dynamic, great job in scheming the business and driving efficiency in the first half. But, again, I would expect to see launch-related costs, fixed costs be up in the second half and similar level of material performance in the second half of the year as well that we saw in the first half.","Dan Galves","And just one more on Europe. Are there any kind of big pieces you can give us in terms of the sequential improvement from Q1 to Q2? I know volume was up a bit and were the Russia losses abating quite a bit in Q2 versus Q1?","Chuck Stevens","Russia losses moderated for sure in Q2 versus Q1 and pricing likely got better in Q2 versus Q1. It did get better as the Corsa and Vivaro ramped up. Those would be the two biggest drivers Q2 versus Q1.","Dan Galves","Okay, so that was more GM-specific than industry wide on the pricing improvement?","Chuck Stevens"," Yes.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mary Barra for closing remarks.","Mary Barra","Thank you very much. Appreciate everybody's participation on the call. Hopefully you saw we recognize that China's a big concern, obviously the market has changed, more volatile. It's moderating.","We tried to really be specific and share with you how we think about China and have that be the foundation for what we think and we're going to keep the pressure on ourselves to deliver in the second half of the year. But, rest assured, we're actively monitoring it daily and also be working very hard to proactively position ourselves to continue to drive the performance that we have. I would also like to say, as you look across all the regions and I won't repeat all of them, but there are a lot of challenges and opportunities in each of the regions. Hopefully you see the GM leadership team is really seizing opportunities and mitigating challenges in a very proactive fashion.","We think our overall results demonstrate the very strong earnings potential of this company. And we believe when you look at what we have been able to accomplish in the first half of this year, it lays the foundation for the commitments that we've made for 2016 that we're very focused on executing and providing the proof point that we're doing what we say we're going to do.","As we move forward, we're going to continue to execute with discipline with all aspects of our plan, including our capital allocation framework and we're confident that we will continue to drive profitable growth, strong returns on invested capital which we demonstrated this quarter, all to drive shareholder value and that is our focus day in and day out. So thanks again, everybody. I really appreciate your time.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

[Operator Instructions]  As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today Thursday, February 16, 2012.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Randy Arickx, Executive Director of Communications and Investor Relations.  Please go ahead sir.","Randy Arickx","Thanks, operator.  Good morning and thank you for joining us as we review our 2011 calendar year results. As you know our press release was issued earlier this morning and the conference call materials are available on the investor relations website. I would also like to highlight that GM is broadcasting this call via the internet.","Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the legend regarding forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. As always, the content of our call will be governed by this language.","This morning, Dan Akerson, General Motors\u2019 Chairman and CEO, will provide opening remarks; followed by a more detailed review by Dan Ammann, Senior Vice President and CFO. Dan Akerson will then conclude the remarks portion of our call with some closing comments.","After the presentation portion of the call, we will open the lines for questions from security analysts. I would also like to mention that in the room today we have Nick Cyprus, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; Jim Davlin, Vice President, Finance, and Treasurer; and Chuck Stevens, CFO of North America and South America to assist in answering your questions.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Dan Akerson.","Daniel Akerson","Thanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone.  Thanks for joining us.  Overall we posted a solid performance for the year and showed steady progress towards a sustained long term strong financial performance.  Obviously, we still have a lot of work to do in some areas and we\u2019re taking the necessary corrective actions to get the ball over the goal line.  More on that in a moment.","For the year global deliveries topped 9 million vehicles, up nearly 8% over 2010.  In fact, we increased sales volume in each of our four regions.  Not only our total sales volumes up but also was our overall market share.  Global markets share came in at roughly 12%, 11.9% to be precise, up 0.4 percentage points.","We gained share in our most critical markets. Our US share was 19.2%, up 0.4 percentage points.  China share was up 0.7 percentage points to 13.6%.  In fact we grew it more than three times the market and we were the first company to sell more than 2 million vehicles in China in two successive years and each year we do it earlier in the year which is good news.","We also had good growth in emerging market such as Russia where we were up over 53% versus 2010, and we\u2019re making significant progress and establishing our brands as aspirational. For example, Buick outsold the Audi A4, the Lexus IS250, and the Acura TSX in the US last year who would have thought that three years ago.","In addition, 40% of Buick customers in the US were conquest sales, away from non-GM brands. This increase in volume in share translated the top line revenue growth with revenue up more than a $150 billion, up almost a 11% year-over-year.","Our net income for the year was $7.6 billion, though it\u2019s on the chart our net income for fourth quarter 2011 after adjusting for special items in restructuring cost, it was above $900 million, up 6% versus the fourth quarter in 2010 on the same basis.","While full year revenue increased 11% we showed our operating leverage even in the midst of unfavorable mix shifts which we want to do, more cars, fewer trucks, SUVs, etcetera.  We improved our EBIT adjust from $7 billion to $8.3 billion or an 18% improvement over 2010.","GM North America delivered very strong results making $7.2 billion for the year with increased volume and favorable pricing, thanks to a vehicle portfolio that continues to gain traction with the American public, and a renewed small and compact car strategy that is starting to payoff.  GME while improving from 2010 levels still posted an unacceptable loss of $700 million in a rather challenging market not only for GM Opel\/Vauxhall but also for our competition.","GMIO posted solid EBIT adjusted result of $1.9 billion for the year, though this was down $400 million from 2010 levels. Our equity income from joint ventures was actually up about 200 million for the year, or results as the consolidated operations level more than offset this.","GM South America had a slight loss of a $100 million for the year, down $900 million from 2010. We plan to aggressively refresh our somewhat aging vehicle portfolio in South America while also executing stringent cost control actions in the short term. In fact we have seven new vehicles launching in 2012 alone. If the first two product launches are any indication, we should start to see some stability in growth in this area.","Based on these earnings we generated $7.4 billion in automotive cash flow from operations. This allowed us to deploy some of the cash before significantly ramping up our capital expenditure rate, about $6.2 billion, while still retaining positive automotive free cash flow of $1.2 billion and increasing our available liquidity by $4 billion versus yearend 2010.","Away from the numbers, we had a busy fourth quarter with a number of initiatives as accomplishments. As it marked its 100th birthday Chevrolet celebrated 2011 with record global sales. Sales totaled above 4.8 million vehicles that\u2019s a new Chevrolet every 6.5 seconds. Three million of those Chevrolets were sold outside the United States, a sign of the strength of our global brand.","In fact Chevrolet gained sales in the top five global markets in 2011. We\u2019ve already sold more than a million cruisers around the world since our 2009 launch.  The new Sonic has outsold Ford Fiesta in the first three months. We formally implemented the Canadian Healthcare Trust during the quarter. This is another important step towards improving our fortress balance sheet even further as we reduced our OPEB liabilities about $3 billion. As part of our effort to return GM Europe to sustainable profitability we made a few important management appointments during the quarter.  First, we named Karl Stracke, President of GME and CEO of Opel\/Vauxhall. We also appointed Steve Girsky as Chairman of the Supervisory Board.  We named Dan Ammann, Tim Lee who runs international operations, and Mary Barra who runs our Global Product Operations Business to the Supervisory Board as well.  Dan will soon touch on some of the plans we have for this group and plan to execute in the coming year.","Lastly, we announced some important new products and features, the Chevy Malibu, the Cadillac XTS, Cadillac CUE to be available on the XTS, ATS, and SRX models.  We will also be joined soon by some other great vehicles including the Cadillac ATS, Chevrolet Spark, Buick Encore just to name a few.","I only recite these important milestones because there are many good things happening with GM. We need to press on these efforts but make no mistake, we know well what our challenges are and we\u2019re assessing them, more to come later in the call.  But at this time, I would like to turn it over to Dan Ammann for a more detailed inspection of the results.","Daniel Ammann","Thanks Dan.  Before we get into the detail, I\u2019d like to mention that we\u2019ve further refined and simplified some of our charts, focusing the managerial discussion on EBIT adjusted.  This is consistent with how we manage the business. In addition, we have now separately displayed the volume and experiences on the EBIT bridges and consolidated some other aspects of the presentation.","Beginning on slide 4, where we provide a summary of our 2011 calendar year results compared to the prior year, net revenues were a $150 billion for 2011, up $14.7 billion from 2010. Operating income was $5.7 billion, up $600 million versus the prior year  Net income to common stockholders was $7.6 billion and earnings per share were $4.58 on a fully diluted basis compared to $2.89 from the prior year including the impact of special items. Our automotive net cash from operating activities was $7.4 billion for the year.","Moving to the non-GAAP metrics from the bottom of the page EBIT adjusted was $8.3 billion for 2011 up $1.3 billion from 2010. The EBIT adjusted margin was 5.5%, an increase of 30 basis points from the prior year.","Automotive free cash flow was $1.2 billion down $1.2 billion versus the prior year.  The 2011 free cash flow includes an unfavorable $1.1 billion related to determination of in transit financing in the first quarter and an $800 million contribution to the Canadian Healthcare trust in the fourth quarter. ","The 2010 free cash flow includes a $4 billion voluntary contribution to US pension plans. As Dan said, our results for the 2011 calendar year was solid and showed progress,1 we\u2019ve more work to do in many areas of the business.","Turning to slide 5, we list these special items in adjustments impacting the 2011 calendar year earnings.  Net income to common stockholders was $7.6 billion and our fully diluted earnings per share were $4.58. Included in both of these metrics for the special items you see listed here which totaled a favorable $1.2 billion or $0.70 per share on a fully diluted basis for 2011.","Turning to slide 6, we provided 2011 comparison of our consolidated EBIT adjusted to the prior year.  Starting on the left our consolidated EBIT adjusted was $7 billion for 2010. In the middle portion of the slide we worked $1.3 billion improvement for the calendar year.","Volume was favorable $2.4 billion, largely driven by 7.6% increase in the industry and a 0.4% increase in our global market share. Mix was unfavorable $1.7 billion, largely due to higher compact and small car volume in GMNA, as we\u2019ve moved rapidly into leadership positions with Cruze, Sonic and Verano.","Price was favorable $1.6 billion for the year due to actions we\u2019ve taken to enhance revenue in every region and us getting rewarded for the quality of our product in the market place. Costs were unfavorable $1.7 billion, which included $1.2 billion in increased material costs, $700 million in increased engineering expense, $500 million in higher manufacturing expense, and $400 million reduction in favorable restructuring reserve adjustments in 2010, partially offset with $800 million in favorable D&A and $400 million in favorable pension income.","Other was favorable $700 million for the year due to the $500 million in favorable earnings before tax from the full year inclusion of GM financial and $300 million lower restructuring charges. This totals to consolidated EBIT adjusted of $8.3 billion.","On slide 7, we provide the composition of EBIT adjusted by region for the 2010 and 2011 calendar years.  GMNA EBIT adjusted was a strong $7.2 billion for the year, up $1.5 billion from the prior year.  GME\u2019s EBIT adjusted was a loss of $700 million for the year but still a significant $1.3 billion improvement from 2010.","Also EBIT adjusted before restructuring is memo items which is $400 million for the year and $800 million improvement over 2010.  GMIO had an EBIT adjusted of $1.9 billion, down $400 million versus the prior year, and GMSA\u2019s EBIT adjusted was a loss of $100 million which was $900 million unfavorable versus 2010.","Excluding restructuring GMSA was breakeven for the year.  GM financial reported pretax results of $600 million for the year, which was a $500 million improvement given the partial year reporting in 2010 as well as improvement on the core profitability of the business.","Corporate eliminations were 500 million unfavorable for \u201911 versus a $100 million favorable for the prior year reflecting $300 million unfavorable for foreign currency movements, $200 million unfavorable due to the absence of a favorable reserve adjustment in 2010 and some other small items.  This nets to EBIT adjusted of $8.3 billion for the calendar year.","On slide 8, we move on to a summary of results for the fourth quarter 2011 results compared to same period in 2010. Net revenues were $38 billion for the quarter up $1.1 billion versus the prior year. Operating income was $500 million, up $200 million versus 2010.  Net income to common stockholders was $500 million unchanged from 2010.","Earnings per share were $0.28 on a fully diluted basis compared to $0.31 from the prior year, and our automotive net cash from operating activities was $1.2 billion. Moving to the non-GAAP metrics on the bottom of the page, EBIT adjusted was $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2011, up $100 million versus the prior year, and slightly ahead of the guidance that we gave you on our third quarter earnings called particularly when you take into account more than $200 million of restructuring charges incurred in the quarter. The EBIT adjusted margin for the quarter was 2.9 percentage points, up 0.1 percentage points from 2010.","Automotive free cash flow was $900 million unfavorable, but this includes the $800 million contributions of the Canadian Healthcare Trust as well as a higher level of capital spending in the quarter.","Turning to slide 9, we list the special items in adjustments impacting earnings in the fourth quarter. Our net income to common stockholders was $500 million and our fully diluted earnings per share was $0.28 for the fourth quarter 2011. Included in both of these figures is a $900 million goodwill impairment for operations in GME and GMIO, a $700 million gain for the implementation of a Canadian Healthcare Trust, a $600 million impairment in our investment in LI [ph], a $100 million gain on the Extinguishment of Debt, and a $400 million gain for the release of the deferred tax evaluation allowance in Australia.","In total these special items reduced net income to common stockholders by $200 million in the fourth quarter, or $0.11 per share on a fully diluted basis.","On slide 10 we provide the composition of EBIT adjusted by region for the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2011.  GMNA\u2019s EBIT adjusted was $1.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2011, up $700 million from the prior year.  GME\u2019s EBIT adjusted was a loss of $600 million essentially no change from 2010 however slightly improved on a restructuring basis.","GMIO had an EBIT adjusted of $400 million, a $100 million improvement versus the prior year, and GMSA\u2019s EBIT adjusted was a $200 million loss including a $100 million of restructuring, down $400 million from 2010.","GM Financial reported pre-tax results of $200 million, an improvement from the previous year. Corporate eliminations was $200 million unfavorable for the fourth quarter versus a $200 million favorable for the prior year resulting from the absence of the favorable reserve adjustment in 2010 that I mentioned earlier. This nets to an EBIT adjusted of $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2011.","Slide 11, shows our consolidated EBIT adjusted for the last five quarters. As we previously covered, we posted EBIT adjusted of $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2011, up a $100 million from the prior year. The seasonality of results for 2011 is typical of what we expect to see going forward.","Moving to the bottom of the slide, our operating income margin was 1.2% for the quarter, 2.4 percentage point improvement from the same period in 2010. Our EBIT adjusted margin was 2.9%, a 0.1 percentage point increase from the prior year. This is related primarily to stronger performance in GMNA offset with a decline in GM South America, which we will cover in the segment reviews.","Our global production numbers continue to increase on a year-over-year basis. Net global market share was 11.7% for the fourth quarter up 0.2 percentage points from the prior year.","Turning to slide 12, we provide a year-over-year comparison of our consolidated EBIT adjusted for the fourth quarter. Starting on the left, our EBIT adjusted was $1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2010. Moving to the middle portion of the slide, we had a $100 million improvement. Volume was $300 million favorable largely driven by 2% increase in the industry and a slight increase in our market share.","Mix was $600 million unfavorable compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, due primarily to higher compact car and small car volume in GMNA with the successful launches of Sonic and Verano.","Price was favorable $800 million for the quarter demonstrating the strength of our products across all regions. Costs were favorable $200 million and other was unfavorable $500 million reflecting the $400 million unfavorable performance in the corporate sector we discussed previously. This totals to a consolidated EBIT adjusted of $1.1 billion.","On slide 13, we provide what we view as key performance indicators for GM North America. The two lines on top of the slide represents GM\u2019s U.S. total and retail share. The bars on the slide represent GM\u2019s average U.S. retail incentives on a per unit basis, and our U.S. retail incentives spending as a percentage of average transaction price and in comparison to the industry average, is noted on the bottom of the slide.","For the fourth quarter of 2011, our U.S. retail share was 17%, down 0.9 percentage points versus the prior year. Our incentive levels on an absolute basis have remained unchanged from the prior year but have increased from the third quarter due to continued sell down from the prior model year vehicles in the industry.","On a percentage of ATP basis our incentives were 10%, up 0.1% from the prior year. This puts us at a 108% of industry average levels for the fourth quarter of 2011.","For January, our retail market share was 16.1% and our incentives were 10% of ATP. In terms of incentive levels, our continuing goal is to be at approximately industry average on a percentage of ATP basis.","On slide 14, we have GMNA\u2019s EBIT adjusted for the last five quarters. GMNA\u2019s EBIT adjusted was $1.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2011, up $700 million versus the prior year. Moving to the bottom of the slide, revenue was $23.1 billion, up $1.1 billion versus the prior year due to the impact of increased volume of $1.7 billion favorable pricing offset with some unfavorable mix. GMNA\u2019s EBIT adjusted margin was 6.5% for the fourth quarter, up 3.1 percentage points from the prior year.","U.S. dealer inventory was 583,000 units at the end of the fourth quarter or 67 days supply versus 511,000 units and 61-day supply at the end of 2010. GMNA production was 739,000 units for the quarter, a 36,000 increase from the prior year. GMNA market share was 17.5% for the quarter, 1% percentage point lower than the prior year. This decline was related to decreases in fleet penetration and higher incentives among our competitors luxury vehicles.","Turning to slide 15 we provide the year-over-year comparison of GM North America\u2019s fourth quarter EBIT adjusted. Starting on the left, GMNA\u2019s EBIT adjusted was $0.8 billion for the fourth quarter of 2010. The middle section of the slide details a $700 million improvement in GMNA EBIT adjusted for the quarter. Volume was favorable $300 million, driven by a 9% increase in the North American industry. Mix was unfavorable $600 million due primarily to increased production of compact and small cars including the Verano and Sonic which were not produced in 2010.","Price was favorable on a year-over-year basis, $500 million, because of increases we were able to take due to the success of our fuel efficient vehicles in the market place. Costs were favorable $500 million this quarter as we continue to make progress on our cost initiatives.","Other was unchanged for the fourth quarter of 2010. This totals to an EBIT adjusted of $1.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2011.","Moving on to slide 16, GME reported an unfavorable EBIT adjusted of $600 million for the fourth quarter, an improvement of about $70 million from the prior year. This result includes approximately $200 million of restructuring charges that we brought on to the quarter. At the bottom of the slide, revenue was $6.3 billion for the quarter, down $600 million from the prior year. This decline was due to $700 million in unfavorable volume offset by some foreign exchange and mix and price. GME\u2019s production for the quarter was 249,000 units down 64,000 from the prior year. The EBIT adjusted margin in the region was a negative 9% for the fourth quarter which was an improvement of 0.2 percentage points from the prior year.","Turning to slide 17, we provide the major components of GME\u2019s improvement in the EBIT adjusted which rounds to a $100 million.  GME\u2019s EBIT adjusted was a $600 million loss in the fourth quarter 2010, volume was a $100 million unfavorable driven by 0.4 percentage point loss share.  Mix was essentially unchanged to the quarter price was a $100 million favorable on a year-over-year basis.  Cost was $200 million favorable due to savings and manufacturing and engineering.","Other was unfavorable $100 million due primarily to foreign exchange, this rounds to GME\u2019s EBIT adjusted of $600 million for the fourth quarter or negative $400 million before restructuring charges.","Before we move on I want to give a brief update on our restructuring plans in Europe.  As you know we implemented restructuring plan in Europe over the last two years that was intended to restore GME profitability.  This plan has delivered $1.3 billion in improvement in EBIT adjusted in 2010 versus 2010.","However, that plan was built around a more robust European economy than we face today.  And in light of today\u2019s macro economic reality it did not go far enough resulting in a loss of $700 million this year or $400 million restructuring, and this is simply unacceptable on a go forward basis.","The works council, the unions, and the supervisory board of automobile are all in agreement that has to become profitable even in a challenging economic environment.","The overall European industry remains challenging from a price, volume, and capacity utilization perspective.  And we are not relying on things to get better as we\u2019re forecasting the overall markets to be down in 2012, a continued pressure on price and mix.","Just like in the United States a couple of years ago we will need to show improvement in both revenues and cost to be successful. The good news is our product portfolio is in very strong shape. However, we must move rapidly and decisively to take the steps necessary to lower the breakeven point and improve the business.  We will work with all of our stakeholders including the unions and governments of every country to do what\u2019s required to fix this business up and down the P&L.","We have deployed significant senior resources to Europe and have made important changes to the management team on the ground. We are currently in discussions with the unions and the works councils on actions we can take now in response to the current economic conditions. Those discussions include fulfilling contractual obligations on both sides, finding ways to improve capacity utilization, and jointly working on actions to improve our breakeven condition in Europe.","We expect to have more to say soon with regard to further actions as we continue to work on developing actions that will enable GME to be profitable again.","Moving on to slide 18, GMIO posted EBIT adjusted of $400 million for the fourth quarter, up a $100 million versus the prior year.  Moving to the bottom of the slide, GMIO\u2019s revenue was $7 billion, up $1.2 billion from the prior year due to increased volume of a $1 billion, improved vehicle mix of $200 million and some favorable price offset with unfavorable foreign currency.","GMIO\u2019s EBIT adjusted margin from consolidated operations decreased 0.06 percentage points versus the prior year to 1.5%. In total China JV net income margins increased 0.06 percentage points to 8.4%.  GMIO production for the quarter was up 92,000 units from the prior year with increases in both consolidated operations and our joint ventures.  Market share in the region was 9.5% for the fourth quarter, a year-over-year increase of 0.8 percentage points.","On slide 19, we provide the major components of GMIOs $100 million improvement in EBIT adjusted.  GMIOs EBIT adjusted was $300 million in the fourth quarter of 2010.  The impact of volume was $200 million favorable. This was driven primarily by 0.8 percentage point increase in market share.  Mix was unfavorable $100 million due primarily to a shift to smaller cars in Australia. The effective price was a $100 million favorable for the quarter, and cost for unfavorable $300 million due primarily to increased engineering expense as well as several other items.  Other was favorable 100 million due to favorable equity income and non-controlling interest. This totals to GMIO\u2019s fourth quarter 2011 EBIT adjusted of $400 million.","Turning to slide 20, GMSA EBIT adjusted was a loss of $200 million for the fourth quarter of 2011 which includes a $100 million of restructuring charges. This was a decline of a $400 million versus the prior year. Revenue was $4.2 billion down $300 million due to decreased volume of 200 million and unfavorable foreign exchange.  GMSA\u2019s production was down 14,000 units from the fourth quarter of 2010 and GMSA EBIT adjusted margin was a negative 5.4%, down 9.8 percentage points from the prior year.","On slide 21 we provide the major components of GMSAs $400 million reduction in EBIT adjusted versus the prior year.  Volume was unfavorable 100 million driven by 1 percentage point loss of market share in an industry the declined 1.9%. Mix was flat versus the prior year.  Price was favorable 100 million, largely related to increases in Venezuela and Argentina.  Costs were unfavorable $300 million driven by material freight increases of $200 million and unfavorable manufacturing cost of $100 million. Other was $100 million unfavorable due to foreign exchange.","This totals the loss of $200 million in the fourth quarter which as I said includes a $100 million in restructuring. However, late 2011 launches are just beginning to have an impact in the region. In the Brazilian market, the Cruze has been second in the segment through January of this year, and Cobalt became its segment leader in the month.  While we are launching several additional great products this year we need to further reduce cost in South America to ensure sustained profitability in the region.","Turning to slide 22, we provide our walk of automotive free cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2011 as well as the prior year. Adding back non-controlling interest, preferred dividends, and undistributed earnings allocated Series B and subtracting GM financial, our automotive income was $600 million for the fourth quarter. D&A and impairment was $2.3 billion non-cash expense. Working capital was $900 million favorable due to a reduction in inventory because of the holiday shutdowns.","Pension and OPEB cash payments exceeded expenses by $400 million. The establishment of the Canadian Healthcare Trust resulted in a payment of $800 million and a non-cash gain of $700 million or $1.5 billion in total. Other was negative $700 million due primarily to non-cash P&L items. This total is down to automotive net cash provided by operating activities of $1.2 billion.","After deducting CapEx of $2.2 billion in the quarter our automotive free cash flow was negative $900 million or a $1.9 billion improvement from the prior year. Much of the improvement is due to the $4 billion pension contribution in 2010 offset by the $800 million contribution to the Canadian Healthcare Trust in 2011 and $1.1 billion in additional capital spending. In terms of capital expenditures we expect 2012 to approximate our spending rate during the fourth quarter within the $8 billion range for the year as we prepare for several major new product launches in 2012 and 2013.","On slide 23, we provide a summary of our key automotive balance sheet items. We finished the quarter with $37.5 billion of total automotive liquidity consisting of $31.6 billion in cash and marketable securities and $5.9 billion of ongoing credit facilities. On the bottom portion of the slide our book value of debt and Series A preferred stock was $5.3 billion and $5.5 billion respectively. The increase in debt from a year ago was accounted for by the $1.1 billion note for the Canadian Healthcare Trust offset with debt was paid down during the year. US qualified pension plans were under funded by $13.3 billion which I\u2019ll discuss more in a few minutes.","Our non-US pension were under funded by $11.6 billion at the end of 2011, $1.3 billion unfavorable move from 2010. Our OPEB liability was $7.3 billion at the end of 2011, a $2.6 billion improvement from year end 2010. This decrease was due primarily to $3.1 billion we removed from the balance sheet with the Canadian Healthcare Trust offset with an unfavorable impact of decreases in discount rate from remaining liabilities.","Turning to slide 24, we provide more detail on our pension de-risking actions. Operationally, we have kept the US populations about [indiscernible] and all new employees will only participate in defined contribution plans. We have also initiated a lump sum option in our salary pension plan upon retirement, although this will have little immediate impact on the funded status of the plan, it will limit the longevity of the US salary plan and reduce absent liability risk.","We recently announced to our employees that we will freeze our salary defined benefit plan for US active employees in September of this year. Those employees who are affected will begin to receive an additional contribution to their 401k plans at that time consistent with our most recent hires. We are also continuing to explore other actions to reduce our pension liability risk.","As far as asset actions, we continue to realign asset allocation to reduce funded status volatility and more closely match corresponding allocation [ph]. At the bottom of the page we detail our target asset allocation for the US pension plans. The equity investment target is reduced to 15 percentage points to 14% while the fixed income investment target has increased 25 percentage points to 66%. Our actual asset mix at yearend 2011 was roughly in line with the current target.","On slide 25 we take a look at our roughly flat percentage funded status of our US pension plans. Starting at the left of the slide, our US pension plans were underfunded by $11.5 billion at the end of 2010 or said another way 89% funded. In January of 2011 we made a contribution of GM common stock to the US pension plans. This contribution became a plan asset for accounting purposes in the third quarter of 2011 and was valued at $1.9 billion.","Service and interest cost on the US plans was $5.4 billion for the year. Our asset returns were a very strong 11.1% which translates to $10.1 billion on a dollar basis. Due to lower yields in the corporate bond market the discount rate of the US pension plan PBR reduced approximately 80 basis points. This change in assumption plus other small items reduced the funded status by $8.4 billion. This results in our US pensions being underfunded by $13.3 billion at yearend 2011 or 88% funded essentially flat year-over-year.","On slide 26 we showed pension income and expense for GMNA and the rest of the world for 2010, 2011, and our expected expense for 2012. In 2010 we recorded pension income of a $100 million and in 2011 we had pension income $500 million due in part to our relatively high expected return on assets. However, because of the actions we have taken to de-risk our pension plan we must now assume returns that are in line with our new expected asset base.","At this time we expect our global pension expense to be $300 million for 2012, given a US expected asset return of 6.2%. This will be an $800 million unfavorable from our 2011 record of pension income with the entire impact being recognized in GMNA.","Slide 27 provides a summary of key operational metrics for GM Financial. GM Financial reported their results earlier this morning and will be holding an earnings conference call at noon. Our US subprime financing in the fourth quarter has increased over the prior year to 6.8% and continues to exceed the industry average. Our U.S. lease penetration of 11.1% is lower than the prior year and continues to trail the industry average. This lower lease penetration is due to our relatively higher mix of products which are traditionally leased at lower rates.","Lease penetration in Canada has continued to improve. The increased availability of leasing in Canada has increased our lease penetration to 8.5%, 5.1 percentage points higher than the prior year but still significantly below the industry average and an opportunity for us going forward.","GM new vehicles as a percentage of GM Financial originations, and GM Financial\u2019s percentage of GM\u2019s US subprime financing and leasing volume, have both increased significantly since the fourth quarter of 2010. GM Financial showed strong credit performance in its loan portfolio, with annualized net credit losses of 3.3% for the quarter, a whole 2.2 percentage points better than the 5.5% annualized loss rate from the prior year. Earnings before tax were $170 million for the quarter.","Turning to slide 28, we\u2019ll look at our outlook. The first column gives the variances when comparing our 2010 results with those in 2011. The second column gives their outlook when we compare results from 2011 to our expected performances of 2012. As we have already indicated in our U.S. sales goals, we expect the industry to continue to grow in 2012 around the world and with U.S. [indiscernible] light vehicles in the $13.5 million to $14 million range along with continued sales growth in most of the BRIC markets.","We expect our global market share to remain roughly flat for the year. With the industry growth and generally stable market share, we anticipate increased volumes. Due to the ongoing introduction of strong product in every region, we anticipate having continued favorable pricing environment across the world in 2012. However, with increasing fuel prices and regulatory pressures we forecast mix will again be unfavorable, but perhaps to a lesser extent than 2011 versus 2010. We expect cost to be well contained in 2012 when compared to 2011 excluding the unfavorable year-over-year change in pension expense that we previously discussed. This includes modest reductions in engineering, advertising, and marketing and start to recognize savings related to complexity reduction, leveraging our global scale, and focusing on reducing administrative costs.","These savings will be offset by increased product launch related costs and manufacturing. Finally, as we have already discussed we will be increasing our level of capital expenditures this year to be in the $8 billion range.","With that, I would like to turn it back over to Dan Akerson for his summary and closing remarks.","Daniel Akerson","Thanks, Dan. So to recap I would characterize the fourth quarter results as another step in the right direction. We had improved our global sales volume, improved our market share, higher EBIT adjusted earnings, and better margins in the fourth quarter 2010. We posted solid results of both GMNA and GMIO and as mentioned continued challenges in Europe and South America which we are addressing rather aggressively. Like Yogi Berra said, it\u2019s tough to make predictions especially about the future.","But for 2012 we expect the global industry to continue to rebound and we anticipate being able to grow the top line. Finally, as this slide shows, slide 30, our business model for today\u2019s GM remains a beacon for us to follow. We continue to systematically execute our plan which includes investing in new products, strengthening our balance sheet, preserving our low breakeven point, and growing in emerging markets.","We have three key elements to long term sustained performance which you see in this pyramid. On the bottom, the foundation, is our aim to reduce the company\u2019s risk profile. Good examples of this are the actions Dan discussed around reducing our pension and OPEB exposure. This improved risk profile allows us to reinvest in the company consistently through good and bad times. Smoothing out the work load in product development and most importantly consistently launching great new products in key market growth areas.","As Dan mentioned we anticipate increasing our reinvestment into the products CapEx at a higher rate in 2012 in a more sustainable target level. Second, we continue to leverage GM's leading position in key growth markets and to a sustainable profitable growth. That includes strengthening the value of all of our brands around the world. Just look at the success of Chevrolet in 2011, over 3 million sales outside the United States.","And at the top is our overall vision to design, build, and sell the world\u2019s best vehicle. Everything we do start and ends with great products. And the numbers prove that the plan is working. With global market share up 4\/10th of a percentage point, net income up 11%, strong margins and positive pricing around the globe. That\u2019s our plan.","We hear to it day and day out. We continue to be vigilant in reducing cost and complexity while at the same time keeping product king above all else. Thank you and now we will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentleman we will now proceed with the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays Capital","A financially oriented question and then a more managerial one, both relate to the cost containment. So first maybe for Dan Ammann. If you could maybe give some more color on the components of the cost lock in North America. In prior quarters you broken out between engineering materials and marketing. Then the second, because we have seen cost pressures at other makers maybe for Dan Ammann and Dan Akerson. How are you managing cost differently than you might have coming out of last year in early this year, the kind of additional steps you are taking?","Daniel Ammann","Sure. I\u2019ll let Chuck address the lock and then I\u2019ll make some comments on what we do in general.","Chuck Stevens","Okay, Brian, presumably you are referring to the Q4 half a billion dollars improvement. On a year-over-year basis we saved about a $100 million in advertising last year. We had a pretty heavy launch cadence this year. We generated some efficiency from some of the global marketing efforts that we are undertaking. We picked up about a $100 million in engineering. We have talked before about the year-over-year improvement and depreciation and amortization and that was worth a couple of $100 million and then a $100 million across all other costs. So those were primary drivers of the improvement quarter-over-quarter.","Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays Capital","And you didn\u2019t mention commodities is that just washed out or?","Chuck Stevens","Yeah. From a North American perspective in Q4, material, freight, the net impact was marginal. For the year about a $400 million headwind primarily freight, but for the fourth quarter it\u2019s relatively flat year-over-year.","Dan Ammann","Is that just to add on from a more general perspective. We have been pretty clear over the last several quarters about how we are going after, it\u2019s just the way we do business around the company. You know, running the company as one big company as opposed to a lot of little ones, getting after scale efficiencies, whether it\u2019s in things like marketing buy or engineering operations, all across the companies. So there is no one sort of magical initiative that\u2019s giving rise to progress on this front. It\u2019s really getting after it on a very broad based basis in a lot of ways changing the way that we face the market in terms of sourcing and everything else. So, no single one answer. If you are starting to see some progress toward a lot of the cost opportunity that we have, what I would say is that we see progress next year on this front. But this is a story that\u2019s going to unfold over the next few years. This isn\u2019t all about getting it all done in 2012. There are some of the things that we are going after that will come more quickly on the administrative side and things like that. Other elements I think are going to take longer for us to get to and those are more \u2013 things that are more closely linked into the vehicle development programs.","Daniel Akerson","But I think the advertising is indicative of the initiatives and outcome and it only because of public. We have on the order of $3.5 billion in global advertising. We had dozens of advertising agency, some multiple media managers and many creative, and we just let that become too decentralized and we lost our purchasing power. So it was supported in advertising, and this will make hundreds of millions of dollars a year difference to us. Some of that will take to the bottom line and some of it will become a better more efficient advertiser and will get a bigger share of voice in the market place. But it gives you an idea of to go to dance the way he described it, we are going to manage it as one big company and leverage our scale. We haven\u2019t done that sufficiently in the past rather than be in many little companies. We don\u2019t want to be divided and conquered. We want to have as much power on a global basis as we can and we\u2019ll look forward to either cost opportunities or the ability to get a greater share of voice in this instance or potentially more market share.","Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays Capital","And is that approach extending to the auto parts supply base?","Dan Ammann","The parts we are taking in with the supply base, and as we\u2019ve talked about previously is to bring the suppliers in much earlier in the vehicle development process than we have historically to make sure that we are getting much more involvement and much more idea generation out of the supply base and getting sort of one price right upfront as opposed to continual change in share all the way through the development process. So, clearly, material cost efficiency is an important part of what we are doing, but the way we are getting to that is working with the suppliers differently than we have previously which refers to both our benefit and also the [indiscernible] frankly.","Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays Capital","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Chris Ceraso with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thank you. Good morning. A couple of items, first on South America. You mentioned some of the new products launched late in 2011, you\u2019ve got more coming in 2012. Should we expect to see profitability in that region improve year-over-year.","Daniel Ammann","Yes.","Christopher Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. Second question on the pension. I like the idea of further de-risking and trying to match the assets with the liabilities, but I wonder why you would move so aggressively into fixed income when rates are so low which could hurt you on the asset side and potentially help you on the liability side as rates go up. Can you talk about that a little bit?","Daniel Ammann","Sure, it\u2019s my favorite topic. Clearly, the de-risking move that we began to make in 2010 when we started talking about that has helped us significantly through this year, and if you look at our asset returns relative to just about any other pension plan they are obviously very high. A big chunk of that is because of the waiting that we added fixed income during this year. So that\u2019s not a move that was made, you know, at the end of the year that\u2019s a move that\u2019s been underway for an extended period of time and would benefit us significantly from that move relative to where we are. So, you see the allocations there. I mean we still benefit on a net basis from an increase in interest rates make no mistakes.","So if rates go up that will clearly benefit us, but we have materially less downside during the course of this year than we would have had if we had not made the asset moves that we made beginning 12 to 18 months ago.","Christopher Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, and on the pension do you have an idea of what you might contribute to the plan in 2012?","Daniel Ammann","We don\u2019t have any specific plans at this time.","Christopher Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse","Does that mean zero or?","Daniel Ammann","It means we don\u2019t have any specific plans at this time.","Christopher Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, and then just the last question on the tax rate. What should we expect for 2012?","Daniel Ammann","10% is a safe assumption. Clearly, it will move around depending on where profitability is generated around the world, but on safer modeling purposes at least for now I would use 10%.","Christopher Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","John Murphy - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Good morning guys. If we look at slide 28 and the arrow in the direction, everything is sort of in a same general direction that you saw in 2011 versus 2010 going into 2012 versus 2011. I'm just curious as we look at the EBIT improvement of $1.3 billion in 2011 versus 2010, I mean could we see something in that same magnitude there. Obviously, you guys aren\u2019t giving exact numbers, but looking at the direction and what you are talking about, it looks like a year that would probably have the same trajectory what we just saw in 2011 and 2012.","Daniel Ammann","You are correct that we are not giving exact numbers. The point of the message here is a number of the trends will continue, similar to what we saw 11\/10, as I said in my prepared remarks we expect a growing industry, we expect share to be more flat as opposed to up. We expect to continue to take some price, mix will go the other way, costs, right now we are feeling cost should be pretty well contained other than obviously for the change in pension income that we talked about. And then the other factor is obviously mix and how that factors in. So, it\u2019s really a question as to how the relative weightings of those play out as obviously drive the result for the year.","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just second question on the change of the GMT900 to the K2XX, a lot of that heavy lifting sounds like it\u2019s going on this year as far as the tooling and all the change over there, but the truck is going to launch in 2013. I'm just curious as far as the cost that are going to be ramped up there, will there be a meaningful pressure on margins as you go through that change over or will we see the launch cost really coming more in 2013 when the truck is actually launched?","Daniel Ammann","Part of what I said and Chuck can add on too. But what I said in my prepared remarks is that we are anticipating some impact from those costs this year and that\u2019s factored in our cost observation here and we are working to offset those with some of the other initiatives that we are working on.","Chuck Stevens","I would say the launch costs will lead over 2012 and 2013. This year a lot of the project related expense will be incurred and as Dan mentioned some that\u2019s been offset by other efficiencies, and then as we go on to the launch mode next year and still PVD, but obviously marketing launch costs will be an issue that we\u2019ll have to deal with on the GMT900 platform for the next gen K2XX.","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay, and then just lastly if we look at cap yield for 2011 in North America ran at 97.2%, so a pretty solid and healthy capacity utilization number there. Just curious if the market recovers you maintain or at least maintain market share going into 2012 and 2013, how high you can ramp that cap yield and at what point do you start having hire workers back?","Daniel Akerson","Yeah, I think that right now we have roughly 40% of our plants on three shifts. We can continue where demand requires to take plants up to three shifts, and when that happens obviously we will be hiring people back to man those shifts. I think on a theoretical basis we could take our capacity utilization up to about a 125% or 130% as measured on a two crew, two shift basis. So we\u2019ve got some obviously potential upside from a capacity perspective without putting in brick and mortar, we\u2019ll just have to hire people to man those shifts.","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Right, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citi","Great. Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to talk about pricing and mix in North America for 2012. Maybe if you could help us dimension the net of those two. It looks like in 2011 it was a slight negative, if the mix gets less than that in 2012, do you think price mix are essentially a wash in North America in 2012 or any color there will be helpful?","Daniel Ammann","Chuck can address North America, but the comments I gave were global comments just relating to mix.","Chuck Stevens","If you look at 2011, price versus mix, slight headwind from a North American perspective. And I would say that in general terms I would expect to see kind of the same outcome in 2012 although kind of the nominal of both of those will be reduced, I think we will have a little bit less price and a little bit less mix implications in 2012 versus 2011.","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citi","That\u2019s helpful Chuck. And then just a quick follow up. At the end can you talk about the rational for why you didn\u2019t make a contribution to the pension in the fourth quarter, of course we didn\u2019t have to make one. But the cash flow is still solid, you have plenty of cash and you would have obviously earned a little bit of income by doing that as well. Can you talk about the rationale for doing that?","Daniel Ammann","Sure. Well, [indiscernible] I guess the most important thing we are working on is de-risking the plants and managing and understanding that under status volatility. We have no required contributions to the next five years at least. So we have a tremendous amount of flexibility in sort of when and how we deploy cash into the pension plans. As you point out one benefit of putting the cash into the plan as you get to earn your accounting rate of return assumption on that, but frankly that in our mind isn\u2019t good enough reason on its own, just to put that cash in there, and once it\u2019s in there you can't get it out of there.","So, we are focused first and foremost on the de-risking strategy. We obviously would rather get some tailwind from asset returns and discount rate to bring the plan more closely to fully funded before we start dropping large amounts of cash into the plant. So, we want to preserve flexibility. We have the flexibility to play this out for a little longer and that\u2019s what we are doing.","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citi ","Great. Thanks so much guys.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Peter Nesvold with Jefferies & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Peter Nesvold \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Good morning. I guess you know bottom line I would love to understand our margins, total automotive margins likely to be up in 2012 or not, and in North America do you expect that it will be up. I definitely respect the fact you have outlined a lot of the individual moving parts and clearly there are lots of them, but as you aggregate them all together and based on volumes and pricing as you see them now, is there any way you can help us come to sort of a net conclusion on all that?","Daniel Ammann","Yeah. Peter, it\u2019s a fair question, but at this point we are not bringing all of that to a conclusion based on where we are right now. We think the perspective we\u2019ve given on each of the components is our best view of where those would go. You will see how the net of all of that comes together over the course of the year. We will see progress as we go through the first quarter, second quarter, and we will have increased visibility as we make progress through the year.","Peter Nesvold \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Okay. And then my follow-up question is on Europe. Press reports in January and February were suggesting that there might be a broader restructuring plan maybe towards the end of March. Can you comment on that? Is that a realistic timeframe? As you go through that process if the union doesn\u2019t agree to reopen the contract, are there any major leverage that you can pull outside of the union contract that you haven\u2019t already tried to pull in the past?","Daniel Ammann","We are working up and down the P&L as I have said earlier. This is not a one dimensional problem of only capacity, and that's the only problem and everything else is fine. We are working up and down the P&L product portfolio. We think it\u2019s in very good shape. We are making sure that our quality of sales mix and country mix and all of that is getting optimized. We are working on initiatives to combine for example a lot of the bank office operations of Opel\/Vauxhall on the one hand and Chevrolet Europe on the other. There is a lot of duplication and efficiency opportunity there. We are working on efficiency in engineering operations. We are working on efficiency in all parts of the business.","So, I don\u2019t want anyone to have the perception that this is sort of a one dimensional manufacturing cost problem or capacity utilization problem. Getting to profitability is going to require progress on those fronts and on all fronts. We are working very aggressively. You have seen the management deployments that we\u2019ve made. You have seen some of the management changes we\u2019ve made over there. We are bringing a lot of change to the business and a lot of change in approach and a lot of urgency. So, I don\u2019t have a specific timeline for you, but you can be sure that we are spending a lot of time there, a lot of us here are spending a lot of time there and we are very, very focused on getting to the right answer.","Peter Nesvold \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi, thanks guys. Couple of questions. First, was there anything at all you can highlight that was one off in nature in North America and the fourth quarter, just wanted to confirm that aside from what you mentioned there were no other items either year-on-year or within the quarter itself that we are going to look back on and say it was one off in nature.","Chuck Stevens","Adam, Chuck. I would say it\u2019s fundamentally any one time items kind of netted to zero there were some puts and takes, but fundamentally there wasn\u2019t a dollar adjustment or a significant retroactive reserve adjustment or anything else like that. So it was pretty fundamental operating performance in Q4.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, thanks Chuck. Question then big picture, you guys have given I think a pretty good deal of incremental cost information on the outlook. If you break things down to four buckets, volume, pricing mix, and the pensions from \u201911 to \u201912 you have indicated in the call that pricing and mix could net to a small headwind, but similar to may be last year\u2019s nothing dramatic. And then we left them with volume versus pensions, you have been very specific in $800 million for pension, and if we were to do some idiot math and divide a 25% operating leverage into the $800 million you would only need to grow your volume and revenue terms by about $3.2 billion which is about a 2% volume growth. I'm just wondering ex Europe, I am putting Europe aside, because understandably the charges there could be huge and up in the air, but ex-Europe it seems like \u2013 why wouldn\u2019t you be able to target stable profitability from \u201911 to \u201912, i.e. volume offsetting the $800 million pension.","Daniel Ammann","Well, again the view we\u2019ve given is anal encompassing view including Europe.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Understandably, but ex-Europe, is it unreasonable then to assume that ex-Europe profitability couldn\u2019t be at least strong this year as in 2011?","Daniel Ammann","Well, again, we are not saying it could be or couldn\u2019t be. We are just trying to give you a sense for the parameters and how we are weighing them up. So you\u2019ve got your own model. You can put them together there and come up with your own perspective on it, but we will try to be as clear as we can and giving you the building cost at least.","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley","Okay. So, exactly you only need 2% or 3% volume growth to offset the $800 million, let\u2019s see. Last question, the 11.1% after return on the pension, phenomenal. I think you probably have a lot of investors on the call that would love to get the resumes from the people that are running that plant for you. So watch out. But, how much of that 11.1 was the interest rate swap versus really the pure, you know having the pure exposure to the longer dated government funds? Thanks.","Chuck Stevens","We don\u2019t break out the relative contribution of those, but I mean what drove the asset performance was an aggregate long duration fixed income exposure.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, so you wouldn\u2019t call out interest rate swap as anything material at this point?","Daniel Ammann","Well, I\u2019d just say that it\u2019s part of our overall fixed income strategy.","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Bye Dan. Thanks guys.","Operator","And our next question is coming from the line of Himanshu Patel with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Himanshu Patel \u2013 JPMorgan","Hi, good morning. I wanted to just go back to Europe. Dan you mentioned the issue there are not one dimensional, but when you kind of do a post mortem on the last restructuring in Europe, it\u2019s pretty clear and very obvious that absence of German vehicle capacity \u2013 assembly capacity closure was kind of one of the key elements missing in that plant. Your comment earlier sort of suggested the workers council and everyone is kind of working together. Can you just talk a little bit about what\u2019s happening with the tone of the conversations with the union there to the extend you can?","On the outside it would seem more difficult now to get any sort of capacity actions done in Europe given where volumes are actually much lower kind of during your last round of restructuring.  So, has there been some sort of \u2013 I don\u2019t know what it is, but there has just been kind of an eye-opening experience with unions like we\u2019re at that stage where we have to do stuff, or is that kind of a false observation that the tone has shifted?","Daniel Akerson","This is Dan Akerson. Let me weigh-in on that. I think there is a general recognition by all constituencies that the situation in Europe today is not a whole lot different than it was in the United States or North America generally three-plus years ago. I think there is a constructive engagement and I think everybody around the table understand that there has been a material change in the outlook for European economies generally. That\u2019s in the paper every day, and it\u2019s certainly weighing on the consumer\u2019s mind and how they look at it.","So, I think as Dan briefly touched upon it though, this is an element of our going-forward perspective or strategy that we have to match capacity with demand and demand has been falling. But, more broadly, more systemically, we have got to look at every aspect of the business and one of our goals is to make sure that we have the proper scale for the opportunity that\u2019s offered in the intermediate to near term, and then we have to structure the company for a long-term profitability and sustainability.","But we\u2019re looking at everything and in order to achieve a better breakeven point, a lower breakeven point and scale. So, when you \u2013 there is more to come on this, I think in the next couple of months, but we\u2019re not approaching the problem on a one-dimensional or two-dimensional basis.","Himanshu Patel \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. And then one the exacerbating issues around the European profitability during the last turn was just all the negative media around Opel\u2019s viability and that sort of became a very nasty circular effect on your market share over there. You are seeing some sequential and year-over-year European market share slippage now. I\u2019m just curious what do you guys attribute that to? Do you think this is just some sort of soft patch in the product cadence or do you think there are some exogenous issues such as what happened last time where it\u2019s really kind of more of the perception of Opel and whether it\u2019s going to around and in what form that\u2019s affecting the share right now?","Daniel Ammann","It\u2019s Ammann. I would say that the \u2013 now, there is one element that you missed in there, which is we have been very proactively looking at the quality of sale across all of our markets in Europe and there have been some markets notably in the UK sort of rental fleet market where we have proactively just taken business out of that market because it hasn\u2019t made economic sense. So, you \u2013 there has been \u2013 when you look at the share numbers, you really need to look at them on a country-by-country basis to some extent to understand what\u2019s going on in looking at an aggregated share number can be a little bit misleading. So, don\u2019t underestimate the impact of some of the proactive decisions we made to get out of some lines of business.","Himanshu Patel \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Rob Lache with Deutsche Capital. Please go ahead.","","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Capital","Hi, everybody. Just a couple of additional things on Europe. You mentioned this target of breakeven for that market. You\u2019re extra-structuring losing $200 million to $400 million a quarter in the back half. So, is it correct that the boggy for your cost savings would be a little bit over a $1 billion of cost saving or is there a reason why the earnings level that you\u2019re recognizing right now is a little bit below what your normal run rate would be. For example, did you reduce inventory somewhat during the quarter?","","Daniel Akerson","Well, the fourth quarter is, as you know, is sort of seasonally the weakest quarter of the year. If look back on 2010 and 2011, you see that impact. Production was down, as you point out in the fourth quarter. So, as to the cost savings target, obviously a lot depends on the dynamics in the market, and as you well know, the first lever that tends to get pulled in Europe has been the price lever and that\u2019s certainly what we\u2019ve seen over the last few months here with volumes sort of following that down. So, clearly the price-volume combination, how we play that, how the industry plays that is going to be the biggest single determinant of profitability outcomes in the immediate term in addition to obviously the cost actions and other things we\u2019re going after.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Capital","Okay. And there is also certainly a perception that your hands are tied somewhat in the short term because of commitments that you\u2019ve made to labor. It sounds to me like you are not directly disputing that, but at least suggesting that there is some flexibility there. Is that a correct assessment? And then also just related to the Europe from a broader perspective, obviously as you mentioned, this is not just a GM problem, this is an industry problem. Is there any signs that you are seeing just from a high level that the market is moving towards some kind of a structural change that would ultimately result in improvement for more broad based, similar to what we saw in North America.","Daniel Ammann","Sure, so on the short term flexibility I mean there are things we can do in the short term, the concept of short work and things like that to manage man capacity on a current basis. So there are a number of initiatives and things that we are looking at within the sort of short term flexibility window if you like. As it relates to overall market change I mean I think there are fundamental challenges in the industry in Europe. We are clearly focused on the things that we can control on our business that we are watching closely to see what other changes and things are going on the industry to try to address some of the most systemic issues if you like.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Capital","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our final question coming from the line of Timothy Denoyer with Wolfe Trahan & Co. Please proceed with your question.","Timothy Denoyer \u2013 Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Good morning. Question on North America as we look at 2012. In the contact that was probably the biggest positive surprise on fourth quarter just the EBIT margin in North America you are going into 2012 and incentives have now been a little bit above the industry average for pretty much last six months if we look at slide 13. Can you give us a sense of how you expect pricing to go throughout the year? Obviously it\u2019s a little bit of a year-over-year failing in the first quarter, but how you expect that to trend through the year?","Chuck Stevens","I guess from our perspective we made some fairly aggressive base model price increases in 2011 to recover and actually over recover the impact of commodity price increases and freight increases. So, in the first half of the year you will see that impact roll through in 2012 because we put those price increases on kind of midyear. So from the way we are thinking about the business right now between the 2012 base price increases and new model pricing related to some of our launch products I would say that a fair amount of the net pricing will roll through in first half of the year, then we will have to monitor the situation from an industry perspective to see what happens with incentives and other opportunities. That\u2019s kind of my perspective on the North American pricing environment right now.","Timothy Denoyer \u2013 Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay, so with the little bit of a headwind I guess the follow up question is \u2013 with a little bit of headwind in the second half, is there any chance of going forward with some of the K2XX launch.","Chuck Stevens","No.","Timothy Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Mr. Arickx, I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to you to continue with your presentations or closing remarks.","Randy Arickx","Thank you operator and thanks everyone for joining us today.

Welcome to the General Motors Company Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2012 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, February 14, 2013. I would now like to turn the conference over to Randy Arickx, Executive Director of Communications and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Randy Arickx","Thank you, operator. Good morning, thank you for joining us as we review our 2012 calendar year results. A press release was issued earlier this morning, and the conference call materials are available on the Investor Relations website. GM is also broadcasting this call live via the Internet.","Before we begin, I'd like to direct your attention to the legend regarding forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. As always, the contents of our call are governed by this language.","This morning, Dan Akerson, General Motors\u2019 Chairman and CEO will provide opening remarks; followed by a review of the financial results with Dan Ammann, Senior Vice President and CFO. Dan Akerson will then conclude remarks portion of our call with some closing comments. After the presentation portion of the call, we will open the lines for questions from the analyst community.","In the room today, we also have Nick Cyprus, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; Chuck Stevens, CFO of North America; and Jim Davlin, Vice President, Finance and Treasurer, to assist in answering your questions.","With that, I'll like to turn the call over to Dan Akerson.","Daniel F. Akerson","Thanks Randy and thank you to everyone on the call for joining us. From every vantage point, 2012 was another solid year for General Motors.","As you can see on slide two, we grew both our sales and top line revenue in earned net income attributable to common stockholders of about $4.9 billion. Special items reduced net income by about $500 million this year, Dan Ammann will walk you through these later on the call.","Turning to our operating results, EBIT-adjusted was $7.9 billion for the year, which reflects strong profit growth in many areas of the business.","North Americas results tracked very close to 2011. South America and our international operations were up year-over-year and GM Financial had record income before tax. The $400 million year-over-year decline in EBIT-adjusted was more than explained by losses in Europe. Cash generation in 2012 was very solid. Automotive operating cash flow was $9.6 billion and adjusted for free cash flow was $4.3 billion. That\u2019s up meaningfully year-over-year reflecting our increased cash discipline.","If you turn to slide three, I\u2019d like to review some of the highlights from the fourth quarter. I\u2019m going to focus on initiatives that fundamentally improved our competitive position and reduced risk. Let\u2019s start with our new products. We planted the seeds of growth in every region around the world. In China, as you many know, 2012 was a record sales year and we gained a four point in market share. We filed this up from January by selling more than 300,000 vehicles in a single month for the first time ever. Domestic sales of Buick, Chevrolet and Wuling brand all set new single month records.","Going forward our product strategy is going to become increasingly hard for competitors to defend again. For example, in the fourth quarter we launched the Buick Encore. Now this quarter, we\u2019re starting to build critical math for Cadillac with local production of the XTS. We also introduced the Chevrolet Sail UVA hatchback in India.","In South America, we revealed the Chevrolet Onix, which is part of an award winning top to bottom transformation that began in 2011. In Europe, it\u2019s been exciting to watch the Opel ADAM follow the Mokka\u2019s fast start. Especially since both vehicles are in new segments for the brand.","The Mokka has more than 80,000 customer and dealer orders. In just a few weeks after the ADAM launch, orders from all across Europe exceeded 20,000 with most of them in Germany.","In North America, our most important product news was the reveal of the all new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra full-size pickups. We are going to share more details about these products in March. But I can tell you that every element of these trucks has been improved, including durability, capability, fuel economy and refinement which will help us leverage our 13 million strong owner base.","We\u2019ve also have a transition plan to optimize our capacity, sales and market share opportunity in a growing U.S. economy.","The GM launching these products is undeniably a stronger company than it was even a year ago. For example, we continue to advance our European revitalization plan and work toward our objective of achieving break-even EBIT adjusted by mid decade. We strengthened the Opel management team with the appointment of Dr. Karl-Thomas Neumann, as Chairman of the Management Board effective from March 1.","We\u2019re brining 23 new products to market between 2012 and 2016, while at the same time we continue to rationalize capacity and reduce cost. For example, we recently completed the sale of our transmission operations in Strasbourg France and announced that vehicle production at our plants in Bochum Germany will seize at the end of the current Opel Zafira\u2019s life cycle 2016, assuming we finalize a German labor deal in the next few weeks.","In addition we finalized both our purchasing joint venture with PSA and initial product plants which follow the logistics agreements already in place. GM Financial meanwhile has moved from strength to strength.","During the quarter we announced the acquisition of Ally\u2019s operations in Europe and Latin America and its joint venture interest in China. When these deals close in \u201913 GMF will be able to provide financing in markets that represents 80% of our sales volume, up from about 30% today.","We will also be able to meet demand in strategic and uncertain markets, all with very good risk-adjusted returns and a smaller balance sheet than any other captive automotive finance company. Less than a month after we announced the Ally transaction, the U.S. Treasury began to sell down its ownership stake in GM, starting with our 200 million share buyback.","Clarity on the government sell down strategy is important because it will help us attract new investors, recruit the best talent and strengthen our brands. That\u2019s why we are eager to put this chapter behind us, but it was a fruitful period in many ways, because we honored our tax payers vote of confidence with hard work and discipline and a long-term approach to the business.","This perfectly illustrated why our two other transactions that closed during the quarter, which strengthened our quarter\u2019s balance sheet; first, we successfully reduced our U.S. salary, pension obligation by $28 billion. Not only that we significantly reduced the form of leverage, we also enhanced the income security of our salaried retirees; that\u2019s something that we\u2019re especially proud of.","I also note that our U.S. plants were 84% funded at year-end and were not expected to have any mandatory cash contributions during the next five years. The second transaction saw us replace our existing $5 billion revolving line of credit with two new credit facility totaling $11 billion. This additional liquidity is appropriate for a company our size. What made it a landmark deal was the fact that we earned investment grade pricing and investment grade terms and conditions. It\u2019s clearly a vote of confidence in GM and the progress we\u2019ve made.","Now, I will turn the call over to Dan Ammann to review our results in more detail and I will rejoin the discussion at the end of the call with some final comments. Thanks.","Daniel Ammann","Thanks, Dan. On slide four, we provided summary of our 2012 calendar year GAAP and non-GAAP results. Net revenue for the year was $152 billion, up 1.3% from the prior year. Excluding the impacts of the FX translation, revenue was 3.8% for the year. GAAP operating income was a large loss due entirely the special items, which we\u2019ll review in a few minutes. Net income to common stockholders was $4.9 billion and earnings per share came in at $2.92. The decline from the prior year was largely due to unfavorable special items this year, this is favorable last year.","Our automotive net cash from operating activities was $9.6 billion, a $2.2 billion increase from 2011. For our non-GAAP measures, EBIT-adjusted was $7.9 billion in 2012 and the EBIT-adjusted margin was 5.2%, this improved performance across most of the business in 2012 was offset by the challenging environment in Europe. Finally, our adjusted automotive free cash flow was $4.3 billion for the year, a $1.3 billion improvement from 2011, reflecting improved cash conversion and our increased focus on this areas in 2012.","On slide five, we provide the EBIT-adjusted by region for 2011 and 2012. GMNA\u2019s EBIT-adjusted had a slight decline to $7 billion as improved underlying performance was offset by $800 million of lower pension income, GME had an EBIT-adjusted loss of $1.8 billion, down more than $1 billion from 2011 due to the very challenging market conditions.","GMIO had EBIT-adjusted of $2.2 billion, as growth in the region continued and GM South America\u2019s EBIT-adjusted was a much improved $300 million for 2012 as the business continued it\u2019s favorable profit improvement on the back of the new product portfolio.","GM Financial had earnings before taxes of $700 million, a record result and corporate eliminations was $500 million expense. This totaled to EBIT-adjusted of $7.9 billion, down $400 million from 2011.","On slide six, we provide an explanation of the $400 million decrease in year-over-year EBIT-adjusted. Our EBIT-adjusted was $8.3 billion for 2011. Volume was a 1 billion favorable due to increased production in North America and IO, actually offset by a decrease in Europe. This was unfavorable $600 million due to continued shift to smaller vehicles in North America and Europe.","Price was a $1.7 billion favorable for the year due to the strength of our new product introductions and net price increases on the vehicles that were launched in prior years. Total costs were up $2 billion including $800 million in reduced pension income and $1 billion from additional material cost from our new product programs. Importantly, fixed costs excluding pension were approximately flat in 2012 relative to 2011. Other was $500 million unfavorable primarily due to an absence in 2012 of favorable lease residual adjustments in North America.","Slide seven identifies special items for the fourth quarter and calendar year that had an impact on our earnings per share. I\u2019ll highlight a few of the major items momentarily. At the top of the side, our net income to common stockholders in the fourth quarter was $900 million, and our fully diluted earnings per share was $0.54. The special items listed had a net $100 million unfavorable impact to net income to common stockholders or $0.06 per share favorable impact on EPS.","For the 2012 calendar year, our net income to common stockholders was $4.9 billion and our fully diluted earnings per share was $2.92. Special items had an unfavorable impact on net income to common stockholders of $500 million and a $0.32 unfavorable impact on earnings per share.","On the next slide we will review our largest special items for the quarter and the year.","As a result of three full years of profitability and our recent completion of our business plans which indicated continued profitability, we reverse the majority of our deferred tax valuation allowance in U.S and Canada and recorded a $34.9 billion non-cash benefit. This reversal triggered an associated offsetting non-cash goodwill impairment of $26.2 billion.","Last quarter we indicated we may impair assets in GM Europe if the economic and business conditions continue to deteriorate. Unfortunately the industry outlook and other factors have deteriorated and we are now impairing our long lived assets in Europe and recording a $5.2 billion non-cash special item. We continue to work towards our objective of breakeven EBIT-adjusted by mid-decade. Also as we discussed during the third quarter earnings call, we recently completed the annuitization of lump sum agreements for the U.S. salaried pension plan. Together these items resulted in a after-tax charge of $2.2 billion in the quarter to settle the $28 billion obligation.","Moving on to the results for the fourth quarter on slide nine, our net revenue was $39.3 billion, a $1.3 billion increase from the prior year. Excluding the effect of FX translation, fourth-quarter revenues increased approximately 4.3%. Again the GAAP operating income performance was driven by unfavorable special items in the quarter.","Net income to common stockholders was $900 million, a $400 million improvement from 2011. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.54 on a diluted basis, compared to $0.28 for the same period in the prior year, and the automotive net cash from operating activities is $500 million.","Our EBIT-adjusted was $1.2 billion for the fourth quarter, $100 million improvement from the prior year. EBIT adjusted margin was 3.2%, up slightly from Q4 2011. Our adjusted automotive free cash flow was $1.1 billion for the quarter, a $1.3 billion improvement from the prior year.","On slide 10, we provide the EBIT-adjusted by region for the four quarters of 2011 and 2012.","GMNA\u2019s EBIT-adjusted was $1.4 billion. GME had an EBIT-adjusted loss of $700 million. IO had EBIT of $500 million and South America was $100 million for the quarter. GM Financial earnings before tax rounded down to $100 million, a slight decrease from the prior year. Corporate eliminations was a $200 million expense. This totals to EBIT-adjusted of $1.2 billion for the quarter of 2012, up $100 million from the same period in 2011.","Slide 11 shows our consolidated EBIT-adjusted for the last five quarters. At the bottom of the slide, we again showed the revenue and margins for the quarter. Our global production numbers including our unconsolidated joint ventures was 116,000 units higher than the fourth quarter of 2011. Our global market share remained fairly steady at 11.5%.","On slide 12, we provide an explanation of the $100 million increase year-over-year consolidated EBIT-adjusted for the fourth quarter. In Q4 2011, our EBIT-adjusted was $1.1 billion. Volume was $300 million, favorable due to production increases in North America and IO. Mix was $300 million favorable due primarily to improving mix in GMNA. Price was $100 million unfavorable for the quarter because the effect of competitive pressures for all the vehicles more than offset the favorable pricing of our new products.","Total costs were up $500 million, which includes $200 million reduction in pension income and $300 million in increased material cost of our recently introduced cars, trucks, and SUVs. Other was $100 million favorable due to increased equity income around non-consolidated joint ventures; this totals $1.2 billion for the fourth quarter.","We now move on to our segment results with the key performance indicators for GM North America on slide 13. For the fourth quarter of 2012, our total U.S. market share was 17.1%. Our retail incentive levels on an absolute basis are roughly flat versus the prior year period. On a percentage of ATP basis our incentives for the quarter were 10% equal to the prior year. This puts us to 104% of industry average levels for the fourth quarter of 2012.","On slide 14 we show GMNA\u2019s EBIT-adjusted for the last five quarters. At the bottom of the slide, revenue was $24.2 billion in the fourth quarter up $1.1 billion for the same quarter in 2011. GMNA's EBIT-adjusted margin was 5.8% for the fourth quarter down 0.7 percentage points from the prior year due to decreased pension income.","Our U.S. dealer inventory was 117,000 units at the end of the fourth quarter. The increase from the prior year includes 28,000 all new Cadillac ATS\u2019s and XTS\u2019s that are included in the prior year as well as increased production of current generation full-size pickups in preparation for this year's launch of the all-new Silverado and Sierra. GMNA production was 775,000 units for the quarter, 36,000 vehicle increased from the prior year.","Turning to slide 15, we provide the explanation of the $100 million year-over-year decline in GM North America EBIT-adjusted. GMNA's EBIT-adjusted was $1.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2011. Volume was $100 million favorable, mix was $400 million favorable due to the recent introductions of the Cadillac ATS and XTS and increased production of other higher-margin vehicles. This is the first time in nine quarters that GMNA has benefited from favorable mix and underscores the importance of that new model launches.","Price was $300 million unfavorable due primarily to the effect of pricing actions on our older vehicles for the quarter and as we said up for 2013. Costs were $400 million unfavorable due to $200 million decline in pension income, $100 million in increased costs for our new vehicle launches and $100 million increase in D&A. This nets to an EBIT-adjusted of $1.4 billion.","On slide 16, GME reported an EBIT-adjusted loss of $700 million for the fourth quarter, $100 million deterioration from the prior year. Revenue was $5.6 billion for the quarter, down $700 million due to declining industry sales, unfavorable foreign exchange in the small loss of share.","EBIT-adjusted margin in the region was negative 12.5%. GME\u2019s production for the quarter was 209,000 units, 40,000 less than the prior year, as we continue to take actions to reduce inventory. GME\u2019s market share in the fourth quarter was 8.3%, a 0.3 percentage point decline from \u201811.","On slide 17, we provide the major components of GME\u2019s $100 million year-over-year decline in EBIT-adjusted. Volume was $100 million unfavorable; mix was $200 million unfavorable due largely to a shift in sales to lower margin countries. Price was $100 million unfavorable due to competitive pressure in the region, cost was $200 million favorable, because of $100 million unfavorable material price performance and $100 million in lower restructuring charges, the total to GME\u2019s EBIT-adjusted loss of $700 million for the fourth quarter of \u201812.","On slide 18, we show GMIO\u2019s EBIT-adjusted for the most recent period, and the fourth quarter EBIT-adjusted was $500 million including equity income from our joint-venture of the quarter. At the bottom of the slide, GMIO\u2019s revenue from our consolidated operations was $7.9 billion, up $900 million from the prior year. GMIO\u2019s EBIT-adjusted margin from consolidated operations was 0.5%, the decline from the prior year largely driven by increased cost which I\u2019ll cover in a moment.","Our average net income margin from our China JVs was 9.1%, a 0.7 percentage point increase from the prior year. GMIO\u2019s total production for the quarter was up 124,000 units from the prior year as we increased our market share to 9.8% in the growing industry. The market share in China rose more than 1 percentage point in the fourth quarter to 14.3%.","Turning to slide 19, we provided the major components of GMIO\u2019s $100 million increase in the EBIT-adjusted. Impacted volume was $200 million favorable, it will increase wholesale units into the consolidation of the GM India in 2012. Mix was a $100 million unfavorable. Price was $200 million favorable due to our recently launched products including the whole new Chevrolet Colorado and TrailBlazer.","Cost was $400 million unfavorable due to $200 million increase in material and manufacturing costs for newly launching vehicles, $100 million in decrease sales of CKBB, and some other items including the consolidation of our India operations. Other was $200 million favorable, including $100 million increase in equity income. This totals to GMIO fourth quarter 2012 EBIT-adjusted of $500 million.","On slide 20, we move on to the South America region, EBIT-adjusted for the last five quarters, excluding restructuring costs for the region was profitable than all four quarters of 2012. At the bottom of the slide revenue was $4.5 billion in the fourth quarter, $300 million increase from 2011. EBIT-adjusted margin in the region was 2.2%, a significant improvement in the loss in the prior year period.","GMSA\u2019s production was 223,000 units roughly flat to the prior year. Market share in the region was 17.7% in the quarter, a 0.7 percentage point decline from the prior year.","On slide 21, we look at the components of the $300 million year-over-year improvements in our South American operations. The fourth quarter 2011 the region had an EBIT-adjusted loss of $200 million, small production variance had no impact. Mix was $200 million favorable due entirely to the higher margins from recently launched vehicles. Price was $100 million favorable. Cost was $100 million favorable due to the absence of restructuring charges in third and the fourth quarter of \u201811. This totals to $100 million EBIT-adjusted from South America in the fourth quarter.","Slide 22, provides our walk of adjusted automotive free cash flow for the fourth quarter. We now exclude the impact of major voluntary management actions such as the repurchase of our common shares from the U.S. Treasury, pension contributions and will continue this practice going forward.","After adjusting for non-controlling interest preferred dividends and undistributed earnings allocated to Series B preferred and deducting GM Financial, our automotive income was $800 million for the fourth quarter of 2012. We had $300 million in net non-cash special items, and our D&A was $1.6 billion expense.","Working capital was $1.5 billion source of cash due to seasonal decrease in inventory because of sequentially lower production as well as an overall increased focus on working capital management. Excluding the non-cash impact of the annuitization of lump-sum transactions in US, pension and OPEB payments exceeded expense by $2.5 billion. Other was $500 million use of cash, $300 million improvement from the prior year. This total down to automotive net cash provided by operating activities of $500 million.","We had $2.1 billion of capital expenditures in the quarter, in addition we have two voluntary management actions that we have excluded from our adjusted free cash flow, of $2.3 billion pension contribution and the $400 million premium rebate repurchase shares from the U.S. Treasury. This total to our adjusted automotive free cash flow of $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion increase from the prior year.","On slide 23 we provide a summary of our key automotive balance sheet items. After repurchasing 200 million shares of stock from the United States Department of the Treasury, we finished the fourth quarter with $26.1 billion in cash and marketable securities, with the completion of our new three and five-year credit facilities, our available credit facilities now stand at a $11.1 billion, bringing our total available liquidity to $37.2 billion. Please note we changed our disclosure this quarter to exclude uncommitted credit facilities from these totals.","Our book value of debt is $5.2 billion. The $400 million decrease from the third quarter is due to partial redemption of GM Korea preferred shares. Series A preferred stock is $5.5 billion, U.S. qualified pension plans are underfunded by $13.1 billion, a slight improvement versus a year ago, which we\u2019ll discuss further in a moment. Our non-U.S. pensions are underfunded by $13.8 billion at the end of the fourth quarter and our underfunded OPEB liability is $7.8 billion. The increase in these liabilities from the prior year is largely due to lower discount rates.","On slide 24, we take a look at the funded status of our U.S. pensions in 2012. At the end of 2011, we had pension obligations of $108 billion and we were underfunded by $13.3 billion, the combined effects of remeasurements are 11.6% asset returns and other items resulted in a $100 million improvement to funded status. We paid out $8.3 billion in benefits to GM retirees and surviving spouses in 2012.","The annuitization agreement in the lump-sum offered to salaried retirees resulted in a $28.3 billion reduction in the pension obligation, and a $30.6 billion transferred pension assets for a net decrease of $2.3 billion in the funded status.","Finally, we made a $2.3 billion cash contribution to the U.S. salary plan. This was less than the $2.6 billion estimate provided last quarter, meaningfully below the original estimate of $4.5 billion as asset returns were more favorable than previously estimated, borrowing the total cost of the annuitization agreement. Our total unit pension obligations were reduced 25%, our funded status improved to negative $13.1 billion, slightly better than 2011.","Slide 25, provides the summary of our order financing activities, GM Financial reported their results this morning and we will be holding an earnings conference at noon.","Our U.S. subprime penetration in the fourth quarter has increased over the prior year to 7.2%. Our U.S. Lease penetration is 14.9% in Q4, up 3.9 percentage points from the prior year. Lease penetration in Canada is 6.3%, down from the prior year due to a heavier mix of prior year models in the fourth quarter of 2012. We were below the lease industry averages because we have a richer mix of trucks than many of our competitors.","GM new vehicle as a percentage of GM Financial origination stayed relatively constant at 43%, and GM Financial percentage of GM's U.S. consumer subprime financing and leasing was 20% on the quarter. GM Financial\u2019s annualized net credit losses remained low at 3.3% and their earnings before tax were $146 million for the quarter, down slightly year ago, predominantly due to expenses related to the acquisition of Ally\u2019s international operations which is expected to close in 2013.","I'd also like to highlight the GM Financial announcement in January, the pricing of $1 billion asset-backed securities offering with the weighted average amount of 1.2%. This is the lowest cost of funds in GM Financial\u2019s history.","We will now give an updated view on a few 2013 items on slide 26. Now that we have real stable valuation allowance on deferred taxes in U.S. and Canada, our effective tax rate for GAAP purposes will be approximately 35% in 2013. This action has not affect the status of our operating loss in tax credit carryforwards accordingly our cash taxes for 2013 are expected to be at about the same rate in 2012.","We expect to have approximately $600 million in reduced GME depreciation and amortization expense in 2013, due largely to the impairment of long-lived and intangible assets in GME. These reduced D&A expenses were not incorporated into our previously provided outlook for 2013.","Under current economic conditions, we don't expect to have any mandatory contributions to our qualified U.S. pension plans for at least five years. Also at the same time, we do not have any current plans to make material pension contributions in 2013, while we will continue to evaluate any opportunistic actions on an ongoing basis.","We expect CapEx this is going to be similar to the $8 billion level, we spent in 2012, and finally we expect to have a $200 million unfavorable special item in the first quarter of 2013 for the recent devaluation of the Venezuelan currency.","Now I'll hand it back to Dan for his closing remarks.","Daniel F. Akerson","Thanks Dan, on prior calls I\u2019ve talked about playing offense with products designed to win, not just compete. This strategy well in whole display at the North American International auto show in January. Energy around GM was infectious in fact Detroit Main event the Company's best auto shows, since the Alpine days in 1950. Corvette, won best in show, the Cadillac ELR was named best design, the Cadillac ATS took home the North American Car of the Year honors, interestingly the first win ever from Cadillac. All of this was great but in many ways we are still not getting going.","During 2013 and 2016 we will refresh our North American portfolio, at twice the rate we did during the last three years. The Chevrolet Silverado and GMC are only the tip of the iceberg. We are redesigning other foundational product like the all new Chevrolet Impala and we are aggressively entering new segments with vehicles like Buick Encore. The same holds true for the Chevrolet product line in South America, where we went from having one of the oldest portfolios in the industry to one of the newest over the span of about 18 months. This includes the aforementioned Chevrolet Onix, which earned the Car of the Year honors in Brazil.","In Europe, we are not just cost cutting our way to profitability as we have said many times. In Russia, we are investing $1 billion to expand capacity because we expect the industry there to surpass Germany by 2017. In China, we are investing aggressively in all facets of our business, especially Cadillac and Chevrolet, because the market could reach 30 million units by 2020, that\u2019s up from $19 million today. All of this and more is possible because of our profitability, fortress balance sheet, and solid cash flow.","We still have a lot of work to drive down our variable cost and ring complexity out of this system, but with $8 billion in annual investment and our drive for results, GM is setting the stage for more than just higher volumes, market share and profit. We are out to create a sustainable competitive advantage and I am pleased with our progress. Our next steps are crystal clear; stay disciplined financially, and operationally, sharpen our focus on customers, and continue to play offense with new products.","Thank you and now let\u2019s open the line for Q&A","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now proceed with the analyst version of the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays. Please proceed.","Brian A. Johnson \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning. Well, I may be the only other person other than Dan, who actually had a Corvette excuse in there past. Still remember that car. I just want to go through kind of this quarter in light of your guidance region by region. And both to Dan, any big changes, I guess when we look at North America and Europe in particular, how much of the improvement in Europe now coming with depreciation is within your control and how much depends on overall market developments, and really kind of the same for North America, thinking about kind of where you guided for SAAR, the kind of pickup truck next you have in mind.","And then I guess for Dan Akerson around that kind of \u2013 what is your sense of Europe right now in terms of your two to three year goals and with the new team in place, how much is really in your control versus how much is depended on competitors taking up capacity and improving the price point?","Daniel Ammann","","Okay, well it\u2019s Ammann, I\u2019ll address your first Europe question, I\u2019ll hand it to Chuck to North America and then to Dan in response to your last question. I think as we look at the environment for 2013, really as we talked about a few weeks back-end as we talked about back-end Q3, we see the industry down this year, and obviously find out by how much as we go through the year, but our view on the industry has not gotten any more bullish, let\u2019s put it that way. As it relates to the things that we control, I do think we feel better and better about the things that we control. We feel very good about the team that we now have on the ground, we have KT Neumann joining in addition all the other changes we made for the three quarters of the last year.","We feel pretty good about receptivity of the new vehicles launches into the market, as Dan commented we have 80,000 orders for the Opel Mokka, 20,000 orders in already for the Adam, which is barely even getting going yet. And those vehicles from a profit contribution point of view will be quite favorable relative to the balance of the portfolio there, so we feel good about that, and what we control on the product side.","We feel good about the progress we are making on the cost side of the business, capacity actions, consolidating from 3S to 2, the run out at Bochum, the sale of the Strasbourg transmission facility, and so on and we feel good about the progress on the SG&A front.","So the things that are in our control, we feel like we are making good progress on, the great unknown of course is what happens in the European economies. What happens to end markets demand, and the nature of where that demand is, profits of different by country, different by channel, and so on and obviously that\u2019s not within our control moving to play that out as we go.","Chuck Stevens","","Yeah, Brian relative to North America, yes your question was related to industry and nothing is changed from the outlook that we provided a couple of weeks ago. We are looking at the industry, $15 million to $15.5 million. Total truck segment share 11% to 11.5%, and our share of trucks somewhere in the range of 36% to 38% for the year, relative to the other drivers that we talked about back in January, I think our view is still consistent with that.","Brian A. Johnson \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","And on the just the technical point on the GM Europe mid decade break-even, is that now break-even plus $600 million with the depreciation or was it $600 million at some point contemplated within that break-even number.","Daniel Ammann","When we\u2019ve provided those outlooks, they were excluding the impact of the $600 million.","Brian A. Johnson \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, thanks.","Daniel F. Akerson","Let me just say yes, good question. How much is within our control, I thought Dan did a pretty good job, but it\u2019s not like we\u2019re just hoping for the best. One thing we can\u2019t control is the market, but we have certain leverage we can post.","PSA agreement for both logistics and purchasing will kick in and also we\u2019re going to do, co-development on the MPV-B and MPV-C and the B segment cars that should in the out years toward build the decade and on should benefit the joint-venture by about $2 billion over that period of time. We\u2019re going to be smart about how we cut costs and just closed plans.","I mean we closed Antwerp in \u201811, that was a big deal and it actually forwarded some leeway in early part of \u201911, where we were actually profitable, and then the European crisis kicked in the summer of the \u201811. I think what you see when we sold Strasbourg and why do well sell it? Well, it was cheaper to take a write-down of $100 million than it was to pay for the labor discontinuity and the cost associated with that. I think that\u2019s smart move.","In the interim in the last year, as I said Dan touched upon a two, Bochum will play out because the Sierra is not going to be assigned to the plans after the \u201816 timeframe. So we\u2019re still in the midst of labor negotiations, we hope to ramp up relatively quickly over the certainly within this quarter is our hope. We\u2019ll have more to report on that. In the meantime, we\u2019ve also reduced headcount in Opel by 2,500 people last year, and we\u2019re doing that, we\u2019re just trying to reshape, remold the costs, the SG&A, the cost profile that we project and we think it will be about (inaudible) this year we continue to work, it\u2019s a work in progress.","At the same time, we can\u2019t just play defense, we are trying to play offense, we are in two new segments that we\u2019ve never been in before, the Adam and the Mokka represent two new segment entry and we have to continue to do well in the segments we are in. So with all of this, I know it\u2019s kind of a white mosaic that I have tried to characterize or portrait here. It\u2019s our objective to hit break-even by a decade or there above.","Brian A. Johnson \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, thanks.","Daniel Ammann","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Good morning everybody. I was hoping first you can explain just two items on the North American year-over-year bridge, there in the decade shows $100 million impact from volume, production was up about 36,000 units which would imply that $2800 vehicle which is a bit lower past seven quarters have been $6000 to $9000 vehicles and you also mentioned in your commentary in North America that pricing actions that you have well for 2013. Was there any one-time pricing adjustment recorded in this quarter? You did make some adjustments on the nullable for example.","Daniel Ammann","Yeah, let me take that valid chart. From a volume perspective, production was up 36,000 units, wholesales however were up 21,000 units and when we factor in the impact of variable manufacturing that brought the overall volume impact to about to 138 million and 20,000 units, so I think that\u2019s relatively consistent with the variable margins we have reflected in the past.","Relative to pricing, when you think about Q4, the economic price in Q4 year-over-year was kind of flat MSRP increases offset increase in sales volumes and MSRP increases on both carry over and new product, the big driver of the unfavorable price was stock adjustments, primarily driven by the recognition of the GMT 900 transition and likely increased incentives as we move through the next six months on that. So that was the primary driver of Q4 price.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. So that was like a retroactive adjustment to inventory that you had which might have been usually high?","Daniel Ammann","It\u2019s essentially topping up the anticipated liability on inventory on hand in total for expected incentives going forward.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, and I was hoping you might be able to fill in a few blanks on Europe. How much was the non-recurring impact that you incurred from inventory de-stocking you commented on, some pretty big numbers that you took down, which presumably doesn\u2019t recur this year. And then the negative side, how are you thinking about FX moves and pricing looks like, Europe pricing was maybe $1400 a vehicle this quarter. Should we be thinking something similar into the next year?","Daniel F. Akerson","So on the inventory side, we hit our objective for the year-end inventory for the company which was under 100,000 units. So we think we\u2019ve set our sales in reasonable shape going forward on that. In terms of how much of that is sort of growing business, non-recurring pieces, I mean obviously it\u2019s just going to be a function of what happens to demand. So going forward our goal is to keep inventory in and around where it is. Obviously seasonal moves within there, but on an overall basis, keep that roughly in line. Sorry, could you repeat the second part of the question.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank","FX.","Daniel F. Akerson","FX, yeah, FX obviously we have seen some strengthening of the euro that hurts relative to the UK market and the sterling there. It\u2019s favorable relative to imported product, particularly what we're importing from Korea. So I\u2019d say overall strengthening euro is a headwind as of right now, but we will continue to try getting \u2013 it just goes accordingly.","","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","Okay, and on pricing, it looks like pricing was about $1400 a vehicle in the quarter.","Daniel Ammann","Yeah, pricing, I mean we\u2019re continuing to manage pricing actions here in conjunction with what's going on in the market. We're obviously looking to make up as much as we can, product launches that we have going on in the marketplace. Too soon to tell exactly how pricing can unfold for the year at this point.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank","One last one, I was wondering whether you might care to comment a little bit on the shape of this year's 2013 earnings, just presumingly you're going to be facing some launch clause and pricing actions in North America in the beginning of the year and then things get better. Any broad commentary if you're willing to provide on what we should be expecting unusually this year?","Daniel Ammann","","I don't think there's going to be anything too unusual, I think you may see things a little more back-end loaded especially out of the first quarter that we have seen in previous years. It\u2019s not a huge change, but I'd say there was some more waiting for the middle and back-end of the year.","Daniel F. Akerson","Yeah, another dynamic in there too as well Rod is, our full size SUV plants were down three weeks in the month of January as part of the conversion. So that's going to have a bit of an impact on Q1 and as Dan mentioned I think we will see, a bit more weight in the second half of the year versus the run rate over the last three years.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you, the next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citigroup. Please proceed.","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citigroup","Great, thank you good morning. Just want to talk about the pension. You\u2019re indicating that you\u2019re not expecting to make any voluntary contributions. Can you update us on your latest thinking around potential de-risking actions for the Ally plants in the U.S.?","Daniel F. Akerson","Well, I\u2019d say overall with our total de-risking strategy, we\u2019ve come a very long way over the last couple of years with a whole host of actions, all of which we have talked through here multiple times. And I think where we ended the year, we feel very, very good about in terms of having got the salary deal done all of the other actions that was taken and it gives us a level of flexibility that we would not have had at this point in time.","As we mentioned in our comments, we have five years. We expect with no mandatory contributions and what that does for us is, it gives us a lot of flexibility. We\u2019ll continue to look at opportunities to further de-risk for sure, dug all or further de-risk as we move along. And if some thing compelling comes along, we\u2019ll act on it. So I think what we\u2019re really signaling here is because of the actions we have taken we feel like we made a lot of progress and we\u2019re in a position where we have a fair amount of flexibility. So we will still act if something interesting comes along.","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citigroup","Absolutely. And then going back to the taxes, the cash tax rates should be pretty similar in 2013 versus 2012. Yeah, how should we think about cash taxes beyond 2013, is there certain rate we should be modeling in terms of the out years or is there a better way of thinking about kind of the cash tax benefit relative to the higher effective GAAP tax rate?","Daniel Ammann","Well in 2012 we were roughly 10% and we\u2019re signaling that we\u2019d expect that to hold till 2013 and I think the next two years beyond that it would be similar to that?","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citigroup","Great, and then Scott, lastly how should we think about working capital in 2013, as hopefully production starts to come back a bit in the second half of the year perhaps in Europe, should that be less of the headwind, maybe even a tailwind for you in 2013?","Daniel Ammann","","Well we had some reasonable performance in, tailwind from an earnings point of view or a cash point of view, depends on \u2026","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citigroup","Cash flow to working capital.","Daniel Ammann","From a cash flow point of view, we continue to see opportunity, we made some progress in 2012 relative to our original plans for the year on that front and we brought more discipline and a pretty keen focus on that and we\u2019re seeing the benefits of that from month-to-month. So we continue to see opportunity on that in \u201913. What I would point out is most of you will know is that typically Q1 is the sizable outflow from working capital and then Q2, Q3 through the middle of the year it tends to be more sort of neutral and then we get a sizable pickup in the fourth quarter just based on shutdowns and so on. And we\u2019d expect that seasonal pattern to continue this year, hopefully with some overall improvement underlying that.","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citigroup","That\u2019s great. Thank so much guys.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Patrick K. Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. Thank you, good morning. I have a cash question and a Europe question. I mean first on the cash question, it looks like if you were to generate something close to what you generated this year or maybe slightly above you\u2019d be back into the $30 billion cash range, and you\u2019ve stated that at least for 2013 there\u2019s no voluntary contributions required. So can you just maybe walk us through what the remaining cash calls are on what seems to be a fairly sizable piece of liquidity there. And if there\u2019s any room for additional shareholder actions potentially throughout this year?","Daniel F. Akerson","So there\u2019s a couple that are fairly obvious, one is they\u2019re closing of the (inaudible) transaction, what we said at the time was that would be about a $2 billion cash contribution from the motor company to the finance company to close that, so that\u2019s one number.","Secondly, we pay about 900 that gets lost in the mix sometimes. If we pay about 900 million a year in dividends so that\u2019s another call on that. Our mandatory convertible which is a piece of that will convert at the end of this year, so that will go away going into next year into \u201814. We have the Series B, the VEBA preferred that\u2019s out there that becomes callable at the end of \u201914 and that\u2019s a very expensive piece of paper and that\u2019s something that we would like to redeem as soon as it\u2019s reasonably able to be done. So it\u2019s something that\u2019s not this year, but that\u2019s on the horizon.","And then we have potential other voluntary pension actions, should interesting opportunities come along on that front. So there are handful of sort of known and identifiable items out there. And obviously we will overlay on that, opportunities from a shareholder point of view, we took from our perspective very major step in that direction around the UST buyback at the end of last year and we bought the balanced to the way that we\u2019re deploying cash.","Patrick K. Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, thank you, very helpful. And then onto my question on Europe, maybe two things, number one is; it\u2019s been written in the press, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s out but that the cooperation with PSA has kind of downshifted a bit. There is no longer the D segment program. I think it\u2019s the B and then some SUVs. My first question is sort of, why the narrowing of the scale of cooperation, just give them the need for variable cost efficiencies down the road. And then number two is what\u2019s the prognosis perhaps for bringing some Chevrolet stuff into your OPEL facilities, you know things like the Cruze or Chevy version of the Mokka or something like that? Thank you.","Daniel F. Akerson","This is Dan Akerson, I will answer that. I think a wise man once said, you can\u2019t believe everything you read. And there is a great ad on television about, yeah I read it on the Internet, that\u2019s got to be true. Don\u2019t take too much stock into what you read, lot of people like to talk. This all good robust and healthy joint ventures are based on self interest and when you can\u2019t pencil a car like the D segment car and for either party, then you shouldn\u2019t do it. I mean this isn\u2019t some sort of fraternity here, it\u2019s a co-calculated business deal. We respect the PSA folks a lot and the relationship is good.","From a manufacturing point of view, whether we would shift around the globe and bring Chevrolet to Europe or that we won\u2019t comment on. That is something we look at on a routine basis, but we are not going to wash our laundry in the public about what we may or may not do. I apologize for that.","Patrick K. Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Daniel F. Akerson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Chris Ceraso from Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Chris J. Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse","","Thank you. Good morning. Quick question about the consolidated portion of IO, do you have the number there Dan on the adjusted EBIT and it looks like it was a bit of a down shift from the previous run rate, can you explain what the weakness there was?","","Daniel Ammann","Yeah. As I said in my prepared remarks, it was down a bit from the previous run rate, mostly due to timing of some cost items in there. I will say that as we covered in January, that we do see margin pressure in the IO business this year, some of that driven by currency and the strengthening of the Korean won. We have a big manufacturing base in Korea. As you know not as big as some, but the given (inaudible) so we see some currency headwinds there that will bring some pressure on the cost equation relative to the revenue right here.","Chris J. Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. Can you give us a feel for some of the big picture cost items as we walk from 2012 to 2013, what are you thinking about material costs, what\u2019s your expected change in pension expense, other structural cost changes. In addition to that you mentioned exclusively the $600 million in the amortization, what are some of the other big puts and takes from \u201812 to \u201813?","Daniel F. Akerson","This is for the whole company or?","Chris J. Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse","Yeah. I guess for North America, and then if there\u2019s anything specific beyond that for other regions, that will be helpful?","Daniel F. Akerson","Well, Chuck can comment it briefly, we don\u2019t want to get into a modeling exercise here, line item by line item, but we\u2019ll \u2013 and we gave a fair bit of color back in the meeting in January, but Chuck, if you\u2026","Chuck Stevens","Yeah. I think just directionally as we talked back in January, there\u2019s material performance, freight performance will be relatively flat obviously there\u2019s going to material cost increases associated with new product launches that will be more than offset by price. From a fixed cost standpoint, as we talked about three big drivers, I think there\u2019s going to be reduced pension income year-over-year that we talked about before non-cash, D&A will be up, primarily tooling associated with the new programs, another non-cash item and we\u2019re investing in significant amount of money in incremental marketing in 2013 to support new product launches as well as improve our share voice. So those are the three big fixed cost drivers year-over-year.","Chris J. Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay.","","Chuck Stevens","A couple of them on cash.","Chris J. Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse","You don\u2019t want to go into any specific numbers around those?","Chuck Stevens","No.","Chris J. Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse","No, okay. And then just on Europe, you were very clear in the text that the $600 million is added into the earlier guidance, but you also mentioned that you decided to take that action because things deteriorated. So if the previous guidance was that Europe would be better in \u201813 than \u201812, is it better again by $600 million or is the underlying worse than you thought just a few weeks ago?","Daniel Ammann","Well, I guess it\u2019s this way, which is back in Q3. We said two things, we said we have an objective to break-even by mid-decade and then we saw an opportunity for buying slight improvement in \u201913 relative to \u201912. So as we said on the outlook and then we separately said that there is a chance that we may impair our long-live assets in Europe. So we said all that together in the third quarter, as we\u2019ve gone from Q3 through Q4, we\u2019ve seen as we expected we have seen a deterioration in the environment in Europe from an industry perspective, from an economic perspective, from a fourth quarter top line perspective, and that led to the impairment analysis, and the impairment charge that we\u2019re showing there. So in that outlook that we provided, the $600 million D&A savings was not incorporated into that outlook.","Chris J. Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse","","And then just the last one, you guided a 35% tax rate, Ford\u2019s been running at about 32%, they were full year into not having evaluation allowances, is there anything that\u2019s materially different about your mix of profit that would argue for a higher tax rate for you?","Daniel F. Akerson","From our perspective 35% was an estimate of where it will be. We don\u2019t have the benefit of tax benefits on our European losses for example, whereas I think they do, so that could be something that\u2019s a difference between the two.","Chris J. Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Good morning guys. First question for you Chuck, I mean as we look at the capacity utilization you ran out in the fourth quarter, 93.4 and then full year 97.5, that's pretty heady, I mean just somewhat capacity constrained or getting close to it. Just curious if you think about that versus your pricing strategy broadly, is there any reason that you would soften pricing or increase incentive, it seems being capacity constraint you might consider raising prices more broadly, I understand there are some specific programs and inventory here, and there you need to take some actions, but you're in a good position, the industry seems like you want to get to a position on its capacity utilization, I\u2019m just curious as you're thinking about 2013, shouldn't this be a good year for pricing?","Chuck Stevens \t","Yes let's talk about capacity first, that's 97% on a two shift basis. If we looked at our capacity on a three shift basis, ultimately we'd like to be in the range of 120% to 130%, so there's an opportunity to continue to drive that, we've got 8 plants on three shifts so we'd like to increase that, so we continue to same structural cost. But talking about pricing next year and where we are with the GMT900, obviously we want to transition through that, and have a good position in the market from a share standpoint as we launch the K2XX, we don't want to give up market position from that standpoint, so I think when you look at carryover pricing year-over-year, the biggest headwind or challenge we'll have will be related to the GMT900, I think from the rest of the portfolio perspective we're going to continue to opportunistically look at improved pricing.","","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay that's very helpful and then Dan and mentioned you got a ABS deal of $1 billion at 1.2% at GM Financial obviously that is very inexpensive relative to what you're charging your customers, just curious are we going to see a lot more deals like that for GM financial over the BOD in the future, where you are actually doing sort of on balance sheet funding for a GM Financial?","Daniel Ammann","Those are on balance sheet securitization so there have placed it on the GMF balance sheet, and that\u2019s being a primary funding tool for GMF over the last little while because it\u2019s just such an efficient way to fund number one. Number two, it matches perfectly the duration of the assets and the liabilities, so you don\u2019t get into any sort of carry trade issues if you like there. We have issued over the last year and a half, $1.5 billion of unsecured debt out of GMF at increasingly attractive rates as well. And so we are migrating to a broader set of funding tools for the business there, as we grow the portfolio. The acquisition of Ally will further broaden out the sources of funding that we have for the business.","So it\u2019s a pretty deliberant and steady development of the funding base, keeping it as efficiently as possible, well matched liquidity point of view as possible, diversified sources of funding, pretty much the evolution that you want to see as we continue to grow the business.","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, and then just lastly on cash structure and how you are looking at adverses, which were invite to shareholders, obviously the pensioner kind of cap this as far as putting cash contributions likely in this year, you\u2019re talking about focusing on the mandatory convert in VEBA things that you might be focusing on next as far as taking down. Could there be more share buybacks or dividend putting in place before you get the mandatory, and you even referred that out of the way, or do you think you need to sort of focus on building up cash and taking those out before you return more value to shareholders recognizing you already bought back shares, but I\u2019m just curious sort of in order of operations, where cash flow go there?","Daniel Ammann","Well I take a couple of things, one just a minor point, which is the mandatory convertible, will convert to common stock in November (inaudible) terms so that\u2019s not a cash flow per se, that\u2019s more cash opportunity, because once that converts, we want to be paying the coupon that we are paying on that currently, so it\u2019s the point on that one or generally I would say, we have a pretty disciplined capital allocation framework that we have used over the last year plus now that we used to review opportunities with our Board of Directors that we look at everything on a relative basis in there.","And so what I identified earlier was to find opportunities that we see out there, we are always evaluating relative attractiveness of one opportunity over the other, things come along that we don\u2019t expect necessarily or as planning for such as the buyback that we executed in December; that wasn\u2019t something that we foresaw as a defined opportunity, too much ahead of times, so I guess the point is there are things out there that we know we would like to do. There are opportunities that are well defined right now that could come along and we will evaluate those in a defined disciplined risk adjusted return to our share owners framework.","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey thanks everybody and Dan I would like the freudian slip on the core ware there to be an interesting Valentines Day present. Question on Europe, Opel, we understand you have done a great job of reducing inventory at the company level, can you give us an update on where you stand in terms of unit inventory at the dealer level?","Daniel F. Akerson","","Dealer level is a little higher. And we are working that down sort of through this quarter as well. So I would say we are in better shape on the company side than we are on the dealer side, but we are making some good progress on that as well, and when we think about inventory, we think about obviously the whole chain if you like and we are focused on both of these.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And a question on your preserved guidance either in the U.S. or Europe incorporate in anyway 94 yen-dollar or 125 yen-euro, have you or do you expect to see any competitive pressure from the Japanese players as a result of this.","Daniel F. Akerson","I guess I mean the whole currency equation is much more multidimensional than just what the yen doing on the flip side, we felt that as I said earlier, the Korean Won strengthening which tells me other direction for those guys. So you also have, when the yen strengthened as much as it did going back few quarters, are you sure to rush the localization by some of the Japanese to get more localization here.","So there may not be a perfectly symmetrical unwind system either side of that as well. So what we said our plans for the year, we obviously have FX assumptions in there, say as we move into their early part of the year, there are some tailwinds, and some headwinds too soon to call the overall effect for the year. South America for example, Brazilian Real move favorably for us there. So we gave you the impact of the Venezuelan devaluation. So\u2026","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it.","Daniel Ammann","Certainly, equilibrium has been a lot of currency activity already or a lot of contracts.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. I appreciate that, and just finally, you\u2019ve been looking for new head of global marketing for about six or seven months. We believe you\u2019re still interviewing candidates from outside the Company, how is that going, is there still a unified head of global marketing job to be filled or are you moving back to global brand has instead, so that there is no longer really relevant, and in that vein, we\u2019re still on track for the $2 billion of savings from commonwealth as a result of potentially reconsidering your global marketing strategy? Thanks.","Daniel F. Akerson","The answer to the question is it will probably evolve more to a global market brand head, rather than the global chief marketing officer. And yes, the commonwealth structure was got in place, which largely surrounds Chevrolet is still operative, still in place and the saving is still projected.","Daniel F. Akerson","","Yeah, no change there.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. The last question will come from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Ryan J. Brinkman \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. At the Detroit show you guided to roughly flat GM Financial earnings year-over-year in 2013, inclusive of a partial euro profits from Ally\u2019s International operations, and I am not sure what your assumptions are for one that varies to proportions of Ally international close or what you expect in terms of profit contribution from those operation. So maybe you can just help me understand, what your underlying assumptions are for the current core North American GM Financial operations in 2013. It would seem to incorporate a decent decline and I was just hoping you could walk through some of the drivers there given that they are coming off at a record year in 2012?","Daniel F. Akerson","Sure, well, I think the outlook that we provided stands, which is there will be core for the existing GM will be down slightly, and offset by some portion of a partial Europe in the Ally business. Exactly how that\u2019s a function of when the transaction closes and the closes in a series of steps by geography, so that\u2019s all still moving around somewhat. What I would say is on the core GMF business is, we have had some tailwinds last year from some of the pre-acquisition portfolio and how that was accounted for and would gone through that previously that gave some extra yield to some of those assets through the P&L.","So a little bit of that tailwind in that one would occur this year. So there is no huge change in the fundamental outlook, it\u2019s more just some of the way that the accounting worked for some of the pre-acquistion portfolios rolling off and we are back to kind of a core for the business. So I\u2019d say that the assuming the Ally transaction is closed roughly on time through the second and third quarters that we would expect year to be essentially roughly flat year-over-year.","Ryan J. Brinkman \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay great. Thanks then last question, full size pick up truck sales have improved recently in U.S. it looks like your share also got quite a bit stronger in December and then January relative to what it was in October and November, so can you maybe just discuss for us, the sensitivity of your North American earnings to these pickup truck volumes and maybe just kind of walk us through how you\u2019re feeling now, about the pickup truck market in the U.S. and your inventories in light of how the market and your share has trended over the past couple of months. Thank you.","Daniel F. Akerson","Yeah, I would say that first we need to recognize that our capacity in full size pick-ups is relatively flat year-over-year. We are going to have significant downtime and transition time, so as the industry improves, as the segment share increases, our share increases. There is not a lot of production upside, what it does is helps us reduce our inventory levels, and from an inventory perspective I would say after December and January results, we are executing to our plans. There is a lot of variability and volatility in that, but we are reasonably comfortable with our truck inventories, where they are now, as we head into the transition. So I would say from a 2013 perspective there is pretty limited upside on full size pick up production just because of the transition.","Ryan J. Brinkman \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great thanks for all the color. Congratulations on the quarter.","Operator","Thank you Mr. Arickx.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Thursday, August 2, 2012. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Randy Arickx, Executive Director of Communications and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Randy Arickx","Thanks, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us as we review our second quarter 2012 results. Our press release was issued earlier this morning, and the conference call materials are available on the Investor Relations website. I would also like to mention that GM is broadcasting this call via the Internet.","Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the legend regarding forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. As always, the content of our call will be governed by this language.","This morning, Dan Akerson, General Motors' Chairman and CEO, will provide opening remarks, followed by a more detailed review with Dan Ammann, Senior Vice President and CFO. Dan Akerson will then conclude the remarks portion of our call with some closing comments. After the presentation portion of the call, we will open the lines for questions from security analysts.","Today, we also have Nick Cyprus, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; Chuck Stevens, CFO North America and South America; and Jim Davlin, Vice President, Finance and Treasurer, to assist in answering your questions.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dan Akerson.","Daniel F. Akerson","Thank you, Randy, and thank you to everyone on the call for joining us.","Today, we are reporting financial results that reflect a number of realities about our business, the competitive landscape and the global economy. The first is that in a tough environment, we have been profitable -- we had a profitable year-to-date in 4 out of our 5 segments, which reflects the strong diversification of our earnings base. GM North America is a powerful earnings engine with the potential to become even stronger. The second concern is Europe. In the past, we haven't moved fast enough to fix the things that we can control, but that's changed. Third, at GMIO, staying on offense has helped us increase our year-over-year sales and share in China and positions us for growth in key markets like Russia. In South America, where GM underinvested for years, our product lineup is being revitalized. And finally, GM Financial has been a tremendously successful acquisition, and it is delivering on all the synergies we expected.","Before we go deeper into the results, I'd like to address the subject of leadership. In recent weeks, you've seen that we had to -- we would not hesitate to act when changes required to make the business stronger. That may mean promoting leaders who have motivated teams to achieve great things from our customers, or it could mean recruiting talent from outside GM to accelerate things. From time to time, it will mean parting company with people who are not delivering expected results or, alternatively, who do not meet the highest standards for accountability and integrity. That's the way it has to be for all of us in order for the company to reach its full potential.","All right. Let's turn back to the second quarter. At the top of Slide 2, you can see that we increased our global deliveries year-over-year by roughly 70,000 units, thanks to Chevrolet, which is on a roll. The brand has now delivered 7 consecutive quarters of record sales. While our net revenue was down $1.8 billion to $37.6 billion, virtually the entire decline reflects the strengthening of the dollar against the euro and other major currencies.","Looking at net income attributable to common stockholders, the bottom line was $1.5 billion, down from $2.5 billion a year ago due largely to losses in Europe.","Turning to our non-GAAP results, our EBIT-adjusted was $2.1 billion in the second quarter, down from $3 billion a year ago, largely because of Europe. North America was down slightly. Europe's EBIT-adjusted loss was $0.4 billion. GMIO's results were essentially equal to a year ago, and South America was slightly down.","GM Financial had earnings before taxes of $0.2 billion for the quarter, which was a strong $0.1 billion increase from last year. Finally, our automotive free cash flow was $1.7 billion.","As I said before, these are solid results in a difficult global environment but our aspirations are much higher, which is why we are systematically entering more new segments, improving our execution and driving cost and complexity out of the business.","If you'll turn to Slide 3, I'll cover some of the recent accomplishments on these fronts then I'll turn it back to Dan Ammann. As we talk about our regional progress, you can see how it is linked together by our global growth strategy of great products, strong brands and strength in the most important growth markets.","Let's start with North America, where 70% of our nameplate will be all new or redesigned over the course of 2012 and 2013. This rejuvenation of our product portfolio combined with all of the new and renovated stores our dealers are building around the country is unprecedented for GM. We are investing in all of our brands, but the focus of our launch activities this spring and summer has been Cadillac and Chevrolet.","The new Cadillac XTS began shipping in June, and it's off to a very strong start as you heard on yesterday sales call. When it's joined by the all-new ATS compact luxury sedan this quarter, Cadillac will have great products in 5 of the 6 largest segments of the luxury market.","At Chevrolet, the all-new 2013 Malibu 4-cylinder, which will represent about 3\/4 of our mix, is now in production, as is the Chevrolet Spark. And finally, we will begin delivering the all-new Malibu Turbo late this quarter.","Of course, our biggest non-product initiative was the pension lump sum and annuitization program we launched for U.S. salaried employees. All affected participants have made their elections and will complete the transaction by the end of the year.","Turning to Europe. We have made progress on all of the key components of our restructuring plan: building a stronger team, investing in new products and addressing our cost and capacity. We have already reached competitive operating agreements with our Ellesmere Port complex in England and our Gliwice plant in Poland. We have also made good progress streamlining decision-making, reducing our material cost and managing our working capital and cash flow.","As we announced in June, Opel Management and German unions are continuing to discuss a broad range of issues that will help ensure the sustainability of the business, including productivity, cost and capacity. We expect to have a comprehensive agreement in place sometime this fall.","Next I'd like to discuss the new leadership team in Europe. Progress always comes faster if you approach the business unconstrained by the past. That's why we've hired change agents to help us to accelerate our progress. Former AlixPartners executive, Thomas Sedran, joined the management board in April, and he is bringing extensive restructuring experience to his new role as Deputy Chairman.","In July, Alfred Rieck, the Volkswagen executive who led the launch of Skoda in China, became our new Vice President of Sales, Marketing and Aftersales. And most recently, Michael Lohscheller, who is the CFO of Volkswagen America, helped steer its rapid growth, will join the Opel board in September as Chief Financial Officer.","These executives have come to GM because they are confident in our plan, and they see the long-term potential that exists when Opel's great products are married to a competitive cost structure and the right go-to-market strategy.","As always, success starts with great products. The Opel lineup continues to get stronger. For example, we announced that Opel's first urban car, the Adam, will reach the market in early 2013. In addition, the new Opel Mokka compact SUV, an entirely new segment for the brand, went into production just last week.","Finally, we continue to advance our relationship with PSA. In July, we announced that PSA subsidiary, Gefco, will become GM's inbound and outbound logistics architect for a 30-site network of assembly and powertrain plants, parts warehouses and ports of discharge. Our goal is to meaningfully lower our total cost of logistics per vehicle, and we expect to be operational in the first half of '13. I want to highlight this example because it beautifully illustrates our approach, which is to rethink how we do business to build a truly sustainable model. This same philosophy is guiding all of our GM PSA work streams, which we continue to make good progress on.","Turning to GMIO, we continue to be the best-positioned global automaker because of our success in countries like China and the strategic investments we are making for growth. In China, for example, we're taking a longer view of the market and preparing for an industry that should grow to more than 30 million units by the end of the decade. To that end, we continue to optimize our manufacturing capacity, and we are adding 600 dealers this year. In addition, we are investing $1 billion in Russia over the next 5 years. And in June, we began an expansion at GM Auto in St. Petersburg, Russia. That will see our annual capacity double to 230,000 Opel and Chevrolet vehicles by 2015.","Further east, Thailand became the first market to launch the all-new Chevrolet TrailBlazer mid-size SUV. And we also announced plans to build the Chevrolet Spin MPV in Indonesia, beginning in 2013.","Turning to South America. We're getting back to a much healthier market position, especially in Brazil. The just-launched Chevrolet Cobalt S10 and Cruze are all performing well. To keep our momentum going, we've launched another 3 vehicles in the second quarter: the Cruze hatchback, the Sonic and the Spin MPV, which has been earning very strong reviews.","In addition to launching new products to grow our top line, we continue our efforts to offset headwinds and to reduce the region's breakeven level by addressing high cost capacity, optimizing our logistics, increasing local sourcing and other actions.","Finally, GM Financial continues to expand the range of financing options it offers our customers and dealers, and it's leading to incremental volume for us. As Dan will cover later, GMF has helped us improve our lease penetration, and we are a leader in subprime finance, both in terms of market share and risk management. In addition, during the quarter, GM Financial launched its Commercial Lending Services business, which offers floor plan, insurance, real estate loans and construction loans for GM dealers. They closed several deals, and dealer interest is high.","This is a tremendous amount of activity. Taken as a whole, these examples and the earnings detail Dan Ammann will walk you through clearly shows we're moving forward confidently despite all of the external headwinds.","With that said, Dan, the floor is yours.","Daniel Ammann","Thanks, Dan. At the top of Slide 4, we provide a summary of our second quarter 2012 GAAP results compared to 2011. As Dan just covered, net revenues were $37.6 billion, a $1.8 billion decrease from the prior year. The decrease was mostly due to $1.6 billion in unfavorable foreign exchange translation.","GAAP operating income was $1.8 billion for the quarter. Net income to common stockholders was $1.5 billion, down $1 billion from 2011. Earnings per share were $0.90 on a fully diluted basis compared to $1.54 for the same period in the prior year. And our automotive net cash from operating activities was $3.8 billion, $1.2 billion less than the second quarter of 2011.","Moving to the non-GAAP metrics. EBIT-adjusted was $2.1 billion for the second quarter, down $900 million from 2011. The EBIT-adjusted margin was 5.6%, a 1.9-percentage-point decline from the prior year. Automotive free cash flow was $1.7 billion in the second quarter.","Turning to Slide 5, we did not have any special items in the second quarter of 2012 or 2011.","On Slide 6, we provide the EBIT-adjusted by region for the second quarters of 2011 and 2012. As Dan previously covered, GMNA's EBIT-adjusted was $2 billion. GME's EBIT-adjusted was a loss of $360 million, a $460 million decrease from the $100 million profit a year ago.","GMIO had an EBIT-adjusted of $600 million, and GMSA's EBIT-adjusted was breakeven, down $100 million from the prior year. GM Financial continued to improve earnings with $200 million for the quarter, an increase of $100 million from the prior year.","Corporate sector and eliminations was a $200 million loss, which included a $100 million unfavorable noncash foreign currency translation accounting adjustment. This nets to an EBIT-adjusted of $2.1 billion for the second quarter of 2012.","Slide 7 shows our consolidated EBIT-adjusted for the last 5 quarters. At the bottom of the slide, our GAAP operating income margin was 4.8% for the second quarter, a 1.4-percentage-point decline from Q2 of '11.","Our EBIT-adjusted margin was 5.6%, 1.9 percentage points lower than the prior year. This decline is largely driven by our performance in GME, which we'll cover in the segment reviews. Our global production numbers are roughly equal to the second quarter of 2011. Our global market share declined 0.7 percentage points as the sales of many of our competitors continue to recover from last year's supply disruptions due to the Japanese earthquake.","Turning to Slide 8. We provide a second quarter 2012 comparison of our consolidated EBIT-adjusted to the prior year. On the left side of the chart, our EBIT-adjusted was $3 billion for 2011. In the middle portion of the slide, we walked a $900-million decline in the quarter.","Volume was flat. Mix was unfavorable $100 million. Price was favorable $300 million for the quarter due to the strength of our new product introductions. Total costs were up $400 million, including a $200 million decrease in U.S. pension income and reflecting our focus on cost containment across the company. Other was $700 million unfavorable due to $500 million of foreign exchange, of which approximately half was the absence of prior year favorable FX and a $200-million reduction this previous year, favorable lease residual adjustments in GM North America. Absent these items, core operating profitability was similar to Q2 2011 results.","We'll now move on to our segment results with the key performance indicators for GM North America on Slide 9. The lines on the top of the slide represent GM's U.S. total and retail share, and the bars represent GM's average U.S. retail incentives on a per-unit basis. Our U.S. retail incentive spending as a percentage of average transaction price and a comparison to the industry average are noted on the bottom of the slide.","For the second quarter of 2012, our U.S. retail share was 15.9%, down 1.7 percentage points versus the prior year. Our incentive levels on an absolute basis have increased $613 per vehicle from the prior year.","On a percentage of ATP basis, our incentives were 10.9%, up 2.1 percentage points from the prior year. This puts us at 110% of industry average levels for the second quarter of 2012 due to higher incentives in April. For July, our retail market share was 15.2%, and our incentives are estimated to being right at our target of 100% of the industry average.","On Slide 10, we show GMNA's EBIT-adjusted for the last 5 quarters. At the bottom of the slide, revenue was $22.9 billion, down slightly versus 2011. GMNA's EBIT-adjusted margin was 8.6% for the second quarter, down 1.1 percentage points from the prior year.","U.S. dealer inventory was 701,000 units at the end of the second quarter, or 76 days supply versus 605,000 units and 73 days\u2019 supply at the end of the second quarter of 2011. Full-size pickup truck inventory was approximately 238,000 units on June 30 and 219,000 at the same period in 2011.","By the end of 2012, we expect our U.S. dealer inventory to be in the range of 650,000 units or about 65 to 70 days supply. Of this total, we expect full-size pickups to be 200,000 to 220,000 units.","GMNA production was 837,000 units for the quarter, a 13,000-unit increase from the prior year. And GMNA market share was 17.4% for the quarter, 1.7 percentage points lower than the prior year. Again, this was partially due to the sales recovery of some of our competitors from the supply disruptions last year.","Turning to Slide 11. We provide the explanation of the year-over-year decline in GMNA's EBIT-adjusted, which actually rounds close to $300 million. Starting on the left-hand side, GMNA's EBIT-adjusted was $2.2 billion for the second quarter of 2011. There was no impact due to volume changes.","Mix was unfavorable $100 million due to lower production of full-size trucks. Price was flat. Costs were $100 million favorable this quarter due to a $300-million decrease in material freight and other costs, offset with $200 million in unfavorable U.S. pension income. This, again, is evidence that we have initiatives in place to contain costs in the business.","Other was $300 million unfavorable due to a $200 million year-over-year reduction in favorable lease adjustments and a $100 million absence of favorable C dollar exchange that we had last year. This totals to an EBIT-adjusted of $2 billion for the second quarter of 2012.","Moving on to GME on Slide 12. The region reported an unfavorable EBIT-adjusted of $360 million for the second quarter, a decline of $460 million from the prior year. At the bottom of the slide, revenue was $5.9 billion for the quarter, down $1.6 billion from the prior year. This decline was due primarily to $800 million in lower volume and $700 million in unfavorable foreign exchange translation. The EBIT-adjusted margin in the region was negative 6.1%.","GME's production for the quarter was 230,000 units, down 96,000, or 30%, from the prior year. GME's market share in the region was 8.8%, a 0.2-percentage-point decline from 2011.","On Slide 13, we provide the major components of GME's $500 million year-over-year decline in EBIT-adjusted. Volume and mix were each $100 million unfavorable. Price was unchanged for the quarter as the strength of our new models offset pricing pressure on the rest of the portfolio.","Cost was $100 million unfavorable due to $200 million in lower powertrain and accessory sales, which we reflect in this cost category, offset by $100 million in favorable material and manufacturing costs as our cost actions gain traction.","Other was $200 million unfavorable due to a $100 million loss in foreign currency derivatives and other individually insignificant items. This totals to GME's EBIT-adjusted loss of $400 million for the second quarter of 2012.","On Slide 14, we show GMIO's EBIT-adjusted for the past 5 quarters, including the equity income from our JVs. In the second quarter, GMIO posted EBIT-adjusted of $600 million. Moving to the bottom of the slide, GMIO's revenue from our consolidated operations was $6.9 billion, up $500 million from the prior year due most entirely to increased wholesale volumes.","GMIO's EBIT-adjusted margin from consolidated operations was 4.3%, a 0.7-percentage-point increase from the prior year and our best margin performance in 7 quarters, driven largely by improved operating results from Korea.","Our China JV net income margins decreased 1.8 percentage points from a strong performance in Q2 '11 to 9.3% in Q2 of '12. GMIO's total production for the quarter was up 92,000 units from the prior year, primarily due to increases in our joint ventures.","Market share in the region was 9.2% for the second quarter, a year-over-year decrease of 0.6 percentage points due to the recovery of the industry in Japan where we have virtually no presence. For perspective, our market share in China was up 0.4 percentage points to 13.8% in Q2 of '12.","Turning to Slide 15, we provide the major components of GMIO's EBIT-adjusted performance. The impact of volume was $100 million favorable due to increased wholesale units at our consolidated operations. Mix was flat for the quarter.","The effective price was $200 million favorable due to higher pricing for new models. Costs were unfavorable $100 million because of increased manufacturing and material costs due to new product programs.","Other was $200 million unfavorable due to $100 million in lower equity income from the China joint ventures and $100 million in unfavorable foreign exchange. This totals to GMIO's second quarter 2012 EBIT-adjusted of $600 million.","Slide 16 shows GMSA's EBIT-adjusted for the last 5 quarters. In the second quarter of 2012, the region had a near-breakeven performance, including the impact of approximately $70 million of restructuring costs relative to $60 million EBIT-adjusted from a year ago.","At the bottom of the slide, revenue was $4.2 billion, a $200 million decline from 2011. The EBIT-adjusted margin in the region was negative 0.5%, down 1.9 percentage points from 2011.","GMSA's production was 230,000 units, down slightly from the second quarter of 2011. Market share in the region came in at 18.2% in the quarter as our new product launches are just beginning to gain traction in the marketplace.","On Slide 17, we look at the components of the year-over-year performance in South America. Despite the slight production decrease, the impact of volume rounded to 0.","Mix was favorable $100 million and continues to be a tailwind in the region as we launch new products with higher margins. Price was favorable $100 million, largely related to increases in Venezuela and Argentina.","Costs were unfavorable $200 million due to $100 million in higher material and manufacturing and the aforementioned restructuring costs. Other was $100 million unfavorable, primarily due to foreign exchange. This totals to a breakeven result for GMSA in the second quarter.","This is the second consecutive quarter where we've had a positive EBIT-adjusted before restructuring, and evidence that our product launches and cost actions are beginning to turn around performance in the region.","Turning to Slide 18, we provide our walk of automotive free cash flow for the second quarter. After adding back noncontrolling interest, preferred dividends and undistributed earnings allocated to Series B and subtracting GM Financial, our automotive income was $1.8 billion for the second quarter of 2012.","We had no special items, and our D&A was a $1.5 billion non-cash expense. Working capital was $1 billion use of cash due primarily to a decrease in accounts payable. Pension and OPEB cash payments exceeded expense by $200 million in the quarter.","Other was a $1.7-billion source of cash due primarily to $1 billion in distributed joint venture dividends and excess of quarterly equity income and $600 million in balance sheet movements related to our rental car fleet. This totals down to an automotive net cash provided by operating activities of $3.8 billion.","After deducting capital expenditures of $2.1 billion in the quarter, our automotive free cash flow was $1.7 billion, a $2.1 billion decline from the prior year.","On Slide 19, we provide a summary of our key automotive balance sheet items. We finished the quarter with $38.5 billion in total automotive liquidity, consisting of $32.6 billion in cash and marketable securities and $5.8 billion of available credit facilities.","On the bottom portion of the slide, our book value of debt is $5.1 billion, and our Series A preferred stock is $5.5 billion. U.S. qualified pension plans are underfunded by $12.8 billion, and our non-U.S. pensions are underfunded by $11.2 billion at the end of the second quarter. Finally, our OPEB liability is $7.2 billion.","Slide 20 provides a summary of key operational metrics related to our financing activities. GM Financial reported their results this morning and will be holding a conference call at noon. Our U.S. subprime financing in the second quarter has increased over the prior year to 8.7% and continues to modestly exceed the industry average. Our U.S. lease penetration is 15.3% in Q2, a 1.8 percentage-point increase from the prior year. Lease penetration in Canada is at 8%, slightly less than a year ago.","GM new vehicles as a percentage of GM Financial originations increased to 45%, and GM Financial's percentage of GM's U.S. consumer subprime financing and leasing is 21%. GM Financial had annualized net credit losses of only 1.5% for the quarter, a 0.9 percentage-point improvement from 2011. This credit performance is at a seasonal low and will likely weaken somewhat through the balance of the year. Earnings before tax were $217 million for the second quarter, a $73 million improvement from the prior year.","Before I turn it back over to Dan, I'd like to address our current 2012 outlook on Slide 21. Despite some challenging macroeconomic data coming out of North America, we still believe that U.S. light vehicle sales in 2012 will end up in the 14 million to 14.5 million unit range. Through June, the U.S. light vehicle SAAR was 14.3.","We continue to expect that the average of GMNA results for the second and third quarters will be comparable to the performance in Q1. Second quarter results for GMNA were stronger, in part due to the timing of spending -- of some spending that was deferred to the third quarter. Finally, Europe continues to be extremely challenging, which makes our outlook for the year uncertain.","On a consolidated basis, we've taken the first steps in realizing our goal of global efficiencies and are making progress on our cost structure. Our balance sheet remains strong, but the industry continues to be dynamic and fluid. We are adjusting to this challenging environment and expect to see similar general business trends in the second half of the year that we saw in the first.","Now I'll turn it back over to Dan Akerson for his closing remarks.","Daniel F. Akerson","Thanks, Dan. I'll keep my closing remarks very brief. This is a solidly profitable quarter for General Motors, particularly in North America and Asia. We're making progress in South America. We generated $1.7 billion in automotive free cash flow, and we continue to strengthen our balance sheet. We're also entering new segments to drive revenue today and laying the foundation for tomorrow. As you can tell from the specific examples I cited earlier in the call, we are tightly coordinated, systematic and relentless in attacking the issues that hold us back and pursuing growth opportunities around the world. Still, the fact remains that most of our key metrics were unfavorable compared with the year ago. That's not acceptable with this leadership team, and we're going to underscore that fact with our teams to keep everyone on point.","Thank you, and now we can open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I had 3 questions on Europe. First, can you unequivocally rule out putting any more money into Peugeot? Because I understand, at the time of the cap raise, the idea was to make sure your partner was healthy and had the resources to back it up as you guys start to work together on projects. But given some of the deteriorating situation in the market, just wanted your -- to have your stance on whether you draw the line anywhere in terms of cap?","Daniel Ammann","Yes, we have no intention of putting any more money into PSA.","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Next question on inventory. I was surprised by the comment that you said working capital was improving in Europe. I think we've heard that inventory levels are actually rather high at both the dealer and at the factory level, and that is actually quite the opposite of working capital control. I was wondering if you could elaborate or give a little color on what inventory levels are? How high are they at dealer and at factory level in Europe?","Daniel Ammann","Yes, I'm not sure I said that they were improving in Europe. And I would agree with your general assessment, which is we still have work to do on both the dealer and the company-owned inventory, and we expect to address that through the third and fourth quarters. We did make some modest progress in the second quarter, but we have more work to do on that front. So I agree with your comments.","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So Dan, would you then -- would I be mistaken then, given the inventory levels that need to be adjusted and you overproduced relative to demand in the first half, would it -- and the seasonality trends that are typical in Europe, are we crazy to assume second half losses couldn't be substantially more than the first half in Europe?","Daniel Ammann","Yes, we're not going to provide any specific perspective on second half losses. The macro environment is going to be as big a driver of the industry as anything else, and there's a huge amount of uncertainty around that. What we're doing is we're focusing on 3 or 4 things. We're focusing on a couple of big product launches, your namesake product. We're focusing on the launch of the Mokka, which is going to be very important for us. We're focused on getting those successfully launched and into the marketplace on a sustainable basis. We're focused on cost and capacity, all the things you've heard us talk about on those fronts. We're focused on managing supply to demand and managing production and inventory and continuing to work that. So we're going to be taking actions on all of those fronts. Exactly how the second half of the year shakes out is going to be, in large part, a function of the market environment.","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Just one final question on Europe if I may. Can you tell us the size of the intercompany loan from GM to Opel, please?","Daniel Ammann","We don't comment on our intercompany funding arrangements anywhere in the company, including with respect to the European business.","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And would you not comment on whether that changed? If there was the delta in the second quarter?","Daniel Ammann","Sorry, ask that again?","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Would you comment on -- if you don't comment on the amount of it, could you comment directionally on is that loan increasing or is it stable?","Daniel Ammann","I'd say the only thing I'd say at this point in time is that across the company, as a general matter, cash flow tends to track profitability.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just hoping maybe, although you're not commenting on the profitability of Europe in the back half, if you can make any comments on what you anticipate as being sort of the production run rate in that region? And relative to your operating leverage in Europe, it looks like decremental margins per unit have been extremely low. You went from, I think, 290,000 to 230,000 units of production, Q1 to Q2, earnings impact only $100 million. And year-over-year, it looks like it's even less. Is that something -- is there anything unusual on that?","Daniel Ammann","I'd say some of it's a function of where that production went. Did it go into company-owned inventory or did it go into dealer inventory, because that drives where you recognize the revenue and some of the profits, so there's an element of that. The decrease in [indiscernible] -- I'm probably saying the same thing. The decrease in deliveries was lower than the increase in production, if that makes sense. We also have factors going on from a mix point of view between countries and between product lines. There are obviously parts of the continent that are more profitable or less unprofitable than others as it relates to country line profitability and also product line profitability. So it's hard to do a simple incremental margin analysis and draw any real conclusions from that.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. On this joint venture that you have with PSA, you were targeting about $1 billion of cost reduction. I was hoping you might give us some color on whether there's been any progress on that or, just generally, on that relationship given their financial situation. And any quantification of cost savings that you might be targeting, just near term and looking out to 2013 in that region?","Daniel Ammann","Yes, nothing has really fundamentally changed from what we talked about at the time that we announced the initiative in terms of either the magnitude or the timing of savings. We have announced the arrangement, as Dan mentioned in his remarks, around the logistics business, and that was something we identified early on as something that we'd be able to get to fairly quickly, and we've done that. So I'd say we're on track relative to what we've talked about previously. But in the time line that we had talked about, it's pretty early days. So bottom line, I wouldn't expect any huge benefits in 2013 arising from those, which is consistent with what we told you before.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Would there be any significant savings that you're targeting for 2013 aside from that, maybe just from the logistics and these work roll changes in the U.K. and in Germany?","Daniel Ammann","Yes. I mean, we're working aggressively on the cost structure of the business. We still see opportunity to improve that in the business. You mentioned a couple of opportunities. We still see just general and administrative cost-reduction opportunities. And one of the benefits that we have and will have from having a number of fresh leaders go into that business is an opportunity to relook at some of those things. So I think we are not yet done from a cost-opportunity perspective.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Just lastly, any color on what we should be thinking in terms of Asia equity income? You had a bit of a decline despite the production in that JV being up. How should we be thinking about margins or just the equity earnings coming into the -- to GM?","Daniel Ammann","There are couple of effects there. One of the major drivers of that results, of production up and margins and earnings down slightly, was some mix shift between the SGM business and SGM Wuling. So the Wuling business accounted for a significant chunk of the growth year-over-year, which is a function of the shifts that we're seeing in the overall marketplace. So that's really the main driver of that dynamic. As we've talked about this for a few quarters, the market remains quite competitive in China. There are some pricing pressures there, but we're still looking at basically a 9%, 10% margin business over there. So we feel good about the overall financial result, and we'll see how the future quarters come.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Peter Nesvold with Jefferies & Company.","H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","A question on North America and then a question on Europe. In North America, 70% of the nameplates renewing in the reasonably foreseeable future, when do you expect the full force of those launch costs to start to hit the P&L?","Daniel F. Akerson","It depends on the launch cost. I would say, starting this year, with the downtime related to the K2XX, we've got a pretty significant manufacturing project impact this year, and that'll run into next year as we launch a few more of the products. And then the big marketing launch cost, really around the K2XX and some of these other products, will start to manifest themselves in 2013 throughout the calendar year.","H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And can you comment on the pricing environment at Europe right now?","Daniel Ammann","I'd say it remains very challenging and very competitive. We haven't seen a fundamental change relative to what we've being experiencing for the last couple of quarters, and we don't see any major external catalysts to drive a fundamental change in that, absent some fundamental change in the economic outlook.","H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. You haven't seen any increased incentive activity by any major competitors yet?","Daniel Ammann","Well, I'd say there's been a lot of incentive activity and a lot of price reduction activity all through the years. So that's been something we've been seeing for quite some time now. We don't see any reason for that to change fundamentally near term. You see in our second quarter year-over-year walk-through for Europe that we had price impact roughly flat. And as I said in my remarks, that's pricing we have on some new product, offsetting some price degradation on the bulk of the portfolio.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays Capital.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So let me talk about -- ask about South America. It looks like x restructuring charges, you would have made about $70 million. So that's about 140 basis points or so margin -- 170 basis points, excuse me. Fiat is now breaking out results. Was it 9%? And I know, internally, you tend to look at where you are versus competitor benchmarks and now we have one for another market leader there. What do you see as the main sources of that gap? And then how quickly and to what extent can you close that gap with some of the actions and products under way?","Daniel Ammann","I'll just make one comment, which is you're absolutely right, that we've done that benchmarking exercise and -- as you would expect and hope. And Chuck will take you through the main elements in that gap.","Chuck Stevens","Yes, I think there's 3 fundamental pieces. First, manufacturing footprint. We've talked about that before and talked about the capacity actions that we need to take from a footprint perspective. And I would size that up to somewhere in -- 30% to 40% of that gap is related to manufacturing footprint. Second, overall product line profitability. We're still selling, at least through the first 6 months of this year, a pretty heavy majority of our products being legacy products, where we've got challenges from a margin standpoint. The other piece of that is on our new products. And Dan mentioned it earlier, we need to continue to drive on localization. On our new products, we've got a pretty significant level of imported content, and we've got exposure to the weakening real from that basis. So we need to work on that. Then the last piece is SG&A. And we've embarked on a benchmarking exercise around that as well. We think there's significant opportunity, in the range of maybe $75 million to $100 million a year across South America, but primarily in Brazil on SG&A. So a number of actions across all of those fronts.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Could you remind me of the footprint issue? Is it you're in a higher cost area? You don't have the right capacity? You don't have enough capacity?","Chuck Stevens","Yes. When you look at our footprint, about 2\/3 of our Brazilian footprint is in high-cost locations, primarily in and around Sao Paulo. And when you look at Fiat, Volkswagen, the vast majority of their capacity is in low-cost regions of the country. Estimated cost penalty associated with that is $300 million to $400 million a year, just from a footprint standpoint.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And when do you think you can move -- make closure on that?","Chuck Stevens","I didn't hear that last part, sorry.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Is that something you're stuck with? Or is that something that you can evolve to a better footprint?","Chuck Stevens","We started to work through that last year with a restructuring action that we took in Q4. As we just announced in Q2 earnings, there's another restructuring charge that's fundamentally related to a yet-unannounced capacity action to address exactly what we're talking about.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.","Ryan Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Could you perhaps talk about any non-labor and non-capacity cost levers that you might be able to pull in Europe to improve profitability near term? For example, you announced that distribution agreement with PSA. Are there other similar opportunities that could be material, or maybe a number of other smaller opportunities that, in aggregate, could prove material? I ask, just because it seems these levers are a lot easier to pull without having to enter into labor negotiations, et cetera.","Daniel Ammann","Yes, I'd say there's opportunity in multiple parts of the P&L. One thing we haven't talked much about here is we do continue to see some relief on a global basis on raw materials, which is providing a little bit of assistance to us. So I'd say that applies also within Europe. But we certainly have opportunity, similar to what Chuck just talked about on the SG&A side, in South America. I'd say we still have opportunity in Europe on that as an example, and that's something we're going after.","Ryan Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just thinking about the year-over-year earnings walk for North America. Mix has been a big headwind for a while now, maybe not so much in this quarter, but maybe it's structural going forward. But it just seems like a lot of the new vehicles you're launching now might be able to turn things around. How would you encourage people to think about mix as you launch vehicles like the XTS, the ATS, refresh the Lambdas and the full-size trucks, et cetera?","Chuck Stevens","I would say, on a go-forward basis, and fundamentally because we continue to be constrained or capped on full-size pickup, full-size utility production through this year and then, again, through next year as we launch the K2XX. Mix will continue to be a headwind, but not as much magnitude as it was in 2010 and 2011 when we launched Cruze and Sonic and some of the entries that are getting a lot of traction now. And obviously, ATS, XTS, the next-generation CTS will have improved margins, and that will be an offset somewhat to the constraints that we have on full-size pickups and utilities. So I'd say, in general, a headwind but not the same magnitude that it's been over 2010 and '11.","Ryan Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Then last question in keeping with the North America walk, you mentioned that this quarter, GMNA enjoyed a $300-million reduction in material freight and other expenses. Is this primarily reflecting that one-time deferral of expenses from 2Q into 3Q this year? Or does it relate to something particular in the year-ago period that did not repeat? Or is it a tailwind that we can think about continuing going forward?","Chuck Stevens","The year-over-year walk, $200 million was material in freight. So that's just material performance Dan just mentioned. We've got a bit of tailwind in Q2 relative to commodity prices retreating a bit, as well as gas and diesel, which had a favorable impact on freight. The other $100 million was depreciation and amortization, and that's really the unwinding of some fresh start accounting entries and assets related to spare tool and IP amortization. So some of that will continue, the IP amortization. The material and freight depends on what happens with commodity prices. The retiming issue from Q2 to Q3 is really around the guidance that we provided back in Q1 when we indicated that Q2 and Q3 would be in the range of Q1 earnings. Fundamentally, there are 3 drivers of that retiming: We allocated some additional advertising money out of Q2 into Q3 around the Olympics, in supporting the programs that we have in market right now; there were some engineering retiming really related to program-specific spending; and then manufacturing project expense associated with the transition of the K2XX and some additional downtime that we had in Q3 versus Q2. So those were the big drivers of the expense retiming.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess one region we haven't really talked about as much is China, though -- I guess there was one question, which touched on some margin pressure. There's been a lot written about Buick inventories being pretty high right now and further pricing pressures that could result to that. Can you just -- how do you assess the health of that market and the health of the inventories at your dealerships, as well as the competitors?","Daniel Ammann","Well, as I said earlier, part of what drove the performance in this quarter was a mix shift in our business, which reflected a mix shift in the market, to the lower end of the market. So for us, that means work from SGM, which is the Chevrolet-Buick-Cadillac business, to Wuling, which is the smaller product, local product. So that mix shift is part of what's been going on. From an overall inventory and supply\/demand dynamic, I mean, there's no change in our fundamental approach, which is to continue to match production to demand. We track that obviously all the time and make production adjustments as we need to. So we're not going to do anything differently there than from what we've been doing on an ongoing basis. So I'd say the overall market continues to be quite competitive, with pricing pressure sort of up and down the line.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","But I guess, sort of asking it a different way, are these reports correct, that inventory is pretty bloated right now, meaning that pricing pressure could continue or get worse? Or you might be in a position to have to take down production a little bit to correct that?","Daniel Ammann","Yes, I don't know exactly which reports you've read, but I'll restate our approach, which is, obviously, we will manage production to meet demand. We will manage price in a very prudent and responsible way as we do elsewhere in the world, which is to approach the market with as much financial and market discipline as we can. So we're not going to change the strategy or change anything different because we have a slower month or something like that. So fundamentally, matching production to demand and maintaining pricing discipline.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, understood. And speaking of strategy, I know there was a comment on this yesterday during the sales call, but obviously, given the resignation of the sales chief or the marketing -- your marketing chief, what -- when we think about some of the things he was associated with, such as the consolidated -- consolidation of the ad spend, the Chevy Runs Deep program and, I guess, some of the decisions about advertising, Super Bowl, that sort of stuff, is any of that being reassessed right now? Or is the idea to just kind of stay on the path that he set out?","Daniel Ammann","Yes. The fundamental approach, there's no change. The consolidation of agency spend, all of the things that we did with media buy and so on, those are all very real drivers of efficiencies, and we're absolutely going to continue with those. Obviously, tactical day-to-day decisions in the marketplace, we'll continue to assess those as we go, but the fundamental strategy remains in place.","Daniel F. Akerson","I think it's fair to say that -- just to be clear, no individual operates -- I know you -- a lot of the public views this is a personality-driven industry\/company. It's a team effort, and what you saw manifest in the marketplace was a thought-out strategy that was agreed upon as a team.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Colin Langan with UBS.","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Can you provide any color, I'm just trying to bridge Europe from Q4 where you lost about 550 to today, even though volumes were actually lower. I mean, what has changed in that market actually? So what actions have you done to actually improve those? It seems like a pretty dramatic improvement.","Daniel Ammann","Yes. You don't want to get too caught up in off-quarter variance analyses, because there's obviously seasonal things that go on in the business in terms of production versus sales and things going in and out of inventory and so on. But again, we have been working on the cost side of the business as you know. But I think the comparison you want to look at and understand is really the Q2, this year relative to Q2 last year, same thing for Q1 and look it that way as a way to think about the business. You can get caught up if you try to do it on non-matching quarters.","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. That's fair. And any comment on -- you talked about South America, that a lot of content is imported and that's a structural issue. Has that gotten worse with some of the recent changes in regulations down there? Have some -- do you now pay some higher tariffs? Or is that just a legacy issue from importing from North America or Europe?","Chuck Stevens","Actually, it's related to the new product programs. When the decisions were made to invest launching the new product programs, there was a fairly significant level of imported content at launch and then with a plan to localize over time, similar to what we've done in the past. So as we launch the Cruze, Cobalt, Spin and a lot of these products, there's a fairly significant level of imported content, which exposes us to the real. And that's kind of a short-term issue, relatively short-term issue as we continue to execute the localization strategy and get ourselves north of 80%, 90% localization. So it's really not regulatory as much as currency exposure.","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And just one last question on, I guess, the CAW contract that's coming up shortly. Any color on what your negotiation -- goals will be there? I mean, are you aiming to get on parity in the U.S. on a cost basis? Is there any opportunity there?","Daniel Ammann","No. We're not going to get into a discussion of that in the public arena at this time. We'll keep our discussions private. And when we have something to say, we'll say it.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Chris Ceraso with Credit Suisse.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was hoping you could clarify a couple of items, Dan, on the cash flow. You mentioned a rental fleet adjustment, I think, of $600 million. Can you explain what that is? And then also, on the working capital, can you give us some color on the timing and what you expect in the back half? Is working capital going to be a source or a use of cash?","Daniel Ammann","So the rental just relates to the sales-to-rental car customers, and it's mostly just a seasonal law of movement that we typically see as we move through the year on the sales cycle of those vehicles. So nothing unusual there. As it relates to working capital generally, typically, it's a use in the first quarter and then it comes to be more of a source as we go through the year and would expect that to generally continue this year, particularly as we get after some of the inventory opportunities that we see in front of us.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And maybe, Chuck, if you can comment. You mentioned, I think, in 2013, you expect to still be -- I think the word you used was constrained on the full-size trucks. Can you give us a little bit more color on the expected timing? We know that you've got downtime on the T-900s here in Q3 and Q4. Can you help us as we get into 2013 on what to expect on the build rates on the old and new truck?","Chuck Stevens","Yes, I'm not going to get into specifics of 2013 yet. There's a lot of dynamics that still have to play themselves out. I would say that we're about 1 year into a 2-year transition, going from GMT 900s to K2XX as we head into next year's launch cycle. And during that time, with the significant down weeks that we've had this year and then ramp-up and acceleration next year, we're going to continue to have a limit on the number of vehicles that we'll be able to produce until we get the K2XXs fully up and running towards the end of next year. So I think it's a 2-year transition that we continue to manage through. We continue to manage the inventories and try to keep that aligned with demand.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then can you maybe -- coming back to the marketing discussion, can you just comment on the plans for the Chevrolet brand in Europe? I understand that, that's part of the focus here, this new deal that was signed. How does that fit relative to Opel? And you're already overcapacitized for Opel. Do you anticipate Chevy brand growing relative to Opel? And then what does that mean for your capacity at Opel?","Daniel Ammann","Well, from an overall perspective, obviously, our plan is to grow both brands and the market presence of both brands in Europe. You have many manufacturers who are running the market over there with more than 1 brand, and we see a clear opportunity to do that with these 2 brands in 2 different segments of the market. The market share of Chevrolet in Europe has continued to grow year-over-year, as it has for the last few years. We have a lot of new product coming in there as well. But we still have work to do to get exactly the right distribution footprint and network in place as it relates to Chevrolet and, frankly, between the 2 brands.","Operator","Our last question is coming from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just one point of clarification on the outlook for GMNA in the third quarter. I mean, if you read this literally, it looks like you're guiding to about $1.3 billion or $1.4 billion in EBIT. But if look at it optimistically and based on some of your comments, it might be closer to $1.7 billion, right in line with the first quarter. I'm just trying to understand if the literal interpretation is correct, or is it going to be closer to in-line with the first quarter?","Daniel Ammann","Oh you see we're not going to give you a point estimate. So you can figure it out relative to those 2 interpretations.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Then second question in Europe on Slide 13, you're not showing any pricing pressure whatsoever. It's pretty amazing, considering that from the comments that you guys have made and, actually, what we've heard from some of your competitors. What happened there, right, because that doesn't sound like it jives with a lot of the comments out there? And secondly, would you get more aggressive on pricing to push volume over there? Because I know you guys have talked about growing volume as part of the strategy to fix Europe.","Daniel Ammann","Yes. I'd say -- as I commented I think earlier, that there's 2 pieces going on in that year-over-year effect. One is price on some of the new vehicles we're launching, which is favorable, and then we have unfavorable on a lot of the rest of the portfolio. We did take some fairly aggressive price action -- price increase action or incentive reduction action toward the end of last year and early this year, which is why you saw some of the share pressure in the first quarter of this year in particular. And some of -- we took that action to some of the other competitors in the marketplace who we're hitting fairly aggressively in the other direction. So we have a trade-off to make as we go forward. We'll continue to be disciplined and get to the optimal trade-off between price and volume as we see the market evolve. But I can't really be more specific than that at this point.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's impressive. And just on the pensions. Just curious, you mentioned you had the results from the buyouts. So I'm just curious how -- what the take rate was on that and what kind of impact you expect that to have on the funding and the expense going forward.","Daniel Ammann","You, you and many other people are curious about that. We're not providing that update at this point in time. But as the rest of the transaction progresses and once we conclude it later in the year, I will provide an overall update as to the effect of the whole initiative.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, you said you got $1 billion in dividends in your free cash flow walk from your JVs. Just curious, is that from an LTM income level? Or what's the cadence? Because that's not an inconsequential number in your free cash flow.","Daniel Ammann","No, it's a chunk of the free cash flow. I mean, the basic approach is we -- the joint ventures pay out 100% approximately of their -- of the previous year's net income. That's sort of the -- that's the guiding principle.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So that's typically a second quarter item?","Daniel Ammann","Correct. And that was in the second quarter last year as well.","Operator","Mr. Arickx, I will now turn the call back to you. Please proceed with your presentations or closing remark.","Randy Arickx","Thank you very much, operator. Thank you, everyone, for your time today.

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Tuesday, October 24, 2017.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Dhivya Suryadevara, Vice President of Corporate Finance. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.","Thanks, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us as we review GM's financial results for the third quarter of 2017. Our press release was issued this morning, and the conference call materials are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast.","Included in the chart set materials published this morning, we had the key takeaways from each chart in the notes pages in order to provide color on the results. This morning, Mary Barra, GM's Chairman and CEO, will provide some brief opening remarks; followed by Chuck Stevens, GM's Executive VP and CFO. We will then open the line for questions from the analyst's community.","Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language. In the room today, we also have Tom Timko, Vice President, Global Business Services, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; and Rick Westenberg, Vice President and Treasurer to assist in answering your questions.","I will now turn the call over to Mary Barra.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Thanks, Dhivya, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining. The results we are reporting today on a continuing operations basis demonstrate our commitment to extending our strong core business performance while redefining the future of personal mobility. Taking a look at the numbers we posted, EBIT adjusted is $2.5 billion. Year-to-date, EBIT adjusted is $9.8 billion with a margin of 9%. And our EPS diluted adjusted is $1.32. We returned $2 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends and our return on invested capital adjusted is 27.6% on a trailing four quarter basis.","We delivered solid results even with planned lower third quarter production in North America. Although market is more challenging than expected, we will deliver another strong year. Chuck will share additional details in regional numbers in a few minutes.","Our work to strengthen the business and focus on areas with higher shareholder return continued with the closing of the sale of our Opel-Vauxhall business. We expect to close the sale of GM Financial's European operations by the end of the year. In addition to the international operations restructuring we previously announced, earlier this month we shared that we will combine all GM operations outside of China and North America under Barry Engle, effective 01\/01\/2018. This allows us to realize greater efficiencies and supports our disciplined plan to operate in the right markets to strengthen our performance and to focus on long-term growth opportunities.","From a product and brand standpoint, customers are responding favorably to our new vehicle launches. In the United States, retail sales of crossovers from our Chevrolet, GMC, Buick and Cadillac brands were up 25% year-over-year for our best crossover sales quarter in history. The second generation of the 2018 Buick Enclave is arriving at dealership. It builds on the success of its predecessor and ushers in Avenir, Buick's new upscale sub brand. We have high expectations for Avenir as it joins Denali GMC's premium sub-brand in our Buick GMC retail channel. Denali makes up more than a quarter of GMC's overall sales and generates higher margins and average transaction prices. Avenir and Denali will offer our customers attainable luxury from our premium brands.","Also arriving at U.S. dealerships is the 2018 Cadillac CT6 with Super Cruise, hands-free highway driving technology. Journalists and influencers recently traveled coast-to-coast to demonstrate its capability with overwhelmingly positive reviews. Super Cruise will also launch in China next year on the CT6.","Sales in China are tracking at a record pace, led by the growth at China \u2013 or excuse me at Cadillac and Baojun. To continue this momentum, we launched five new models in the quarter, including the Baojun E100 EV. This is a niche build-to-order electric vehicle from our JV partner SGMW. We plan to launch six additional models in Q4.","Last month in Shanghai, I helped celebrate our 20-year joint venture with SAIC GM and the production of our 15 millionth vehicle. It was an important milestones representing a productive partnership in our largest market. And in South America, we are now gaining market share and making money in an industry still significantly depressed from prior high levels.","Now, I'd like to talk about the future of personal mobility. We all know the industry is changing very quickly. By staying focused and disciplined, we have repositioned our core business to be more resilient through the cycle and we have made key investments that will help us create a safer, better and more sustainable world and a healthy business model well into the future. We believe our future mobility initiatives will be accretive to our core business because they give us an opportunity to increase our exposure to new customers in urban centers and coastal markets.","At the same time, our core operations will continue to generate strong profits in the markets that will be the last impacted by these new mobility trends. Regardless of where we do business, we are committed to an all-electric future, and we have announced plans for at least 20 new all-electric vehicles by 2023, including two in the next 18 months. We've already done a lot of the hard work, investment and innovation necessary to meet this commitment. Our extensive track record with electrification, including what we have learned from the Chevrolet Volt and the Chevrolet Volt EV along with strong supplier partnerships and mass market EV manufacturing experience give us confidence that this portfolio puts us on a path to a new profitable generation of electric vehicles. We will pursue both battery electric and hydrogen fuel cell technology because we will need both for solutions to meet all of our customers' transportation needs.","For example, we revealed a new autonomous capable hydrogen fuel cell platform called the Silent Utility Rover Universal Superstructure or as we refer to here SURUS. It was designed to provide commercial vehicle solutions including flexible cargo delivery and utility services. But its ability to solve tough transportation challenges created by natural disasters, complex logistic environments and global conflict also make it adaptable for military use.","I'm also pleased with the progress our team is making on self-driving vehicle technology. GM and Cruise Automation recently deployed our latest generation self-driving electric test vehicle. We believe it will meet the redundancy and safety requirements necessary to operate without a driver. It is our third generation of AD technology in just 14 months. The GM and Cruise teams have worked together to integrate the best hardware and software with an almost completely new and fault-tolerant systems that are unique to a driverless vehicle. In fact, the latest generation of self-driving electric test vehicle has about 40% unique content compared to previous generations.","Another reason we are moving so fast is because we are testing in one of the most challenging urban environments anywhere, San Francisco. In this environment, we encounter almost 50 times more interactions with pedestrians and other vehicles and complex road intersections compared to driving in a suburban environment. This testing is accelerating our deployment of self-driving technology, and we believe it will put us on the path to the fastest path toward deploying self-driving cars safely and at scale.","To move with even more speed, we also recently announced we will be opening a Cruise office in New York City to begin testing our self-driving cars there as well. And just two weeks ago, we acquired Strobe, gaining access to new LIDAR technology that will significantly improve the capability of self-driving cars and reduce the cost of each LIDAR on our self-driving cars by 99%.","Finally, in August, we launched Cruise Anywhere, a ride-sharing beta test platform for select Cruise Automation employees in San Francisco. Employees use a GM smartphone app to hail a ride in a self-driving electric test vehicle. Focusing on all aspects of the self-driving experience gives us more flexibility to develop the appropriate go-to market strategy.","Our vision is ambitious, and I believe GM is uniquely positioned to transform how we provide personal mobility for our customers. We have the right team with the right technical and business expertise to solve problems along with the passion to change the world. We will host an investor event later this year to share more details, so stay tuned.","And now I'd like to turn it over to Chuck.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Thanks, Mary. Our third quarter results from continuing operations demonstrate the resilience of our core business and continued disciplined execution of our plan. All of our operating segments were profitable this quarter for the first time since Q4 2014. This did not happen by chance. Our strategic initiatives, including the closing of the Opel-Vauxhall deal, in addition to our cost efficiency measures and product launch cadence are paying off. We remain solidly profitable and generated 8.3% margins in North America even with the planned downtime for our next-generation full-size trucks, and decisive actions to reduce production of passenger cars to right-size our inventory.","South America had its first profitable quarter in three years. China continues to generate consistent equity income and GM Financial had a record third quarter. We generated net revenue of $33.6 billion, EBIT adjusted of $2.5 billion and an EBIT adjusted margin of 7.5% in the third quarter, contributing to a strong first nine months of the year. We've generated year-to-date net revenue of $107.9 billion, EBIT adjusted of $9.8 billion and an EBIT adjusted margin of 9%.","During the quarter, we consumed $1 billion in cash as we expected with cash flow primarily impacted by our production downtime. As production levels normalize, we anticipate working capital to meaningfully contribute to fourth quarter adjusted automotive free cash flow. And importantly, we still plan to return approximately $7 billion in capital to shareholders this year.","Moving to the segment details. North America has delivered year-to-date revenue of $82.6 billion, EBIT adjusted of $9 billion and a 10.9% EBIT adjusted margin, consistent with 2016 margin levels on 6% lower revenue. For the third quarter, North America revenue was $24.8 billion. EBIT-adjusted was $2.1 billion with an 8.3% margin despite a $2.1 billion headwind from a largely planned 26% reduction in wholesale volume. The performance was driven by improved mix of about $600 million as we reduced production of cars which more than offset the mix headwind from truck retooling. Solid improvements in cost including warranty of about $300 million also contributed to the performance. The actions we've taken will allow us to end the year with dealer inventory down compared to the end of 2016.","And our focus on cost continues. During the third quarter, we have generated more than $5 billion in cost efficiency since 2014 and plan to achieve our more aggressive goal of $6.5 billion by the end of 2018, which more than offsets incremental investment in engineering, technology and D&A. Based on our disciplined cost initiatives and the strength of new crossovers, we continue to project strong 10-plus percent margins in North America for the full year 2017.","Moving on to China. China generated another $500 million of equity income in the third quarter for a total of $1.5 billion of equity income year-to-date, both flat year-over-year. Pricing remains challenging with deterioration of at least 5% calendar year-to-date. Our focus on cost efficiency and the strength of our recent launches and growth in Cadillac have allowed us to mitigate the pricing headwinds as evidenced by another quarter of strong equity income, and we are forecasting that 2017 will be another year of strong overall equity income.","Turning to South America. Year-to-date revenue was $6.8 billion, an increase of $1.8 billion or 36% year-over-year and the EBIT-adjusted loss was less than $100 million, a $200-million improvement from a year ago as the actions we've taken over the past several years are yielding benefits in a slightly improved macro climate. Our progress in South America paid off in the third quarter as the region generated $15 million of EBIT adjusted of $2.6 billion of revenue, our first profit in three years.","Another segment that had strong third quarter performance is GM Financial. GM Financial generated quarterly revenue of $3.2 billion, up 30% from $2.4 billion in the third quarter of 2016, resulting in third quarter record earnings before taxes of about $300 million, up more than 60% year-over-year. Year-to-date through the third quarter, GMF generated almost $900 million of earnings before taxes, up about $300 million or almost 50% versus the three quarters of 2016 driven by a 38% increase in revenue to about $9 billion. We do see some headwinds in the fourth quarter for GM Financial driven primarily by residual value and used car pricing.","One bit of housekeeping. Beginning in the three months ended December 31, 2017, we intend to change our segment reporting because of changes to our organizational structure. As a result, our South America and international operations will be reported as one combined international segment called GM International. Our North America and GM Financial segments will not be impacted.","To summarize, overall this was another solid quarter even with significantly lower volumes. Our solid margins illustrate the benefits of the strategic actions we've taken resulting in a simpler, most focused business with a leaner cost structure. With the disciplined production actions we are taking, we project to be well-positioned going into 2018 with lower dealer inventory levels than year-end 2016, and that inventory will be better balanced to meet customer demands.","As we think about our full year guidance, the operating environment is more challenging than we expected at the beginning of the year. We continue to take actions to adjust production in response to lower passenger car demand in North America. Raw material costs are on the rise, and we recently resolved the labor situation in Canada that resulted in unexpected down time.","Despite these headwinds, we project strong financial results for the year including revenue, EBIT adjusted and EBIT-adjusted margins generally in line with the record results we posted in 2016 and adjusted automotive free cash flow of approximately $6 billion. We also continue to forecast earnings per share in the middle of the range of $6 to $6.50, ROIC adjusted of greater than 25%, North American margins of 10-plus percent, China equity income of about $2 billion, and we continue to project to return about $7 billion to shareholders as previously committed.","This concludes our opening comments. We'll now move to the question-and-answer portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question is going to come from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Good morning.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Good morning.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Just on the results in North America, Chuck, hoping you could talk about how pickup trucks performed relative to other segments in terms of pickup truck variable profits, particularly as you prepare for the new launch in the next couple of years. How much of the resilience do you kind of attribute to the pickup truck segment relative to other segments in the company?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. Good question, Itay, and I've talked about this before on some of these results, quarterly results.","Number one, we've continued to hold our share and we view that as especially constructive given where we are in the lifecycle of that truck at about a 35% segment share. But more importantly, when you look at the actual data on kind of a same-store basis trim to trim, crew cab, extended cab, regular cab, on a variable profit basis, our margins are up calendar year-to-date in 2017 versus 2016. So, we've been able to continue to generate strong and improving variable margins as we move through the life cycle of this vehicle, and we would expect to see more of the same given the overall demand. We've taken actions over the last couple of years opportunistically from a price perspective. And clearly, that's paying off, and that's one of the big drivers of the overall 8.3% margins when you look at the significant production downtime we had in North America.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","That's helpful. And then just as we think about 2018 for North America, I think last quarter, Chuck, you alluded to kind of perhaps being able to maintain that zip code of 10% margins under accommodative macro conditions. Hoping you can update us on your kind of preliminary views for 2018 in North America.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","I would say at this point in time, no update that is consistent. That view has not changed, In the current macro environment, our expectations is that we've built a business model especially when you consider our product launch cadence and the cost actions that we've been taking that will generate 10% margins in North America, and that's certainly what we're focused on executing.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. And maybe if I could sneak in a quick product question. There's been a lot of talk, I think one of your competitors as well talked about looking to get more aggressive in the off-road category and some of the demand we're seeing for SUVs. And so just, as you kind of think about your product plans going forward, is there anything you can do as well to maybe attack those segments? And one thing maybe that comes to mind is the HUMMER that you used to have, and any opportunities for GM to penetrate some of these markets that some of your peers are talking about as well as you think about redesigning the new truck platform?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","I think when you see the new truck platform come out both full-size truck and SUVs, you're going to see us having a broader portfolio that really addresses specific customer needs including from an off-road capability.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. That's very helpful. Thanks so much, everyone.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, guys. Just one additional sort of follow-up on North America. I mean, Chuck, when you look at the 86.2% CapUt in North America versus the 8.3% EBIT margin and the wholesale drop of 26% in volume year-over-year, I mean it kind of looks like we went through sort of a shock test here on the downside in the cycle, yet you put up 8.3% margin. So, if you're old school and maybe I'm dating myself a little bit, if you thought about CapUt around 80%, you'd be breakeven and wholesale of decline of negative 26%, you'd be losing money. But you put up a big number here. I mean, is this the kind of thing that you think is repeatable or was there anything going in on the quarter that was an outsized benefit, it might not repeat in a shock like this again?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Well, I think clearly we've got a fundamentally restructured business model and we've been talking about that for the last number of years, maintaining a breakeven point at a SAAR level of 10 to 11 million units. And I think this is a proof point that that business model can withstand the kind of volume reduction that we've seen. Obviously, one of the big drivers of that is the significantly improved mix, not only full-size pickups and full-size SUVs but crossovers and the launch cadence associated with that. But I think interesting comparison would be to look at Q3 results of 2017 versus Q4 last year. In Q4 last year, 8.6% margins on wholesales and revenues that were significantly higher than Q3 this year. And again, that just demonstrates the resilience of the business model, the continued execution of our plan and fundamentally reinforces our breakeven point thesis that we've been talking about for the last number of years.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. That's very helpful. And then, Mary, I mean, as we think about sort of the execution of finally getting the European sale done here, I mean, could we hear about sort of a Cruise office opening in Paris, London and Berlin, and this mobility service business would be how you would attack or actually operate in Europe and it could be actually be a lot more profitable than what you've done historically? I mean, do you need a presence outside of \u2013 I mean, obviously you're getting away from manufacturing, but can you have a presence like that and actually operate there?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Oh, absolutely. We are going to be looking globally. We're working extremely hard on the technology to have self-driving vehicles and looking at it from a safety perspective, a performance perspective, but we're working hard to lead in that area, and then we're already evaluating what markets make the most sense to generate the most shareholder value.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And European markets are obviously on that list?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Absolutely.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just lastly, on all the funding for your future car efforts, are they contemplated in your existing R&D and CapEx budgets, or are there any significant step-ups we should be thinking about in 2018, 2019 and beyond?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Generally, when we look at the capital spend that we'd had in the engineering spend, we are able to do the work that we want to do from AD perspective, and by the way an EV perspective and a connectivity perspective. We're going to continue to evaluate that, but our current view is that that largely is all included, because we've been driving a lot of efficiencies, especially in the capital budget. When we look at being able to reuse architectures, reuse equipment, and then also the synergies and the work that's going on in product development. So, we will evaluate because we don't want to be constrained by being able to fund. We know speed is important to get the first mover advantage. But right now, I'd say generally it's within those bounds.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just one quick follow up to that. Is there any need to do any more vertical M&A or integration like you did with Strobe on different parts for the AD each or do you feel like you have a lot of those puzzle pieces already?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Yeah, I feel that we do have a lot of the puzzle pieces. We continue to look at it. This is a very dynamic and evolving marketplace. I think the real opportunity with Strobe is we saw an opportunity, also partnering with the work that we do at the Hughes Research Labs to look at that technology, how to really improve the capability of the technology which gives you the ability to open up the areas where you can do autonomous vehicle while taking the cost significantly out and really getting to an automotive-grade LIDAR capability.","So we'll continue to evaluate. I don't have anything to share right now. But again, this is fast moving and we're going to look at what makes the most sense to allow us to go with speed, with safety, and to deliver value.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. We're looking forward to seeing these things in New York. Thanks so much.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","We are too.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. I'll start with some questions on today's business then follow up on the economists. Within North America, can you kind of dimension the walk a different way? Specifically, what was the drag from the downtime in cars, the downtime in pickup trucks versus the uptick from the crossovers and just how can we kind of gauge the impact of the crossovers in that GMNA EBIT?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Boy, really good question, Brian, but I'm not sure that I'm ready to break down volume and mix by segment within, I would say, the following. Here's the way to think about it. Our volumes were down roughly 250,000 units. Half of that was launch related, roughly. Of that, 50,000 were full-size trucks and 60,000 were CUVs. And then the balance was passenger cars. The planned piece of that was roughly half, which was the full-size trucks and the crossovers. Aligning supply and demand on cars was the other portion of that, roughly 100,000 units or so.","And as you look at the number, obviously, the volume impact we talked about was $2.1 billion, but mix was favorable in the quarter, and that was largely reduction of passenger cars that drove that favorable mix. So hopefully, that helps dimension that a little bit. But as far as numerics associated with each of those moving pieces, not ready to share at that level of detail.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And pricing less materials for crossovers, I assume that's positive. Is that, I mean, put other ways, majors mostly the crossover launches?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. Majors were the crossovers and carryover was largely passenger car driven, right, as that segment continues to be very, very competitive and as people shift away.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","And I would expect fourth quarter pricing to be favorable versus third quarter largely on the back of the crossover launches.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And how about the planned downtime for trucks? Are you through the CUV downtime and is IHS roughly accurate for the truck downtime or anything you could say around that?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","What's the IHS number for next year? I mean, are you talking about 2018 or 2017?","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Well, 4Q 2017 and then into 2018.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. I would look at it like this. We expect Q4 production factory unit sales to be up versus Q3, roughly 150,000 units. We don't have any downtime on full-size trucks or SUVs. Actually, we expect versus Q3 to be up, production to be up on those segments. We will continue to make adjustments as appropriate on passenger cars. And when we look into next year, clearly, and we'll have more to say about this in January, but clearly there is incremental downtime in 2018 related to the truck launch.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And you'll probably talk this more about the Investor Day. But sort of a lot of talk in the press, analysts, around not just building autonomous cars but putting those into revenue producing shared autonomous ride-share service. Can you provide us any update on your preliminary thinking of that, kind of how the test with Cruise with their own employees are in terms of using, admittedly, human backup drivers and the timetable to taking the driver out?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","So, I don't have anything new to say. What we've talked about is it will be, first of all, will be gated by safety, so being able to take the driver out will \u2013 we have our metrics we defined to look at that and when we'll be ready to do that, but we think that's in quarters, not years.","And as it relates to how we deploy, we very much believe we want to maintain the relationship with the customer. And so, we're exploring many options and we could partner with someone, partner with many or work on our own the Cruise application that is being used with our employees at Cruise is going quite well, in fact we have some of those people participating in their pilot that are using it for all of their transportation needs. So, it continues to \u2013 we continue to develop that, and we're keeping our options open.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Just following on that last question for the global mobility business. Can you envision a scenario where some of these partners invest in your mobility business? And is that something that maybe needed for certain markets such as China?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Certainly, that could be possible. We're keeping all options open. It's kind of in this point where the technology is evolving and the opportunity is evolving. We're having a lot of conversations, kind of everyone is talking to everyone. And we're going to continue to look at what provides us the greatest value for our shareholders over the long term because we think this is a very significant business that is accretive. And we're going to look to get \u2013 it gets gated by the technology and that's why our focus is on technology.","The fact that we have everything under one roof and we can move so quickly. I mentioned that we have our third generation of vehicle \u2013 AD vehicle, test vehicle on the round, we're in parallel already working on our fourth. So, that speed with technology that is evolving so quickly, both from a hardware and a software perspective, is our primary focus. But then we're going to look to how do we launch and put a business model together that's most advantageous for our shareholders.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Interesting. And then just talking about the auto business, you mentioned that you're targeting 70 days of inventory at the end of the year in the U.S., and I think that that's lower than you had previously targeted. Is that an adjustment to your production expectations, maybe for the fourth quarter? And if it is lower production, is that the primary factor driving the decline in the free cash flow target for the year?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","I would say a couple of things, Rod. First, let's start with the nominal number because the day supply will be largely dependent on the sales rate in December.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Right.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","So, our target is to be in the 70-day range. I think the more important number is the overall nominal number. And our view right now is we're going to be significantly lower at the end of 2017 versus the end of 2016. Just to dimension that, we had 850,000 units in dealer inventory at the end of 2016. We think that we'll be in the zip code of somewhere around 800,000.","Importantly, within that, it will be better balanced. We expect to have roughly 80-day supply of trucks and SUVs which is normal for us, an appropriate level of crossovers, 60, 70 days of crossovers and somewhere in the zip code of 50 days of passenger cars as we work through that. I think that that is a good launch point as you think about 2018 to end the year with that kind of inventory level and that day supply.","Built into our free cash flow forecast, obviously, there's continued rightsizing and aligning production. But there's also the impact that we have from the strike. At the end of the day, we lost 20,000 units in the strike that we had in Canada, which won't be made up and that has an impact on working capital and the timing. So, I think the adjustment of guidance from $7 billion to $6 billion is more about production timing, including the strike impact than overall earnings generation, obviously, since we've maintained our guidance.","And I think, importantly, within that, though, is we still expect to distribute about $7 billion to shareholders and end the year in a strong cash and liquidity position. So, very, very consistent overall when you look at those parameters.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you. And could you clarify \u2013 you were asked about this earlier \u2013 what's the magnitude of the production downtime year-over-year that you're expecting for trucks in 2018? And as we look out to 2019, I think it seems like you should be benefiting from the truck launch, as well as the GEM's platform launch. Any just preliminary thoughts on how we should be thinking about the longer term?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. I would look at this broadly speaking because it's early days and we always are evaluating the best ways to optimize the downtime and everything else. But I would say, overall, there'll be less downtime in 2018 versus 2017 overall, significantly less, but trucks will be more. And whether that's four weeks or five weeks or six weeks, we will look towards optimizing that. So, it's hard for me to sit there and say it's going to be X thousands of units at this point in time because, clearly, we want to be able to minimize the impact.","Once we get through the launch of the first \u2013 remember, the T1 launch will go for a couple of years as we work our way through that very broad portfolio, but I think the biggest portion of that will be next year, and we'll get that full benefit in 2019. We'll also be well on our way of the GEM launch, which will favorably impact South America and China.","I don't want to provide guidance on 2019 yet, Rod. It's a little bit early. But, certainly, when you look at launch cadence, the benefit of the full-size truck launch, continued cost execution, again, in this broad macro environment, I see no reason why you shouldn't continue to see us progress towards our 10% margin objective in the core business.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Thanks, Rod.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe firstly on South America, I see that you're making money there at lower volumes than in past periods when you lost money. Just a couple of questions there. Firstly, does the cost reduction there put you on any better footing structurally such that you could earn higher profits when the volume normalizes? And then secondly, are the operations there now anymore flexible so that the next time there is another sharp downturn that you could maybe avoid the same degree of losses that you experienced in this last down cycle?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Well, I think yes and yes is the answer to that, Ryan. Thanks for the question. I mean, fundamentally, we've reduced our breakeven point in South America by 40% versus the prior peak not only in South America but importantly in Brazil. And you're seeing that play out in the results that we've started to put on the board the last two quarters where there was a minor recovery at least directionally, a minor recovery in the market and we're highly leveraged to that upside.","So, we're constructive about the market in South America, the continued improvement in the market in South America, and layer on top of that, the global emerging market portfolio when you talked about flexibility. 90% of our volume will come from that architecture by 2020 in South America, which means huge scale benefit across multiple product entries produced largely in our low-cost facility in Gravata\u00ed and we've shifted more of our production there out of S\u00e3o Paulo which is higher cost within the country to Gravata\u00ed. So, fundamentally, across the board the team in South America has done an exceptional job running kind of the same playbook we ran in North America back in seven or eight years ago on rightsizing the business, driving more flexibility from a cost structure perspective.","And if you look at some of the advances and benefits they've got from the labor negotiations well out in front of the competition, building more flexibility around that, the ability to take people out and do it without a lot of, I would say, speed bumps along the way with our labor partners there makes it a much more dynamic and resilient business model.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then, just lastly from me on the improvement also in the consolidated international operations. Firstly, did 3Q benefit already from some of the actions that you announced on the call last quarter such as the sale of some of the African operations or wind-down of domestic sales in India or are those savings yet to come?","Secondly, I think you just ended assembly in Australia, how to think about the sequential improvement in 4Q and 1Q? And then, thirdly, there has been some discussion in the Korean press about possible changes to your operations there. What are the options on the table relative to Korea and how much of a profit improvement might you be able to drive for the investors there?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Wait. Those were a lot of questions in one sentence, Ryan. Let me see if I can remember them all. In the GM consolidated operations, the restructurings that we took which were India domestic business, exiting South Africa and fundamentally winding down the headquarters, we said that that was going to be a run-rate benefit of about $100 million a year on a go-forward basis. There was obviously a portion of it that impacted Q3, but not materially. I think most of that you're going to see in 2018 as we wind down and exit those operations.","Australia manufacturing, we've been on kind of that path of starting to reduce production, but if you just think about a typical facility, I would think that on a year-over-year basis that's a $115 million a year benefit, given the level of production. We're only producing the Commodore in Australia. So, I would expect to see that wind through, all else equal, in 2018. Obviously, our objective with all the actions we've taken in those markets is to drive that business to profitability. And slow going thus far, but we're starting to get some traction, and you saw it in the third quarter, and we've got more to go.","Relative to Korea, that is a challenging market for us. We have a strong presence there. We have a strong brand there, a healthy market share, but the cost structure there not only for us, but the overall industry in Korea, has grown to where it's not sustainable. And we're going to have to take action there on a go-forward basis to address that, to build a viable sustainable business. And I would say more to come on that. Clearly, there's challenges there with our labor partners, a very, very dynamic and challenging environment to get things done, but we've got a strategy that we're starting to execute, and like I said, I think more to come on that as it progresses. It's just too early to talk about it right now.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for all that color.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, everybody. I just have one question and one follow-up. The first is on the GM International kind of creation. Understand the logic of using this opportunity to kind of change the transparency in the reporting structure, but does this signal a deeper strategic shift to kind of think of all of GM's non-U.S. businesses together, not just for reporting purposes, but in terms of, let's say, architecture and strategy?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes. Absolutely. First was the combination from a reporting responsibility perspective under Barry Engle. And he is now responsible or will be responsible for South America and GM International markets. Obviously, the reporting is a manifestation, the external reporting is a manifestation of that structure once it's in place January 1. But fundamentally, the strategy is to take advantage of our GEM architecture and our presence in these markets to optimize across all of these businesses. So, there's clearly a strategic aspect of this, as well as an external reporting to align with the strategy.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","All right. Thanks, Chuck.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Adam,","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes, Mary?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","I was just going to add that when you look at going back to what Chuck said about South America, Barry Engle and his team have done a great job of setting that business up in a even more cyclical business. And so, looking at that and taking that leadership team and looking at all of those business together is definitely going to be a benefit, and Barry is the right guy to do it.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you, Mary. And, Mary, just a follow-up for you. OEMs everywhere seem to be kind of creating these new legal entities where they house kind of their future auto, new tech or new business models. I think you alluded to one of the benefits in your comments earlier, Mary, about being able to move very quickly in the speed of tech. But if I just back up for a moment, how would you describe the pros and the cons to potentially creating a separately seated legal entity, whether it's publicly traded or not, but just that kind of separation of an auto 2.0 business? Kind of what are the pros and cons in addition to the speed of tech under one roof that you could add? Thanks.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Sure. I think we've already been transparent in what we're reporting from in the Corp segment and been clear about the amount of money that we're spending on autonomous. But I think when we look it, our focus, Adam, right now is to move as quick as possible to develop the technology, have a first mover advantage and be able to not only have the safest technology, but be able to deploy it at scale. That's where our focus is right now. And there's the integration and not when you \u2013 depending on how you would separate it of where is IP, where is IP formed, right now, that's why our focus is keeping it all together. And I really do think it's enabling us to move quickly.","The amount of work that goes on between Warren, Israel, Canada and San Francisco on a daily basis is stunning. And the fact that we're working on our fourth generation, that's where our focus is right now. And I think we'll have time to look at it as that develops and as the business model develops, what is the best reporting and structure from a company perspective to drive the best shareholder value.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, Mary. I appreciate it.","Operator","And our final question for the day will come from the line of David Tamberrino, Goldman Sachs.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for taking our questions back here. First one, just you just recently released the Super Cruise business or product on your Cadillacs, and it was delayed, I don't know, one and a half, maybe two years. What's the difference from that technology that did see about a year or two delay to your bullish tone that you've been putting out on your AD solution where you think you're going to be coming obviously faster to market than anyone else?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","So, Super Cruise, which you're correct that we did delay because we were gated by safety. There's a lot of learning that went into that system. And it's the base that the core organization has that is now the Cruise Automation team is benefiting from of safety, of redundancy, of looking at the \u2013 one of the technologies was critically important. Super Cruise is the way we monitor the driver to make sure that they're paying attention.","And so, all those learnings go into Cruise. And then \u2013 but as I look at that and I look at where the schedule we put ourselves on Cruise and how the technology is developing, I continue to be very forward-leaning on that with the work that I see happening there, and all the learnings we had from Super Cruise are transferring into Cruise Automation.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And then, two last ones. Chuck, I think you mentioned this in the comments but, for residuals, did you say that you're expecting headwinds in the fourth quarter for GMF from residual values in used car pricing? Can you elaborate on that?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Sure. We've been talking about, through the year, that we expected used car pricing to be a headwind in the year, and it fundamentally would manifest itself in the second half of the year. We didn't see it as much in the third quarter. We had talked about 7% year-over-year.","I think with the recovery that we had seen already starting a lower year-over-year decline in the latter part of the second quarter and the third quarter somewhat impacted by hurricane issues that we see less than 7% at this point in time for the year, but still a headwind. And when you think about the timing of the depreciation and everything else, most of that is going to impact Q4 from that perspective. And that 's consistent with what we've been talking about all year long.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's fair. In the quarter, did you see a benefit to your residual values as a result of the hurricane? And, again, as of September, I mean, how much of that increased selling rate in September really helped to lower your inventories for the quarter?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","First, on the first question, I think the improvement that we saw in used car values in the third quarter, if anything, just delayed the mark-to-market that we're going to see in the fourth quarter as we continue to see used car pricings moderate. So, I wouldn't say there was a headwind. There was an absence of a \u2013 I wouldn't say there was a tailwind, there was an absence of a headwind in the third quarter when you think about GMF results.","And on your second question, relative to inventory, the biggest driver of the inventory reduction was the production adjustments. Obviously, as we think about our plan for the year and everything else, we've built in a sales forecast that goes into that. Certainly, a 18.5 million light SAAR in September helped with that on the margin, probably 15,000, 20,000 units in the month of September overall, but not a big driver of that 160,000 unit inventory reduction.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And then my final question on corporate expenses. It was a lot lower than what we were forecasting. I think the slide deck mentioned a couple of favorable non-recurring gains. Could you just elaborate on what those were for the quarter? And we should be going back up $400 million or not?","Unknown Speaker","Yeah. We will be going back up to the $400 million to $500 million range. I think importantly, within the numbers that we reported in Q3, we spent something north of $160 million on AV. And we'll continue to spend at that pace, that $600 million to $700 million pace that we've been talking about. In Q3, we had the benefit of some non-recurring gains related to the PSA transaction. Primarily, the mark-to-market on the PSA warrants that were part of the transaction and the movement in Peugeot stock price. And that was the biggest driver of that.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Understood. Thank you.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. I'll now turn the conference over to Mary Barra for her closing comments.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Well, thanks, everybody. I appreciate you participating today. I hope that you see we're demonstrating that we are a very disciplined organization, that we're going to take the bold actions and make the tough decisions to drive a profitable business and a very resilient core business. Also, we are committed moving with speed and we're going to continue to invest in EV, AD because we see huge opportunity in the future of personal mobility. We are intent on leading the transformation of this industry, and we have created a vision of zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion that we believe is the future for this industry. We are in a leadership position and we think it is the best way to generate long-term shareholder value and you will hear more as we move forward. So, thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

Welcome to the General Motors Company Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, February 4, 2015. I would now like to turn the conference over to Randy Arickx, Executive Director of Communications and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Randy Arickx","Thanks, Operator. Good morning. And thank you for joining us as we review the GM financial results for the 2014 fourth quarter and calendar year. Our press release was issued this morning and the conference call materials are available on the Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via the Internet.","Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the legend regarding forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language.","This morning, Mary Barra, General Motors\u2019 Chief Executive Officer will provide opening remarks followed by a review of the financial results with Chuck Stevens, Executive Vice President and CFO. After the presentation portion of the call, we\u2019ll open the line for questions from the analyst community. Marry Barra will then conclude the call with some closing remarks.","In the room today, we also have Tom Timko, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; and Niharika Ramdev, Vice President, Finance and Treasurer, to assist and answering your questions.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mary Barra.","Mary Barra","Thanks, Randy, and thanks to everyone joining the call today. Over the last couple of months, we have several opportunities to talk to you in detail about our strategy to create shareholder value, including our operating strategy, the investments we are making in our brand, technology and innovation, as well as our financial targets.","At our Global Business Conference in October, we affirmed our mid-decade targets and outlined strategies to deliver 9% to 10% EBIT adjusted margins by early next decade. At the Deutsche Bank Auto Conference last month, we affirmed that we were on track to deliver strong operating results in 2014 and we shared our outlook for 2015. This outlook includes year-over-year improvement in all of our automotive regions with higher EBIT adjusted and stronger margins.","Today, we are reporting fourth quarter and full year 2014 results that demonstrate continued strong core operating performance. This is especially true in North America and China where we are busy -- where our business is highly profitable and growing. It\u2019s also true in other regions around the world where we are managing through very difficult market conditions and building a solid foundation for profitable growth.","As we execute our plans, we are focused on generating the level of earnings, margin and cash flow that will make us the most valued automaker for our owners. Our strategy is also designed to support a strong and growing dividend and consistent with our strong core operating performance, we intend to increase our second quarter common stock dividend by 20% to $0.36 per share. The decision on the expected dividend increase will be made by our Board as part of the regularly scheduled second quarter dividend declaration procedure.","Turning to slide two, let\u2019s take a closer look at our fourth quarter results, which were robust. We have now been profitable for 20 consecutive quarters and this was our best ever fourth quarter consolidated EBIT adjusted during that period.","As you can see on the chart, almost all of our key operating metrics were up, including global deliveries and net income to the common shareholders. Importantly, EBIT adjusted was up in three of our automotive regions, the fourth was flat and our automotive net cash from operating activities and adjusted automotive free cash flow was also very strong.","In North America, we had record average transaction prices driven by Cadillac and our new Chevrolet and GMC truck and SUV, and we delivered our sixth consecutive quarter of improved EBIT adjusted margins based on core operating performance.","In China, we had another solid quarter, contributing to record full year equity income as our sales continued to outpace the market. In South America the team has now delivered three consecutive quarters of improved EBIT adjusted results. And in Europe, Opel\u2019s core operating results improved, excluding the recent economic decline in Russia. The quarter kept a full year of solid core operating performance.","If you turn to slide three, we can review our 2014 results. To start, we delivered our second consecutive year of record global sales, deliveries rose 2% to 9.9 million light vehicle.","We had record sales in, excuse me, and market share in China and higher sales and stable share in North America, a clear highlight we sold close to a 1 million full-size pickups full-size SUVs and large luxury SUVs in the United States, and increased our share in all three segments.","In fact, our share of the large SUV segment now stands at more than 75%. I expect we can do even better this year from a volume standpoint and we have another opportunity to gain full-size pickup market share.","Our global share was down one-tenth of a point, which primarily reflects our decision to withdraw Chevrolet as a mainstream brand in Western and Central Europe, and our use of pricing to offset currency volatility in regions such as South America and Russia.","Net revenue increased by about $5 million to $155.9 billion, thanks to growth at GM Financial. Looking at the bottomline, net income to common shareholders was $2.8 billion, absent special items, net income to common shareholders would have been $5.2 billion. Our Automotive business meanwhile generated $10.1 billion in net cash from operating activities.","Turning to EBIT adjusted, we earned $6.5 billion, which includes $2.8 billion in recall-related expenses. Finally, our adjusted automotive free cash flow was $3.1 billion. Chuck Stevens will provide more details on the fourth quarter and 2014 calendar year financial results a bit later.","If you turn to the next slide, you will see that our calendar year highlights are organized around strategic priorities, so it will be easy to see how we are driving the business forward.","Let start with our relationship with customers, specifically our commitment to safety and quality. The recalls we experienced in 2014 were galvanizing and our response has been far-reaching as you well know.","I won\u2019t review everything we have done on this call. Instead, I will simply underscore that we have built what I believe is the best safety organization in the industry and we\u2019re instilling a zero defect mindset across the company.","Our work begins from a solid base, last year, for example, J.D. Power ranked -- J.D. Power ranked GM number two in initial quality, number three in durability and three of our brands, Chevrolet, GMC and Buick took three of the top four spots in customer satisfaction with Dealer Service Index. In addition, Cadillac was recognized as a 2014 Customer Champions by J.D. Power, the third time the brand has earned this distinction.","Let\u2019s continue the discussion of our brand starting with Chevrolet, our largest global brand. Chevrolet had a very good 2014 in North America, with sales up about 5%. The new Silverado, Tahoe and Suburban all had great momentum, and the new Colorado which won Motor Trend Truck of the Year is off to a great start. Chevrolet had record sales in China and the brand retained market leadership in South America, despite weak industry conditions that hurt sales.","Buick also had a fantastic year with record sales of almost 1.2 million vehicles in its core markets of China, United States, Canada and Mexico. Robust demand in China also lifted Wuling and Baojun which had record sales. GM also increased it sales for the fifth consecutive year and the new Canyon was named Autoweek Magazine Best of the Best\/Truck for 2015.","Turning to Cadillac, the brands global sales increased 5% on the strength of a 47% increase in China. That brings the brand\u2019s cumulative volume growth since 2012 to 35%. But we understand we have a lot of work ahead of us with Cadillac.","As Johan de Nysschen shared at the Detroit Auto Show, we are investing in the portfolio by developing eight new Cadillac models by the end of the decade, many of which are going to enter segments where we don\u2019t compete today.","Turning to Europe, Karl-Thomas Neumann and the Opel\/Vauxhall team continued to make good progress. Opel\/Vauxhall delivered almost 1.1 million vehicles in Europe in 2014, sales and share increased for a second year in a row and orders for the new Corsa are ahead of plan at more than 110,000 units.","Turning to GM Financial, it\u2019s important to note that they\u2019re going to play an increasingly important role in helping all of our brands grow as they transform into a full spectrum captive finance company.","For example, GM Financial is now writing half of all GM lease transactions in the United States and that figure will rise when it becomes the exclusive lease provider for Buick and GMC this month, followed by Cadillac later in the quarter.","GM Financial is also financing roughly 40% of GM\u2019s retail sales in Europe and South America, and in early January it completed the acquisition of Ally\u2019s joint venture in China.","Leading in technology and innovation, especially in the areas of connectivity and autonomous are key are we move forward. It is a critical component of our customer-centered brand building strategy and an area we are -- where we are moving much faster than our competitors in many respect.","For example, last year we began the rollout of OnStar with 4G LTE in North America on more than 30 models. Later this year, 4G LTE will be introduced in China where we have more than 800,000 subscribers. We will also launch OnStar with 4G LTE in Europe. We intend to leverage 4G LTE and its fast speed to introduce a wide range of features and apps to improve all aspect of the driving and ownership experience.","In January at the Consumer Electronics Show we previewed technology that can predict and notify drivers when certain components need attention, in many cases before vehicle performance is impacted. It will be available later this year on a wide range of 2016 models in the U.S. and Canada including the Chevrolet Equinox, Tahoe, Suburban, Corvette and Silverado.","As we move through the year, we will also be sharing more details about industry-leading GM technology including vehicle-to-vehicle connectivity and Super Cruise, which is an advanced automated driving feature that Cadillac expects to introduce during the 2017 model year.","The last point, I\u2019d like to make before turning the presentation over to Chuck is this, we will continue to aggressively pursue core operating efficiency. We made good progress in 2014 with more than $1 billion in non-raw material and logistic cost savings flowing through the bottomline.","We\u2019ve also improved capacity utilization in Europe and our focus on the Opel Vauxhall brands in Western and Central Europe have dramatically improved our business in the region. Also our new operational excellence team using Six Sigma and other statistical and analytical tools as part of an overarching strategy to drive a customer-centric culture of continuous improvement, innovation and quality is well underway.","Gerald Johnson is leading this initiative and we\u2019re moving very quickly. We have been recruiting talent from outside and inside GM, executive champions have been [Technical Difficulty] and we\u2019ve already identified projects that we expect to deliver significant savings this year with customer loyalty and operating margin building over time. This is a good start but we know there is more work to do but we are on it.\u2019","With that said, let me hand off to Chuck Stevens, who will provide a more detailed look at the quarter and the year.","Chuck Stevens","Thanks Mary. On slide six, we provide a summary of our 2014 fourth quarter and calendar year GAAP and non-GAAP results. Starting with Q4 first, our net revenue was $39.6 billion, $900 million or 2% decrease from the prior year. Automotive revenue was down nearly $1.1 billion primarily due to lower wholesales of 73,000 units or an unfavorable $1.4 billion, unfavorable foreign exchange of $1.7 billion partially offset by an increase in price of $1.6 billion. GM financial revenue increased $200 million.","Our fourth quarter 2014 GAAP operating income included net $250 million of unfavorable special items as detailed on chart seven. The prior year GAAP operating income performance included significant unfavorable special items of $1.4 billion in the quarter primarily related to the exit of the Chevrolet brand from Europe and impairment charges.","Net income to common shareholders was $1.1 billion, up $200 million compared to the prior year period. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.66 on a diluted basis compared to $0.57 for the same period in the prior year and our automotive net cash from operating activities improved significantly to $3.8 billion.","Our EBIT-adjusted was $2.4 billion for the fourth quarter, a $500 million improvement from the prior year. The EBIT-adjusted margin was 6.1%, up 1.4 percentage points from the fourth quarter in 2013. Our adjusted automotive free cash flow was $1.8 billion, including $600 million in recall-related cash payments. This compares to adjusted automotive free cash flow of $1.1 billion in the prior year period.","For the full calendar year, net revenue was $156 billion, up $500 million from the prior year. Automotive revenue decreased $1 billion primarily due to lower wholesales of 380,000 units, which was worth an unfavorable $5.6 billion, unfavorable foreign exchange of $3.3 billion, partially offset by favorable pricing of $5.1 billion and favorable mix of $2.3 billion. GM financial revenue increased $1.5 billion.","Our GAAP operating income was $1.5 billion, including $2.8 billion in recall-related charges as well as $2.3 billion in special items. In the prior year period, GAAP operating income was $5.1 billion. Net income to common shareholders was $2.8 billion and diluted earnings per share came in at $1.65, again the decrease was primarily attributable to recall-related costs, increased charges for special items and lower income tax expense.","Our automotive net cash from operating activities was $10.1 billion, including $1.6 billion in recall-related cash payments. This compares to automotive net cash from operating activities of $11 billion in 2013. For our non-GAAP measures, EBIT-adjusted was $6.5 billion in 2014 including $2.8 billion of recall related costs, as well as $1 billion in restructuring expenses. EBIT-adjusted margin was 4.2%, including the negative impact of 1.8 percentage points associated with recall-related costs. Finally, our adjusted automotive free cash flow was $3.1 billion for the year, including $1.6 billion recall-related payments, resulting in a net $600 million decrease from 2013.","Slide seven identifies special items for the fourth quarter and calendar year that had an impact on our earnings per share. I\u2019m not going to go through the entire list but the items in 2014 primarily relate to the redemption of our Series A preferred stock, a recall-reserve catch-up adjustment, the recall compensation program and a number of impairment charges.","In 2013, special items, primarily related to strategic actions we announced in GM international operations, the wage litigation in Korea, as well as sale of certain non-core assets. At the top of slide, our net income to common stockholders in the fourth quarter of 2014 was $1.1 billion and our fully diluted earnings per share was $0.66.","Special items had a net $900 million unfavorable impact to net income to common shareholders and $0.53 unfavorable impact on earnings per share. For the 2014 calendar year, our net income to common shareholders was $2.8 billion and our fully diluted earnings per share were $1.65. Special items had an unfavorable impact on net income to common shareholders of $2.4 billion and a $1.40 unfavorable impact on our earnings per share.","Slide eight shows our consolidated EBIT-adjusted for the last five quarters. At the bottom of the slide, we again show the revenue and margins for the quarter, clearly demonstrating the solid underlying performance that the company achieved in 2014 when adjusting for recall-related expenses. Our consolidated wholesale vehicle sales were 1.6 million vehicles in the fourth quarter, down slightly compared to the prior year and our global market share was 11.4%.","On slide nine, we provide an explanation of the $500 million increase in year-over-year consolidated EBIT-adjusted for the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2013, our EBIT-adjusted was $1.9 billion. Volume was $300 million unfavorable as global wholesale volume decreased 73,000 units, primarily attributable to lower wholesales in international operations and the wind down of Chevrolet Europe.","Mix was $300 million favorable primarily due to increased wholesales of full-size trucks and full-size SUVs. Price was $1.4 billion favorable for the quarter, primarily due to the strength of our recently launched vehicles in North America and actions we\u2019ve taken to offset foreign exchange in South America.","Total costs were $600 million unfavorable, primarily attributable to higher material costs in North America related to our recently launched full size trucks and full size SUVs. Other was $300 million unfavorable primarily due to foreign exchange challenges in South America with, Venezuelan Bolivar, Argentine Peso and Brazilian Real as well as pressure on the Russia Ruble in Europe. This totals $2.4 billion for the fourth quarter.","On slide 10, we provide EBIT-adjusted by region for the four quarters of 2013 and 2014. North America\u2019s EBIT-adjusted was $2.2 billion. Europe had an EBIT-adjusted loss of $400 million. International operations had EBIT-adjusted of $400 million and South America\u2019s EBIT-adjusted was a positive $100 million for the quarter.","GM financial earnings before taxes adjusted was $100 million, down from a year ago associated with debt-related expenses. The corporate and elimination segment was breakeven for the quarter. This totals to an EBIT-adjusted of $2.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2014, up $500 million from the same period in 2013.","We now move on to our segment results. On slide 11, we show North American EBIT-adjusted for the last five quarters. At the bottom of the slide, revenue was $25.3 billion in the fourth quarter, up $200 million from the same quarter in 2013. The EBIT-adjusted margin was 8.7% for the fourth quarter and 9.1% for the second half of 2014, an improvement of about 70 basis points compared to the second half of 2013.","For the full year, EBIT-adjusted margin was 8.9% excluding the impact of recalls. Six consecutive quarters of year-over-year margin growth excluding recalls demonstrate strong progress toward our 2016 goal of 10% margins. Our U.S. dealer inventory was 737,000 at the end of the fourth quarter, a decrease of about 11,000 units from the prior year period. Also, vehicle sales were 849,000 units for the quarter, a 14,000 unit vehicle decrease from the prior year.","Turning to slide 12 for key performance indicators for North America. For the fourth quarter of 2014, our total U.S. market share was 17.4% and our retail share was 16.3%. Retail share increased 0.4 percentage points from the prior year, led by our all new midsized trucks, full-size truck and full-size SUVs. In fact full-size truck retail share increased nearly 5 percentage points from a year ago to approximately 41% in the fourth quarter. Our incentives for the quarter were 11.2% of average transaction price, which put us at 110% of the industry average.","Turning to slide 13, we provide the explanation of the increase in North America EBIT-adjusted of about $300 million. EBIT-adjusted was $1.9 billion for the fourth quarter of 2013. Volume was $100 million unfavorable associated with the 14,000 unit vehicle decrease in wholesales.","Mix was $300 million favorable, primarily due to increased wholesales of full-size truck and full-size SUVs. Price was $400 million favorable as the $800 million in favorable pricing from our recently launched vehicles was partially offset by $400 million in unfavorable pricing from our carryover products.","Costs were $400 million unfavorable, primarily due to increased material costs associated with recently launched vehicles, partially offset by carryover material and logistics performance. Other was flat. These nets to an EBIT adjusted of $2.2 billion.","On slide 14, Europe reported an EBIT adjusted loss of $400 million for the fourth quarter, flat from the prior year. However, after excluding restructuring and the impact of the Russian market, the European business demonstrated improved core operating performance on a year-over-year basis.","Revenue was $5.4 billion for the quarter, down $300 million from the prior year period. The EBIT adjusted margin in the region was a negative 7.3%. Wholesale vehicle sales for the quarter improved 6,000 units.","Market share in the fourth quarter was 6.3%, a nine-tenth of a percentage point decline from 2013, as the increase in Opel, Vauxhall market share for the second consecutive year was more than offset by the negative impact of the Chevrolet brand wind down.","On slide 15, we provide the major components of Europe\u2019s EBIT adjusted performance versus a year ago. Volume was flat as increased wholesales in Western Europe and the rest of the region was essentially offset by the roughly 40% decline in Russian wholesales.","Mix was flat. Price was $100 million favorable, driven primarily by pricing offset exchange headwinds in Russia and the introduction of the next-generation Corsa and Vivaro. Cost was flat as increased material costs associated with recently launched vehicles were offset by material and logistics performance on carryover vehicles.","Other was $200 million unfavorable, primarily due to foreign exchange related to the Russian ruble. This totals the Europe\u2019s EBIT adjusted loss of $400 million for the fourth quarter of 2014.","On slide 16, we show international operations\u2019 EBIT adjusted for the most recent periods. In the fourth quarter, EBIT adjusted was $400 million, including equity income from our joint ventures of $500 million, partially offset by a loss of a $100 million in consolidated operations.","At the bottom of the slide, revenue from consolidated operations was $3.8 billion, down $600 million from the prior year. The EBIT adjusted margin from consolidated operations was a negative 2.7%, a decline of nine-tenths of a percentage point from the prior year.","Our average net income margin from our China JVs remained strong at 8.7%, a 1.1 percentage point increase from the prior year. For the full calendar year, net income margin was 9.8%, up three-tenths of a percent from the prior year.","Wholesale vehicle sales totaled 177,000 units for consolidated operations and 981,000 units for the China JVs. Market share in the region increased from the prior year, including record market share in China of 14.8% for the 2014 calendar year.","Turning to slide 17, we provide the major components of international operations\u2019 $200 million increase in EBIT adjusted. The impact of volume was $200 million unfavorable as wholesales decreased 54,000 units. Mix was flat compared to the prior year period. Price was $300 million favorable, primarily due to the recently launched full-size trucks and full-size SUVs in the Middle East.","Cost was $100 million unfavorable associated with material on recently launched products. Other was $100 million favorable, primarily related to an increase in equity income from our China JVs. This totals the fourth quarter 2014 EBIT adjusted of $400 million.","On slide 18, we move onto the South America region and look at EBIT adjusted for the last five quarters. At the bottom of the slide, revenue was $3.7 billion in the fourth quarter, a $400 million decrease from 2013. The EBIT adjusted margin in the region was 2.4%, an increase of 1.7 percentage points from the prior year period. Wholesale vehicle sales were 249,000 units, down 11,000 units, compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 and market share decreased 1 percentage point from the prior year period.","On slide 19, we look at the components of the $100 million year-over-year increase in our South American EBIT adjusted. Volume and mix were flat compared to the prior year. Price was $600 million favorable due to actions we\u2019ve taken to offset unfavorable foreign exchange and the sustained strength of pricing on our new products.","Cost was $100 million unfavorable, primarily due to higher material costs on carryover products. Other was $400 million unfavorable due to the Venezuelan Bolivar, Argentine Peso and Brazilian Real currencies. It\u2019s important to note that team in South America delivered three consecutive quarters of improved EBIT adjusted results even as conditions became more challenging in the region.","Slide 20 provides the summary of our auto financing activities. GM Financial reported the results this morning and we will be holding an earnings conference call at noon. Our U.S. subprime penetration in the fourth quarter decreased 6 percentage points from the prior year to 6.6%.","Our U.S. lease penetration is 21.9% in Q4, up 1.1 percentage points from the prior year, as we continue to approach the industry average. As mentioned earlier, we expect this lease growth trend to continue as GM Financial becomes the exclusive lease provider for Buick and GMC, with plans for the Cadillac brand later this spring.","Lease penetration in Canada is at 17.8%, a decrease of 1.8 percentage points from the prior year period. GM\u2019s new vehicle financing as a percentage of GM Financial origination, continues to grow as our financing subsidiary continues to expand its leasing, subprime and prime lending footprint.","GM Financial\u2019s percentage of GM\u2019s U.S. consumer subprime financing and leasing increased to 43% in the quarter. Annualized net credit losses remained low at 2.2%. Earnings before tax adjusted decreased to $119 million for the fourth quarter, primarily due to incremental investment in systems, people and consumer portfolio growth, resulting in increased interest and provision expenses.","Slide 21 provides our walk with adjusted automotive free cash flow for the fourth quarter and calendar year. Starting with Q4 first, our net income to common shareholders was $1.1 billion. Adding back the impact of non-controlling interests, preferred dividends and the Series A redemption then deducting GM Financial earnings, we arrive at an automotive income of $2 billion for the fourth quarter of 2014.","We had a $100 million in non-cash special items and our depreciation and amortization expense was $1.4 billion. Working capital was a $1.4 billion source of cash. The $1.2 billion improvement from the prior year was primarily due to one fewer supplier payment cycle in Q4 compared to the prior year period, partially offset by increased receivable balances.","U.S. pension and OPEB cash payments exceeded expenses by $200 million in the quarter. Other was $900 million use of cash, which includes recall related cash payments as well as approximately $500 million in non-cash equity income. This totals down to automotive net cash provided by operating activities of $3.8 billion.","We had $2 billion of capital expenditures in the quarter, which brings us to adjusted automotive free cash flow of $1.8 billion, up $700 million compared to the prior year, despite $600 million of recall-related cash payments.","Taking a look at the full calendar year, starting with net income to common shareholders of $2.8 billion, we add back the impact of non-controlling interests, preferred dividends and the Series A redemption, then deduct GM Financial earnings to arrive at an automotive income of $3.5 billion for the calendar year for 2014.","We had $1.6 billion in non-cash special items that I covered earlier and our depreciation and amortization expense was a $5.8 billion expense. Working capital for the year was a $1.6 billion use of cash. The $1.1 billion decline from the prior year was primarily due to increased receivables outstanding at year-end, partially offset by one fewer supplier payment cycle in 2014 versus the prior year.","U.S. pension and OPEB cash payments exceeded expenses by $900 million in 2014. Other was a $1.7 billion source of cash, which is primarily attributable to recall and warranty accruals in excess of recall-related cash payments. This totals down to automotive net cash provided by operating activities of $10.1 billion.","We had $7 billion of capital expenditures during the year, which brings us to adjusted automotive free cash flow of $3.1 billion for the year, including $1.6 billion in recall-related cash payments. Updating our prior guidance, we expect adjusted automotive free cash flow to be flat to up in 2015 versus 2014.","However, given normal seasonality, combined with approximately $500 million in recall-related cash payments, approximately $500 million in restructuring payments and an additional supplier payment cycle compared to the first quarter of 2014, we do expect a net cash outflow in the first quarter.","Turning to slide 22, we closed the year with a strong liquidity position of $37.2 billion, including $25.2 billion in cash and marketable securities. The change in our net cash position included approximately $2 billion in return of capital to our shareholders through our common stock dividend.","Debt increased to $9.4 billion, as we took advantage of the credit markets this past November to raise funds to partially fund the redemption of the Series A preferred shares. That transaction was executed on December 31st of last year and resulted in a reduction to net income to common shareholders of $800 million associated with the difference between the redemption price and the book value of the preferred stock.","Our total U.S. qualified and non-qualified pension plans are under funded by $10.9 billion, an increase of $3.6 billion versus a year ago, which we will further discuss in a moment. Our non-U.S. pensions are under funded by $13.1 billion at the end of the fourth quarter and our global unfunded OPEB liability is $6.6 billion\u2026","On slide 23, we take a look at the funded status of our global and US pension plans for the past four years. At the end of 2014, we had a global pension benefit obligation of $105 billion. Our global pension underfunded position increased to $24 billion.","As it relates to our US pension plans, our underfunded status at the end of 2014 was $10.9 billion, an increase of $3.6 billion. $2.2 billion was due to mortality assumptions as a result of incorporating recently issued new mortality and mortality improvement tables by the Society of Actuaries.","The new table shows increase in life expectancies, which have the effect of increasing aggregate expected benefit payments. The remaining increase in our underfunded status is due primarily to the effects of decreasing discount rates, partially offset by higher than expected asset returns.","Now let\u2019s take a look at the full calendar year EBIT-adjusted on slide 24. North America\u2019s EBIT-adjusted decreased to $6.6 billion, including the $2.4 billion of recall-related expenses. Europe had an EBIT-adjusted loss of $1.4 billion, which included an incremental $500 million in restructuring expense as well as increasingly challenging conditions in Russia versus a year ago.","International operations had EBIT-adjusted of $1.2 billion, down slightly from the prior year. South America\u2019s EBIT-adjusted decreased to $200 million loss for 2014, as the region faced a challenging macro environment, including significant foreign exchange headwinds. GM Financial had earnings before taxes adjusted of $800 million for the year. This totals to an EBIT-adjusted of $6.5 billion.","On slide 25, we provide an explanation of the $2.1 billion decrease in year-over-year EBIT-adjusted. Our EBIT-adjusted was $8.6 billion for 2013. Volume was 1 billion decrease, as wholesale volumes were down significantly in international operations and South America due to challenging macro environments and the wind down of the Chevrolet brand in Europe. This was partially offset by increased wholesales in North America.","Mix was favorable $300 million, primarily due to full-size truck and full-size SUVs in North America as well as improving country mix in Europe. Price was $4.9 billion favorable for the year led by the strength of our new vehicle introductions in North America and price actions to offset foreign exchange impacts globally, partially offset by modest unfavorable pricing on carryover products.","Although 2014 was a very strong year for year-over-year pricing improvement, we expect the impact on pricing to moderate as we cycle past the introduction of our new full-size trucks and SUVs in North America. For 2015, we expect total net price to remain positive compared to full year 2014 on a consolidated basis. However, we would expect a stronger pricing environment as we enter our aggressive launch cadence of new cars and crossovers in 2016.","Total costs were unfavorable $5.2 billion for the year, primarily attributable to recall-related cost of $2.8 billion, increased material cost associated with the recently launched vehicles of $3.6 billion, incremental restructuring expense of $500 million, partially offset by favorable material cost performance associated with carryover products of $900 million, and approximately $500 million in lower marketing cost.","Other was $1.1 billion unfavorable, primarily due to foreign exchange challenges in South America associated with the Venezuelan Bolivar, Argentine peso, and the Brazilian real, as well as the Russian ruble and euro. This was partially offset with $300 million and increased equity income from our China joint ventures.","Summing it all up on slide 26. 2014 was a very solid year. The automotive business delivered strong core operating performance, absent recall expense and GM Financials continues to contribute solid earnings, as it reinvests in the business for future growth and to support incremental sales at the auto company. For 2015 specifically, we expect EBIT-adjusted and EBIT-adjusted margins to improve in all automotive regions.","As Mary mentioned earlier, given the strong core operating performance in 2014 and our expectations for stronger performance in 2015, we intend to raise the common stock dividend 20% to $0.36 per share in the second quarter of this year. This action is consistent with our stated objective of a strong and growing dividend supported by improved business results and the planned increase demonstrates our commitment to enhancing shareholder value over time.","Finally, we are on track with financial commitments we set for 2016, specifically 10% EBIT-adjusted margins in North America, profitability in Europe, and maintaining strong net income margins in China. And all of this would lead us to the longer-term 2020 plus financial targets we outlined last October.","Now Mary and I will take your questions, after which Mary will have some closing remarks.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Rod Lache","Good morning, everybody. I was wondering if you can just answer a couple things on North America, first. If you sum up the combination of pricing, mix, and content cost, just to kind of run a proxy for contribution margins, you had a big positive in the first quarter of 2014, like $600 million, then it was positive again in Q2, but little less to negative in Q3 and then reversed, and is $300 million or positive year-over-year in the fourth quarter. It looks like mix now is running more positive than we\u2019ve seen in prior quarters. And I would think that it\u2019s -- your expectations are better than where they were back in October. Can you just give us some high level thoughts on how you think contribution margins overall look for 2015 and extent to which that could be a source of upside?","Chuck Stevens","Yeah, I would certainly suggest that with the recent fuel prices and strength in full-size SUVs, full-size trucks and crossovers that mix will be a tailwind in 2015 and better than what we expected back in October, again given what transpire with fuel prices. I think there is also, as we talked before Rod is we cycled through the first year launch of trucks and SUVs where the year-over-year impact falls into pricing. We are going to see more of that show up in mix in 2015 versus 2014 as well.","Rod Lache","Okay. And can you also give us some insight into your expectations for structural costs looking forward? It looks like you didn\u2019t really discuss structural costs this year. There were some items, like D&A, which was down year-over-year in the fourth quarter. I believe you guys are expecting structural costs to be up a bit in 2015. What is the high level expectation there?","Chuck Stevens","Yeah, let me start with 2014 overall, when we look at overhead, fixed costs, structural costs, whatever we want to call it, relatively flat in \u201814 versus \u201813, as we took actions around the world. As we indicated back at the conference in January, we would expect to see overhead costs up on a year-over-year basis and the primary driver of that is incremental engineering and incremental marketing as we head into our very strong launch cadence in the latter part of 2015 and 2016. And I would say that that\u2019s prevalent from a North American and a European perspective primarily.","Rod Lache","Okay. And just lastly, can you just touch on your updated views on China. Obviously, there has been quite a bit of discussion about inventory levels there and capacity growth, DMS, and specific strategies to mitigate that, but just from a high level, has there been any change in the competitive environment there?","Chuck Stevens","No significant change from what we discussed in January. We indicated in January that we\u2019re monitoring the situation very closely. We still expect the industry to be up year-over-year somewhere in the range of 5% to 8%, call it 25.5 million to 26 million units. Our inventory position actually is in really good shape right now. Through the month of January and early February, we are down below our target days on hand at a dealer level. So our expectations are still consistent with what we talked before. Industry growth will continue to grow our revenue and we will maintain our net income margins in the 9% to 10% range, resulting in higher equity income.","Rod Lache","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","John Murphy","Good morning, guys.","Chuck Stevens","Hi, John.","John Murphy","A first question on trucks, I mean obviously you\u2019re highlighting there is some potential upside there given what\u2019s going on with your product as well as what\u2019s going on with gas prices. I\u2019m just curious where you\u2019re running on capacity utilization on the K2XX right now, what the potential for upside to that capacity might be in 2015, and how we should think about incremental profitability as you stretch out that capacity maybe?","Chuck Stevens","Yeah. I would say this we are running pretty hard right now from a capacity utilization perspective. We do have opportunities at a system level from a capacity perspective primarily in double cabs. We continue to work very, very hard on a day-to-day basis with the supply base and our manufacturing to increase capacity.","On crew cabs, we\u2019ve got capacity on heavy duties as well. So we think, obviously, there is some production upside in the system and again, we\u2019re working to eliminate any bottlenecks.","As I think about the overall opportunity John, it\u2019s not just volume, there\u2019s also mix, where customer demand increases for trucks. There\u2019s an opportunity to up-sell from a mix perspective. And ultimately, in the overall supply and demand equation, we\u2019ll be looking at price and that was one of the reasons why back in October and again in January, I said that, we thought that the truck pricing environment was going to moderate in 2015.","John Murphy","Okay. And maybe just some specifics around that, I mean, do you think that you could increase your production or volume on these trucks 10% year-over-year, is that something that is viable given your footprint? I\u2019m just trying to understand the potential upside just on a volume basis?","Chuck Stevens","Yeah. I\u2019ve rather not get into those specific. That\u2019s a bit competitive dynamic there that we like -- I would just suggest that, if the industry segment runs at 12.3% to 12.5% and the industry is in the range that we expected to $16.5 million to $17 million, we will have system-wide capacity to build a deal with that.","John Murphy","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then second question on the CapEx for 2015, you\u2019re talking about $9 billion, which is a pretty big step up? I\u2019m just curious, if there\u2019s any way that you might be able to thrift that through the course of the year and if maybe you can explain why there is this real big step function increase in CapEx?","Mary Barra","Yeah. I would say, first of all, on thrifting, we\u2019re always looking at that impact. We\u2019ve got quite a few initiative and driver from a global perspective, so both from a supplier vendor tooling perspective and the capital that goes into our plan. So we review that in great detail and are continuing to work on initiative to take that down.","But then when you look at it, I think of it in three buckets. One is new products that are within our existing portfolio and look at in some of the technology that we\u2019re driving into the vehicles for industry leading fuel efficiency, as well as autonomous and connectivity, making sure we\u2019re making the right investments with a customer focus there.","And then the third impact or the third bucket I look at is, we believe there is opportunity in segments we\u2019re not in around the globe that we\u2019ll generate the right return and can enhance our brands and enhance our market position. So looking at those three buckets and again it\u2019s an area, I ran in the company at one point in my career, there is an intense focus on that and we\u2019ll seize every opportunity.","John Murphy","Okay. And then just lastly, if we think about GM Financial, your commitment there and to grow, that sounds like it makes a tremendous amount of sense? But it sounds like there is a pretty heavy investment period here that you started in the fourth quarter? I\u2019m just curious how long you think that investment period will last? And then also additionally, what kind of capital might you need to commit to that business overtime to really grow the balance sheet to support it, because it sounds like you are doing mostly on balance sheet financing there? So just trying to understand the capital equipment too?","Chuck Stevens","Yeah. First, the result in the fourth quarter is not run rate. I mean, there was some investment for growth and taking provisions as you bring on new loans have a bit of a tail on it before you started to get the full benefit of the income. So there is some timing there. There is a significant portion of the variance on a year-over-year basis were some nonrecurring items.","I go back again to what we talked about in January, we expect GMF profitability as we ramp up our capability to be flat on a year-over-year basis in \u201815 versus \u201814. And then we\u2019ll start to see the incremental benefit of the growth in their portfolio, the growth in their originations in \u201816 and beyond.","Relative to any capital calls on the auto company. We certainly don\u2019t anticipate any in this growth plan. We went through that and that\u2019s going to all be self-funded from GMF. We run a number of scenarios including downside risk scenarios and again, minimal to none on a go-forward basis, John.","John Murphy","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Brian Johnson","Yes. Good morning. Just want to ask sort of a housekeeping question on cash flow for next year and then kind of a broader question around the CapEx investments, continuing that line? You booked $2.5 billion of accruals for recalls? You paid out less than that, so it seems like that is a $900 million cash call this upcoming year? You mentioned $500 million of restructuring expense?","I guess a question for Chuck is, within your guide of flat year-over-year cash flow, what is, if you will, the bills that you are paying that were accrued in 2014 that cash is going out of the door in 2015 and if you could just mention for -- that for us?","Chuck Stevens","Yeah. Sure. Overall, from a recall perspective, including the Feinberg compensation program, we accrued roughly $3.2 billion that showed up and impacted our P&L in 2014. We made about $1.6 billion of cash payments in 2014 associated with that, which means we have a carry-on into 2015 of a further -- 2015 and beyond $1.6 billion.","As we indicated in January, we expect to incur about $1.2 billion of cash costs in 2015 associated with those accruals that we took in 2014 and then the balance would bleed out into 2016. A lot of its dependent on timing of getting the vehicles repaired, et cetera.","In addition to that, we highlighted that there was going to be an overflow into 2015 associated with restructuring expense recall. We booked a $1 billion of restructuring expense against the P&L in 2014. We anticipated roughly $300 million of that flowing over into 2015. So between the two, about a $1.5 billion broad strokes Brian rolling over from \u201814 into \u201815.","Brian Johnson","Okay. And kind of second or related to that before I ask the CapEx question. Does that kind of feed into just getting those cash payments out the door, apparently which is [indiscernible] quoted you on saying there is a possibility for second half we are looking at cash to shareholders, maybe you could elaborate on that.","Chuck Stevens","Well, yeah, what I specifically said was, our objective and our focus is to drive shareholder value and shareholder returns, evidenced by the intended increase in the dividend.","And then looking beyond the first half of the year, we have a number of open items that we still need to get clarity around related to the recall. Separate from these issues that we just talk about, Brian, this is ongoing litigation and other issues.","And to the extent that we get clarity and understand what those issues are and the potential impact from a cash perspective, we could be in a position in the second half of the year, where we would evaluate further returns of capital to shareholders and that\u2019s something we continuously monitor and evaluate.","Brian Johnson","Okay. And then finally, on CapEx, the $9 billion, which you discussed some of the drivers, Mary, thank you for the increase? To what extent can we expect either as a dollar amount or percent of sales this to continue?","And, secondly, particularly for some of the investments in technology and in new product introductions, kind of when is the timing for when those investments ought to get return on investment. Not to sound like a bean counter, but I\u2019m sure you count.","Chuck Stevens","Yeah. Sure. A big portion of the $9 billion is associated with our products that we\u2019re going to be launching at the tailend of \u201815 and into \u201816 and \u201817. And when you look at what we talked about from a margin expansion perspective, North America 10% margins, Europe profitability, we indicated that the next-generation Cruze, next-generation Malibu, the Corsa, the Astra and some of these other products will going to be more profitable than the vehicles that they replace.","So the return on a big portion of this capital, which is portfolio related, will start to see roll through in \u201816 and \u201817. And if you add up the guidance we provided for 2016, you quickly get to overall consolidated margins that are much more robust than we are today and that\u2019s really the return for that investment.","Brian Johnson","Okay. And sort of level of CapEx in \u201816, \u201817, \u201818?","Chuck Stevens","What I said before in our outlook hasn\u2019t changed on that. We would expect on a go-forward basis, as we move through a number of the items that Mary talked about both portfolio, fuel-efficient technologies, advanced proportion and other innovations that our capital spending would be around industry average, call it 5.5% in net sales just to provide some broad guidance on that.","Brian Johnson","Okay. Thank you.","Chuck Stevens","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan from UBS. Please go ahead.","Colin Langan","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Firstly, I noticed there were some headlines that you were taking some price cuts on models in North America, but your comments today indicate that we should think of pricing as relatively flat. So can you explain some of the logic behind the pricing strategy that was recently announced?","Mary Barra","I don\u2019t know specifically what you\u2019re referring to, if you\u2019re referring to Cadillac, what they fundamentally did was reposition option packages and content. When I look at carryover pricing in North America, I indicated in the past that we expect it to be flat to slightly a headwind in 2015. As we cycle through the full-size truck and SUV dynamic and actually, we are in the last year of a number of our products that we talked about before Cruze, Malibu and others. So the specific actions from a Cadillac perspective, was really adjusting packaging content and the starting-form price to the entry-level vehicle and not the whole line up of Cadillac products. And we do that quite often, when we look at, trying to make sure that we\u2019ve got the content lined up with what the customers want.","Colin Langan","Okay. I think the recent article said that on some of your Chevy models, I think including the Cruze and some SUVs, you were cutting the base price by $1,500 to $2,500. Does that sound accurate?","Chuck Stevens","Probably, it\u2019s the same issue. Adjusting starting-from price, which at the end of day helps from a digital Internet shopping perspective but fundamentally very-very low penetration levels on those models.","Colin Langan","Got it. Okay. And any color on the GMIO consolidated fix, I mean, you are targeting, I believe you said that it was going to be a breakeven ex-restructuring next year. It was losing I think around $900 million this year. What are the key drivers to getting that back to profitability -- back to breakeven? And then any color on what you are going to do with the facilities that were supplying the Chevy Europe vehicles?","Chuck Stevens","Yeah. Sure. I\u2019ll answer the first part first. One, one big driver year-over-year is the absence of Chevrolet Europe losses. So, I\u2019m not going to get into the specifics of that, but that\u2019s one of the drivers in the improvement \u201815 versus \u201814. Second, full year of full-size pickups and full-size utilities in the Middle East, and third, just continuing to drive efficiency in the core operations and the rest of consolidated operations. And I think you saw that if you looked at the results during 2014 quarter-in quarter-out, the results got better, still little loss, but the results got better.","And we would expect to see that ex-restructuring in 2015 as well. Relative to what happens to the capacity associated with the Chevrolet Europe volume, most of that came out of Korea. And when you look at what we are doing to fill that and the opportunities to fill it, it\u2019s really with other global products like small SUVs the Encore, the Mocha, the Chevrolet Trax and driving efficiency and continue to drive efficiency in Korea. So this is obviously an ongoing set of actions that the international team are executing to.","Colin Langan","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And just last question. Any color on your relative risk to the volatility in currency? I imagine in Europe that actually does help translate some of the losses back to a lesser degree. What about the other inter-regional currency issues that you face? Is that a rising concern, or is it net neutral to your global business?","Chuck Stevens","Yeah. Clearly, as you saw from the calendar year results, it was a significant headwind in 2014. We are largely able to offset that through pricing and other actions, as we started this year, further weakening of these currencies will again be a challenge. But when I look at it across the globe, I generally -- the transaction impact is offsetting with the exception of the Russian ruble that\u2019s the biggest concern that we have thus far. And the team continues to take actions to offset that. So as I think about it from a big picture perspective, I think we\u2019re in a pretty good position to manage the FX exposure without changing our view of the year. And again, the proof-of-point is we\u2019re able to do that last year and get after it and we\u2019ll do the same thing in 2015.","Colin Langan","Okay. All right. Thank you very much.","Chuck Stevens","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Emmanuel Rosner","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Chuck Stevens","Good Morning.","Mary Barra","Hello.","Emmanuel Rosner","Wanted to ask you first about your mid-term target margin for North Americas, 10% by 2016. It looks like this quarter, a lot of things from execution as well as environment were going very well and you achieved obviously a strong margin in what is seasonally a weak quarter. But it\u2019s still only about 8.7% or so. Can you please remind us the bridge from current levels to 10% by 2016, what are the main buckets there?","Chuck Stevens","Yes. Sure. Number one, significant improvement from product and when I talk about product, two different buckets. Product refreshes, so replacement of current models like the Cruze, Malibu, Equinox, Terrain. We indicated back in October that each of those vehicles would be more than a $1,000 per unit more profitable than the vehicles they\u2019re replacing. Next between cost efficiencies, as well as price and then new entries like the mid-sized truck for instance and Cadillac entries that we\u2019ll be adding to the portfolio, which are accretive to volume share and profitability. So that\u2019s the product portfolio piece of it.","And then of what we call adjacencies or business model leverage, we think there\u2019s significant opportunity going forward between now and \u201816 and beyond for customer care and after sales expanding our reach in the value chain in the F&I area, OnStar with monetizing 4G LTE.","So those are the big drivers of going from -- think about it 2014 kind of ex recalls 9% to 10% in 2016. Those are the big drivers to pickup that net 100 basis point improvement. Clearly, the first two will be more than 100 basis points because we are going to have is we\u2019ve talked about before some overhead headwinds associated with engineering and marketing, but net those out and that\u2019s how you go from 9% to 10%.","Emmanuel Rosner","Okay. Very helpful. And then just another margin question, but on China this time. Obviously, you are running pretty close to your targeted levels and these are obviously very impressive margins in absolute terms. Yet, I cannot notice that just the ongoing trend I guess over the past four quarters or so is just a sequential decline. And I\u2019m sure there is some seasonality in that as well. But can you just go over again these sort of competitive dynamics and why you wouldn\u2019t expect this to sort of like continue to decline as it has for the past few quarters sequentially?","Chuck Stevens","Yeah. I think it\u2019s important there is seasonality in that. If you look at the fourth quarter net income margins this year versus last year, they are up 110 basis points. So 8.7% versus 7.6% from a China net income margin perspective. For the year, we are at 9.8% which is up three times of a percent year-over-year. And as we talked about the dynamics in the China market before and how we are going to maintain 9% to 10% EBIT margins. We indicated that volume and mix would be favorable material performance with partially offset price and we expected kind of fixed cost to increase as we continue to invest.","The biggest driver if I net it all that out is really mix and that\u2019s going to be driven in maintaining margins. And that\u2019s going to be driven by nine new SUVs that we are launching and in a process of launching including the Chevrolet Trax, which is doing very well, the Buick Envision, which is doing very well as well as filling out and growing Cadillac. So that\u2019s how we are going to attack and maintain those 9% to 10% margins.","Emmanuel Rosner","Perfect. Thanks a lot.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Ryan Brinkman","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. First I see on slide nine that you call out $0.1 billion of recall-related costs, but I didn\u2019t see that in the press release or in any of your regional year-over-year EBIT bridge slides, maybe because it rounds to less than $0.1 billion in any region. So I\u2019m just curious what that is, whether it might relate to North America, suggesting that your underlying margin there was even higher?","Chuck Stevens","It\u2019s primarily legal related expense and that falls into the corporate sector. So for the year and we\u2019ve talked about this before, we expected and actually incurred about $300 million in year-over-year increase in legal expense and that\u2019s one other things that we expect to continue into 2015 as well.","Ryan Brinkman","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then I\u2019m curious on what you are seeing in terms of the impact of lower commodity prices in 2015. Not just in terms of the raw materials that I guess that go into your cars, but also maybe from the perspective of lower diesel prices impacting freight and logistics. How material could that potentially be?","Chuck Stevens","Certainly versus our original expectations, it would have -- it would be a tailwind both commodity prices and fuel prices. And when you think about the magnitude assuming that fuel prices to stay with -- for the rest of the year, we are talking $200 million to $300 million at the top end of the opportunity range there","Ryan Brinkman","Okay. Great. And then last question, we saw some headlines the other day about suspending production in Russia, I guess to avoid that ruble to euro transaction headwind that you talked about earlier. So how should we think about -- what that means going forward? And other firms have sometimes talked about like what their unavoidable fixed costs in a country are like in Venezuela, for example. They try to draw the line for the investment community in terms of how bad could it get if there were no corresponding revenue. Anything you can do to kind of frame the situation for us?","Chuck Stevens","Sure. If you look at 2014 versus 2013, the net headwind from a Russian perspective and European results was about $200 million on a year-over-year basis. As I think about 2015 the kind of the local fix costs left unattended are about $250 million. So if we produce zero vehicles and generated zero variable profit and took no action, there could be a $200 million to $250 million headwind from a local fixed cost perspective.","Obviously, our objective is to offset that to the extent possible with cost reductions, which we continue to do hence the suspension of manufacturing and the 1000 people that we\u2019ve taken out of St. Petersburg but as well as pricing. But just sizing up the kind of potential exposure on a year-over-year basis, Ryan, I would call it $200 million or less.","Ryan Brinkman","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Spak with RBC. Please go ahead.","Joe Spak","Thanks for taking the question. Going back to China first, I know you mentioned the better year-over-year margin. Obviously, we see the whole sales were up as well. Was there any benefit from mix or can you give some color on that on a year-over-year basis?","Chuck Stevens","Yeah. The mix was favorable in 2014 versus 2013. Again headline we grew share and profit margins. And one of the reasons we grew share was we introduced a number of new products, especially in the SUV\u2019s segment, where we had to had some gaps from a portfolio on the competitive perspective.","And again the same dynamics in 2015 were present in 2014. Volume mix were favorables. The net pricing dynamic in China is and has been a headwind and will continue to be a headwind. Material performance and carryover products partially offsets the net price and generally our fixed costs have been going up as we\u2019ve been expanding in an increasing capacity. But the volume mix impact fundamentally offsetting price and fixed cost.","Joe Spak","Okay. In South America, you guys have done a really good job offsetting FX with price. And it sounds like you are going to be able to -- you expect to be able to continue to do that in 2015, I just want to confirm that. And then also related to South America, I was wondering if you had given any thought to -- you mentioned in the media some comments about Venezuela. I was wondering if you gave any thought to deconsolidating those activities such as Ford did?","Chuck Stevens","Yeah. Let me talk about the general dynamic in South Africa first. Not only, have we been working hard to offset the impact of FX in economics with pricing but we continue to drive efficiencies throughout the business from a cost perspective as well.","I would suggest that generally from a Venezuelan and Argentinian perspective, we can recover any FX movement and any economic impact inflation. And we demonstrated the ability to do that over the past number of years.","Brazil is a little bit different dynamic. So I\u2019m keeping a very close eye on what\u2019s happening with the real and our ability to recover that completely. Historically, we haven\u2019t been able to get it completely offset that headwind with pricing. And that\u2019s something we\u2019re going to have to monitor. Obviously, it\u2019s weaker than what we expected thus far.","From a Venezuela standpoint, our facts and circumstances would dictate that currently we control our operations. We have some control over operations. We were able to take advantage of currency releases and participate in the currency markets in 2014 to secure hard currency to order product. We settled and got a labor agreement.","And in the fourth quarter, we\u2019ve been producing vehicles, producing and selling. And until those facts and circumstances change, we\u2019re in a position where we\u2019re actually controlling the business. But that\u2019s something that we monitor very, very closely. And if those things change, further volatility, unavailability of currency, or otherwise, that\u2019s something we will have to revaluate.","Joe Spak","Okay. And then just real quickly, the recall-related legal expense, should that continue -- of $100 million, should that continue for another couple quarters?","Chuck Stevens","As I indicated, we incurred roughly $300 million of recall-related legal expenses in 2014. And we would expect that kind of pace plus or minus to continue in 2015.","Joe Spak","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Chuck Stevens","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Please go ahead.","Itay Michaeli","Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And congratulations.","Chuck Stevens","Thanks, Itay.","Itay Michaeli","Just a couple of housekeeping, Chuck, the $700 million of restructuring expense this year, can you give us a rough breakout of where that\u2019s going to be by region?","Chuck Stevens","I\u2019ll give you a general breakdown of that. About something less than $100 million in South America, a range of $100 million to $200 million potentially in North America, and then the vast majority will be in international operations, primarily related to Holden and the previously announced action to cease manufacturing operations and some restructuring activities in Korea associated with alining capacity with demand around the world, somewhat related to the Chevrolet Europe wind down.","Itay Michaeli","That\u2019s very helpful. And then you mentioned earlier some of the cadence issues for cash flow, how about EBIT-adjusted, anything special to think about this year? You do have some product launching late in the year. Any tips in terms of modeling the cadence this year?","Chuck Stevens","If I was going to model the cadence, I would look at the last two or three years earnings cadence and look at that and Q1 will be generally the weakest quarter of the year. Just based on from a seasonal perspective, Q2 will be the strongest and Q3 and Q4 will be about average.","Itay Michaeli","Great. Just lastly, on the free cash flow guidance, just to clarify, are you still looking for about $1 billion of cash restructuring in 2015? I know you mentioned the recalls. I just want to check on the restructuring as well.","Chuck Stevens","That\u2019s correct. The $700 million assuming that we execute all these restructurings and actually make the payments in 2015, that\u2019s the assumption, plus the $300 million overhang from 2014.","Itay Michaeli","Great. That\u2019s all very helpful. Thanks so much, guys.","Chuck Stevens","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Our next comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Adam Jonas","Thanks, everybody. Just a couple questions about GM Financial and the strategy, the decision to pull the subvented leasing business for Buick, GMC, and Cadillac back 100% captive and away from Ally. Ally has been pretty critical of the move. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen some of the quotes from their former CEO. I just wanted you to explain again the logic for not giving Ally any chance at all as a subvented leasing alternative, why the exclusives?","Chuck Stevens","Yes. Number one, first and foremost, is owning the customer. This is all about customer relationship and driving improves the loyalty. And what we\u2019ve found and I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s specific to Ally, but in other lease providers, at the conclusion of lease their objectives may not be the same as ours. Our objective is to get that person another General Motors vehicle and maintain that relationship and own that customer. So this is 100% around loyalty and customer ownership.","Adam Jonas","Okay. That\u2019s clear. And just a second just follow-up, you have been growing your captive finance business very aggressively, both through organic and non-organic means. And some of the non-organic stuff you have done has been acquisitions of some of the former Ally International businesses most recently in China, the JV side of it there.","Can you categorically rule out considering adding some of the domestic Ally portfolio if it was offered at the right price? And I say that seeing Ally trading at around 0.7 times tangible book. Thanks.","Chuck Stevens","Yeah. I really, I\u2019m not going to comment on that at all. I\u2019m one way or the other, Adam.","Adam Jonas","Okay. So that\u2019s not a categorical to rule out. Thank you.","Chuck Stevens","No comment.","Adam Jonas","I respect that. Thank you.","Operator","Miss Barra, there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference back to you.","Mary Barra","Thank you very much, Operator. And thanks everybody for participating on the call and for your questions. As we move forward, you can expect us to keep the same intense focus on results that we demonstrated through 2014. And with this focus, we expect to deliver improved performance in all of our automotive regions this year. It\u2019s key to meeting our 2016 objectives, including the 10% EBIT-adjusted margins in North America, profitability in Europe and continued strong margins in China.","And it will also keep us on track to deliver EBIT-adjusted margins in the 9% to 10% range early next decade. Our intention is to increase second quarter -- our intention to increase second quarter dividend is the first step in our goal to maximize long-term shareholder value through both return of capital and stock price appreciation.","So now I would close by saying thanks again for your participation. I appreciate your time, and hope everyone has a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, May 3, 2012. ","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Randy Arickx, Executive Director of Communications and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Randy Arickx","Thanks, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us as we review our first quarter 2012 results. A press release was issued earlier this morning and the conference call materials are available on the Investor Relations website. We would also like to highlight that GM is broadcasting this call via the Internet. ","Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the legend regarding forward-looking statements in the first page of the chart set. As always, the content of our call will be governed by this language. ","This morning, Dan Akerson, General Motors' Chairman and CEO, will provide opening remarks, followed by a more detailed review by Dan Ammann, Senior Vice President and CFO. Dan Akerson will then conclude the remarks portion of our call with some closing remarks. After the presentation portion of the call, we will open the line for questions from security analysts.","Also, in the room today, we have Nick Cyprus, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; Jim Davlin, Vice President Finance and Treasurer; and Chuck Stevens, CFO North America and South America, to assist in answering your questions. ","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dan Akerson.","Daniel F. Akerson","Thanks, Randy, and thank you to everyone on the call for joining us. General Motors had another solid quarter. Our EBIT adjusted results are strong. We had product success stories in every region of the world, especially with Chevrolet. Among the 20 largest automotive brands in the world, Chevrolet has been the fastest-growing for the last 2 calendar years. ","Big marketplace wins like these are happening because we continue to advance the 4 strategies that are the foundation of how we run the business. Simply put, they are to design and build the world's best vehicles, strengthen our brands, grow profitably around the world and maintain our fortress balance sheet. We made good progress on this strategy last year, and we didn't let up in the first quarter of this year either.","I'll review each of the highlights through my remarks. But as you hear them, remember this. This management team is not getting ahead of ourselves. We are confident in our plan. We're pleased with the progress in most areas, and we have internal issues we're fixing. We're not immune to the industry issues like recession or overcapacity in Europe or competition that's intensifying everywhere we do business. Every day, we keep our teams focused on these cold hard facts because it instills discipline, and discipline helps deliver better results.","It's certainly reflected in our top line growth, which you can see at the top of Slide #2. GM's first quarter global deliveries and net revenue both increased year-over-year, with North America and GMIO more than offsetting the declines in Europe and our flat results in South America. Globally, our deliveries were up 60,000 units, and our net revenue increased 4% to $37.8 billion. ","Looking at the bottom line, our net income attributable to common shareholders was about $1 billion, which is down from the first quarter of 2011. As you know, we had a net $1.5 billion gain from special items a year ago. In this quarter, we had a special loss in special items of $600 million. Our automotive net cash from operating activities was a much improved $2.3 billion.","Looking at EBIT adjusted, we improved $200 million year-over-year to $2.2 billion. Our North American businesses drove these results. Revenue in the region increased 9%, and EBIT adjusted increased $400 million to $1.7 billion. ","This really speaks to our balanced portfolio of cars, trucks and crossovers and the ongoing success of vehicles, like the Chevy Cruze and the Cadillac SRX, and contributions from new vehicles like the Chevrolet Sonic and Buick Verano. All these vehicles have significantly better design, fuel economy, average transaction prices and resale value than the models they replaced.","Europe obviously remains a work in progress. Our EBIT adjusted loss was $256 million compared to a breakeven result last year -- year ago. Net revenue declined about 20%, which reflects our lower sales of vehicles and components, as well as the impact of a stronger dollar relative to the euro and the British pound. These results are disappointing but not unexpected, and we're working hard to identify new revenue and cost reduction opportunities to put the business on a path to sustainable profitability.","GMIO, like North America, remained a source of strength for the company. Our EBIT adjusted results of $500 million were down slightly compared with a year ago. Importantly, GM and our JV partners have continued to grow both sales and market share in China. They are first -- we had a record first quarter sales of 745,000 vehicles, thanks to the successful launch of Baojun, the ongoing success of Wuling and Buick and a solid start to the new Chevrolet Malibu. ","The key for us in China has been to stay in offense, which is why I traveled to Beijing auto show last week and announced that we will add an additional 600 dealers in China this year and add one new Cadillac model to our lineup in China each year through 2016.","First car will be the Cadillac XTS luxury sedan, which will go into production at Shanghai GM later this year. We'll follow that up with the Cadillac ELR electric coupe in the near future. These are important strategic moves because half of all luxury purchases in the world, all categories not just cars, are predicted to occur in China by the end of the decade.","In South America, our results were essentially flat with the same quarter a year ago. But they are back in the black, and we're starting to see the impact of new product introductions. ","In Brazil, for example, we launched the Chevy S10 pickup and the Cruze hatchback this quarter. And we're gaining traction with the Cruze notchback and Cobalt, which we launched in the fourth quarter. The new Cobalt increased Chevrolet share in this segment by almost 13 percentage points over the nameplates sold in the second half of last year, and Cruze sales in the quarter ran at more than double the rate of car it replaced. ","Finally, our automotive free cash flow was a much improved $300 million for the quarter.","Before I turn the call over to Dan Ammann, our Chief Financial Officer, I wanted to specifically call out some of the major revenue and cost actions we took in the quarter to improve our margins over time. These are summarized in Slide 3. The most significant is the global alliance with PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, which we announced in late February. Management and implementation teams are in place. We have more than a dozen work streams underway. And very soon, we will be able to announce the first visible results of the alliance.","Also, in the first quarter, sales in China set a record. As I mentioned before, our sales in Russia were up 29%. This helped Chevrolet delivered record global sales of 1.2 million units. ","Our marketing organization, meanwhile, delivered 2 major cost and complexity reductions this quarter. In January, we consolidated our global media planning and buying services to increase our purchasing power. And in March, we reduced the number of advertising agencies that support our Chevrolet brand from 70 down to essentially one.","Also on March, we advanced our strategy to ensure that competitively priced credit is always available to our dealers and customers. We did it by adding Wells Fargo as a partner in our Western U.S. sales region. They will be a great complement to GM Financial and our existing relationships with Ally and U.S. Bank.","These are all in addition to the changes we announced in February to further de-risk our U.S. hourly and salary pension plans. ","Finally, we had a number of major product announcements, the 2 most recent being the unveiling of the 2014 Chevrolet Impala and our new line of bi-fuel pickups that can run compressed natural gas or gasoline. With the launch of the Impala, we will have completely transformed our Chevrolet passenger car showroom from top to bottom, and this great-looking car is going to help us deliver much higher retail sales for Chevrolet in this segment. Bi-fuel pickups, by contrast, are primarily targeted fleet customers who want to use clean-burning, domestically sourced low-cost alternative gasoline -- to gasoline. ","On future calls, you can expect updates on many of these initiatives and new ones that are designed to make us a stronger, more profitable company. ","Now I'd like to turn it over to Dan Ammann, who will give you more details on our results, then I'll return to close the call. Thank you.","Daniel Ammann","Thanks, Dan. Beginning on Slide 4, we provide a summary of our first quarter 2012 GAAP results compared to the prior year. As Dan previously covered, net revenues were $37.8 billion for 2012, up $1.6 billion from 2011. Net [ph] operating income was $1 billion for the quarter. Net income to common stockholders was $1 billion, which rounds to a $2.1 billion decline from the prior year, driven largely by special items. Earnings per share were $0.60 on a fully diluted basis compared to $1.77 for the same period in 2011. And our automotive net cash from operating activities was $2.3 billion for the quarter, up almost $3 billion year-over-year.","Moving to the non-GAAP metrics on the bottom of the page, EBIT adjusted was $2.2 billion for 2012, up $200 million versus 2011. The EBIT adjusted margin was 5.8%, an increase of 0.2 percentage points from the prior year. Automotive free cash flow was $300 million, a $2.2 billion improvement from 2011.","Turning to Slide 5, we list the special items and adjustments impacting the first quarter 2012 earnings. As I mentioned, our net income to common stock shareholders was $1 billion, and our fully diluted earnings per share was $0.60. Included in both of these metrics is the $600 million special item for the impairment of goodwill, primarily in our GME operations. That equals $0.33 per share on a fully diluted basis. ","On Slide 6, we provide the composition of EBIT adjusted by region for the first quarters of 2011 and 2012. As Dan previously covered, GMNA's EBIT adjusted was $1.7 billion, up $400 million from the prior year. GME's EBIT adjusted was a loss of $256 million, a $300 million decrease from the breakeven performance a year ago. GMIO had an EBIT adjusted of $500 million, down $100 million versus the prior year. And GMSA's EBIT adjusted was $100 million, equal to its 2011 performance.","GM Financial continued to improve earnings with $200 million from the quarter, up from approximately $100 million in the prior year. Corporate and eliminations were breakeven for both periods. This nets to an EBIT adjusted of $2.2 billion for the first quarter of 2012.","Slide 7 shows our consolidated EBIT adjusted for the last 5 quarters. Moving to the bottom of the slide, our operating income margin was 2.6% for the quarter, equal to the same period in 2011, although both periods were affected by special items. Our EBIT adjusted margin was 5.8%, a 0.2 percentage point increase from the prior year. This is driven by a stronger performance in GMNA, partially offset with the decline in Europe, which we'll cover in the segment reviews. Our global production numbers are about 4% higher on a year-over-year basis. However, our global market share declined 0.1 percentage points to 11.3% for the first quarter.","Turning to Slide 8. We provide a first quarter 2012 comparison with our consolidated EBIT adjusted for the prior year. We recently made a few changes to our EBIT bridge methodology in order to provide some more insight into key trends. Most notably, we previously assigned the net price and cost changes of our new major product programs into the mix category. We have now split these effects out and placed them into the price and cost categories. ","On the left side of the chart, our consolidated EBIT adjusted was $2 billion for 2011. ","In the middle portion of the slide, we walk the $200 million improvement for the quarter. Volume was favorable $400 million, largely driven by increased production in North America and IO. Mix was unfavorable $200 million due to increased sales of compact, small and midsize cars in North America, offset with a modest improvement in South America. Price was favorable $800 million for the quarter due to the strength of our new product introductions and other pricing actions we have taken. Total costs were up $900 million. ","Excluding the $200 million decrease in pension income that we've discussed previously, fixed costs were flat for the quarter. Our material pricing and freight costs were also unchanged. We had $200 million impact of material content for our new product programs, and the remaining cost increases for the quarter were essentially one-off adjustments totaling $300 million, including a $200 million increase in retroactive policy and warranty adjustments and $100 million in restructuring charges. ","Finally, we had $200 million lower contribution from powertrain and part sales, which is included here in the cost category. Other was $100 million favorable. ","This totals to a consolidated EBIT adjusted of $2.2 billion for the first  quarter of 2012.","We'll now move to our segment results with the key performance indicators for GM North America here on Slide 9. The 2 lines on the top of the slide represent GM's U.S. total and retail share. The bars on the slide represent GM's average U.S. retail incentives on a per unit basis. Our U.S. retail incentive spending as a percentage of average transaction price and a comparison to the industry average is noted on the bottom of the slide. ","For the first quarter of 2012, our U.S. retail share was 16%, down 2.2 percentage points versus the prior year. Our incentive levels on an absolute basis decreased $360 per vehicle from the prior year. On a percentage of ATP basis, our incentives were 10.4%, down 1.3 percentage points from the prior year. This puts us at 109% of industry average levels for the first quarter of 2012. For April, our retail market share was 16.2%, and our incentives are estimated to have been 10.3% of the average transaction price.","On Slide 10, we show GM North America's EBIT adjusted for the last 5 quarters. For the first quarter of 2012, EBIT adjusted was $1.7 billion, up $400 million versus the prior year. ","Moving to the bottom of the slide, revenue was $24.2 billion, up $2.1 billion versus 2011, due primarily to increased volume. GM North America's EBIT adjusted margin was 7% for the first quarter, up 1.3 percentage points from the prior year. U.S. dealer inventory was 713,000 units at the end of the first quarter or 86 days supply versus 574,000 units and 75 days supply for the first quarter of 2011. GMNA production was 862,000 units for the quarter, a 76,000 vehicle increase from the prior year, of which 44,000 units were due to full-size trucks and SUVs. ","As we indicated in the prior quarter, this buildup of full-size trucks is in preparation for the plant downtime that is scheduled through the balance of 2012. GMNA market share was 16.7% for the quarter, 1.6 percentage points lower than the prior year. This decline is due to reduced volumes from our older and discontinued product offerings.","Turning to Slide 11. We provide the year-over-year view of GMNA's $400 million improvement in EBIT adjusted. Starting on the left-hand side, EBIT adjusted was $1.3 billion for the first quarter. Volume was favorable $600 million, driven by increased full-size truck and compact and small car production. ","Mix was unfavorable $300 million due primarily to increased production of compact, small and midsize cars, more than offsetting the impact of the increased truck production. Price was $400 million favorable on a year-over-year basis. Costs were $300 million unfavorable this quarter due to $200 million on an unfavorable U.S. pension income and $100 million expense for a skilled trade Special Attrition Program resulting in 1,400 voluntary retirements. Other was unchanged for the quarter. This totals to an EBIT adjusted of $1.7 billion for the first quarter of 2012. We'll provide you some perspective to the impact of the full-size truck production ebbs and flows on earnings for GM North America later in the presentation.","Moving on to Slide 12. GME reported an unfavorable EBIT adjusted of $256 million for the first quarter, a decline of just under $300 million from the prior year. ","At the bottom of the slide, revenue was $5.5 billion for the quarter, down $1.4 billion from the prior year. This decline was due primarily to $1 billion in lower vehicle volume and $300 million in unfavorable foreign exchange translation. The EBIT adjusted margin in the region was a negative 4.6%. GME's production for the quarter was 292,000 units, down 52,000 from the quarter prior, partially attributable to an industry that had a 6% year-over-year decline. GME's market share in the region was 8.2%, a 0.2 percentage point decline from 2011.","Turning to Slide 13, we provide the major components of GME's $300 million year-over-year decline in EBIT adjusted. Volume was $200 million unfavorable, driven by a decline in the industry and a 0.2 percentage point loss of share. Mix and price were essentially unchanged for the quarter. Cost was essentially flat due to $100 million decline from decreased sales of powertrain's parts and accessories, offset with favorable manufacturing expenses of $100 million. Other was $100 million unfavorable due to foreign exchange. This totals to GME's EBIT adjusted of negative $300 million for the first quarter of 2012.","On Slide 14, we show GMIO's EBIT adjusted for the past 5 quarters, including the equity income from our JVs. In the first quarter, GMIO posted EBIT adjusted of $500 million. ","Moving to the bottom of the slide, GMIO's revenue from our consolidated operations was $6.1 billion, up $900 million from the prior year, due to increased volume of $400 million, favorable vehicle mix of $300 million and favorable pricing of $200 million. GMIO's EBIT adjusted margin from consolidated operations decreased 1 percentage point versus the prior year to 2.1%. Now China JV net income margins decreased 1.8 percentage points from a strong performance in the first quarter of 2011 to 10.2% in the first quarter of 2012. ","Now GMIO production for the quarter was up 101,000 units from the prior year, with increases in both consolidated operations and our joint ventures. Market share in the region was 9.4% for the first quarter, a year-over-year increase of 0.1 percentage points, driven by an increase in China market share from 13.6% to 15.1%.","On Slide 15, we provide the major components of GMIO's $100 million decline in EBIT adjusted. The impact of volume was $100 million favorable due to increased production in our consolidated operations as we previously discussed. Mix was unchanged for the quarter. The effective price was $200 million favorable. Costs were unfavorable $400 million due to $100 million product recall, $100 million increase in manufacturing expense and $100 million increase in material content for major product programs, combined with several other minor items. Other was unchanged for the quarter. This totals to GMIO's first quarter 2012 EBIT adjusted of $500 million.","Turning to Slide 16. GMSA's EBIT adjusted was $100 million for the first quarter of 2012, essentially equal to the performance from a year ago. Revenue was $3.9 billion, also unchanged from last year as favorable pricing and mix offset a decline in volume and unfavorable foreign exchange. The EBIT adjusted margin in the region was 2.1%, down 0.2 percentage points from the prior year. GMSA's production was 203,000 units, down 28,000 units from the first quarter of 2011. ","On Slide 17, we look at the components of the year-over-year performance in South America. Despite the production decrease, the impact of volume rounded to 0. Mix was favorable $100 million due to a shift in Brazil to our higher-margin vehicles such as the recent launched Cruze and S10 pickup. Price is favorable $100 million, largely related to increases in Venezuela and Argentina. Costs were unfavorable $200 million, driven by manufacturing increases of $100 million and several other smaller items. Other rounded to $100 million favorable due primarily to a gain on our purchase of GMAC Venezuela.","This totals to an EBIT adjusted of $100 million for the South America region in the first quarter. However, the results for South America indicate that our new products in the market have begun to turn around profitability in the region. We still have key launches remaining for the year, including the Cruze hatchback, the Sonic, the Spin and others that are on track and will contribute to our product renaissance in South America, along with the additional cost actions that we are pursuing. ","Turning to Slide 18, we provide our walk of automotive free cash flow for the first quarter of 2012, as well as the prior year. After adding back non-controlling interest, preferred dividends and undistributed earnings allocated to Series B preferred and subtracting GM Financial, our automotive income was $1.2 billion for the first quarter of 2012. We had a non-cash special item of $600 million. Depreciation amortization and impairment was a $1.4 billion non-cash expense. ","Working capital was a $700 million use of cash due primarily to seasonal increases in inventory and accounts receivable, partially offset with an increase in accounts payable. The working capital in 2011 was impacted by a termination of in-transit financing that we've discussed in prior earnings calls. ","Pension and OPEB cash payments exceeded expense by $200 million in the quarter. Other was negative $100 million due primarily to non-cash P&L items. This totals down to automotive net cash provided by operating activities of $2.3 billion. After deducting capital expenditures of $2 billion in the quarter, our automotive free cash flow is $300 million, a $2.2 billion improvement from the prior year.","On Slide 19, we provide a summary of our key automotive balance sheet items. We finished the first quarter with $37.3 billion of total automotive liquidity, consisting of $31.5 billion in cash and marketable securities, $5.9 billion of undrawn credit facilities. ","At the bottom portion of the slide, our book value of debt and Series A Preferred Stock are $5.4 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively. U.S. qualified pension plans are underfunded by $12.9 billion on our balance sheet. Our non-U.S. pensions are underfunded by $11.6 billion at the end of the first quarter and the OPEB liability is $7.3 billion. ","Slide 20 provides a summary of key operational metrics related to our financing activities. GM Financial reported their results earlier this morning, and we'll be holding an earnings conference call at noon. Our U.S. subprime financing in the first quarter has increased over the prior year to 8.2% and once again exceeds the industry average. Our U.S. lease penetration of 12.6%, lower than the prior year, due to lower numbers of returning lessees. Lease penetration in Canada is at 8.9%, a full 5 percentage points higher than the prior year. ","GM new vehicles as a percentage of GM Financial originations is 45%, and GM Financial's percentage of GM's U.S. subprime and leasing is 23%. Both metrics are higher than a year ago, as GM Financial continues to grow its financing business and its importance to GM. ","GM Financial again saw strong credit performance in its loan portfolio with annualized net credit losses of 2.5% for the quarter, 1.5 percentage points better than the prior year. GM Financial's earnings before tax were $180 million -- $181 million for the first quarter of 2012. ","Before we move on, I want to mention that GM Financial just launched its commercial lending services business last month. This gives our dealers in the U.S. another option for their floor plan financing and insurance, capital, real estate and construction loans and cash management programs. We will update you on the performance of this piece of the business in the future quarters.","Before I turn it back over to Dan, I want to share a few points regarding the 2012 outlook on the next slide. As we stated in our sales call a few days ago, we now expect U.S. light vehicle sales for the year to be in the 14 million to 14.5 million. This is a 0.5 million unit increase from our prior projection. Also, due to the timing of our scheduled full-size truck plants downtime, we expect the financial results for both Q2 and Q3 at GM North America to be in the same range as what we reported for Q1. Specifically, we expect Q2 and Q3 full-size pickup and SUV production to be lower in the second and third quarters than it was in Q1. ","Finally, we continue to examine the effects of taxes in the many countries in which we operate. We now believe the effective tax rate will be greater than the 10% we've previously discussed. Going forward, we will likely have a rate similar to what we had in Q1, which was 12% to 13%, excluding the effects of special items. We may still experience some tax rate volatility within a specific reporting period due to variations in country-specific profitability and tax liability. ","With that, I'd like to turn it back over to Dan Akerson for his summary and closing remarks.","Daniel F. Akerson","Thanks, Dan. I'll keep my closing comments very brief because I think the highlights speak for themselves. Sales increased, so did our pricing power. EBIT adjusted and EBIT adjusted margins both improved, and so did our cash flow. Going forward, our plan is to deliver results like this but with a bit more balanced scorecard. That means all 4 regions must become solidly and reliably profitable. ","I believe we'll get there. It's going to be purely a function of execution, execution on process improvement and complexity reduction and flawlessly executed vehicle launches. All told, we have more than 20 major product launches in 2012. The Cadillac ATS and XTS in the North America will be entering segments where we don't compete today, and the ATS represents a serious challenge to the hegemony of the BMW 3 Series in the compact luxury segment. ","In Europe, we're introducing the Opel Mokka, a small crossover, which will feature 2 small gasoline engines and diesel engines, equipped with stop-start technology and will be available with state-of-the-art comfort and safety features. ","At IO -- GMIO, one of the major launches is the Chevrolet Sail in India. The Sail is the first passenger car developed by Shanghai GM and the Pan Asia Technical Automotive Center.","Major global launch is the new Chevrolet Colorado, which based -- which is based on an all-new midsize truck architecture developed by GM Brazil. Eventually, it will be on sale in 60 markets around the world, including the United States. ","All this product activity should lead to growth. And with our new business model and significantly lower risk profile, it will improve our profits and our cash flow generation as well. ","Thank you, and now we'll open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Johnson, Barclays Capital.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just want to get in 2 questions, Europe and then just a bit -- we've heard a lot in the sales calls about fleet strategy. I would like to hear it from the leadership. First of all, in Europe, it looks like pricing was maybe a little bit better. Can you give us a sense of where you are on dealer and company-owned inventories? Are those getting in better shape? And then before we get any hopeful labor cost and capacity and other restructuring, should we be thinking about this level for Europe or can it improve from here or was this somehow unusually better?","Daniel Ammann","On the inventory question, I'd say that we ended the first quarter still with more inventory than we'd like to have, and we will be working that down over the balance of the year. But our objective is to work a good chunk of that down through the second quarter. And as it relates to some of the cost actions and so on, we're making progress, I would say, sort of week to week on the cost front. Not everything will come with some big announcement, but there's a lot of activity and progress going on in the background. There's year-over-year cost improvement. There's quarter-to-quarter cost improvement, but there's still more work to do on that front.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And on North America, you ran about 26% fleet mix. One competitor who disclosed it was more like 37% but would actually talk about their execution on the commercial side. Is fleet about where you want it? Do you see an opportunity to penetrate segments there or you're deliberately holding back? And in addition, if we kind of look at the gap between very strong retail pricing levels and maybe less overall in price when you get to the segment results, is there pricing pressure at all that's emerging in the fleet segment due to some competitor actions?","Daniel F. Akerson","Yes, let's talk about overall in general. I think that on a go-forward basis, we'll see our fleet penetration continue to come down marginally from 26%, down into the low 20% to 23% ranges. We launched new products that have traditionally been daily rental fleet products, like the new Impala that was mentioned earlier, which is a pretty high penetrating fleet. At the same time, we're trying to improve our mix between daily rental and commercial, government fleet. And that competitor that you mentioned has been very, very aggressive, obviously, in that segment of the fleet business. And that is putting a bit of price pressure specifically on the commercial and government fleet business but, obviously, that's something we're going to continue to work to grow and supplant some of the daily rental. With that said, unlike past years, the overall fleet business is reasonably profitable. Obviously, the mix is not as rich as retail, but it certainly isn't a loss making part of the business as it was in the past.","Daniel Ammann","Maybe the only thing I'd add to that is in the -- what you're seeing, to some of the extent, is the effect of the daily rental caps that we put on our new vehicles that we're introducing to preserve the residual values. And as the old Impala rolls off and the new one rolls on or same for Malibu, same for some of the Cadillac product, you're going to see those caps kick in and we're going to be very disciplined about what goes into the daily rental business. And that's part of what you're seeing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Peter Nesvold, Jefferies.","H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Maybe one quick question on the quarter and then maybe a bigger picture question. So on the quarter, when I look across all the different segments' costs year-over-year, it seemed to be going up or it seemed to be a headwind, volume mix pricing generally working in your favor. Dan, you kind of addressed them individually in the segments as we went through, but is there something bigger picture that's happening, whether it's materials inflation, whether it's labor inflation that's sort of the common thread there?","Daniel Ammann","No, I'd say, I'd characterize it as follows, which is for the whole company for the first quarter, fixed cost were basically flat year-over-year, excluding the $200 million of pension income headwind we have in North America. So as we described on the earlier call, last quarter call, we're going to have an $800 million headwind this year as a result of lower pension income. So you got to take that into account, number one. Number two, I'd say material pricing as a general matter is essentially flat year-over-year, and that's generally across the board. We have additional material content coming in as a result of richer content on new vehicles. That was about $200 million for the whole company. And then we did have a handful of sort of more onetime type items. We had over $200 million of retroactive policy and warranty adjustments here in North America, and we had about $100 million associated with the product recall in IO. So there were some items along those lines that are less recurring in nature, if you like. Then there's $100 million restructuring charge here in North America associated with the special trades SAP program. So you've got to break it down into those items to understand it. In IO and in South America, there has been some inflation from a manufacturing cost point of view. So those would be the main elements.","H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then one quick strategy question. The JV strategy, so your news release is out, a possible tie-up with Isuzu. And certainly, I don't expect you to comment specifically on that situation. But coming off the heels of the Peugeot tie-up recently, it seems like there's been some kind up of change in strategy here to go back to strategic alliances globally. And I'm hoping you could just talk bigger picture about what GM hopes to accomplish with further tie-ups. Are you not big enough on your own to accomplish a lot of the objectives that you're seeking with some of these?","Daniel F. Akerson","Let me talk about that. Yes, we are big enough to handle it on our own. Second point, don't always believe what you read.","H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Understood on Isuzu. But -- okay, I mean, I'll just leave it at that.","Daniel Ammann","The only thing I'd add, third point would be we have a lot of work to do on the PSA alliance. We have a lot of people working on that. We're making good progress. The teams are working well together, and that's where we're focused right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley.","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I'm glad I don't have to ask the Isuzu question then. Question about 4Q seasonality in North America. I mean, last couple of years, it seems to show this kind of big dip in the fourth quarter. It's been kind of new to the industry. But given the pace of the shutdowns and the disruptions in the middle part of the year, can you help us provide us a little bit of a hint on what the year end might look like relative to this ballpark $1.7 billion North America run rate for the middle of the year? That's my first question. I just have one follow-up.","Daniel Ammann","Okay. So we're not providing any specific commentary on the fourth quarter at this point other than, I'd say, that the seasonality that we've seen in the last couple of years is getting a bit disruptive this year, quite obviously, as a result of the truck plant downtimes. So I think, while it's too soon to tell what's going to happen in Q4 because it's going to be a function of the industry and everything else, the cadence that we've seen for the middle 2 quarters of the year is going to be a little different this year.","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And then just a quick follow-up on China. Can you update us on your progress of getting back to 50-50 with SAIC?","Daniel F. Akerson","Yes, it's complicated by -- you have both the city and the provincial government review, which is through. And then you have the national policy review, their equivalent of the SEC, is where I understand it resides today. So both boards have reviewed it and passed it to the provincial\/city review, and now it's at federal. So we've had both, I would describe as productive and cordial discussions dialogue. And just like in our own country, you wait for the government to -- and they're not on the same clock we are. That's kind of the way I put it. So we expect some action here in the near term, and we'll let you know as soon as we have any further developments.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Dan, appreciate the detail walk on North America, but one item that you guys put out in your release is the capacity utilization number. And for North America, it was 103%. I was just curious if there were any inefficiencies of running over 100% or any impact in your cost that maybe if you were to build a little bit more capacity, you can get that closer to the mid-90s or back to 100%, that would be better? I'm just trying to understand if there was any penalty in the quarter for premium freight or overtime or anything that would have depressed the quarter?","Daniel Ammann","No, I think we're quite comfortable running at that level of capacity utilization and even higher. If I was looking at the -- and Chuck can chime in here as well, but if I was looking at the Q1 North America result relative to last year, you obviously have the $1.7 billion versus the $1.3 billion. But you got to take into account the $100 million restructuring item, the $200 million policy and warranty retroactive adjustment and the $200 million of pension income headwind when you\u2019re looking at that comparison.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And if we were to think about this and to follow-up on the earlier question. I mean, you guys have given us sort of the pressure you're going to see from the changeover from the GMT 900 in the second and third quarter, which, I guess, is helpful, but it's kind of giving us the punitive guidance for the next couple of quarters. I mean, obviously, launching new products usually creates some really good upside in revenue and profits. I mean, is there no way you can give us some directional guidance as to looking at the fourth quarter as maybe saying it will be similar to what we saw in the first quarter x those items you just mentioned? It seems like you're giving us the negative without the positive.","Daniel Ammann","We're not going to give further perspective at this point in terms of Q4 specifically. But I'd make a more general comment which is, we are clearly on the -- the vehicles that we've recently launched, think about the Sonic, the Verano, the Malibu Eco that's just kicked off here, we're doing really well. And we're really pleased with how those are performing. Where we've had a little bit of drag has been more on some of the products that are getting longer in their life cycles. And we have a very significant turnover of product coming here in North America, I think 70% of the total portfolio over the next -- this year and next year and, obviously, a lot of that is in our very profitable segments as well. So we have the refreshed larger SUVs, the Lambdas, obviously, everything going on, on the truck front  2 critical new entries with the XTS and the ATS into the Cadillac portfolio, into really high-volume lucrative segments for us there. So there's a lot of good activity coming on the launch side. Too early to put definitive perspective around that from a quantitative point of view, but a lot of good things to come over the next 12 to 24 months.","Daniel F. Akerson","Qualitatively, I would add though that this discipline you're seeing with respect to pricing incentives and whatnot and what it does for our residuals in terms of how we're handling our fleet is it bodes well. When you look at Sonic, it's got -- bring in about $1,000 more per car in that segment. And I think within 2, 3 months of introduction, we were second in the segment. Same thing is happening with Verano. So these new products that are rolling out that are a bit up-contented, we are able to hold price and get a premium. And so when you look into these new product launches, there is a reason for the discipline that you're seeing that sometimes it's difficult to remain as disciplined as we have been when you look at some of the activity of our competitors.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's very helpful. And then just lastly, on Europe, I mean, just thinking about the restructuring there in the context of what's happened in North America. I mean, the big driver of the change in North America was really headcount reduction and the retiree health care deal. A lot of that because you had a very old workforce in North America, and you were able to take advantage of the attrition curve. As we think about the workforce in Europe, what sort of -- what is the age parameters or the population demographics over there? And would it be possible over the next couple of years, and it's probably going to take time, to run through that attrition curve similar to what you did in North America and maybe run special buyouts or Special Attrition Programs over in Europe to really fix that part of the business structurally going forward?","Daniel Ammann","You're going to see headcount coming out on a continual basis along the general approach that you described. I mean, we're -- there's a fixation on plant closings and so on, but those take time and are challenging as demonstrated across the industry. But at the same time, we're continuing to focus very much on matching our manned capacity to demand and adjusting headcount within the parameters along the lines of what you identified to get there as soon as we can.","Daniel F. Akerson","I think the demographics are quite similar to what we saw in North America. That being said, we still have not matched production to demand. And I think in the -- before the next quarter's report, you'll see some more information coming out from the company. We're not in a position to comment further today, but I will say what we said in the past, we have engaged all parties at specific levels and are in dialogue all the time.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And not to get into the details on that though, if we look at the attrition curve in the U.S., it was really sort of in the 5% to 7% range naturally, if we went back to the mid-2000s. Would we think about the same kind of thing in Europe, and then maybe as you did in North America get that up to something that could be closer to 10% over time?","Daniel Ammann","Yes, I don't have the specific numbers in front of me. But I'd say it may not be quite as advanced as what it was here but same general direction.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rod Lache, Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","There was a question earlier about whether you can sustain this run rate for Europe or whether the destocking that you commented on implies further deterioration. I was hoping you can maybe just comment on that. And Latin America, just separately, it sounds like you believe that you've turned the corner. And just wondering if you think that you can maintain profitability at this point going forward or whether some of these launches are large enough that there should be -- there would be some volatility in terms of the earnings that we should be expecting?","Daniel Ammann","Yes, as it relates to Europe, there's obviously a different impact between company-owned inventory and dealer inventory. I'd say it's the company-owned inventory that we'll be most significantly working down over the next quarter or two. So obviously, the other piece of the equation is what's happening from a sales perspective and we'll obviously see how the market unfolds there. And then on South America, I'll ask Chuck to comment on that.","Chuck Stevens","Yes, right. I would say, encouraging Q1 results, I mean, from an operating perspective, we were slightly above breakeven. So as mentioned, we started to get some traction. But I would say going through the year, there's a lot of challenges we still need to manage through, and I would suggest some volatility from a quarter-to-quarter perspective in earnings. We've got some restructuring activities to take care of. As we head through the summer, we've got a number of product launches that are cadenced out through the rest of the year. FX recently has, in Brazil, specifically, has turned into a bit of headwind that we're going to have to manage through. And then continued demand on legacy products, as we roll over into the new portfolio, is going to be a challenge that we're going to have to manage through. The good thing on the new launched products, good market acceptance, good profitability, better than the vehicles that they replaced. We're kind of working our way through that transition right now. We're about 30% to 40% of the portfolio. Our new products, by the end of the year, will be in much better position. So I think volatility this year but kind of the core underlying performance of the new products is going to put us on a decent glide path by the end of the year.","Daniel Ammann","We expect to leave the year in -- at a relatively good run rate.","Daniel F. Akerson","We've launched 4 of the 9, and all 4 of those have gotten good acceptance, good traction. So I agree, foreign currency is a bit of headwind, and you do have just the transition and the launches. So there's a lot of moving parts in South America, but it's a lot better place than it was 6 months ago.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And Dan Akerson, you just came back from China, it sounds like. And there's been a lot of talk in the market about pricing deterioration in that region. I was hoping maybe you can just comment on what you guys are seeing. Is that a factor behind that net margin deterioration that we see on that slide on the China business or was that something else?","Daniel F. Akerson","Well, I think we -- just to give you a slice. If you look at the end of year and through first quarter, first quarter, overall market was down about 2%. We were up, I think, 8.5%, 8.7%, almost 9% -- call it 8.5%. And we actually gained market share in China at just over 15%. That's through the quarter, which was up almost 2-plus percent. So there is pricing pressure. But the thing that we find really good is the products are selling, and we've got new ones coming out. As I mentioned, Baojun is out -- in the first quarter. I do think there was a bit of anomaly. I don't know if I would say we've got kind of true run rate gain of a couple of market share points. But because the first quarter is traditionally stronger for light commercial vehicles, and Wuling had a very strong first quarter. That being said, so did Chevrolet and so did Buick. We hit an all-time sales record for the quarter. Price is a factor, but I just think our products are being very well-received. If you step back from it, our biggest challenge, I think, is to continue to play offense. That's how we're going to hit this. We want to hit a 5 million unit run rate coming out of '15 going into '16. And that was an ambitious goal we put out last year. But if you look at where we are, where we were, where we are today, that is achievable, not for certain, but it is achievable. So there are many variables in here, mix, volume, price, but I would say China is off to a pretty good start this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Denoyer, Wolfe Trahan.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Quick question on the 1,400 skilled trade buyouts that you had in the quarter. Can you give a sense of what the payback period might be on that?","Chuck Stevens","Yes, the run rate savings associated with that, net of moving some people around, will be roughly $60 million to $70 million a year. So the payback is going to be a little over a year.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay. And then a quick follow-up on China in terms of the sequential or the year-over-year margin decline that you saw, of about 200 basis points. Can you give us a sense of how much of that was just sort of mixed with the new Baojun brand and how much was pricing?","Daniel Ammann","The first quarter of last year was an unusually strong quarter as well, so it's a little bit of a difficult comparison year-over-year. But I'd say, overall, there's been a couple of trends that have been underlying the China margins over the last few periods. One is the mix impact of bringing in Baojun, some of the costs associated with that launch, and the ongoing mix change associated with it. Secondly, there has been some element of pricing pressure at different points in the market. And then thirdly, the margins we're reporting here are net income margins and are, therefore, after-tax and have been impacted by some tax increases. So each of those plays some part.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Can you give us sort of the change in tax rate?","Daniel Ammann","It's a whole bunch of different components of taxes in different ways. I don't have a number off the top of my head, but it's a reasonable portion of what you're seeing.","Daniel F. Akerson","As an adjunct, Cadillac was up 79% year-over-year. That's good. But it's only 30,000. It's on a small base, but 30,000 units is a lot. And we're importing a fair number of those, exporting into China. We\u2019re also building a fair number. But if Cadillac starts to build there, we'll have better margins than we do today.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Are there any specific sales targets for Cadillac there?","Daniel Ammann","Yes.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Can you say them?","Daniel F. Akerson","It's our goal over a 3- to 5-year period, and I would say on the longer end of that, to produce as many Cadillacs on the same order, I won't say the same number. So we produce about 180,000 here in the U.S. a year, and we'd like to be in the 150,000 to 180,000 range within the next 3 to 5 years. So I don't have a specific goal for next year, but we're not -- we're serious about this. And we think we'll have the right products for that market as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Ceraso, Credit Suisse.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I wanted to dig in a little bit in North America on Slide 11, where you show volume plus $600 million, mix minus $300 million. If I put those together, volume and mix, it adds $300 million. Relative to the 76,000 or so increase in units, that seems like a pretty small contribution. So I'm wondering what that is, and I'm guessing there's a few things here. Could wholesales have been lower than production? Maybe there's some issues with the mix, within the mix. Maybe it's the aftermarket thing you mentioned. Is it rental accounting? Why does the contribution level seem thin relative to the pretty meaningful increase in volume?","Chuck Stevens","Yes, talking specifically about volume, to start with, obviously, the biggest driver of the volume increase was full-size pickups and full-size utilities. That drove a fairly significant number. On the mix side, as previously mentioned, quarter-to-quarter, full-size pickups and full-size utilities were up a bit 30,000 units or so year-over-year, but more significantly was the increase in Sonic, Cruze and midsize vehicles, which drove the mix deterioration.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Those have a positive dollar contribution?","Chuck Stevens","Yes, they do.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Was there anything with regard to maybe wholesales being lower than the change in production or any of the other rental accounting or anything else like that?","Chuck Stevens","No, on a Q1-to-Q1 basis, there was very little factory unit sales adjustment related to daily rental accounting.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And I have a follow-up on the cash flow. I thought that as you guys built inventory and production was rising that you would generate cash from working capital. Here in the quarter, you had a use of cash and working capital. So I'm wondering about that, and then just what to expect on a go-forward basis if you're talking about North America profits being flat from quarter-to-quarter. Is cash flow flat or is there some way that cash flow gets better than what you did here in Q1?","Daniel Ammann","I'd say the way to think of our cash flow or the way to think about the working capital piece of it specifically is there's fair amount of seasonal move in working capital. Q1 is typically a cash -- a working capital cash outflow coming out of the holiday shutdown and building inventory and production into the first quarter. So Q1 tends to be an outflow. Q2 and Q3, you tend to recapture that, and then Q4 tends to be roughly neutral. And again, that's just a general perspective. I would say that we have been working recently on working capital as a specific focus. I think we have opportunity within working capital, and we are going after that on a pretty specific basis. So that's a more general comment. But in terms of the quarterly cadence, think about Q1 as an outflow, 2 and 3 to recapture it and 4 tends to be flat.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And is CapEx a little bit high relative to what you're going to do on a full year basis?","Daniel Ammann","No, CapEx, we've indicated around in the range of $8 billion for the year, and we ran $2 billion in Q1.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli of Citi.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Last quarter, you provided an outlook slide with the different arrows for metrics. I was hoping you can update us on some of those, particularly costs, excluding the pension. I think you've reclassified some of the cost components, as well as just the price versus mix on a full year basis and market share globally.","Daniel Ammann","Yes, sure. So I'd say industry outlook, no real change there. Market share -- global market share, we were down from 11.4% to 11.3% in the first quarter. We'd indicated flat for the year. I'd say there's the one element on here where we think there's probably some potential pressure, driven by North America what we've seen in Q1 here. So a little risk around that. Volume, we continue to see favorable for the year. Price, we continue to see favorable, and I think demonstrating that through Q1 here. On the mix side, no real change in perspective there. On costs and, again, this was excluding the pension income, through Q1, as I said, we have basically flat fixed costs, basically flat material and freight -- material pricing and freight. We expect on a general basis to be in and around that for the year. There will be some variability on the fixed cost side as we move through some of the plant changeovers and things like that. There will be some cost incurred there, but I wouldn't say there's a fundamental change on that front. And then CapEx, as we've indicated, will be up. The thing that we've changed in terms of classification versus what we showed you in Q1 is moving the material cost increases associated with new product programs and the price increases associated with those new product programs. What we've done previously was net those 2 together, and that would show up in mix, taken it out of mix and put it into price and cost from a material perspective. And so the net of those, we expect to be positive for the year. So we're getting more price than we're adding material cost, which is obviously good. That's why the reason we've broken that out that way is to keep track of that. So as a result of that, you may get a little bit more negative on the mix side than you might have been thinking about just from a reclassification perspective.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Appreciate all that detail, Dan. And a quick follow-up, and I apologize if I missed this earlier. But the sequential improvement in the European losses, can you give us a rough walk on how you got there? Was it some of the inventory build or there's cost, may be a combination? Just a little color there would be great.","Daniel Ammann","Sure. Some of it was some restructuring. And so about 1\/2 of that -- about $150-odd million of restructuring, I think from memory. And there was some cost improvement sequentially. And some of it was the production versus sales component in inventory, so some of each of those.","Operator","Mr. Arickx, I will now turn the call back to you.

Please go ahead, sir.","Randy Arickx","Thanks, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us as we review the GM financial results for the third quarter of 2014. Our press release was issued this morning and the conference call materials are available on the Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via the Internet. Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the legend regarding forward-looking statements on the 1st Page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language.","This morning, Mary Barra, General Motors' Chief Executive Officer will provide opening remarks followed by a review of the financial results with Chuck Stevens, Executive VP and CFO.","After the presentation portion of the call, we'll open the line for questions from the analyst community. Marry Barra will then conclude the call with some closing remarks. In the room today, we also have Tom Timko, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer and Niharika Ramdev, Vice President, Finance and Treasurer, to answer some questions.","Now I'll turn the call over to Mary Barra.","Mary Barra","Thanks, Randy. I want to open today's call by thanking everyone who attended our Global Business Conference just three weeks ago. It was an important meeting because it was our first chance to talk to you about where we are going as a company. Together, we stated our clear purpose to earn customers for life and to become the most valued automaker.","We reaffirmed our near-term financial target and we said, we are targeting 9% to 10% on an EBIT adjusted basis, by early next decade. We believe in our capabilities. We have the talent, the technology and the resources to deliver products and experiences that people love. We have huge upside potential in our brands and with GM financial and we expect to deliver significant core operating efficiencies especially in product development and purchasing.","In know there is a show me attitude out there and believe me, it's a powerful motivator for me personally and for our team. We understand, we have real work to do and we are on it. We are changing behaviors to truly value every interaction with our customers and to build much strong relationships with our suppliers, our dealers and our other stakeholders across all of General Motors.","This kind of change happens person-to-person one day at a time, but it is beginning to happen. Our journey continues from a solid base. As you can see on Slide 2, we delivered 2.4 million units in the quarter up slightly from a year ago. In the United States, sales increased 8% in the third quarter compared to a year ago.","Sales in China, our largest market were up 14% looking at market share, our global share was 11.5% and we earned 17.3% of the market in the United States and 15.2% in China. On a revenue basis, we improve nearly $300 million thanks to improvements in North America and GM Financial, which offsets the clients and markets like Russia and Brazil, where the entire industry is facing headwind.","Turning to the bottom line, net income to common stockholders was $1.4 million or $0.81 per diluted share which includes a net loss from special items of $300 million or $0.16 per share. Looking at net cash, net cash from our automotive operations activities was $700 million compared with $3.3 billion in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by one extra regularly scheduled payment to suppliers in the quarter compared to a year ago and cash payments to suppliers and dealers to pay for recall, repairs.","Next, let's look at non-GAAP results. On an EBIT adjusted basis, GM earned $3.2 billion which is in line with our expectation. As you can see on the chart North America earned $2.5 billion in EBIT adjusted which is up about $300 million from a year ago. Europe continues to show operational improvements despite the headwinds in Russia.","Losses increased due to incremental restricting expense that overall results were ahead of expectation and GM South America, we essentially breakeven despite the difficult macroeconomic environment in Brazil and Argentina and the ongoing challenges in Venezuela.","In China, we earned an equity income of $500 million from our joint ventures, which is up 14% from a year ago. At GMIO including china and all other markets and at GM Financial results were about equal from a year ago. Finally our adjusted automotive free cash flow was negative $800 million compared with $1.3 billion a year ago.","Chuck Stevens will provide additional details in all of this in just a few minutes. If you turn now to Slide 3, we have summarized some of our key accomplishments from the quarter. They are organized around the 2016 financial targets and strategic opportunities that we presented at the Global Business Conference. So it is clear to see, how accomplishments are driving the business forward.","Starting in North America, we had an outstanding record with record 80 ps in an EBIT adjusted margin of 9.5%, that's an improvement an 0.2% compared with a year ago and it marks our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. Our performance was well balanced across different vehicle segment, but it was especially strong in pickups and SUV.","For example, our retail share of the large SUV segment is about 80% through the first nine months of the year. Also GM estimated share of the retail market for large pickups has now increased sequentially for three quarters in a row.","We expect to believe in more truck momentum as availability of the Chevrolet Colorado and the GMC Canyon growth during the fourth quarter. We are very excited about these launches. The trucks are getting great reviews in the press and to meet expected demand, we've already announced plans for third production shift at our Winfield, Missouri plant.","We expect it to come online in March. Sales of smaller vehicles have also been strong. In fact our compact cars are having their best sales year since 2005 and the new Buick Encore small crossover has been the best-selling vehicle in its segment for six months in a row, through September.","Looking next at China, we had record sales in the third quarter and during the first nine months of the year. Our margins continue to remain strong at 9.6%. Our market share in the quarter 15.2%, up 0.8% of a point from a year ago. For the year, we are up 0.2% to 14.7% on the strength of new products at all of our brands, especially Chevrolet and Cadillac.","We also passed a major milestone in September. 20 million cumulative vehicle sales. As we said at the Global Business Conference, we aim to grow faster than the market overtime. Our China joint venture are planning to invest significant from 2014 through 2018 to open five new manufacturing plant, this will give us the ability to support sales of just under 5 million vehicles annually.","During the third quarter, we added capacity for 300,000 vehicles and 450,000 engines. In Europe, we made several strategic moves during the quarter which we expect will help us return to profitability in 2016. The better managed through the difficult market in Russia and position ourselves with future success.","We have strengthened our leadership team. We are speeding up supplier localization at our St. Petersburg plant and we have adjusted manpower. In Spain, we began building the Opel Mokka at our Zaragoza plant, which we believe will help us meet market demand and improved profitability.","At the Paris Auto show we unveiled four new products and powertrains, that we expect will drive revenue and share growth. The biggest reveal was the fifth-generation Opel Corsa. It's the car first major redesign in 8 years and we are expecting an improvement of variable profit of about $900 per unit.","The new Astra which will follow next year is expected to deliver an even larger variable profit improvement of about $1,250 per unit together these models will represent about half of Opel\/Vauxhall's volume. Turning to Slide 4, let's next talk about Cadillac, where we have a new leadership team led by Johann Denison that lives and breathes, the luxury business and is prepared to make bold moves to accelerate the brands global growth.","The opportunity is enormous, the global luxury segment is expected to grow by 36% by 2020. In September, Johann, Dan [ph], [indiscernible] and I met with our Cadillac dealers and shared the framework of a plan to elevate the brand, so it's value in the market place matches the strength of its award winning new vehicle.","This includes investing in every customer touch point and expanding Cadillac portfolio with vehicles like the ATS Coupe, the ATS-L in China and the CT6, which will be the most technologically advanced Cadillac every built.","One of the CT6's most important innovations will be the new lightweight body construction technique that helps reduce fuel consumption and enhances driving dynamic and improved safety. It's an important statement about our intent to lead the industry and technology and innovation, but it's not the only one.","For example, this quarter we launched Powermat wireless smartphone charging in the Cadillac ATS Coupe and we continue to rollout 4G, LTE and high speed mobile broadband across our brands in the United States. We also announced that in 2017, the Cadillac CTS will be GM's first car and we believe the first in North America, with vehicle-to-vehicle connectivity, which can help mitigate or avoid up to 80% of crashes involving unimpaired drivers.","We also confirmed that Cadillac will introduce a technology call Super Cruise in that same timeframe. This feature will allow drivers to safely travel highway without touching the steering wheel or the pedals for extended periods in both stop and go traffic and at speed. This is just a glimpse of how we will use technology to make driving more fun, safer and more convenient.","There is a lot more coming. Another piece of good news came when the S&P upgraded GM and GM Financial investment grade status on the strength of our fortress balance sheet, our cash flow and our operating performance. The biggest impact of the upgrade will be filed at GM Financial, which will be able to raise capital at a lower cost that in turn will help us sell more vehicles and build customer loyalty.","Before I turn the call over to Chuck. I'd like to give you a quick recall update. As we have discussed before, we have worked very closely with our suppliers to accelerate the production and the shipment of repair part for the vehicles we have recalled this year and our dealers have done an exceptional job of fixing vehicles as quickly as possible.","With respect specifically to the ignition switch recall that we announced in the spring, our dealers have repaired more than 1.2 million vehicles which is more than half of the population still on the road. We now have a parts and kits available to repair all of the impacted vehicles. So we are stepping up our proactive outreach to customers, who have not yet brought their vehicles in for a repair.","Finally, the GM ignition claims resolution facility, which is been administered by Ken Feinberg began accepting claims on August 1, and will continue to accept claims until December 31. Let's now move to a more detailed review of the quarter with Chuck Stevens then we will take your questions. Chuck?","Chuck Stevens","Thanks, Mary. Now on Slide 5, I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter. Net revenue for the period was $39.3 billion compared to $39 billion in the prior year period. The $300 million increase includes an unfavorable $800 million associated with 93,000 lower wholesale volumes and an unfavorable $300 million primarily related to foreign exchange translation in South America and North America.","These factors were partially offset by $600 million favorable impact from net pricing primarily in North America. Favorable mix of $400 million across several regions and $400 million of [indiscernible] GM Financial. Net income to common stockholders was $1.4 billion for the quarter and nearly $700 million from the prior year.","This was driven primarily by the absence of the $800 million reduction from the redemption of, a portion of series A preferred shares during the third quarter of 2013. Partially offset by $300 million in special charges this quarter, which I will cover later.","Diluted earnings per share came in at $0.81 and our automotive net cash from operating activities was $700 million, down $2.5 billion on a rounded basis compared to 2013. The decrease was driven by one extra weekly payment cycle to suppliers in this quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago and cash payments related to repairing, recalled vehicles including cost to expedite parts to dealers.","For our non-GAAP measures EBIT adjusted was $2.3 billion in the third quarter and EBIT adjusted margin declined to 5.8%. the decrease from the prior year was primarily due to incremental restructuring expenses in Europe, incremental recall related expense and unfavorable foreign exchange.","Adjusted automotive free cash flow was a negative $800 million to the third quarter. a decrease of $2.2 billion on a rounded basis. The decrease was driven primarily by one extra regularly scheduled payment to supplier in the quarter compared to a year ago and cash payments to suppliers and dealers to pay for recall, repairs.","For the first nine months of the year, we generated $1.3 billion in adjusted free cash flow despite the higher recall related calls on cash. This would equate to about $2.3 billion of adjusted free cash flow for the first nine months excluding recall related cash payments. Slide 6, lists the special items for the quarter.","Again net income to common stockholders was $1.4 billion and a fully diluted earnings per share was $0.81. net income was reduced $100 million related to flood damage sustained at our technical center in Warren, Michigan and $200 million of assets impairments related to our Russian subsidiaries.","These charges had a $0.16 unfavorable impact on diluted earnings per share. On Slide 7, we show our consolidated EBIT adjusted for the prior five periods. At the bottom of the slide, we list the revenue, wholesale volumes and margins for the same periods. Our EBIT adjusted was $2.3 billion and our EBIT adjusted margin was 5.8% for the quarter, down 1 percentage point from the prior year period.","This include $200 million on incremental recall related expense. Our consolidated wholesale vehicle sales were $1.5 million in the third quarter 6% decrease from the prior year. Primarily attributable to challenging market conditions in South America and GM International operations and our global market share decreased 0.10 percentage point to 11.5%.","Turning to Slide 8, we explain $400 million year-over-year decrease in our consolidated EBIT adjusted. As I just covered global wholesales were down in total. However, the EBIT adjusted impact increased wholesales in North America, offset the impact of lower wholesales in the rest of regions.","Mix was also flat compared to the prior year. Price was $600 million favorable primarily due to recently launched vehicles in North America like the new full size SUVs. Full size trucks in the Middle East and price actions to offset foreign exchange and inflation impacts in South America. Costs was $800 million unfavorable primarily due to $700 million in material cost associated with recently launched products.","Incremental restricting expense of $100 million, recall related expense of $200 million. Partially offset by $200 million in material cost performance. Other was $100 million unfavorable primarily related to $200 million of unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset with $100 million of incremental equity income.","Slide 9 gives our year-over-year EBIT adjusted performance by segment. GM North America increased to $300 million to $2.5 billion including approximately $100 million of incremental recall expense. GM Europe decreased $100 million on a rounded basis driven by higher restructuring expense.","GM International Operations was flat compared to the prior year period as China growth was offset by challenging conditions and consolidated operations. The South American segment essentially broke even despite an increasingly challenging macro environment. GM Financial recorded $200 million in adjusted earnings before taxes, flat year-over-year.","Our corporate sector was $200 million loss, including recall related legal expenses of approximately $100 million. I will now review the key performance indicators for North America on Slide 10. For the third quarter of 2014, our total US market share was 17.3% and our retail share was 15.5%.","The success of our recently launched full size SUV's have driven retail share in the segment to 78% year-to-date, a 9 percentage point improvement and a nearly 15 percentage point increase in a share with a large luxury SUV segment. Our incentives for the quarter were 11.4% of average transaction price, which put us at 110% of the industry average.","This compares to incentives as 10.9% of average transaction prize and 114% of the industry average in the prior year period. The incentive growth was far less than our domestic competitors and less in the overall industry. Average transactions prices at all-time high for GM in the month of September.","Slide 11 shows, GM North America's EBIT adjusted for the most recent five quarters. At the bottom of the slide. At the bottom of the slide, revenue increased $2.3 billion to $25.8 billion driven by a wholesale volume increase of 59,000 units and strong pricing.","North America's EBIT adjusted margin was 9.5% for the third quarter. this represent the fifth consecutive quarter of sequential year-over-year improvement and EBIT adjusted margins excluding recalls. Our US dealer inventory increased to 754,000 vehicles up from a year ago, but down about 45,000 units from the second quarter.","This is equivalent of 81-day supply and at the end of the September one day less than the prior year period. GMNA wholesale vehicle sales were 834,000 units, 59,000 units higher than the prior year. North American market share was 16.8% in the quarter which was at the 0.10 percentage point increase from the prior year period.","The primary drives of $300,000 million increase in North America's EBIT adjusted are on Slide 12. Volume was $500 million favorable due to an increase of 59,000 units in wholesale vehicle sales driven primarily by full size pickups and full size SUVs. Mix was a $100 million unfavorable primarily due to country mix. As a large proportion of sales were attributable to Canada and Mexico this quarter compared to the prior year.","Price was $400 million favorable as the $800 million in favorable pricing from our recently launched vehicles was partially offset by $400 million in unfavorable pricing from our carryover products. There were no materials incentive stock adjustments or related impacts in price this quarter. cost was $700 million unfavorable primarily due to $600 million in increased material cost associated with recently launched products and $100 million of other.","Primarily due to incremental recall related cost including higher freight expense as we expedited shipping of recall replacement parts. This was partially offset with $100 million in material cost performance associated with carryover products. Other was $100 million favorable due to foreign exchange.","Turning to Slide 13, Europe reporting EBIT adjusted loss of $400 million for the quarter on a rounded basis $100 million increase from the prior year. Revenue decreased to $5.2 billion for the quarter primarily due to lower volume in foreign exchange primarily driven by Russia. Europe's wholesale vehicle sales for the quarter decreased 14,000 units to 273,000 units.","Opel\/Vauxhall sales were up about 4%, which was more than offset by lower sales in Russia. European market share decreased to 6.5% as we wind down the Chevrolet brand and deal with market declines in Russia. However, Opel\/Vauxhall brand experienced market share increases in 12 countries on a year-over-year basis.","On Slide 14, we provide the major components of Europe's $100 million decrease in EBIT adjusted. Volume was flat. Mix was a $100 million favorable driven primarily by the Opel Mokka. Price was flat. Cost was $100 million unfavorable driven by $200 million in incremental restructuring expense partially offset by $100 million in material cost performance on carryover products.","Other was a $100 million unfavorable due to foreign exchange. Primarily the Russia Ruble against the US Dollar. We now move on to GMIO's profitability for the prior five quarters on Slide 15. EBIT adjusted was $300 million including $500 million in equity income from our joint ventures.","At the bottom of the slide, GMIO's revenue from consolidated operations was $3.7 billion. So $1.1 billion decline from the third quarter of 2013, is primarily due to lower wholesale vehicle sales of 74,000 units associated with the line down of the Chevrolet brand in Europe and lower volume in [indiscernible] in India.","The net income margin from our China JV's came in strong at 9.6%. GMIO had wholesale vehicle sales of 159,000 for its' consolidated operations and 868,000 for the China JV's. year market share improvement to 10.4% driven entirely by share growth in China, which finish Q3 at 15.2% share.","And Slide 16, we provide the major components of GMIO's year-over-year performance. Volume was $300 million unfavorable driven by reduced wholesale vehicle sales and our consolidated operations. Mix was $100 million favorable, primarily attributable to lower proportion of Chevrolet Europe sales.","Price was $100 million favorable due to full size SUV's and full size pickups in the Middle East and cost was essentially flat year-over-year. Other was $100 million favorable driven by increased equity income in China. Slide 17 provides a look at GM South America's performance in recent quarters.","Despite of very challenging environment South America, we have delivered sequential improvements in EBIT adjusted as the year has progressed and we expected this trend to continue in the fourth quarter. at the bottom of the page, revenue decreased $1.2 billion year-over-year to $3.2 billion.","This is due to $900 million in lower wholesale volumes primarily in Brazil, Venezuela and Argentina as well as $300 million unfavorable impact primarily from foreign exchange. GM South America's wholesale vehicle sales were 218,000 units and 64,000 unit decreased from the prior year period and our market share in the region declined to 16.4%.","On Slide 18, we will look at the drivers of the $300 million decrease in EBIT adjusted. Volume was $200 million unfavorable driven by 64,000 lower wholesale volumes. Mix was $100 million unfavorable due primarily to lower sales in Venezuela. Price was $100 million favorable due to actions we have taken in Argentina to partially offset inflationary and foreign exchange pressures.","Cost was $100 million favorable and other was $200 million headwind due to foreign exchange in Argentina and Venezuela. This totals to essentially breakeven EBIT adjusted in South America in the third quarter. Slide 19 provides a walk of adjusted automotive free cash flow for the third quarter.","From our net income to common of $1.4 billion. We add back the impact of non-controlling interest in preferred dividend and then deduct GM Financial earnings to arrive at an automotive income of $1.3 billion. We had $300 million in non-cash special items and our depreciation and amortization was $1.4 billion.","Working capital was $2.7 billion use of cash driven primarily by an extra weekly payment cycle to suppliers, during the quarter compared to the prior year period along with increased inventory related to rental cars. Pension and OPEB cash payments exceeded expenses by $300 million in the quarter. other was an $800 million source of cash. A $200 million increase from the prior year. Primarily driven by an increase in joint venture dividends partially offset by deferred income taxes.","This totals automotive net cash provided by operating activities of $700 million, which also included approximately $700 million in recall related cash payments associated with large accruals, we made earlier this year. We expect similar levels of recall related cash payments in the fourth quarter with the remainder of the recall related cash payments following into 2015.","We have $1.6 billion of capital expenditures in the quarter giving us an adjusted automotive free cash flow of negative $800 million. We expect adjusted automotive free cash flow to be positive in the fourth quarter as much as negativity in the quarter was due to timing of working capital components.","Our liquidity position on Slide 20 decreased to $36.6 billion including $26.1 billion in cash and marketable securities. Debt increased to $7.3 billion and we continue to $3.1 billion in Series A preferred stock. As we look at rolled forward of our pensions plans primarily including updates to service cost, payments and foreign exchange.","The US qualified and non-qualified pension plans ended the quarter underfunded by $6.8 billion. Our non-US pensions were underfunded by $11.5 billion and our unfunded OPEB liability remain flat at $6.2 billion.","Slide 21 provides a brief summary of our auto financing activities. GM Financial release their results this morning and will hold their earnings conference call at noon. Our US Subprime penetration in the third quarter declined 0.2 percentage points to 7.6%. Our US lease penetration increased to 22.3% in the third quarter, which is just a few point below industry average.","Lease penetration in Canada improved 7.8 percentage points to 15.9%. GM is a percentage of GM Financial loan and lease originations rose to 74% and GM Financial percentage of GM's US consumer Subprime financing and leasing was 33% in the quarter. GM Financials annualized net credit losses remained consistent at 2% and their adjusted earnings before tax were $205 million for the third quarter.","Currently on Slide 22, we reiterate our focuses we begin to close off the year. We need to continue to execute our recent and upcoming launches and this includes ramping up, availability of our all-important midsized trucks here in North America. We will continue to drive improved core operating performance across the regions as we execute action plans to address challenging environments in places like South America and Russia.","We are confident, we are currently on or ahead of the plan to deliver the results, we promised earlier this year excluding the effects of recalls. We continue to believe that second half EBIT adjusted and EBIT margins will be higher in the first half of the year excluding recalls. The first half EBIT adjusted and margins were $4.3 billion and 5.6% respectively excluding recalls and in Q3, we delivered another $2.5 billion EBIT adjusted and margins of 6.4% excluding incremental recall related expenses.","Our third quarter results, further validates that we are consistently delivering on our plans. Now Mary and I will take your questions, after which Mary will have some closing remarks. Thanks.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen (Operator Instructions) our first question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, sir.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Couple things, one is I was hoping you might be able to just talk a little bit about within North America, the price and mix versus the contribution cost, if you had it all together for new products and carryover. It's about negative $200 million and you did mention that your investor meeting that you're expecting that to get better going forward. I think partly on some moderation of carryover pricing and partly on cost.","Can you just give us a sense of when we would start to see that some of the major drivers of that improvement going forward?","Chuck Stevens","Yes, sure, Rod. As we indicated back on October 1, when we looked into 2015 and beyond. We expect to accelerate material performance on carryover. Generally in the range of $800 million to $900 million of performance next year, which would be up $300 million or $400 million on a year-over-year basis and as we cycle through especially on a year-over-year compare, the incentive increases in full size pickups. We will expect that to moderate as well next year driven by a number of factors as we mentioned competitive launches at a couple of our competitors. So those will be the big drivers.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","So early next year, you would expect to see some moderation?","Chuck Stevens","That's our expectation to see it through the year, as we indicated on October 1, yes.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","Okay, and I noticed in the J.D. Power PIN data that there was something of an uptick in incentive spending in large pickup trucks recently like September and October. Is that just sort of tactical moves or is there some deterioration happening there and then, I was hoping you can also maybe touch on just China kind of broadly.","Obviously there is been some slowdown broadly in that market. Some players are suggesting that inventories have risen and obviously that some capacity growth. You know what's any update on the outlook for that region?","Chuck Stevens","Yes, talking about the talking centers first and overall incentives for us in September were up versus where we've been running in July and August and as you noted, it was very much a tactical move. We wanted to start and aggressively sell down, model year '14 to make room for model year '15.","If you look at overall Q3, our increase was below our domestic competition, Q3 versus Q2 and generally in line with the industry and on a calendar year-to-date basis. We are generally in line with spending levels as a percent of transaction price versus last year. So in no way a departure from incentives, discipline and aligning supply and demand that was very much a tactical move in the month September.","I would expect incentive spending to moderate and come down as we go through the fourth quarter. relative to china, growth has slowed in the last couple of months, but year-to-date still up between 9% and 10% in a year-over-year basis. We are still expecting something just short of 10% industry growth to somewhere around $24 million versus just over $22 million in 2013 and would expect to see that kind of level of growth may be somewhat muted going into 2015 as well.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, thank you.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Proceed with your question.","","Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays Capital","Sure. A couple questions, sort of housekeeping in North America then sort of Russia and helping us understand what part of Russia is in GMIO versus Europe. In North America, your wholesales seem to match your retails roughly year-over-year, but if we look at sequentially. You had they weren't kind of in line, can you kind of maybe go back and recap for us and kind of wholesale retail, mismatch. Last quarter versus this quarter then how to think about going forward?","Chuck Stevens","Yes on that specific question, Brian. We will get back to you on those details between second quarter and third quarter retails versus wholesales. Remember, you start with production, imports and we imported a fair few units less exports and then we end up with factory units sales and we adjust for whatever happens from a daily rental perspective, whether we are buying \u2013 since I would suggest that taking wholesales in the movement in dealer inventory should roughly triangulate with the changes in deliveries, but we can provide that that detail to you later.","Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, second question on North America. I think in the past you said that, same thing about North American margin that you said about Global EBIT margin that will improve second half over first half recalls. Is that still out there or is that just because their winnings [ph] in the end of the back year.","Chuck Stevens","Yes, I would suggest that EBIT margins in North America are going to be higher in the second half than they were in the first half, they'll be higher in the second half versus the second half last year will be higher in the fourth quarter versus the fourth quarter last year.","Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays Capital","","Okay and then finally, could you provide some more color on Russia. What was the headwind in 3Q, maybe where does it show up between GME and the wind-down of Chevy in GMIO's, is there any intra-region we got to be aware of there? And then how should we think about that going forward both the currency effect which might just show up in a special item and then just ongoing pressures there.","Chuck Stevens","First all of the Russia results are reported in GM Europe Chevrolet, Europe which is Western Europe results are reported in International Operation. So again, all of Russia is within the GM Europe segment. When you think about Russia on a go forward basis, I think you need to size the operation. You know, we are selling today roughly 125,000 units to 130,000 units significantly down year-over-year because of the industry.","Locally, we have about a quarter of $1 billion in country over the local fix costs. So when I think about where the challenge is or where the headwinds could materialize on a go forward basis clearly, it would be in foreign exchange depending on what happened with the Ruble and our ability to go price for that and offset it.","Number two, would be in volumes and how much further does the industry drop on a go forward basis, but I think the key message is overall exposure, overall magnitude of the business in Russia compared to the rest of GM Europe is relatively small.","","Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays Capital","","Okay and your PP&E base is fully depreciated yet and if you were to market it down duty to business prospect for currency or both. I assume, that would be a special item.","Chuck Stevens","We impaired the Russian assets in the third quarter $200 million charge as a special item.","Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays Capital","","Okay, thanks.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, just a first question on average transaction prices which are running better than I think most people unexpected despite the fears. One of the big supports is that, 3-year to 4 year old residuals are running about 5% higher than normal for the industry. I'm just curious if you can comment on where GM's 3-year to 4-year old residuals are running relative to current pricing and just trying to understand that versus where the industry stands right now because of big support for price [ph].","Chuck Stevens","Just broad strokes John. Our residuals generally compared to where the industries out in US, we have a gap of roughly 200 basis points to the industry on average across our portfolio. So you could apply, whatever numbers you have for the industry and were about 200 basis points less than on average from a residual perspective.","","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And you'd expect that gap to close as new products are launched over the next 1 years or 3 years.","Chuck Stevens","And as I've talked about before, in my former role that's one of the key initiatives that we have on a go forward basis, was to close that residual gap and if you size up that opportunity from a business model average improving the overall output of the business, that's $150 million to $200 million opportunity. Especially it manifests itself from a lease perspective and lower lease cost.","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","That's very helpful, then a second question as we look at Slide 19 and the working capital ahead of $2.7 billion. I know you guys are setting this extra week of payments to suppliers, is that really basically $2.6 billion trucks or is it that, you know a little bit less than that? I'm just trying to understand the magnitude.","Chuck Stevens","Yes, broad strokes that extra payment is worth about $2 billion and then there inventory impact that makes up the rest and a big portion of that inventory impact is the timing of rental repurchase, we buy them back and we didn't send them to the auction in Q3 and frankly, a certain part of that delay was, we had to hold until they were repaired because of recall issues.","So I would expect to see that unwind not necessarily all in Q4, will be opportunistic depending on used car values typically better in Q1 and Q4, but I would expect that to unwind over the next six months or so.","","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","And working capital should unwind in the fourth quarter?","Chuck Stevens","A good portion of that supplier payment, that extra payment should unwind. So started $2 billion and that will be driven largely by the level of production, that we have on a comparable basis, but certainly we'd expect a good portion of that to unwind in the fourth quarter, yes.","","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay and then on the European comments, is very much focused on profitability in 2016, the bulk of them is going to be closed at the end of this year and it sounds like, the Corsa and Astra launches will be fairly helpful next year. I'm just curious, if you could talk about sort of interim step in 2015 because that would be a breakeven year, in Europe just based on the cost saves and the product launches.","Chuck Stevens","I would only go this far and you'll stay tuned for January, but we would expect to see significant improvement year-over-year in Europe versus this year.","","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay and then just lastly, it looks like you guys brought back about $168 million box worth of shares in the quarter, what was that? I mean, I thought we won't look at any share buybacks here, but it looks like you executed share buybacks in the quarter.","Chuck Stevens","Yes, this is just any dilutive share buyback related to our incentive compensation program.","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay, but do you have the ability to buy back shares, if so desired into offset options?","Chuck Stevens","That's fundamentally what we did in the quarter, yes. For what we intended to do is make sure that our incentive compensation program did not dilute shares. Yes, we don't have options by the way.","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay, got you. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line Colin Langan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Colin Langan \u2013 UBS","","Any upside on the restricting cost for the year? I think in starting the year you said, it would be about $1.1 billion, there's only $700,000 year-to-date. Does that imply a big hit in Q4? Is that number likely going to come in lower?","","Chuck Stevens","","I would expect overall restructuring expenses to come in somewhat less than $1.1 billion, but I would also suggest that Q4, will be slightly higher than Q3 from a restructuring perspective two drivers to that Colin. Number one, Europe will be down slightly quarter-to-quarter, but we are also now starting to ramp up the restructuring costs associated with the Australian manufacturing.","So you know the combination of those two, a little bit lower in Europe higher and IO, the net result will be slightly higher restructuring cost in Q4 versus Q3, but overall I think we are going to be end up closer to a $1 billion, then we will $1.1 billion, when we get all set and done. You know a lot of that dependent upon the timing of employee acceptances of separation program etc., but that's our best thinking at this point.","","Colin Langan \u2013 UBS","","And you know, looking at GMIO ex-China. It looks like, it continue to decline about another $100 million, is there any restructuring plans there. I assume this year there was going to be some action, given the changes to the Chevy Europe strategy. Is there anything we should be anticipating coming down the line there to get that those probable [ph] losses to turn around.","Chuck Stevens","Yes, we continue to execute a number of plans. I just mentioned, the Australia manufacturing that's is going to be one big driver over time that will drive improved performance. There is been a number of actions taken by Stefan Jacoby and his team and all of the markets there to an improve the results and rate size, the business model.","And in fact, we are ahead of our plan there from restructuring their performance perspective and again similar to Europe without providing too much specific guidance on 2015. We would expect to see continued improvement in consolidated operations on a year-over-year basis. A lot of that obviously will be absence of losses associated with Chevrolet Europe, which is also factored into the IO results.","Mary Barra","I would just add Chuck, there is two components of that. there is, I'll say shorter term of just driving the efficiencies and make sure, we are managing the business effectively and then there is longer term, making sure we have the right portfolio, understand the customer and are going to market with the white product lineup that will take, have a little longer horizon.","","Colin Langan \u2013 UBS","","Okay and just one last question, tax rate was pretty low in the quarter. how should we be thinking about that going forward for the full year?","Chuck Stevens","Yes, for the full year I would say low 20% range.","Colin Langan \u2013 UBS","Okay, thank you very much.","","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question","Ryan Brinkman \u2013 JPMorgan","Obviously a lot of moving pieces in Europe these days, you know some better sale and share in Western Europe sharply lower sales in share in Western European sharply lower sales in share in Russian that currencies, sanctions, plant closure, Chevrolet exist as that stuff. So I'm wondering, is there anything you can tell us about the profitability of your underlying core Opel\/Vauxhall operations, outside of Russia, outside of [indiscernible], so that we can better gage the progress of your underlying continue to [indiscernible].","Chuck Stevens","Okay, so broad strokes. We lost overall Europe $300 million in the first quarter, $300 million in the second quarter, $400 million in the third quarter. the restructuring in each of those was roughly $200 million. Yes the core overall European operation about $100 million loss in the first quarter, the second quarter; $200 million in the third quarter.","A chunk of that really was related to the Porsche ramp down in the course of launch. So the core European business was running close to $100 million loss and that includes a fairly significant year-over-year headwind from Russia. So my takeaway and the way, I think about it Ryan is, the core operation in Opel\/Vauxhall performed reasonably well.","If you strip out the restructuring and factor in some of the headwinds we were facing from Russia.","Ryan Brinkman \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay, great and that housekeeping item on North America, Chuck you said you called that some higher trade expense related to the recall parts. Can you quantify that, it does sounds like there's $100 million non-material cost cut out, is all of that freight, that would be 40 bps?","Chuck Stevens","Yes, no. all in on around about $100 million of incremental recalls related expenses, significant portion of it, is premium freight and just expediting the shipment of recall parts as you know, not only the ignition switch but other recalls we get, 25 plus million vehicles we are trying to repair and take care of the customers as expeditiously as possible.","We are also doing significant outreach to a number of these customers above and beyond, what we have done in the past to try to encourage them, to bring their cars in and get them repaired, which is a factor and overall from a warranty adjustment perspective, there were adjustments and warranty but nothing material.","Taken all together, it kind of adds to on around $100 million or so.","Ryan Brinkman \u2013 JPMorgan","So I guess, what I'm hearing is that, full year adjusted for recall, you ran at 9.9% in the third quarter, which is typically a softer quarter relative to your 2016, well 10 points to zero [ph].","Chuck Stevens","I would say that, your map is correct and the third quarter ex, the impact of recalls, we ran it about 9.9%.","Ryan Brinkman \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay, great. Then just complete last question, on the breakeven results in South America, probably the biggest price today, I would say, if you will get a tend bit [ph] sideboard it doesn't look like you're taking much restructuring down there. You talked about [indiscernible], but nothing that rounds, that doesn't round down to zero. So if it's not restructuring and is a product cadence, which is of course a good thing, but that maybe it means, it's little bit more cyclical as oppose to restructuring.","Can you just tell us about sources and sustainability of those better results? Thanks.","Chuck Stevens","Yes, I think what you're fundamentally seeing is the impact on the cost structure of all the actions that we've been taking over the last two years. so this just wasn't a one-time time, starting back in late 2011, 2012. We have been consistently driving improved localization, material performance, logistic savings.","We've been working on manufacturing efficiency including plant closures and other actions, a more economic labor agreement, three year labor agreement at lower than industry average economies for instance and what we are seeing is, the impact of much lower cost structure and our ability to deal with the volatility in the market.","So it's a one initiative thing, it's a combination of everything that team is been executing over the last number of years.","Ryan Brinkman \u2013 JPMorgan","Great, thanks for the color.","","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Couple of questions for Mary. Mary at Ford Motor company's recent capital market stay, a couple of days before yours. They show the slide called automotive industry trends and one of the slides, part of the slide included technologies that would have disruptive impact on the business model of automakers. At the top of list was new mobility and car sharing.","I would love to hear your views on how GM views the threat or opportunity of car sharing and ride sharing, things like business model like Uber Lyft and you know guys have really arrived on your business in what you're doing and how much of a focus that is?","Mary Barra","Well, Adam. We \u2013 as I said at the Global Business Conference we think, there is going to be more change in the next 5 years to 10 years than there has been in the last 50 years, with a lot of different aspects. As it relates to technology, consumer preferences, what is happening from an environmental perspective, from a regulatory perspective and but we are not announcing specific things. We are working in all those areas because, they drive change, but they also drive opportunity and to strengthen the business.","The end of the day, there is going to be a point where people still need to get from point A to point B and well, we want to participate strongly in that, in a number of different models because I don't think it will be the same across the globe. So we are working on a number different initiatives specifically to talk, what we deem our call Urban Mobility and so we do see those changes coming and we see them as opportunities.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Great and then just final question, Mary. A lot of the topics and goals of your business conference through 2016 and of course beyond through the architecture consolidation period, well in the next decade involved a very large dependence on China, on Cadillac, on your global architecture. Which would of course imaging involve your most important strategic partner Shanghai Auto.?","I guess a question is, as you get more intertwined with Shanghai Auto or SAIC. Is the current structure enough to kind of handle and nurture that co-dependency that you have, you're obviously hugely important to them, they're important to you, but as you kind of become more and more co-dependent not less. Is there an opportunity or is there a discussions to take that, to kind of more formalized that perhaps you will say a strategic alliance or cross shareholding or something more or is the current structure satisfactory to you? Thank you.","Mary Barra","You know I would say the current structure is satisfactory, I think what's more important than even the structure though is the strength that we have in the partnership, the respect, how well we work together, how we look at the business and are driving it and looking at opportunities across the market place.","You know we have complete alignment and the importance of the three brands that we have from Cadillac, a Buick and a Chevrolet and then come to specific as you look at the Wuling partnership with [indiscernible] and the Wuling brand and so you know very well set out strategies have looked at the opportunity, Cadillac provides a great opportunity.","So again, I think the structure is fine and I think it's the strength of the JV is the way that we work together and look at how the market is going to progress and how we're going to participate in it.","","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thank you, Mary.","","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citi","Just a couple of follow-up questions. To Chuck, back to South America you mentioned, you expect to see continued momentum into the fourth quarter, do you expect you might be profitable in South America in the fourth quarter?","Chuck Stevens","What I indicated was continued improvement in the fourth quarter. we lost $32 million specifically in the third quarter, essentially breakeven and I would expect to see that improve and a couple of drivers of that, that's always with the caveat that we see, no further decay from a macro perspective, but based on the work that we have been doing with Venezuelan government. We were able to get currency releases back in the second quarter, not a huge amount but enough to enable us to order and produce a low level of vehicles in the fourth quarter and that will all other things being equal, really be the tailwind in Q4 versus Q3 going from essentially zero production to some level of production assuming all works out, so that's the biggest driver.","Again with the caveat that, there is no further deterioration from a macro perspective.","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citi","","Great and just to clarify, I think you mentioned Chuck in remarks that, you were at or ahead of the original expectations for 2014. Were you specifically referring to the original outlook for total EBIT adjusted to be modestly improved 2014 versus 2013?","Chuck Stevens","Yes, I was generally talking about the guidance that we provided back in January and I would base on the performance that we've seen counting year-to-date, we are certainly from an overall company perspective very, very much on plan and in certain areas ahead of plan, up for instance Europe versus what we expect to earlier this year's performing ahead of plan.","International operations both China and our consolidated operations and performing a bit ahead of plan, North America is very, very much unplanned and South America you know clearly is not performing as we expected given the macro conditions and as we look through the fourth quarter, if we achieve our objectives and what we expect to in the fourth quarter.","I think that, at the end of the day we are going to be very much on or potentially ahead of that plan.","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citi","","That's very helpful, Chuck and then just lastly, CapEx in the quarter looked a little bit light I think you're running lower than $7 billion to $8 billion. Any thoughts there and expectations into the fourth quarter? how we should think about just CapEx going forward here?","","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citi","","You know that's cash CapEx not accrual CapEx, so a lot of that has to do with, when you make the commitments in that and you know depending on the milestone. So on a year-over-year basis, last year we were $1.9 billion in the third quarter and cash CapEx, this year $1.6 billion. I would expect the cash CapEx to go up in the fourth quarter.","You can almost look at the cash CapEx to be at or slightly delay from when you actually launch the products because you go through PPAP and all the milestones and once everything is running, you know we start to pay the supplier. So I would expect, as we indicated earlier to spend in $7.5 billion range this year and I would expect Q4, cash CapEx to go up versus Q3.","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citi","","Terrific, that's very helpful. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Daniel [indiscernible] with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks for the additional disclosure on majors versus carryover pricing. In North America is there any way you can give us a rough estimate of what percentage of shipments were new products versus carryover in the quarter?","Chuck Stevens","We can get that information for you, but I don't have it off the top of my head. I mean, when you think about the new products that we are selling right now, that would be part of that calculation. Full sized SUV's, heavy duty pickup trucks, to the extent that we sold midsized pickup trucks in the quarter.","So I would think, that would be a relatively low percentage of our overall sales that obviously very big impact, when you think about the price impact on full sized SUV's and heavy duty pickups.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, got it and what products, if you can go into any detail or driving the negative pricing on a year-over-year basis on the carryover?","Chuck Stevens","You know largely, full sized pickups and again as you launch through last year launch cadence, we were in the third quarter last year, we were still in our launch cadence as we started in April with Ford Lane with one series of trucks and move through the launch cadence. So I would say, largely that's attributable to full sized pickups, not entirely but at least the majority of that $400 million negative net price is associated with large pickups.","Unidentified Analyst","So basically kind of the large pickups that you're selling this year that are GMT 900s versus.","Chuck Stevens","No, the new pickups because we cycle out of the launch, right?","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Okay, I see okay and then just one other question on IO. If you could talk about the trajectory, were on exporting K2XX products into region in Q3 and more on a long-term basis, can you give us an update on, now that Chevy Europe is basically not, you know they're getting no production from Korea anymore, what's the cap utilization situation in Korea and anything you can tell us on plans to address that?","Chuck Stevens","Alright, first on the K2, yes we do produce and ship to the Middle East and as we indicated, as we thought about second half and next year of the growth of that and the performance to that, in the Middle East, we thought was going to be a tailwind and it's starting to prove out to be that, we had favorable mix or pricing in the third quarter, associated with the launch of those products and we expect that to continue going forward.","Relative to Korea and Chevrolet Europe and we've talked about this before. Clearly, roughly 200,000 units out of the manufacturing build and Korea has created a capacity situation and we're aggressively, inactively working to deal with that overtime. So that's part of the actions that we are taking in international operations to ensure, that we've got the right industrialization and structural on this.","The demand capabilities in the region. So Korea certainly an area that we continue to focus and work on.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, appreciated. Thanks.","Operator","And our last question today comes from the line of Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Alright, made it under the wire. You know just two last ones from me. Number one is, the impact of well you've seen the Manheim come off a little bit, not dramatically but there has been moderation in used prices. You know can we understand how that impacts you from a leasing perspective and is that strictly kind of GMS thing or is there a lease sharing or residual risk sharing arrangement that impacts North America as well?","Chuck Stevens","Okay, first we execute leases today through GM Financial ally in US Bank through partners. There is no residual risk sharing, so the residual exposure stays with the finance company, whether it's GMF ally or US Bank.","Clearly depending on industry moves and what happens with our residuals vis-\u00e0-vis the competition the current at the market cost, can manifests themselves primarily in the OEM, as we need to hit competitive payment point. So that gets back to that residual gap that I was talking about before, but I would suggest from a residual risk perspective and I can speak specifically to GM Financial, we monitor that very closely mark-to-market on a quarter-to-quarter we look at the developments in the used car market and where we think those prices are going versus the ALG Automotive Lease Guide, which is how we establish the reserves to start with.","So we're at least in our view, are fully reserved in good shape as of Q3 of GM Financial.","Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Okay that's helpful and then just one last clarification on the, I guess it's Slide 12, GMNA there are indeed a lot of moving pieces here, but just as we kind of think about the make-up of the profit tailwind you're expecting in '15 and ultimately in '16. You know a gave a number of pieces. Clearly there is the cost saves of I guess $400 million year-on-year that you highlighted that's beneficial that potentially get that $700 million cost locked down.","Now you know did say incentives on carryovers, I mean could they be less of drag next year based on an reversing [ph] some of those hard headwinds on the trucks. I'm just trying to get a sense, really is, is the profit increase really driven by volume with these two things cancelling up or could we be in a situation, where price and cost all in is also positive year-on-year.","Chuck Stevens","Yes, on a carryover basis as we indicated from a pricing standpoint in 2013, '14 we've been running roughly negative 1% net price maybe a little bit more this year. We expect that to moderate next year from a net pricing perspective. So year-over-year carryover pricing will be a tailwind. We expect material cost year-over-year material performance to be a tailwind consistent with what we said October 1, obviously [indiscernible] will be a benefit overall, as we were bridging to 2016.","We're working to manage to flat fixed cost kind of environment and then our next-generation products as we launch, the next-generation Cruze, Malibu, Equinox. We expect those vehicles to be more profitable not only from carryover material cost, but just material cost performance in the vehicles as well as improved pricing versus the vehicles that they're replacing. So those were the big drivers.","Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Okay and so it does sound, I mean there is a lot of opportunity there. I mean, it sounds like the net of pricing in cost could be positive on a year-on-year basis?","Chuck Stevens","I would think so, yes.","","Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Okay, alright. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","","And there are no further questions at this time. Turn the conference back over to you.","Mary Barra","Great, thank you operator. Well, we've covered a lot of ground today. so I'm going to keep my remarks brief. In the last 10 months, that this leadership has been together. We spent a significant amount of time defining our goals for the future of GM and developing an integrated holistic plant.","At the Global Business Conference, we shared some of our key initiatives including a product development strategy, where we expect to deliver [indiscernible] vehicles and core operating efficiency. Today, we shared solid results that underscore our strong position in United States and China and we also showed resilience in the face of headwinds and other markets.","Taken together all of the ingredients are there for GM to create significant value for customers and shareholders overtime. Clearly, we have a lot of work ahead of us, but I expect to meet all of our goals for two reasons; first our integrated approach is designed to systematically and methodically build a more profitable General Motors.","We've recognized that it will take time, but we are confident we are on the right path. Second, we have never been more aligned as our leadership team are more focused as a company and I believe that's exactly what you need for long-term success and I look forward to the next opportunity to update you on our progress.","I appreciate your time today, thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude the conference call for today. we thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Have a good everyone."],"10257":["General Motors Co.

Welcome to the General Motors Company Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Wednesday, February 6, 2019.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Rocky Gupta, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations.","Rocky Gupta","Thanks, Dorothy. Good morning and thank you for joining us as we review GM's financial results for the fourth quarter and calendar year 2018. Our press release was issued this morning and the conference call materials are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast.","I'm joined today by Mary Barra, GM's Chairman and CEO; Dhivya Suryadevara, GM's EVP and CFO; and a number of other executives.","Before we begin, I'd like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language.","I will now turn the call over to Mary Barra.","Mary Barra","Thanks, Rocky, and good morning everyone and thanks for joining. We delivered very strong results in 2018 despite significant macro headwinds and a year in which we transition to our light-duty pickup truck. Our North American performance was very strong as we launched pickup trucks and crossovers. China results were strong despite the market environment and GMF delivered record result.","Let's get the full year 2018 numbers. Net revenue was 147 billion, EBIT adjusted was 11.8 billion, EBIT adjusted margins was 8%, our EPS diluted adjusted was $6.54. Our automotive adjusted free cash flow was 4.4 billion and this excludes the 600 million intention and prefunding payments and ROIC adjusted was 24.9% on a trailing four quarter basis.","As we shared in January, we expect to improve 2019 earnings and cash flow as we move into the next phase of our transformation, linear, more agile and better position to win. Our favorable outlook is based on a continued robust mix of new products around the globe continue cost efficiency and our business transformation initiatives. We believe that we will continue to be macro uncertainty but we expect to mange through them based on current market conditions.","Let\u2019s look at our performance in North America where we achieved a strong year including record fourth quarter earnings. In the U.S., we lead the industry and pickup sales for the fifth straight year and delivered more than a million crossovers. We will benefit from a full year of sales of our all new light-duty pickup and the cadence will continue with all new heavy-duty models.","We've revealed the Chevrolet Silverado heavy-duty yesterday in Flint and it will go on sales later this year along with the GMC Sierra heavy-duty. We\u2019re encouraged by the early success of the newly launched Cadillac XT4 SUV which already leads in it segment and we will also see a full year of sales of the new Chevrolet Blazer.","I would like to take a minute to update you on the business transformation actions we announced in November. We said, we would outline our product portfolio in capacity in North America with changing consumer preferences and transform the workforce to position the Company for long-term success. To-date, nearly 950 U.S. hourly employees have been placed in U.S. plants with products in key growth segment.","At GM Canada, we are supporting affected employees by working with local colleges on retraining as well as with dealers and more than 20 local employers who have expressed interest in hiring these experienced employees, and we will also provide outplacement services to be impacted salaried employees. Business of the strong business results we delivered last year, eligible hourly employee will share in this success through profit sharing payments later this month.","Moving to our international operations, the actions we announced earlier last year have placed GM Korea on a path to enterprise level profitability. However despite improved share in Brazil, the South America business remains a concern because of continued macroeconomic pressures. We are having productive discussions with key stakeholders to generate acceptable returns in the market. In China, we earned 2 billion in equity income last year and an increasingly challenging business environment. While we expect macro issues and flat industry performance will impact our results this year, we remain confident in the long-term position in China.","We expect China industry sales to be roughly in line with 2018 levels based on expected GDP growth and our current assessment of market condition. Last week, the government announced actions to stimulate the economy and the industry and we look forward learning more about the details on these initiatives; however, generally such report had a positive impact on the auto sector. Our aggressive product cadence continue this year in China with more than 20 new and refresh models from our Buick, Chevrolet, Cadillac, Baojun and Wuling brands. This includes 7 SUVs and first of our all new global family of vehicles.","I also want to mention the momentum at Cadillac. Last month, we announce that it will be GM's lead electric brand where we introduced our next generation EV technology. Through technology innovation and beautiful design, we\u2019re fully committed to restoring Cadillac to the luxury leader it should be. Last year, Cadillac posted another record year of global sales and we expect continued growth as we introduced a new model roughly every six months through 2021, including the XT6 SUV we unveiled last month.","Turning to our future mobility initiatives, we made real progress last year toward expanding our leadership in both autonomous and electric vehicles since first announcing our vision of a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion nearly 18 months ago. GM Cruise is deeply resourced to succeed with more than 1,100 employees and 5 billion raise in external capital from Softbank and Honda in 2018.","We have demonstrated our willingness to work with partners with common value and where a partnership can improve efficiency, capital spend and speed of development. For example, our AV collaboration with Honda builds on our existing EV battery and fuel cell work. On the EV front to encourage greater consumer acceptance of battery electric vehicles, last month, we announced the collaboration with three partners to establish the largest collective EV charging network in the United States.","In addition, Cruise continues to focus on the entirety of the autonomous vehicle ecosystem citing the partnership with DoorDash last month. So to recap, we had another year of strong earnings and volatile environment. We offset macro headwinds with fresh product in the right segments by staying intensely focused on cost and by making the business decision throughout the year.","So now I will turn the call over to Dhivya.","Dhivya Suryadevara","Thanks, Mary, and good morning everybody. We exceeded our expected 2018 results from both an EPS and adjusted automotive free cash flow perspective. Our performance was driven by strong execution across all of our operating segments including record fourth quarter results in North America and GM Financial. We were able to accelerate the execution of our transformation cost savings and started to see early benefits of these actions in the fourth quarter. With that, let\u2019s review the results in more detail.","As Mary mentioned, we generated calendar year results of 147 billion in net revenue, 11.8 billion in EBIT adjusted, 8% margins, 6.54 in EPS diluted adjusted and 4.4 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow excluding the impact of pension contribution. In the fourth quarter, we generated 38.4 billion in net revenue, 2.8 billion in EBIT adjusted, 7.4% EBIT adjusted margin, $1.43 in EPS diluted adjusted and 4.2 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow.","Let's turn to North America. In the calendar year, North America generated 9.5% EBIT adjusted margin despite over a 1 billion of commodity headwinds and downtime taken for full site changeover. In Q4, North America delivered record EBIT adjusted results of 3.0 billion and 10.2% margin, up 20 basis points year-over-year. Performance of our all new light-duty pickup and strong material cost performance in the quarter more than offset commodity headwinds and the volume impact from downtime.","The full-size pickup truck launch has been very strong. We have experienced a smooth ramp up of the new models as well as sell down of the old model. This reduced over 75,000 all new trucks in Q4 consisting primarily of highly profitability crew cab. This contributed favorably to volume, mix and price during the quarter.","Let\u2019s move to GM International. Full year EBIT adjusted in GMI was down 900 million year-over-year primarily driven by FX headwinds in South America. For the fourth quarter, EBIT adjusted in GMI was down 500 million year-over-year due to South America headwinds as well as lower equity income in China. We still delivered strong full year equity income of 2 billion in China driven by our market position, cost performance and a richer mix of Cadillac.","Equity income for the quarter was 300 million down year-over-year as a result of the industry slowdown, continued pricing pressure, and partially offset by cost efficiencies and Cadillac growth. Important to note that there were some factors specific to Q4 including lower production levels and elevated launch cost that impacted the results for the quarter by $100 million.","A few comments on GM Financial, Cruise and our Corp segments. GM Financial posted all-time record revenue of 14 billion for the year and all-time record EBT adjusted of 1.9 billion. In the fourth quarter, GM Financial generated revenue of 3.6 billion and EBT adjusted of 400 million both records for the fourth quarter. In October, GM Financial paid a dividend of 375 million.","As I mentioned last month, continued dividends from GM Financial provides an opportunity to strengthen our long-term cash generation capability and narrow the gap between earnings and free cash flow. Cruise costs were 700 million for the year and 200 million for Q4. We expect to spend approximately 1 billion in the GM Cruise segment in 2019.","Corp segment costs for the full year were 600 million including approximately 250 million combined favorable impact from PSA warrants and revaluation of our list investment. We expect to spend the Corp segment to be about a billion in 2019. In the fourth quarter, Corp sector costs were impacted by unfavorable performance in PSA warrants and were $400 million negative for quarter.","Before I close, I wanted to reiterate our outlook for the calendar year. As I mentioned last month, we expect strong EPS diluted adjusted in the range of $6.50 to $7 and adjusted automotive free cash flow in the range of $4.5 to $6 billion. Catching on the headwinds, we will take downtime to the tune of 25,000 units as we prepare for the launch of our all new full-size SUV. We expect China equity income to be down moderately year-over-year. We expect to see headwinds year-over-year from commodities and tariffs to the tune of $1 billion.","Finally headwinds from depreciation and pension income are expected to be approximately 1 billion, and as a reminder, since these are non-cash items, they were compressed the gap between earnings and free cash flow. Offsetting these are a number of tailwinds specific to GM. The full year benefit of our truck launch will provide tailwinds in volume, mix and price in 2019. We expect a meaningful benefit from full year of XT4 and Blazer, the launch of Cadillac XT6 as Mary mentioned, and the rollout of our global family of vehicles.","We also expect year-over-year growth in high margin adjacencies like aftersales and OnStar. When you layer on top of that, the transformational cost savings of 2 billion to 2.5 billion through 2019, we expect these tailwinds to more than offset the headwinds, assuming a similar macro-environment. It is also important to understand this year quarterly cadence, we expect the first quarter to be the weakest since most of our SUV downtime will be taken in the first quarter.","In addition, we will have lower volumes in China, given continued industry pressure while staying disciplined by reducing our inventory levels. As we progress through the year, we expect to see improvements in China equity income following these inventory actions and with a strong product launch cadence later in the year.","As a reminder Q1 is typically our weakest cash flow quarter due to working capital seasonality. In addition, this year given the SUV downtime that I just mentioned, Q1 cash flow is expected to be meaningfully below our historical averages. For the full year, however, we expect cash flow to improve after Q1 and our full year free cash flow, as I mentioned earlier, will be in the range of $4.5 billion to $6 billion.","In summary, we had a solid finish to 2018 and we will continue to stay focused on execution in 2019, and as I mentioned in January, we had three key financial priorities including improving our free cash flow and cash conversion, a best-in-class cost structure and efficient capital deployment.","That concludes our opening comments and we will now move to the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America.","John Murphy","A sort of follow-up question to your finish there, Dhivya. I am just curious, if you could go through the cadence of the truck launches, I mean it sounds like you've got 75,000 to light duties in the fourth quarter, but obviously that\u2019s much lower than run rate you expect on a new truck. When the HD will actually start really contributing post there ramp and there launch and then when the SUV will layer in? So if you kind think about when those -- the SOPs for those and when the real full throated benefit comes for reach of the three tranches of the trucks?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Sure, John. So, if you look at Fort Wayne, we\u2019re already up and running in full volume and that transition is over. So, if you switch over to Silao, which is where we have taken our downtime in fourth quarter, we\u2019re now up to full line rate reproduction for our light-duty pickup. As after January, we\u2019re up to full level of production. So light duties, we\u2019re pretty much with our transition.","If you switch over to heavy-duty, most of the changeover we have been working on in 2018 and through second quarter of 2019, we will see transition. And after that starting in Q3 of 2019 is when you will see, the full production ramping up for heavy-duty. For SUVs, we\u2019re going to take the 25,000 downtime for the year that will be mostly in Q1 of 2019 and the SORP for that will be in 2020 and will have more to talk about that later.","John Murphy","Just a second question, if you could update us on what\u2019s going on with Cruise? I mean, obviously, there was some talk about getting launched with a fleet, commercial fleet this year, something that might get a little bit delayed. And also maybe Mary, if you could talk about what\u2019s going on to DOT petition on the fourth gen Cruise? And if there's any word on that whatsoever?","Mary Barra","So, there is really no word on the petition for our level four, our track four vehicle, but we also are very capable of launching with the truck three model. So, I think we\u2019re in good position there. We -- as we've been consistently communicating, safety is going to be the getting metrics for Cruise. We have hired -- we're at 1,100 people, so we've got the right team and at right focus obviously moving out there has been I think just shows our commitment to what we\u2019re doing there and been able to work on the whole ecosystem as well as the technology.","We continue to make rapid progress with the technology, I think that's as evidenced by the video, we released just last month that shows that our vehicle can handle the new that others are struggling with. So I think we\u2019re in a very strong position, if not a leading position. So, we\u2019re continuing to make the rapid progress. We\u2019re going to make sure we meet all the appropriate safety thresholds that we defined for ourselves as well as the regulatory requirements, and this is going to be a really important critical year, and we\u2019re going to continue to update you as we progress, but I would say everything is moving forward in a very positive fashion.","John Murphy","And then just lastly just one sort of housekeeping, when we think about the GMF dividends, I think it was 434 in '18. So what is the progression as the balance sheet and the earnings growth at GMF? And how should we think about sort of the addition of cash flow in 19 and 20 and beyond?","Dhivya Suryadevara","So, John, you're absolutely right. The dividend in GMF is now at a level which is lower than what would be our steady state potential. If you look at our long-term earnings before tax expectation for GMF that's in the range of about $2 billion, and we expect that once we reach full captive and that's going to be likely in the early 2020, we would be able to dividend the earnings before that will after taxes, net income I would say about to be apparent. The curve between there and now would be determined by our average ratio along the way.","And we have our managerial target of 10 times to leverage ratio of GMF. And if we've seen potential for the dividends, we will take that but we will ultimately be governed by maintaining and appropriate leverage ratio and our communications to the rating agencies and how much of dividends we take out of fin-co where we will assume in our outlook for 2019 is that a level that's comparable to 2018 from a dividend perspective. And if we see anything above that, that would be upside. But we will post you that from that as we move forward with how the leverage ratio developed.","John Murphy","But simply, it's fair to say 1.5 billion potential upside run rate to free cash flow as GMF normalizes into its size that you want to get it to?","Mary Barra","Thanks John.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research.","Rod Lache","Couple of questions. One is this fourth quarter margin in North America obviously was really strong, it was up year-over-year despite the higher DNA, the commodity inflation, all of those headwinds and obviously you are so kind of early in the truck launch. I was hoping you may be able to just address one aspect of how we should be thinking about the truck positive from where we are right now into 2019? At one point, you talked about, I think it was a $2 billion revenue opportunity for you, as you convert your average transaction prices between where you were on the old trucks and were you expected to be. What your updated view on that? Are you tracking towards that? Is that something we should see in 2019?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Sure. So, before we even get into the numbers, I would say from a truck launch perspective, we're really excited about the new generation of trucks and where we have been in the leadership position that for many years, and we expect to continue with that with this brand new launches that we have. And within that, Rod we -- if you remember, we had talked about the releasing a number of constraints that we have historically had with our previous truck platforms including crew cab capacity, which we have fixed that I would say with the current generation versus the prior generation. And also a wider and broader offering of vehicles including high-content, high-value, we would really participate in the middle of the curve and now we've sort of expanded that to the edges as well.","So put all that together, Q4 you are starting to see, you already started to see the impact of pricing as well as mix in our new trucks. And what you're going to see in 2019 is, you could easily run rate that off of Q4 and we're also not going to have the volume headwinds that we saw in 2018 for light duties as we were transitioning them. So light duties, I would say volume up, mix favorable and pricing continues to be support of this world. Heavy duties, even you see this similar dynamic in the second half of the year, so you will see half year of benefit of that and SUVs as it continues to be a transition year. So, a simple way of looking at it for you would be to take the Q4 results for light duties and run rate that in 2019.","Rod Lache","I was also hoping that you can address the non-China part of GMI? Looks like, it was about a $1.6 billion drag last year. What are your high-level expectations for this going forward? Obviously, there is some Korea improvement and is the rest of it contingent on macro in South America? Or are there some other things that you would expect to be big drivers?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yes, if you look at our South American business, over the last several, we've taken a number of actions to right size the cost structure and set the business up for future profitability. And in fact in Q4 of 2017, the business did breakeven and turned a profit. What happened in 2018 was, as you will know, the FX story there with the Brazilian real and the Argentine peso. What we've done since then is to start working with a number of our stakeholders, as you know in South America, and we will have more to say as we make more progress there.","But it is important to know a couple of factors specific to 2019. One is, we are going to have a full-year impact of pricing in South America because priced tends to lag FX there. So last year as we were experiencing headwinds in FX, we were pricing for them but on a lagged basis. So you are going to see a full-year impact of that in 2019. And the second aspect is, towards the end of the year, we're going to start to see the impact of our global family of vehicles, and this is the portfolio that we shared more in detail about in last month of our Capital Markets Day.","That portfolio is a new architecture that replaces the numbers of legacy architecture. So, the cost profile and the margin profile of the portfolio is different as well as the footprints to the portfolio where we have more hedged from an FX perspective. So, you're going to start to see the impact of that. So, year-over-year in 2019 based on everything in South America and those actions we've taken in Korea as well, we expect to see improvement from a profitably perspective with GMI.","Rod Lache","And just my last question. You've talked about 4.5 billion to 6 billion of free cash flow, but 6 billion to 6.5 billion excluding the timing differences, which were I think largely related to the supplier payment days. If we were to think about the underlying free cash flow of the business in 2019, to kind of users as you for bridging purposes to understand where your free cash flow generative power is of the Company. Is it really closer to the 6 billion and the 6.5 billion just on a go forward basis?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yes, I think timing you have addressed, Rod. It was basically related to supplier payments as well as production timing and our changeover. And as we look at -- look beyond 2019, excluding the impact of timing, you are going to see the remaining cost savings flow through, we said 4.5 billion in total. 2019 will get a about a half of it and the 2020 results will have the remaining benefits of the cost savings as well. And couple of that with our CapEx savings, we talked about how our 8.5 billion run rate will get to a -- 8.5 billion current level will get to a 7 billion by 2020. You're going to see the impact of that in 2020 as well. But obviously, if all of that is in the context of this current macro-environment and I'm -- what I am giving you is puts and takes assuming and nothing else changes, but you have tailwinds working for us in 2020.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citi.","Itay Michaeli","Just a first question on China, given the recent challenges in the last few quarters, how you're now thinking about normalized China margins for GM say over the next couple of years?","Mary Barra","I think if you look at, there is kind of puts and takes there from a Cadillac perspective and launching more cross over, we think there is an opportunity continue to grow and improve their margins. Clearly, as we transitioned to more electrified vehicles as we gain scale that will be lower and then we move higher. So, we're still focused on having strong margins and China will go through a bit of transition with the EVs. So, we think that specifically the growth of Cadillac and some of our larger SUVs will help to offset that.","Itay Michaeli","And then, I think you've mentioned a $1 billion still assumed on for commodities and tariffs. Love to get your thoughts on tariffs component in terms of what you're assuming and just some of that the scenarios that we should be thinking about Section 232 and some of the other items are still outstanding out there?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yes, Itay, it's a pretty volatile environment, so I don\u2019t want to put specific numbers on individual components here. You've seen some pullback in steel and aluminum. Palladium has gone up and it changes day-to-day. So I wouldn\u2019t really break that down into individual components. We do have the 301 tariffs factored into our outlook for the year that's embedded in our 1 billion number. And as we said last year, the amount -- since our sourcing for steel and aluminum is largely local, we don\u2019t anticipate any tariff components there that's more of where the spot prices are moving and that tends to be lagged by a couple of months. So take that as a broader $1 billion number and we've shown during 2018 that we're going to work to offset that with matured cost efficiencies and other efficiency, so we can find and that's a no different in 2019.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.","Joseph Spak","Just one quick question and I think Rod alluded to this. The higher D&A in North America, it looks like I think some of that was accelerated depreciation related to some of the actions you took in North America. Was that actually backed out then the accelerated part from the adjusted results?","Dhivya Suryadevara","That's right. The accelerated depreciation as a part of the overall charge for transformation which is treated as special for EBIT adjusted. The one that Rod was talking about in the form of additional D&A, that is our normal cadence of our D&A normalizing to our capital level, and we saw a good portion of that flow through in the fixed component of our EBIT walk. For the fourth quarter as well as the calendar year, it impacted results. And as I said in 2019, that will continue to impact results as well. So, that's the normal D&A, Joe. The accelerated one is not counted in that.","Joseph Spak","Okay. So of the 1 5 roughly in America, that includes the accelerated portion, so it was up -- so on an apples-to-apples basis, it was up a couple of $100 million year-over-year?","Dhivya Suryadevara","You are talking about the accelerated portion or the normal\u2026","Joseph Spak","No. On an adjusted basis, how much higher was the D&A?","Dhivya Suryadevara","I would say from the transformation perspective, we took a charge of about 1.3 billion for the year that included D&A of about 300 million or so with the 1.3 billion charge. So, that's the transformation portion. And on the normalized basis, if you look at our calendar year EBIT walk, the fixed component had a year-over-year increase a vast majority of that. If not all of it, I would say it would be attributed to D&A.","Joseph Spak","The real point in going down this path is as we think. You showed the free cash flow walks on Slide 13, as we think about that CapEx less depreciation for '19. Does that gap further narrow relative to your $8 billion, $9 billion CapEx guidance for the year?","Mary Barra","Yes, the way I would think about that bridges in 2019, you are going to have 1 billion of additional depreciation and pension income which are non-cash, so you will see the compression in the first two bar coming from that. And in 2020, you are going to see additional depreciation and pension and a decline in 1 billion of capital. So that should be on top of the pension and depreciation number that I would think about. And as John asked earlier about GMF, that's the other component of when that dividend starts to come in, that will be on top of this first two components.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS.","Colin Langan","There is obviously a lot of pushback on the plans to close some plans. I mean, how much of that 4.5 billion is at risk, if the unions don\u2019t allow those the concessions are closing? And do you see that as a risk?","Mary Barra","I think obviously it's important, we announced that the plans are unallocated and as part of our UAW negotiations, this year we need to finalize the status. But I think when you look at the fact of the 2,800 workers that are impacted, 1,200 of retirement eligible, and we have about 2,700 jobs available, as I mentioned already 950 people have been placed. I think as we worked through and addressed the concerns from a workforce perspective, that will go a long way to allowing us to make this transition.","And obviously, we have work to do, but when we look at what we need to do from a market perspective, we can't run at a 70% utilization, we had to improve that and that will work to accomplish. So, that's the way I look at, and I don\u2019t see risks from especially with the ability that we have to do with the people to places where we're hiring. And we just announced yesterday that we have 1,000 jobs available in Flint. So, I think it's the transition we have to go through, it's what we have to do and problem solve with UAW.","Colin Langan","And when we look at your '19 guidance, what is the assumption on pickup? I mean, do expect to ends up more about the new product take pricing? Some of the recent data showed some market share shift, but it's followed months-to-months. I mean, are you optimistic that you're going to gain share with new truck? Or is it more about them?","Dhivya Suryadevara","I would say as volume mix priced all of the above, we expect the truck penetration to hover around the ranges that it has booked in the recent past, which is in the low 20s. We expect that to continue going forward. The crew cab makes us an important component of all of this. As I mentioned earlier, in the second half of the year while we release the constraint on crew cab with Fort Wayne, we saw the tailwind associated with that and we are going to see in the full year, calendar year, a full impact of both Fort Wayne and Silao still out running at full crew cab capacity.","Colin Langan","Got it. So with the recent market share changes that are showing up, that they are not -- until next year I guess, would be the short answer?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yes, I wouldn't extrapolate from one data point Colin.","Colin Langan","Got it. And just lastly, any color on where your inventory in China is -- a lot of concern that there is still high inventories, I guess, across the industry?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yes, I would say we've taken actions in Q4 to right size our overall production levels. We took out about 250,000 units of production in China in Q4. If you look at the overall inventory picture, we target to be typically around 40 to 45 days of inventory. SGM, which operates more in the tier 1 to 2 cities, is a touch above that, and we're working on that further in Q1 of 2019. SGMW is at a level that is higher than we would like, and again that's action that we have to continue to take in Q1 as well.","So when I talk about the cadence in my remarks, and I alluded to Q1 being the seasonal low in China as well, it factors the inventory right-sizing actions within that.","Colin Langan","Got it. All right. Thank you very much for taking my question.","Dhivya Suryadevara","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs.","David Tamberrino","Great. Let's stay in China for the moment. Trying to read the tea leaves on your comments, as it sounds like your JV income should take a step down from the $300 million run rate in the fourth quarter and the first quarter, as you take some of these inventory actions and shutdown production in wholesales, but then you're expecting it to improve sequentially throughout the year, and outside -- getting to normalized wholesale shipments, I am just wondering what's the main driver there?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yes. Firstly, I would not assume that it would take a step down from Q4. I would say similar to Q4 we're taking inventory actions. We took them in Q4, from a production perspective and we're going to continue to take them in Q1 as well. And I think it's important to note, the 20 new launches that we talked about earlier, they are in Q2, Q3 and Q4. So actions that are specific to us, I would say, really starts to take effect in the latter half of the year. So from a cadence perspective in China I would say, Q1, expect similar-ish levels to Q4 and then pick up after that. But obviously with an eye overall on the macro environment as well as the sales picture over there.","David Tamberrino","Got it. That's helpful, Dhivya. And then from a Cruise perspective, the spend, well below your billion target for the year. Is there anything to read into that? Are you signaling anything here? I kind of want to understand that if there was a tone-shift earlier, another analyst asked a question, it wasn't necessarily answered or not, if we should expect a later deployment in 2019. It seemed a little bit more squishy, if I can use that term. But on the back of that one tone-shift question; two, should that spend in 2019 ramp toward at $1 billion that you were looking for? And then what type of increased spend are you really contemplating at deployment for your operations, as well as customer acquisition costs with getting people into a AV ride-hailing network?","Mary Barra","David, we're not squishy at all on our plan for AV for Cruise. I would say one of the reasons the spend is lower -- it turned out to be lower in 2018 is, Kyle Vogt is an excellent leader and manager and he spends every dollar like it's his own. So there's incredibly good cost controls in GM Cruise set out, and saw that we expect to spend this year. So I think that's just good cost discipline.","As I said that -- this is one of the biggest technical challenges of our time. But I think we're really well positioned. We're committed. We have every resource we need, and if they come forward and say they need additional resources, we stand ready to provide those. So I think it's in a strong position from funding. I think it's in a strong position, as we continue to do the development. And yes, so we're going to keep you posted throughout the year. But we're on-track from the performance that we've talked about, and I think again, reference to video that -- what the vehicle is now able to do, we're going to continue to work on the regulatory front as well, and we will hold ourselves to the safety standards that we've set. But we're committed and we're moving at a very aggressive pace.","David Tamberrino","Okay. And just within that, maybe I'm missing it, you did about $700 million of spend this year, your target was $1 billion for 2018, you came in $300 million low, I understand some cost saves. Are you expecting a similar level, $700 million in your 2019 guidance, just\u2026?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Our guidance for 2019 for GM Cruise is approximately $1 billion.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.","Adam Jonas","Two quick questions. First, when do you think GM can sell EVs for a positive EBIT margin roughly?","Mary Barra","So Adam, we've talked to you about the fact that with our next generation of development, that we want to make sure we have obtainable, profitable, desirable, and with the appropriate range. And so that is the work that we're doing. We benefit from the fact that we have a strong position in China, and as you know, the regulatory situation we will drive there. Also I think, important to note that we have the partnership with Honda to leverage the technology as well. So I think we're in a good position, driving our cell costs down, also from a quality perspective, and that is our stated goal when we launch that next family of vehicles.","Adam Jonas","Okay. So I'm interpreting that as kind of post 2020, maybe 2021, correct me if I'm wrong. Second, question for either Mary, you or for Mark if he is on, what do you think of an all-electric pickup truck and when will GM sell an E-Silverado?","Mary Barra","So, I think you said, correct, if you're wrong. I would say early next decade, but I wouldn't put any more specificity on EV profitability than that. And I'll say on your second question is, we believe in an all EV future. So you'll have to stay tuned.","Adam Jonas","We will. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JP Morgan.","Ryan Brinkman","I thought to ask on GM International restructuring progress outside of China that is. So can you provide us with an update on the Korea restructuring announced in the 1Q call last year, and how you would rate your progress there since that time? Also I think there were two international plants included in the restructuring announcement back in November. These were unnamed, but slated to close sometime in 2019, presumably they are outside Korea, perhaps South America. Any update you can provide on how investors should think about the cadence of those savings, as 2019 progresses?","Mary Barra","I would step back and look more broadly at GMI, not including China and Dhivya has already addressed South America. I would say that Korea restructuring is on track, and we're also seeing a pickup in our share there. Obviously, there was a difficult period of time. So we continue to implement all of the actions that we announced last year. I would say there is still work that we're doing around that region to right size the business, have a solid plan to profitability and that work is under way. So I don't have anything more specific to add. But we're -- what we announced with the two plants is definitely on track. And I don't know, Dhivya, if you have any additional color you want to add there?","Dhivya Suryadevara","I would just say that the cost savings that we have outlined for 2019, contemplate the right cadence for these plants as well. So it's all baked in.","Ryan Brinkman","And then lastly, but sticking with GMI. It looks like currency continues to be a fairly large headwind, $300 million in the quarter. Seemingly the Argentine peso and the real, biggest drivers there. Based on the prevailing spot prices, any hedges that you might have? And then your localization plans with regard to the GEM platform, how should we think about this trend as 2019 progresses?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yes, I would say there has been some stabilization post the elections in Brazil from a Brazilian real perspective. But obviously remains elevated relative to historical averages. I think the way to think about Brazil and Argentina is, we're able to price in line with inflation in Brazil, and we typically pass through the FX headwinds in Argentina. There might be a lag, Ryan, but I wouldn't think of Argentina as anything other than -- you take last few months of FX headwinds and kind of factor that into your future pricing ability.","So, I wouldn't think of it as hedges and we don't use forwards necessarily in these areas. I would look at pricing and localization as the 2 primary levers we have from an FX management perspective. And on localization, the next generation of vehicles that I mentioned earlier, will be more localized. But with all the actions we're taking, it is our objective to be able to breakeven and turn a profit at even more extreme levels of FX. So we're continuing to work on it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays.","Brian Johnson","Yes. I want to ask a few questions around GM Financial. First, if I look at full year 2018 over 2017, ROA seemed to expand from 140 bps to 195 bps. Could you maybe dimension how much of that was due to lease residual performance versus credit performance versus other factors like net interest margin or cost saves?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yes, I would say, if you look at overall year-over-year GMF EBT bridge, if you will, half it from increase in volumes as they continue to grow to full captive levels. So just their penetration getting higher and their overall volume is getting higher and the other half coming from the fact that, residual values were flat in 2018 versus 2017, so take the delta, Brian and divide that by two.","Brian Johnson","Okay. So the main factor of the ROA increase would have been the residuals. Which gets to the second question, you've talked about a mature run rate of about $2 billion EBIT, full year 2019 was $1.9 billion and fourth quarter would kind of be right in line with that. Are you implying that it's sort of going to be flattish, as perhaps residual gains come down, given your used car pricing forecasts or even down next year?","Dhivya Suryadevara","I'd say 2019 flat to 2018, we're expecting a 4% to 6% decline in residual values, which we expect will be offset by the growth in volume that I mentioned and our continued penetration. And the other aspect longer term as well, Brian, as the business matures, you're able to spread the OpEx over a larger asset base. So we should see OpEx efficiencies as well as we move forward.","Brian Johnson","Okay. And the need to grow the asset base is why you're not committing to upping the payout ratio to the full 100% just yet?","Dhivya Suryadevara","That's correct. So our current asset base is around -- north of $95 billion. We would see in the next several years, that that would tail off probably in the $120 million range. So the amount of equity that we are holding in the fin-co now is to support that remaining growth.","Brian Johnson","And final question is around your GM Financial JV in China. At least the 3Q is up to 44% retail penetration, which seems impressive. A few, just more strategic questions; to what extent is there further room to use that to offset some of the headwinds in the Chinese market? And then second, as you kind of think about the mix -- vehicle mix in China, are you better able to penetrate the upper Cadillac, Buick and -- of the market with that support, versus the lower end, given the credit profile of the buyers?","Dhivya Suryadevara","I'd say to you, first question, there's certainly room from a growth perspective for SAIC-GMAC joint venture. We are still in the early stages of, I would say, of penetration over there on financing and also the leasing portfolio which is in its infancy, so more growth to be had longer term. And across the board, I would say, in China, adjacencies are at its early stages of development across the board, whether it's the after sales, GMF and others. So, we will continue growing those. And from a vehicle mix perspective, perhaps more tilted toward the tier 1 to tier 2 market, than the tier 3 to tier 4 market. But I wouldn't specifically draw trends on Cadillac versus other brands.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank.","Emmanuel Rosner","Wanted to ask you about the expected cadence of some of the benefits from your restructuring actions, I assume that as part of your comments on the cadence for the earnings this year, some of it is also -- when some of these benefits hit and maybe beyond the first quarter. So can you maybe talk us about that $2 billion to $2.5 billion benefit expected for this year, how should we think about it in terms of progression throughout the year?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yes, I'd say we're off to a pretty good start. As I mentioned in my comments, Q4, we already started to see early signs of these savings starting to flow through. And if you look at calendar year 2019, the savings will be tilted more toward the earlier part of the year. So we will be off to a pretty good start here after Q1. So I'd say Q1 is when we implemented, Q2 onwards, you will start to see the benefits.","Emmanuel Rosner","Okay, I understand. And I guess second question, there is -- I don't think there was a big focus on the Capital Markets Day. But I was curious about your thoughts around the opportunity to do some -- or the priority around doing some buybacks this year. It feels like if you achieve your $4.5 billion to $6 billion guidance, even after financing, restructuring and the common dividend, it feels like there could be some room, depending on where you shake out for some buyback. Is that a priority or is 2019 viewed as a more a transition year, and then it would come in future years?","Mary Barra","Yes, we're going to stay very committed to our capital allocation framework of looking at opportunities to continue to invest in the business to generate a greater than 20% return, as well as maintaining an investment grade balance sheet. And then, as we get to that point, there is opportunity that will be returned to shareholders. So I don't have anything specific to say other than we're going to follow our process.","Emmanuel Rosner","Okay. And then I guess, finally, just curious what you're seeing in terms of latest data and trends in China. Obviously you're assuming a fairly flat market for the year, which I think when the guidance was given, may have been perhaps seen as optimistic. Now the most recent data point throughout January seemed to think there is going to be a little bit of stabilization. Are you seeing any of that or is it sort of like too early to say, in terms of the Chinese market?","Mary Barra","No. I think we're seeing improvements from Q4. I mean it's early days, but we're optimistic, not only from what we've seen in the month of January, but also, what the government has announced, because we've seen that have a positive impact. And then again, the team there is very focused on costs and improving mix, etc. So with the new launches, we see a lot of, we see opportunity from an industry perspective, with the signs we saw in January and we also have a lot of, I'll say, GM specific opportunity.","Emmanuel Rosner","And just very finally, I guess still on China. So how should we think about your guidance for a modest decline in equity income? I mean, it seems like you're speaking about Q1, not necessarily any worse than Q4, then I would assume beyond that, you sort of have the benefit from some of the new products and then potentially some stabilization in the market. So is it really thus -- mathematically you are lapping some very strong quarters last year, or is there anything else that's sort of like a headwind to expect throughout the year?","Dhivya Suryadevara","I wouldn't say there's headwinds to expect beyond what we shared at Capital Markets Day. I think it's important to note that, when we say moderately lower equity income we're factoring all these in and it's our intent -- there will be puts and takes in different regions and between North America, China and so on. It's still our intent to post a strong calendar year, results from a company perspective. So I wouldn't over train on one versus the other. We do expect that as Mary mentioned, there's company specific factors that's going to help us. It is a volatile market at the end of the day, I wouldn't get any more specific on that.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Chris McNally with Evercore.","Chris McNally","Hi. First time caller, as they say, so appreciate getting on the call. Maybe I can attack this cadence on the North American EBIT Just in a slightly different way. I think you guys been clear, that Q1 is low, we have production shutdown, and the cadence of the cost saves across the year. I think some of the questions investors may have are around in the second half. Is there any extraordinary cost that we should think about, given the launch of the heavy duty and the SUVs? Because if not, you would you would think that sort of cadence, beats the sort of Q4 as another peak. So is there any sort of offset to the benefit that you've laid out, that should get better across the year?","Dhivya Suryadevara","I don't think there was any specific launch related costs or anything we haven't already talked about, that's going to weigh on North American results. We had talked about depreciation and pension income going down and commodity headwinds, that does impact North America, but that should even through the whole year, depending on how commodities behave in the next several quarters here. But I'd just say, beyond what you talked about on Q1 with the downtime and all the factors that I mentioned, that should positively impact the second half of the year. There is nothing that we haven't already discussed.","Chris McNally","And just one follow-up on actually the timing of commodities and tariffs, I mean obviously, the $1 billion we are still annualizing some of the costs from last year, so it would make sense that those hits are greatest in the first half. It sort of surprised me a little bit, when you talked about some of the spot prices of the quarter of being a lag of quarters, I know sometimes with hedges, could be anywhere from, four to six quarters. Is it possible that if we see these spot levels continue over the first six months, that there actually could be some benefit by, let's call it the end of the year, as you know, obviously you've had to project out, for the full year?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yes. The lag that I talked about is in our index commodities. We typically experience a three month lag in -- when the actual impact shows up on our income statement versus when the spot prices go up or down. And I would say, it's really difficult to call the specific cadence of it. As you well know this moves up and down every quarter. I'd say evenly distributed through the entire year. We are obviously watching the 301 tariffs very closely, because that will have an impact, and within the current market environment, I'd say, you also need to look at the mix of which commodities are going up and down as well. So it's difficult to provide any more specificity on a topic that is inherently pretty volatile.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing comments.","Mary Barra","Thank you. Well, thanks everybody for participating today. As we begin the next phase of our transformation, I want you to know that we are committed to continuing to strengthen the core business, as well as continue to accelerate our work to lead in the future of personal mobility. We are really repositioning this company, what from -- one that was trying to be all things to all people in all markets, to a very strategic, agile and profitable company. And we believe we are in a very differentiated position than many of the competitors in this industry. We are intent on reinventing personal transportation, capitalizing on the $1 trillion opportunity on making the world safer, better and more sustainable.","In 2019, we will continue to deliver on our commitments that we've made to you, our owners, by capitalizing on our strong global vehicle portfolio, our adjacent businesses, and we will stay focused on driving profitable growth across the business to create value in the short term and long term for our shareholders. This transformation will be very dynamic and -- but you have our commitment, that we will continue to act with speed, with discipline and with integrity, to drive the business performance that we need to win not only today, but in the future.","So thanks again for your time.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the conference call for today.

In the room today to assist in answering your questions, we also have Dhivya Suryadevara, Vice President of Corporate Finance and incoming Executive Vice President and CFO; and Tom Timko, Vice President Global Business Services and Chief Accounting Officer.","Before we begin I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language.","I will now turn the call over to Mary Barra.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call. Before I start and comment on earnings, I would like to share that at General Motors, our thoughts are with Sergio Marchionne's family and friends as well as the entire FCA team over his sudden loss. I think we all agree, Sergio will be remembered for the many, many accomplishments he had in our industry.","And now, I'd like to move to the numbers. First, from a net revenue perspective, we generated $36.8 billion. We had EBIT-adjusted of $3.2 billion, EBIT-adjusted margins of 8.7% and EPS-diluted-adjusted of $1.81. Our ROIC-adjusted was 24.7%. And our adjusted automotive free cash flow was $2.6 billion.","Our financial results in the second quarter, whilst solid, did not meet our plan. We faced significant external challenges including higher than expected commodity prices and currency devaluation in South America. We have been taking actions to mitigate these headwinds and that will continue. However, we expect this volatility to extend into the second half, and Chuck and I will share more on this in a few minutes.","Before we do that though, I do want to point out the key accomplishments in the quarter that demonstrate we are executing the business with strength and discipline. We improved U.S. sales and market share through strong sales of crossovers, trucks and SUVs. In addition, China equity income was a Q2 record driven by record Cadillac and Baojun deliveries and strong market share. And GM financial growth and earning assets and continued loyalty performance contributed to a record earnings before tax-adjusted in the quarter.","Production of our all new 2019 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra full-size pickups have begun on schedule, and we expect to begin delivering high contented crew cab models to customers in August. To support our commitment to quality, these trucks have been subjected to the most stringent testing and validation in our history, and we've accumulated over 7 million miles in that testing and validation. In addition, we secured landmark deals and alliances that will help us redefine the future of personal mobility.","Let's take a deeper look at the core business performance by turning to the United States where sales are up 4% through June and where our brands gained market share in the quarter. Year-to-date, Chevrolet has posted record Trax, Equinox and Traverse deliveries. With a double-digit pickup sales increase in the first half of the year, Chevrolet and GMC outpaced the industry. Cadillac is on track to launch the XT4 luxury SUV this fall. And as I mentioned, our full-sized pickup launch is going very well, with our truck plants operating two shifts at over 100% capacity to meet the demand for current generation trucks while we're transitioning to our all-new Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra.","In the second half of the year, GM China will introduce 10 new models including the Cadillac XT4. The focus is on high-demand segments including SUVs and MPVs and luxury vehicles. We expect increased launch-related costs in the second half of the year and because of competitive launches, we expect pricing pressures to intensify. But we remain confident in our 20 years of market strength in China. Due to established local and U.S. brands and our strong Chinese partner, our current outlook does not assume any comprehensive impact in China beyond existing trade flows.","We also continue to be committed to our vision of zero crashes, zero emissions, and zero congestion, and we signed a landmark deal with SoftBank valuing GM Cruise at $11.5 billion. The GM and SoftBank investments are expected to provide the capital necessary to reach commercialization at scale. And we took an important step toward our all-electric future by partnering with Honda on next-generation battery development for our respective EV models. As part of this deal, Honda will source battery cells and modules from GM, and this creates scale and manufacturing efficiencies.","We began this year expecting pressure from raw material prices and foreign exchange rates and while we have mitigated some of this effect the challenge has become significantly greater than we originally expected, and we believe it will continue in the second half of the year. Because of this, we have updated our full year outlook for EPS in the $6.00 range and adjusted automotive free cash flow to approximately $4 billion. Chuck will go deeper into the numbers and share our expectations for the rest of 2018.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Thanks, Mary. As Mary mentioned, while execution continues to be strong, we did experience a challenging second quarter, and we are facing greater than expected headwinds in commodity pricing and significant currency devaluations in South America. Again, in total we generated $36.8 billion in revenue, $3.2 billion in EBIT-adjusted, 8.7% margins and $1.81 in EPS-diluted-adjusted in the second quarter. We also generated $2.6 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow, in line with our expectations. North America generated $2.7 billion of EBIT-adjusted and 9.4% margins. These results are below our expectations.","Q2 is down $800 million year-over-year primarily due to unfavorable pricing and trim mix from the sell-down of our current generation full-sized pickups, increased commodity pricing and timing of fleet sales. Our U.S. transaction prices which are net of incentives continue to grow in the second quarter. Our second quarter ATPs of almost $35,500 were $300 higher than the second quarter of 2017. We expect pricing performance to improve as we progress with the launch of our new trucks later in the year. And as we look into the second half, we remain focused and being disciplined from an incentive spending perspective.","Regarding GM North America full-year EBIT-adjusted margins, we are on path to achieve our target of 10% margins. However, with the largely commodity-driven headwinds we are facing, a 9% to 10% range is more appropriate at this time.","Moving to GM International, EBIT-adjusted performance in GM International is down $200 million year-over-year, driven by a significant devaluation of the Argentine peso and Brazilian real, partially offset by strength in China. China continued to deliver record results with equity income of $600 million for the quarter, up $100 million year-over-year. Pricing pressure remains a challenge, but was more than offset by the richer mix of vehicles, continued strong sales performance from Baojun, Cadillac, and Chevrolet and continued focus on cost efficiencies.","Just a few comments on GM Financial, GM Cruise and our Corp segment. As we continue to progress towards full captive, GM Financial posted record revenue of $3.5 billion and record earnings before tax-adjusted of over $500 million in the second quarter. Earning assets grew $9.9 billion to just over $90 billion, supporting expected future earnings growth. And for the full year, we continue to expect a meaningful improvement in GM Financial earnings versus 2017. GM Cruise costs in the quarter were $200 million as we continue progressing toward commercialization. We expect to spend approximately $1 billion in GM Cruise for the full-year.","The Corp segment reflects an improvement of $300 million year-over-year in the second quarter, primarily due to the revaluation of our investment in Lyft. We still expect the Corp segment cost to be approximately $1 billion for the full year.","Turning cash flow and capital allocation. In Q2, as I said, we generated $2.6 billion of adjusted automotive free cash flow, in line with our expectations, and down $200 million year-over-year primarily due to the lower EBIT-adjusted performance partially offset by favorable managed working capital. During the quarter, we returned $500 million to our shareholders through dividends.","With regard to our total company outlook for the full year, the pressure from commodity prices and foreign exchange rates has been more significant than our original expectations. While we've been able to offset some of the headwind, the challenges have been greater than anticipated, and we expect approximately a $1 billion net headwind versus our original guidance. As a result, the incremental impact from these headwinds is reflected in our updated EPS outlook in the range of $6.00 and adjusted automotive free cash flow outlook of approximately $4 billion which excludes GM Cruise.","As mentioned, we expect significant year-over-year profit growth at GM Financial. In China, we expect elevated pricing pressure in the second half due to competitive entries in the market and an increase in launch costs across multiple brands. Regarding earnings cadence, Q4 will be stronger than Q3 on a relative basis, as we increase full-sized pickup truck production.","So, to sum up the quarter, while we are experiencing significant headwinds primarily as a result of recent developments in commodity pricing and FX rates, we're making every effort to mitigate the impact. Our execution remains strong. And when you look at our absolute level of performance, you'll see that it remains very solid. The full-sized truck launch is on plan. Regular production began earlier this month, and our first customer deliveries will begin next month with a rich mix of high content crew cabs.","We continue to see a medium term path to profitability in GMI driven by our recent restructuring actions, the launch of our new GEM program in South America, and improvement in macroeconomic conditions in South America. Additionally, we expect profit growth in our adjacencies including GM Financial, aftersales and OnStar, and we continue to make considerable progress in the future of mobility as evidenced by SoftBank's recent investment in GM Cruise. We're excited about these opportunities ahead of us and continue to expect strong execution both over the short and long term.","That concludes our opening comments. We'll now move to the question-and-answer portion of the call. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, guys.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Good morning, John.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a first question on the raw material pressures. Obviously, you can take actions internally and execute better and better, which you're doing. But there's also the potential to pass this through in price increases to the customer or potentially push down to your suppliers to help out a bit more. I'm just curious in those two directions, has there been any action or thought put into place in doing those and how successful could those be?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Well, let me just kind of size up the challenge on that relative to the commodity challenge. I mean at the end of the day, I noted that we had a net unmitigated exposure or headwind for the year of about $1 billion. The unmitigated headwind when you look at both commodities and FX is something north of $2 billion, so we've already executed actions to offset more than $1 billion of those headwinds and a big portion of that is commodities. We're doing that through commercial \u2013 incremental commercial and technical savings which gets to the supplier, a portion of that.","We're also doing that, where possible, through pricing. And if you look at our pricing for the year and the second half, we expect pricing to be favorable by roughly $800 million on just pure MSRP. So, to the extent that we can, we're recovering that through pricing. Obviously, John, the market in the United States is challenging. This is a market driven kind of \u2013 we're going to be competitive in the market, again, to the extent that we have opportunistic ability to pass along some, we will. But I'd say the big picture is we've already are in or have executed or will execute actions that's going to mitigate more than 50% of the headwind that we're seeing.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, would it be fair to characterize $2 billion gross headwinds down to about $1 billion based on current actions that you've taken with the potential to maybe try to offset some more through other actions? Is that a fair characterization?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Well, I would say that remaining \u2013 when we look at the year, obviously, if we thought there were actions to mitigate the further $1 billion, we wouldn't have adjusted our guidance. I think on a go-forward basis, as we cycle through 2018, we have levers that we can pull that are longer term in nature. Obviously, we'll continue to work with suppliers, work with them across the entire value chain. We can look at footprint from a sourcing perspective. We can look at ultimately replacement or substitution of materials. So, we will not leave this unmitigated piece of this as a permanent erosion in margins, if that's kind of where you're getting at. And again, that's the commodity piece.","For FX, I would say that you know that is largely the South American piece of the unmitigated exposure between the Argentinian peso and Brazilian real and I would say there's a lag effect. The FX is rolling through as we're cycling through this year. We're taking pricing action aggressively in Argentina and to the extent possible in Brazil. And we would expect as we exit this year, those to be relatively balanced. There's just a lag on how quickly you price for these things and the market acceptance.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's very helpful. Then next on sort of mix in price in the pickup segment, it sounds like there were some incremental pressure, but is this really the sell-down of the old truck or is there something else going on sort of in the competitive landscape in pickup?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes. That's a good question, John. And again, starting at 10,000 feet when you look at North American results $2.7 billion and 9.4%. Both Mary and I stated that this was below our expectations. The biggest driver of the underperformance in the quarter was commodities. When you look at the price bridge year-over-year, I would say what we're seeing from a pricing perspective and what we're seeing in a mix perspective largely expected when you think about we're selling down the K2 and getting ready to launch the new truck. And the trim dynamic that we talked about from a mix standpoint in the second quarter is because our crew cab truck plant was down, getting ready to transition to the new crew cab. So, we were producing and selling largely regular cab and double cabs, which are clearly not as profitable as our high contented crew cab. So, that's more of a timing issue that will cycle through as go through the rest of this year and into next year.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just lastly on Cruise, as we think about sort of progression of that business from an operating basis and a funding basis, are we still on target for commercialization next year? Could there be the potential for a on-demand service, branded Cruise, before you get to truly autonomous level 4 vehicles? And as we think about sort of the monetization and funding of this with SoftBank, really just sort of the first tranche of what investors should expect to see and could there be more down the line in other rounds of funding?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","So, John, we continue to progress and achieve the development that we're looking for. As we've said all along, we'll be gated by safety. But we are on track, and I think, very important investment with Softbank with the validation they did of \u2013 the approach that we're taking of having the deep integration. But beyond that, I don't have anything further to share. We're going to continue to look at what's in the best interest of growing this business, of creating first the safe technology (00:18:27) because that's what enables everything and then driving the network and then beyond. We do have the Cruise, I think it's called Cruise Anywhere where we're already leveraging our own network in driving Cruise employees. But I think we're focused as we've said and on a path for a deployment in a ride-sharing environment in 2019.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks for taking the question. Just to follow on the thinking about the second half versus first half in GMNA, the improvement. The commodity cost remains, so the offset to get to that 9% to 10% considering where you are in the first half is really more some of that mix and some of those new programs \u2013 some of the new trucks coming on?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","That would be correct. If you look at truck production in the first half of the year, we were down versus the first half of last year roughly 40,000 units. That's going to \u2013 we're going to be transitioning out of that. My big picture would be truck production is going to be kind of flat in the second half of 2018 versus the second half. So, we'll cycle past that. And you've got the benefit of the new trucks and what that's going to do from both a mix and a pricing perspective. So, I think as I think about the big picture in the second half, you've got favorable mix, favorable price of the new trucks which is more than going to offset kind of cost associated with launch primarily engineering and D&A and some of the commodity headwinds.","Again, when you add it all up for the year, you end up in the zip code in 9% to 10% margins, and that will largely be the commodity headwinds that we are unable to offset. But fundamentally, the big drivers remain as they were back in January relative to second half versus first half. The new issue is the commodity escalation.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Just taking a step back from the quarter, there was obviously news coming out about some of the fuel economy standards sort of being pushed out and maybe even sort of withdrawing California's ability to regulate. Like I believe in the past you talked about how that was actually a positive because it made standards a little bit more homogenized across the region. So, is that still the thinking or I mean \u2013 I think just what do you prefer, sort of California's able to set their own stuff or if they pull back?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","What we ultimately would like is a one national program across the country. And we are going to remain committed to improving fuel economy, reducing emissions and working toward an all-electric future, but it is in, we believe, everybody's best interest to have one national set of requirement that comprehends the new technologies that we're putting in place and the increase in sharing of the \u2013 increase in \u2013 what the opportunity poses for autonomous vehicles. But one national standard is very important.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then last one on Cruise, as you think about the future \u2013 well, let me let me step back, so it seems like clearly as you're progressing towards this 2019 launch, you're sort of taking a do-it-all approach. But as you think about the longer-term potential for Cruise, if you got the technology to work, do you envision any scenarios whether it be for certain segments or certain geographies where you'd consider licensing out the technology?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Again \u2013 and I think you said it correctly, the key thing is to get the technology developed safely so we can deploy and validate that. And once we do that, we're going to look at any and all opportunities to really ramp up and maximize the use of the technology to drive shareholder value. So, we will be open to all opportunities. Key right now is getting the technology developed and be able to deploy safely.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Sure.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","My first question is on trade. So, I think we've all explored how potential changes to the global trade environment could potentially be quite negative for GM, particularly around NAFTA. Has there also been though any scenario planning within GM that suggest that potential other changes to trade could actually shake out positively for you? I know GM management stands for free trade, but it seems to us that certain scenarios such as NAFTA remaining but Section 232 tariffs applying to imported vehicles from outside the NAFTA block, that could actually end up being quite positive for you from a pricing or share perspective? How are you thinking about the range of possibilities?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Well, the range of possibilities is almost infinite when you look at how many moving pieces there are. As you said, General Motors, we generally are free traders. We believe it's important to modernize NAFTA but we think it's important for the auto industry to have the right NAFTA agreements. What we've been focused on is providing input to the people in government across government and the administration and across countries to make sure they understand the complexities of the supply chain, the length of when we make investments. So, whatever moves are made can be done in a logical fashion. But again, we're very much focused on having the NAFTA agreement resolve. We think that's important.","As we look at the opportunities that may come out of this as it shakes out with whether it's Section 232 or some of the other things that are being discussed, I think what our focus on is making sure we have the best products from a car, truck and crossover perspective that we're going to win in the marketplace. And obviously as those sort out and there's a lot of scenarios we're looking at but we're going to try to really make sure that we're going to be able to take advantage based on the strong product portfolio that we have.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I see. Thanks. And then on the currency headwinds you're seeing in South America, depending upon the performance of what was previously called consolidated IO, the headwinds there seem quite large given that International was softer while China was a record. So, can you kind of help us understand the magnitude maybe of those headwinds and what's driving it? I asked because last year you were only slightly profitable in South America. So, the lower currency translation of your EBIT profits there does not seem to explain the degree of the headwind. Are you may be having to like import certain components into Brazil and Argentina paid for with depreciated reals and pesos? And if so, are there any actions that you can take or that you are taking now to try to lessen that impact going forward?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Well, the net impact of the currency in GMI which was largely","South America, in the second quarter was $200 million, broadly speaking. Significant devaluation of both the Argentinian peso and the Brazilian real. As I mentioned, when you look at this unmitigated for the year, just the South American piece you're talking somewhere close to $1 billion of exposure based on the current rates which had \u2013 pick a day, the Brazilian real has been at BRL 3.80 plus or minus, and the Argentinian peso at ARS 27.5. At the beginning of the year, it was BRL 3.15 and something around ARS 20. We can price and price aggressively in Argentina because it's a hyper inflationary environment, and we've been doing that. And as I said earlier, we would expect that there's a lag, but we would expect that to catch up assuming that there's some stability.","Brazil's different. Brazil inflation is low. It's very, very difficult to pass those costs along. The solution in Brazil, assuming that these current \u2013 this exchange rate persists, which we don't believe it will, will be the execution of our GEM strategy because with the Global Emerging Market program which we're starting to launch now and we'll continue to launch over the next 12 to 18 months in South America, we're going to be much more localized.","So, that's the path out of this. I think that everybody's got their point of view, but kind of the consensus view is once we move through the elections later this year and get some kind of clarity around the government in both Brazil and Argentina, the government policies and execution of some fiscal reform, that these currencies are going to recover, the biggest one that we're focused on obviously is Brazil, given the lack of pricing capability to offset the exchange.","So, that is a long-winded answer, but I think it sized up Q2 in kind of what our view is for the rest of the year. Answered your question, Ryan?","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes, it does. It's very helpful. Thanks. And then just lastly, quickly on metals, I heard in the prepared remarks that you expect the prices to remain high in the back half of the year. Steel prices, we can see clearly they were sharply higher in the quarter and they remain high. At the same time, the prices for some of the other metals that you're exposed to such as aluminum or copper, while they were also sharply higher in 2Q they appear to have significantly moderated after the quarter end just in the last few weeks here. So, the question is like what level of cost do you assume for metals in the back half? Do your assumptions reflect the level of cost you incurred in 2Q, the latest available spot prices or your own expectation of where they might trend going forward? Thanks.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes. We look at a number of different indicators of commodity prices \u2013 one's spot, one is the bank forward rates, one is our own informed view based on all of these inputs. I think that obviously, we've seen the pullback in some of the aluminum pricing most recently. All of that is factored into our thinking. One of the things that you need to understand is there's a lag effect. We have at least a three-month lag from when the price moves to when it ultimately works its way through. So, that's why when you saw the run-up in pricing kind of in Q2, we had a net commodity headwind of $300 million in Q2. We see that playing out into the second half of the year because the run-up that we saw in Q2, we're going to feel the full effect of that in the second half of the year given that kind of three-month lag based on the supply chain. So, all of those are factored in, Ryan, including the recent back up in aluminum.","And I would say our biggest exposure, our biggest unmitigated exposure is really steel and aluminum when you look at all of the commodities. And frankly, the biggest driver of that is steel.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citi.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you. Good morning.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Hey.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Maybe a question on 2019 for Chuck, can you just update us on your latest thinking there? I think the original kind of outlook was for core EBIT to get better 2019 versus 2018. And then also how we should think about the kind of puts and takes on North America. Because I think your second half North America guidance implied about a 10% margin. So, does that kind of continue in 2019 with these headwinds and maybe talk a little bit about that?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Well, just a couple of comments, Itay. I'm not going to set guidance for 2019 because I won't be here to execute to it. So, it would be really easy for me to get aggressive and lean forward. But in all seriousness, I would say that the way I would think about 2019 is execution remains very strong. We continue to work to optimize those things that are in our control. We are in a very uncertain and volatile environment at this point in time and we're in the middle of 2018.","But when you look at the truck launch and having a full year of light duty pickups next year, when you look at the continued strength that of GM Financial and the continued growth there, hopefully, some improvement in South America, I would say a foundation is there for us to continue to execute well, but I am not going to get out in front of my interference here given the macro environment and the uncertainty associated with that. We will continue to focus on strong execution and continuing to drive the improvement in those areas of the business that we've been talking about for the last number of years and I'm confident in whatever the macro backdrop is, we'll optimize results.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","That's helpful. And then on the T1 launch, I think you previously highlighted a $2 billion opportunity mostly in terms of revenue on the crew cab mix. How much of that do you think you'll get in the second half? And can you talk about what the rough incremental margin on that $2 billion opportunity might look like?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","You're going back to the \u2013 Ammann's chart at the Deutsche Bank Conference, right, as I recollect. And when we were looking at that, that was when you looked at kind of the K2 and some of the opportunities we have in the T1 vis-\u00e0-vis the K2. In other words the new entries up-level entries in both the Sierra and Silverado lines, removing the constraint that we had on crew cabs that we've seen in the past and I would say that is kind of like life cycle to life cycle opportunities. So, I wouldn't start booking benefit like that in the second half of 2018. I think that continues to build and will manifest itself in 2019 and 2020 as we move through the launch.","Relative to 2018 second half, we're going to produce roughly 120,000 to 130,000 T1s. Obviously, they're going to be more profitable than the K2. And rich mix; rich mix because they're all crew cabs. But we're not going to see the full impact of that until 2019 and beyond.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","That's very helpful. And then just lastly maybe a strategic question for Mary. With the announcements from Maven yesterday on peer-to-peer, can you talk about how the peer-to-peer sharing platform plays into GM's future AV strategy and even potentially EVs as you can maybe use that platform to make the monthly payment on an EV perhaps more compelling on a shared platform?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Well, Itay, I think you said it well. I mean, we have learned a tremendous amount with Maven in the different contracts whether it's Maven from a real estate perspective, Maven Home, what we've done in Ann Arbor with the City and then Maven Gig, and now this is the next installment with highlighting in the three cities the peer-to-peer. And we think especially with what General Motors has with our OnStar connection, it really allows for a pretty seamless way for people to make their car available to others and defer some of the costs. So, I think there will be people who do what you suggest and use it as a way to offset the cost of the vehicle and we also see it having a huge benefit from a Cap 8 on a regulatory perspective because once you use the vehicle more, we're demonstrating that a vehicle in a sharing environment and we've deployed a number of Chevrolet Volt EVs, is something that gets higher miles usage and therefore has a better impact on the environment.","So, we're really excited about the peer-to-peer, learning about it in the three pilot cities, and then looking at what are the opportunities to expand from a current business today. And in many of the learnings we've already had for Maven that is being factored in and considered in our plans for Cruise. So again, good learning, continuing to expand, multiple benefits for the customer from a greenhouse gas perspective, and we see those learnings being leveraged in autonomous.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","That's very helpful. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Guggenheim.","Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Good morning.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Good morning.","Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities LLC","I was hoping to come back to your first half to second half walk and specifically for GMNA. You're obviously assuming your very nice \u2013 or I guess a material improvement in both EBIT and margin for the second half, and you mentioned the factors behind that. I was just curious if you could just give an order of dimension for those for those factors because if my understanding is right you have commodities, that's where the lag will probably be a larger headwind in the second half, but then you have production up and then you have pricing which you expect to be stronger especially in the fourth quarter. So, any sense you can give us on dimensioning these factors?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Boy, I hesitate to do that because then, in Q3 and Q4, you'll be asking for a reconciliation of that. I would just say that when you look at \u2013 the biggest driver of the improvement, the biggest tailwind in the second half will be mix. We're going to be up roughly 100,000 crew cabs in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year.","Second, the pricing dimension of that is pretty favorable, and I would put that in the zip code of $1 billion dollars of net price. And that's largely related to majors as well as typical model year 2019 pricing. So those two factors together are a significant $1 billion tailwind.","Headwinds, overall, in the second half of the year overall volume is going to be down and you know that July and December are our shut down months, and we always have lower production in the second half. As I mentioned, cost is going to be up, call it in the $500 million to $600 million range. That's primarily engineering and D&A, launch-related. And then I would say the other piece of that, kind of the commodity headwind in the second half of the year unmitigated is several hundred million dollars.","So, again if I'm just dimensioning those, the biggest positive driver is mix, followed by price, which will be partially offset by the biggest driver fundamentally being volume, typical second half seasonality launch-related costs, and then commodities.","Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities LLC","All right. That's extremely helpful. And then just following up on the commodities piece, so you're obviously seeing \u2013 been increasing steadily throughout the year your estimates for the headwind. I think when you first guided this in January, it was $200 million, $300 million. Now we're obviously talking about net $1 billion. If the prices stayed at current levels, what does that headwind look like in 2019?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes. Let me \u2013 if I could go back, Emmanuel, and provide a little bit more clarity, the $1 billion net headwind for the year is not all commodities. I would say, broadly speaking, the unmitigated headwind is roughly $300 million to $400 million of FX, largely the South American piece and the unmitigated commodities $600 million to $700 million. A big portion of that falls into North America, obviously, on the commodity piece of this.","So, as we exit this year and go into next year, on a run rate basis you're talking about maybe something like a $0.5 billion in the second half of the year which would equate to $1 billion for a full year, just commodities. But it's early days and we need to see how all of these different factors, market forces that impact that play out and what other actions we can take to mitigate it. All we're seeing is with the significant run-up that we've seen in the second quarter, we just can't pull enough levers in the second half to offset that.","Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yes. That's super helpful. And just very finally, I wanted to ask you a question on Lyft. I saw that you marked up the GM stake in Lyft. Just curious what is your stay course at this point? And also more strategically, what is your plan with Lyft both with the stake and in terms of working with them? We obviously noticed Dan left the board last month, and so, what can you tell us about the plans going forward?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes. Relative to the value of the Lyft investment, we don't disclose that. We did, obviously with their latest funding round, pick up a gain which was booked in the second quarter as you noted relative to the strategy. And I'll turn it over to Mary.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Yes. So, again, we have a good relationship with Lyft. Other than drivers currently using the Maven Gig product, we don't have any formal joint projects going on right now. But as we have said, as we move into deploying AV vehicles, we're looking at will we deploy with one partner, two partners, or go on our own. So, I don't have anything further to share with plans with Lyft right now, but that's what we've said, and we continue to believe.","Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Good morning. A question for you on the Cruise spend. Halfway through the year, we're at $300 million. You're still guiding to $1 billion. It implies a pretty significant ramp for 3Q, 4Q. What is that ramp associated with? Is that going to continue into 2019? So, call it $300-plus million per quarter is the right run rate, so maybe it's like $1.2 billion, maybe $1.5 billion burn in 2019. Just help us understand why it's starting to ramp, and why it hasn't yet.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes. Well, one, the Cruise spend, just Cruise, setting aside other movements in the Corp segment. I think we were somewhere in the zip code of $400 million in the first half of the year, but I'm not going to quibble on the round. Obviously, we're ramping up spending. We're hiring more engineers. There's more cost associated with the ramp-up. So, that's the spend rate to get to $1 billion in the second half of the year, and that's not inconsistent with our expectations. It wasn't going to be flat line in 2018.","I think the best way to think about spend as we go exit 2018 and going to 2019, with the Softbank investment and our $1.1 billion alongside the initial $2 billion funding for Cruise. The expectation is that we'll be funding to get them to the commercial launch milestone which we've talked about in 2019. So, that will give you an indication. I mean if we expect to spend $600 million or $700 million from that point through the balance of this calendar year, we'll probably get another $1.3 billion roughly in 2019. But hey, if we need to spend an extra $200 million or $300 million to advance this, accelerate it, we'll do that. It's a great opportunity and right now that's just our current thinking.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks, Chuck. And then thinking back to North America crossover segment, you guys were able to take share within the quarter but I think we tracked your incentives being up pretty substantially year-over-year. What are you seeing within that segment from your competitors? Is it going to get more competitive, more cash on the hood going forward or do you think you're going to be able to still maintain your kind of implied $7,000 of variable profit for a crossover? So, I think the original guide was for about $500 million of contribution from crossovers with an incremental $70,000 wholesales year-over-year?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes, I would say that when we look at the year so far and our expectations for the year, we're going to generate that kind of tailwind. I think what is driving that, there's a couple of different factors. One is we're performing better and our volume is better which is driving a bigger aggregate but the pricing dynamic is a little bit more challenging than we expected. And I think you almost need to look at this segment-by-segment, our mid-SUVs are strong and performing exceptionally well. The compact SUV segment is very, very competitive and I would expect \u2013 our baseline planning has that continuing to be very, very competitive and escalation in that. But again, the mid crossovers for us are performing really, really well, and we seem to be holding our own from a pricing perspective. But that $0.5 billion that we talked about earlier this year, that still holds, or could ultimately be slightly better than that.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And generally that's from volume?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just lastly, China JV margins were up year-over-year. It seems like we're going through maybe a bit of an air pocket in June, July. Can you walk us through how you're able to, I believe, probably take cost out, and if that's repeatable into the back half? And really, what the change in guidance is from kind of above $2 billion or at least $2 billion to now just $2 billion in JV equity income?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes. Again, big picture, we've been able over the last number of years unlike if you look at kind of the overall environment, unlike some of the competition, to maintain a pretty healthy level of equity income because of improved mix and cost efficiency. That drove the business results in the first half of the year largely.","In addition, there was a favorable FX component in the first half of the year. The renminbi had strengthened versus last year and versus expectations. As we look at the second half of the year \u2013 we earned $1.2 billion of equity income in the first half of the year. When we look at the second half of the year, clearly, we're in a dynamic now where the renminbi is weaker, and whether or not it's related to all the trade situation and everything else, I'll let somebody else opine.","We expect more competition in the luxury segment because there's a significant number of launches which will drive a bit of a headwind from a pricing perspective, and we're launching 10 new models in the second half of the year which will drive launch cost up. So, I would expect the second half to be down versus the first half. With that said, we still expect very strong equity income in China and it's going to be $2 billion-ish as we go through the year. We're still very, very constructive there, but let's see how some of these other issues play out.","And I think importantly, as Mary noted in her opening comments, we've got a very strong position there, we've got a strong partnership that's been built over a number of years. But what's not built into our plan in the second half of the year is if things could change relative to that overall China relationship and sentiment vis-\u00e0-vis American companies. That's a pretty significant uncertainty depending on where some of these other trade discussions go.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Super helpful. Thank you very much for the detail, Chuck","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. The first question, just want to build off where you ended there, Chuck. On the potential anti-U.S. sentiment in China. I agree, I actually think that's the hardest to define, but single biggest risk facing GM or brands in China, especially if you look at the experience of Japanese and Koreans when there were similar kinds of national disputes and territorial disputes. Any sign of that right now or is this just \u2013 I know it's not on the numbers, but anything you're seeing all?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","No. We have not seen any of that yet. And obviously, we're very cognizant of what happened to the Japanese and the Koreans and certainly have thought through those potential implications. But again, it starts with a very, very strong relationship with our partner. But we have not seen anything yet.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. The second question is for Mary and on SoftBank. Mary, first of all, I want to \u2013 as on the side, thank you for your very, very thoughtful message on Sergio. I thought that was 100% class, and it meant a lot to a lot of people including me, Mary. So, SoftBank relationship with Uber, you've been developing the relationship more deeply with Uber kind of pulling away at least ostensibly from the outside, from Lyft, understandably these things move on. I guess what are you \u2013 are investors wrong to read into that there could be a number of commercial technological business opportunities within the SoftBank-Uber relationship that may be accelerating now post the investment in Cruise?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Well, I think we're going to do, at GM Cruise, what's in the best interest of the General Motors shareholder. And so, I'd like to think that we have a good relationship in the United States with both Lyft and Uber and across the globe with many of the other ride-sharing companies. Clearly, having the relationship and the investment from SoftBank does give us an opportunity to more directly look at opportunities with some of the different ride-sharing companies that they're involved in around the world, although many of those we already had strong relationships before. So, again we're just \u2013 this is a very dynamic space right now. It all gets gated and really the value gets created when you have the technology developed that you can deploy and meet the safety standards. But we're considering many, many options, and I think it's one of the assets that comes with the SoftBank relationship that we formed.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And maybe my last one back to Chuck, the Korean situation, I'm sorry if I missed anything in the prepared remarks, but could you just appraise us on where we are in terms of timing of one-off costs as you rationalize capacity there? And any delta and ongoing profitability as a result of those charges and the efforts with the union and the resources there? Thanks.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Sure. The vast majority of the charges actually rolled through our Q1 results. We had a tail effect which we expected of a couple hundred million dollars that rolled through in Q2. It was the final tranche of the VSPs and some supplier-related claims associated with the restructuring and again that was all consistent. There was a fairly significant cash impact in the second quarter as we ultimately paid the separation payments to the employees roughly $700 million. So, I'd say as we move through Q2, this is \u2013 the costs itself are largely behind us. As we talked about before, at an enterprise level, the run rate benefit associated with the restructuring there, both the Gunsan closure, the concessions that we negotiated with the union, et cetera, are in the zip code of $400 million a year. And we would expect to see some of that roll through starting in the third quarter and ramping after that and getting the run rate in 2019, that's broadly speaking.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","All right. That's very clear, Chuck, and thanks, everybody.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. I have a couple of questions. First, it's primarily on GMNA raw mats. When you say raw materials, it sounds like you're including both direct purchases from steel and aluminum suppliers, mills, as well as what's indexed on your supplier contracts. A, is that correct? And B, given that GM in the bad old days used to try to renegotiate the contract with suppliers and get some of those commodity costs saves down, how are you thinking about that relationship with those indexed commodity costs this time?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes. The answer to your first question is it's the broad index of product and steel. And I would also broaden that to say when we talk about commodities\/raw material that also includes oil-based like resins and diesel and all of those input costs that go in. The biggest driver though, going back to what I talked about before, at least the unexpected or accelerated pressure is really on the steel side of the business. So, lookit, three, four years ago, five years ago, we embarked on a path with our suppliers around having a more strategic long term relationship and working constructively and proactively instead of what we used to do in the past. And I think that that has been very, very beneficial for us when you think about our relationship, when you think about the opportunity to drive continued productivity, when you think about opportunities across the value chain, one input is cost, one input is efficiency, one input is warranty, one input is looking at global footprint and supporting us where we want to go, and I think we're going to continue that relationship. Where there's an opportunity to try to mitigate some of these headwinds through discussions and negotiating with suppliers, we're going to do that. But our first and foremost approach isn't to just go back to the suppliers and say no, right. As a matter of fact, index flows through, and then we'll work with suppliers to see what we can do to mitigate that through efficiency.","On the flip side, the vast majority of our raw materials are not indexed. And clearly, there's pressure from suppliers on that side of it to escalate the component costs, take that into account, and we've been very, very proactive working with suppliers to try to mitigate that as well and we'll continue to do that.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Second question, over to trade. One of the proposals on the table and maybe light at the end of the NAFTA tunnel is to move to 40% high wage content on NAFTA vehicles coming up from Mexico obviously with the Canada, U.S. rates that already apply there. Can you give us a sense of what your content is currently? And then if that did go through, what you would be thinking about either in your factories or your supply chain to hit that content level?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","So, I'm not going to get into the details of where we are from that level. But what I will share is we are working closely with the trade representatives to make sure that we maintain an overall cost base that allows us to be competitive globally and to help understand the intricacies of that. So, I'm not going to give you specific details. We're well aware of it, assessing it, and providing quite a bit of input.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And I guess as just a final question, Mary, on that note, with the sad departure of Sergio from the auto scene, are you stepping up as sort of the senior CEO in auto land who's been around the political world for a while to sort of fill some of that gap?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Well, clearly I'm going to do what I think is on the best interest of General Motors and in the best interest of all of our shareowners and that is my focus. And we work with our trade association to try, where we can, to come to an agreement to have a strong and appropriate voice into the administration, into governments around the world. But I think that's more for others to decide, not me.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks for taking my question. Can you provide any color on what you could do if tariffs were imposed particularly since I know you have a lot of production down in Mexico, and that would be potentially a risk under Section 232?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","I would say, there's almost an infinite number of things that could happen and what exactly would be a part of it. So, I'm not going to hypothesize on a broad base of a Section 232 or something specific with NAFTA. I would just again focus on the fact that I think it's in everyone's best interest to have a strong U.S. auto industry. It's a big provider of quality jobs. And we're also an industry that has high capital investment, so you don't move things on a dime, and making sure \u2013 and we've spent a lot of time with the administration and the appropriate departments to make sure everybody understands that. And we believe that there's a path for NAFTA to get resolved in some of these other issues and we're going to continue on that path.","Clearly, if there's something specific comes out, we will respond quickly to the fullest extent that we can. But I think right now we're more focused on providing the right input so there's a right understanding made and things don't happen with \u2013 decisions aren't made that have unintended consequences that don't serve anybody.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Any color on what, if you have \u2013 20% has been thrown out there as a tariff, I mean, what would that mean for your overall cost and interest?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Yes, again, as I've spent a lot of time on trade in this last several months, there's a lot of intricacies and details that really matter and drive what will be the end impact. So, I really can't speculate on something like that.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Any color on Corporate\/Other, it's been strong year-to-date? I think you mentioned Lyft revaluation was the help in the quarter. How much was that on the quarter? And what are the other items that are helping there, just kind of a broad bucket?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes. The benefit from Lyft in the quarter was about $140 million, the revaluation associated with Lyft. We also had some improvement in our PSA recall from the transaction that we did last year. We have warrants and those get mark-to-market every quarter depending on what happens to PSA's stock price and, obviously, they've been on a favorable trajectory. Those would be the two biggest drivers of what we've seen so far, Colin, year-to-date and in the second quarter.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And just lastly, I mean any thoughts on the already announced tariffs in China? Does that actually create an opportunity for you? Some of your competitor luxury products will get some pretty large tariffs and you're pretty localized in Cadillac.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","We're pretty localized across the board. We're the only vehicle that \u2013 right now \u2013 our general strategy is build where we sell. And so, we have a lot of manufacturing capability in China. There are some iconic Chevy products that we send there. And then of course the Buick Envision is sent here although it's important to note on the Buick Envision, the majority of Buick Envisions are sold in China. It's very strong in that market. And it wouldn't be something that we'd capitalize here so it's just something like bringing the low quantity or low volume of Buick Envisions that we bring here provides customer choice. And we think that's important as well to round up the portfolio and to do that efficiently. But again, we generally are building most of the products we sell there.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. All right. Thanks for taking my questions.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Sure. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing remarks.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Well, I want to thank everybody for participating. And I want to note, we are working hard executing our plan and we are committed to managing this business with focus, discipline and integrity. Our business fundamentals and our execution remain strong. We are optimistic about the industry, our strong portfolio of cars, trucks and SUVs, our position in key markets and in the technology and leadership that we have demonstrated in many aspects of the future of personal mobility.","Our new crossovers and SUVs are growing sales and share in an increasingly competitive segments, and we're excited about the financial opportunities that our new full-sized trucks provide for the rest of the year and into 2019 and beyond. At the same time, we are connecting with like-minded investors and partners to commercialize self-driving vehicles and to realize an all-electric future.","Before I close, I do want to recognize Chuck for his four decades of service and dedication to this company. And I also want to congratulate Dhivya on her new role as EVP and CFO, as well as Rocky Gupta who becomes the Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations. I think we all know that Chuck has played a very big part in developing and executing our core and future business strategies. In addition, he has been a very important and trusted advisor to me and I know he has strong relationships with many of you.","With Dhivya's strong leadership skills and experience. I am confident that she and her team will build on the results that Chuck has been a major driver of, and help us continue to build and drive success and shareholder value. But I do want to say Chuck, thank you very, very much.","So, as I close, I want to leave you with this, even with the recent macroeconomic challenges, I continue to be confident about this company's ability to create long-term shareholder value and a safer, better and more sustainable world for our customers and that's what we're committed to do as we execute our zero crashes, zero emissions, zero congestion vision.","So, thank you all for participating.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Tuesday, February 7, 2017.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Randy Arickx, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Randy Arickx - General Motors Co.","Thanks, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us, as we review GM's financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2016. Our press release was issued this morning and the conference call materials are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast.

The content of our call will be governed by this language. In the room today we also have Tom Timko, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer and Dhivya Suryadevara, Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Investment Officer to assist in answering your questions.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Mary Barra.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Thanks, Randy, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. GM delivered a second straight year of record earnings in 2016, setting records for net revenue, EBIT-adjusted, EBIT-adjusted margins, EPS diluted-adjusted and automotive-adjusted free cash flow.","Highlights and results for the full year include net revenue of $166 billion, up 9% year-over-year. EBIT-adjusted of $12.5 billion, up nearly 16% from a year ago. EBIT-adjusted margins of 7.5%, up more than 40 basis points.","Net income of $9.4 billion, EPS-diluted adjusted of $6.12, up 22%. EBIT adjusted of $12 billion in North America, up from $11 billion and EBIT-adjusted margins of more than 10% for second straight year.","Automotive-adjusted free cash flow was $6.9 billion, up $4.7 billion. ROIC adjusted of nearly 29% was up 1.7 percentage points, demonstrating the positive impact of our disciplined capital allocation framework. And we returned $4.8 billion to shareholders in 2016 through a combination of share buybacks and dividends. By nearly every measure, 2016 was a great year. And this morning, we are announcing record global sales for the fourth consecutive year at nearly 10 million vehicles. This underscores the progress we are making in strengthening our brands and putting the customers at the center of everything we do.","Our results last year were largely driven by growing retail share in North America, another year of record sales in China, and strong margins in both regions, so let me go a little deeper into each of the regions. First, in GM North America, GM's U.S. brands sold more than 3 million vehicles and gained a 0.5 percentage point of retail share in 2016, the largest of any full-line automaker and this is thanks to the disciplined go-to-market strategy we've been utilizing. Chevrolet was the fastest-growing U.S. brand led by strong gains in mid-size pickups, small crossovers and large SUVs, gaining a 0.5 percentage point of U.S. retail market share.","In the U.S., full-year GM average transaction prices were about $35,400, about $4,300 above the industry average, and up $750 over the 2015 average.","Full-year incentive spending as a percent of ATP was 12%, well below domestic and many other global competitors. And on the quality front our progress continues. Consumers Report recommended 12 GM models in its annual reliability survey and Buick was the first domestic brand included in the survey's top three brands.","In the fourth quarter, we delivered the first Chevrolet Bolt EV to dealers and customers in California with an EPA estimated 238 miles of range it has won multiple awards including the 2017 North American Car of the Year, Motor Trend Car of the Year and Green Car Journal's Car of the Year and others.","More launches in hot crossover segments are coming in 2018. We have the Chevrolet Equinox and Traverse, the GMC Terrain, which will join the newer entries like the GMC Acadia, the Buick Envision and the Cadillac XT5 to form one of the industry's precious line ups in the very important SUV segment.","In China, China drove record sales and strong margins in a very volatile environment. GM and its joint ventures delivered nearly 3.9 million vehicles, up 7% over a record 2015. Cadillac, Buick and Baojun deliveries reached all-time high.","GM launched 13 new models in 2016 and we plan to introduce 18 new or refreshed models across five brands this year.","Cadillac retail sales were up nearly 46% for the year. The brand sold more than 100,000 vehicles, driving global sales up 11% to a 30-year high. And Baojun sales rose 49%, with strong products like the 730 MPV, and the 560 SUV, and the new Baojun 310 hatchback.","As we look at Europe, without the negative impact of Brexit, we would have achieved breakeven in 2016. However, we're not satisfied with these results, and the team is focused on mitigating the effect through further cost efficiencies and by leveraging the momentum of a fresh Opel\/Vauxhall portfolio.","Opel\/Vauxhall full-year sales rose 4% on the strength of the Astra, which was the European Car of the Year, along with the Zafira and the MOKKA X. Sales improved in 18 of 22 markets, including Germany.","For 2017, we are planning seven launches including the Ampera-e. In South America, we see an opportunity for significant year-over-year improvement because of our continued work to restructure the business.","Chevrolet continues its market leadership in our key market of Brazil, where we successfully launched 12 products in 2016, and for the second consecutive year, Onix was the top-selling vehicle.","In Q4, GM led the entire region with 16.8% market share, and calendar year share was 15.9%, up a 0.5 percentage point year-over-year.","So let me make a few comments also about the future of personal mobility. We made remarkable progress last year in technology and innovation, especially in the game-changing technologies that are helping us redefine personal mobility.","We launched Maven, our personal mobility brand and scaled it up very quickly. It is operating in 16 cities and its Express Drive program for Lyft drivers has about 5,000 vehicles with plan to add several 100 Bolt EVs in California. And we are learning a great deal about developing transportation-as-a-service in urban markets, due to our work with Maven.","By mobilizing in-house talent and acquiring Cruise Automation, we're now making progress on autonomous as well. We're testing more than 40 autonomous Bolt EVs on public roads in Metro Detroit, San Francisco, and Scottsdale. And last December, we announced that we plan to be the first high-volume OEM to build fully autonomous test vehicles in a mass production assembly plant. And in terms of connectivity, OnStar celebrated its 20th anniversary, reaching 1.5 billion customer interactions and putting nearly 12 million OnStar-connected vehicles on the road globally and entered into an industry-first partnership with IBM Watson to launch OnStar Go.","So, if I look at where we are as we start 2017, I'm very proud of the progress we've made and I'm confident that we can do even more and build on our momentum. As we shared last month in the Deutsche Bank Conference, in 2017, we expect earnings per share diluted adjusted of $6 to $6.50 per share. We also expect to improve revenues and maintain or improve EBIT-adjusted and EBIT-adjusted margins.","In addition, we expect to generate about $6 billion in automotive-adjusted free cash flow. Based on our outlook, our board approved an additional $5 billion in common stock repurchases. This increase in our stock buyback program is further proof that we are committed to driving shareholder value and we remain committed to generating strong business results that will eventually be appreciated by the market.","Our projections for improved performance in 2017 are based on a number of factors. First, we have continued strong sales and income in North America and China. Economic indicators show significantly improved optimism in the U.S. economy and we believe auto sales will continue to be at or near record levels. We also have an intense focus on material, logistics, manufacturing, and general administration costs. Frankly, we're looking at cost in all areas of the business.","Last month, we raised our 2018 cost efficiency target from $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion. We also have growth of adjacent businesses like GM Financial, Customer Care and Aftersales, OnStar, and Maven. And finally, our strong vehicle launch cadence. We expect our percentage of global volume from new or refreshed models to grow to 38% in the 2017 through 2020 timeframe, with more than half in the popular crossover truck and SUV segments.","We appreciate that there will be headwinds, but I am confident that we have the right strategy and the right team to manage them with integrity and to drive achievement of our commitments. As I said when we gave our full-year outlook, we are here to win.","So now, let me turn it over to Chuck.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Thanks, Mary. I'd like to provide some perspective on the quarter and our results for the full year, as well as provide additional insights into our 2017 outlook. Solid and as-expected Q4 results capped another record year of earnings as we exceeded the commitments we outlined for 2016. EBIT-adjusted was a record $12.5 billion, up $1.7 billion year-over-year. EBIT-adjusted margin was a record 7.5%, up 40 basis points year-over-year. Net revenue was a record $166.4 billion, up $14 billion year-over-year. Our strong results for the year were driven by record results in North America and GM Financial, sustained strong performance in China, and continued improvements in South America and Europe.","And it was these strong results in 2016 and our outlook for 2017 that gave us confidence to announce the additional $5 billion in common stock repurchases. We are committed to returning all available free cash flow to shareholders with a focus on share buybacks. This is best reflected in our recent decision to maintain the current dividend per share and reallocate the released cash from a smaller share count to make additional share repurchases.","Turning to the fourth quarter, we generated $43.9 billion in net revenue, $2.4 billion in EBIT-adjusted and delivered a $1.28 in earnings per share diluted adjusted. This is very much in line with our prior guidance.","In North America, revenue was a record $119 billion for the year, up $12.4 billion year-over-year. EBIT-adjusted grew to a record $12 billion for the year, up $1 billion year-over-year. Our EBIT-adjusted margin was 10.1%, achieving our target of sustaining strong margins of 10% plus for the year. In fact, North America has now achieved 10% plus EBIT-adjusted margins for two straight years, and we expect to once again generate a 10% plus margin in North America in 2017.","In Q4, North America generated $2.6 billion of EBIT-adjusted off a record $31.3 billion of revenue, down $200 million year-over-year. Volume and price were net positives, which were offset with costs, mix and FX. We continue to view the U.S. industry as healthy and supportive of our strong earnings outlook. The U.S. light vehicle industry finished the year with a 17.5 million units sold, and we continue to expect the industry to remain strong into 2017 and over the foreseeable future.","We remain absolutely committed to our disciplined, retail focus go-to-market strategy, matching supply with demand, and being thoughtful about our sales to daily rental companies. This strategy is paying off through higher retail share, higher transaction prices and better residuals.","Retail share for the full year was 16.8%, up 50 basis points versus 2015. We will continue to focus on retail share with additional planned reduction of daily rentals of approximately 30,000 units to 50,000 units in 2017.","Moving to incentives and transaction prices; for 2016, we significantly outperformed our closest competitors on incentives as a percent of ATPs. GM incentives were up 80 basis points year-over-year, while the industry was up a 100 basis points year-over-year. Furthermore, GM's average transaction price has increased at a faster rate than the industry in 2016.","Year-end day supply is well positioned at 71 days, in line with our target of 70 days. Looking ahead to Q1, we expect aggregate dealer inventory levels to remain higher than a year ago, as the industry remained strong and we built dealer stock ahead of our upcoming crossover launches. Having said that, we will continue to manage inventories with discipline and take the necessary actions as demonstrated by our recent shift reductions to match current production with demand.","Okay. Moving on to the rest of the world, China continues to deliver solid results with equity income of $2 billion for the full year, about equal to a year ago. While we see slower growth in China for 2017, we are confident our new launches will improve our mix and enable us to continue to deliver strong equity income.","After years of depressed conditions in South America, we're starting to see light at the end of the tunnel. We have worked hard at restructuring our business and lowering our breakeven point. Our efforts continue to payoff. The team narrowed losses by nearly $250 million this year compared to 2015 in a more challenging environment. We anticipate continued improvement in South America throughout 2017.","Shifting to Europe. As Mary stated earlier, we're not satisfied with these results. Despite a $300 million impact from Brexit, we reduced losses by $550 million year-over-year, and would have achieved our breakeven objective absent Brexit. However, Brexit is a reality and we need to take renewed actions to get back on the path to a sustainable business and we will. Heading into 2017, we would expect relatively flat performance versus 2016 as we work to mitigate the Brexit impact.","A few comments on GM Financial and our Corp segment. GM Financial posted record revenue of $9.6 billion and record earnings before tax adjusted of $900 million, up $100 million year-over-year.","Earnings assets grew 36% to about $77 billion, supporting expected future earnings growth. We anticipate continued earnings before tax growth in 2017, as we execute the full captive strategy in the United States.","In the Corp segment, costs were about $400 million for Q4, which resulted in costs of about $900 million for the year. The increased costs in the quarter were primarily related to our investments in autonomous and mobility. These costs will continue to be captured in the Corp sector. We expect a similar level of total quarterly corporate sector costs throughout 2017 as we saw in Q4.","Turning to cash flow and capital allocation, adjusted automotive free cash flow grew to $6.9 billion for the year, up $4.7 billion year-over-year. These results include increased capital spending of $1.7 billion, as we made investments in our portfolio, in line with our previously-communicated plan.","Q4 adjusted automotive free cash flow grew by $2 billion year-over-year, primarily driven by timing in working capital, including rental car activity and sales allowance accruals. We anticipate this effect to partially reverse in 2017. However, we still expect to generate approximately $6 billion in automotive free cash flow this year, consistent with the guidance we provided at the Deutsche Bank Conference.","Our strong cash flow generation and earnings growth continues to support a significant return on capital to shareholders, in line with our capital allocation framework. We returned $4.8 billion to shareholders throughout the year, including $2.3 billion in common stock dividends and $2.5 billion in share repurchases, completing our initial $5 billion authorization one quarter early.","In Q4, the company also completed the first $1 billion of the next $4 billion authorization. We expect to complete the remaining $3 billion in 2017. Last month, we announced the third share repurchase authorization of $5 billion to be completed as expeditiously as possible. The underfunded status of the U.S. pension plans improved by $3.2 billion in the year to $7.2 billion, due primarily to improved return on assets and contributions of $2.1 billion.","Now I want to share more details on our 2017 outlook. As we outlined last month, we expect to deliver full-year 2017 EPS diluted adjusted of $6 to $6.50. Looking at the earnings cadence for 2017, for the full company, we expect the quarterly earnings to be more evenly distributed throughout the year than in the recent past with a slightly stronger Q1 and slightly weaker Q3 due to K2 production downtime.","In North America, we expect to generate another year of 10% plus margins, primarily due to strong material cost performance and pricing driven by our new crossovers, partially offset by carryover pricing and increased content in our new launches. We see a significant opportunity for growth in adjacencies in 2017, specifically GM Financial, where we expect to once again improve earnings, as we continue to grow our U.S. captive capability.","As we look around the world, we see an opportunity for improvement year-over-year in South America as the macro conditions improve, especially in our key market of Brazil, and we see continued strong profit performance in China. We expect these key drivers will lead to another strong year, maintain our improved EBIT-adjusted and EBIT-adjusted margin and generate higher revenues compared to 2016. The company also expects to generate about $15 billion in automotive operating cash flow and $6 billion in automotive adjusted free cash flow.","Lastly, I want to say a few words regarding recent news. We are supportive of efforts by President Trump and Congress to implement tax reform that improves the competitiveness of American companies. GM continues to share job creation ideas and industry information with lawmakers to help them create proposals that will be positive for the U.S. economy and keep vehicles affordable. Within the topic of tax reform, boarder adjustment tax is an area that has drawn the most attention and speculation. As you can appreciate, at this stage there is a significant uncertainty as to what proposals will actually be enacted and we expect to have more dialogue with you over time as details emerge. At this point, we can offer high-level insight into our assessment of the industry and GM's current sourcing picture. Our analysis shows the U.S. auto industry on average derives in the mid-50% range of its content from non-U.S. sources.","Ours is lower. If current proposals are enacted, we expect to be less affected than some others. We're also taking a holistic view in considering other favorable elements of tax reform. For example, we would receive a benefit from our meaningful annual U.S. exports.","Importantly, we expect our cash taxes to remain low over the next few years. We believe foreign-exchange, GDP growth and how costs and benefits are allocated through the supply chain are among the major variables that will ultimately dictate the economic outcome for GM and the industry.","We'll continue to work with our government on tax reform measures that support U.S. manufacturing and the U.S. economy. So to sum it up, quarter in line with expectations, a record full year in 2016 and we will continue to meet our commitments in 2017 as we have done over the past three years.","That concludes our opening comments. We'll now move to the question-and-answer portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, guys.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Good morning.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a first question on the 2017 guidance, particularly in North America and when we think about this, the changeover costs for the crossovers is going to be met with some upside revenue because the product will actually launch. But when you look at the truck changeover on the actions you're taking in the second half of the year, getting real benefit on the revenue side is not going to occur until 2018, I'm just curious, if you can kind of delineate what level of pressure you're expecting from those truck changeover costs in the second half of the year, and really when you expect the benefit from the revenue to occur as we get into 2018?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes, John. Good try to get me to answer when we're going to launch the next-generation truck. That's going to happen....","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","What's coming?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes. No doubt. What I would say, when I look at North American in total, again starting with the overall guidance, we expect another strong year of 10% plus margins in North America. The big drivers again with the puts and takes, volume and mix roughly are going to be flat. Volume will be down year-over-year, partially due to our taking action on passenger cars, and partially due to the ramp-up of the new crossovers and some of the changeover of the trucks, but mix will be favorable fundamentally offsetting that.","Price will be favorable and costs will be favorable. Those two will largely or more than offset FX. Those are the biggest drivers in 2017 for North America.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, it sounds like the truck changeover costs are relatively low then in the second half, but are still a little bit of a headwind. Is that a fair characterization?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes. I would say that as we're going through this launch cadence, whether it's trucks or crossovers or the vehicles that we launched this year or some of the impact in fourth quarter in North America related to Duramax, you always have some of those. I wouldn't say that they're materially different in 20 \u2013 the cost themselves in 2017 versus 2016, the bigger impact is on the volume side.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's helpful. And then, secondly, I was just wondering if you could talk about your lease penetration in the fourth quarter and the full year in 2016. What generally sort of your marketing plans are between sort of lease subvention and marketing or incentive dollars in 2017 and what you're seeing in the industry, because it seems like there are some divergent views among the automakers, I'm just curious what you're seeing?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes. Lease penetration in 2016 in the fourth quarter was roughly 25%, 26%. That feels like the right number for us relative to overall penetration when you look at the makeup of our products whether luxury mix, truck mix and generally that would be running at an appropriate level from an industry perspective. With low interest rates, feels to me from an industry perspective that leasing is filling some of the gap on subvented financing and that's been running very low. So the biggest drivers are cash deals, and then leasing, and then standard \u2013 kind of standard payment term is very low subvented financing at this point.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just lastly, I know this is kind of a tough question to answer at this point because we're not even sure what policy issues are going to be. Policy has got to actually settle in North America. But, Mary, in your discussion with Trump and the new administration, are you hearing anything about sort of a recognition that there could be sort of a response overseas, particularly in China, which is a very important market for you, sort of near-term and long-term, that might not be so great for your business. Is that being taken into the calculus as these decisions are being made or is this more just U.S. focused in the discussion so far?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Well, I think if you look at, there's a wide range of topics whether it's tax, trade, regulations and there's a lot of, I'll say, information being shared just to level the foundation. For instance, I've shared a lot of information about the dynamics in the auto industry and how all those things would be impacted. So, I would say, right now it's very constructive dialog and the administration really listening to the input that we have and to kind of put things in context. So that's where we're at right now, John.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Mary, I just got two questions for you. First on safety, Toyota has targeted a 100% of their vehicles sold in the U.S. to have active safety in AEB of some form as standard by the end of this year. That's their goal and sounds like they're on track to do that. When could we expect GM to make AEB standard on all of its vehicles to ensure the safest possible baseline technology available to all consumers regardless of their ability to spec up to the higher-trim levels?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","So, Adam, we're looking across the whole portfolio, we made the commitment with many other OEMs from a \u2013 it's a perspective for the emergency automatic braking. We're looking across and so we have the commitment made, we're looking across each of those product lines to look and see what we think is best from a customer perspective of what they are going to value, clearly it will be available, but giving the customers some choice there. So I don't have the specific rollout in front of me, but I know the team has worked across the entire portfolio across all brands to implement those plans.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Second question is more structural. Since your IPO, the S&P is up 95%, GM stock's up around 6%, I'm not trying to pick on you, because Ford stock's down over 20% from your IPO date in 2010. So there is clearly an OEM business model problem being discounted by the market and it does appear to go way beyond just GM. But look, your stock's really cheap and you admitted earlier in your comments, you think underappreciated by the market. Question is, is there something radical or structural like a change of business unit structure, legal organization structure like what Alphabet has done on the Google, something more radical that needs to be done to address the strategic concerns and risks discounted by investors or to otherwise unlock hidden value. I realize that's a very ethereal question and I ask it this way deliberately and respectfully just to see how you respond, Mary. Thank you.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Adam, so when we look at it, I kind of divide it into two pieces. One, we come to work every day looking to how do we drive shareholder value and long-term value for all of our shareholders. We believe and we've got a track record of demonstrating performance and meeting our commitments for three years now. We're going to continue to do that with our outlook for 2017. We've identified how we can continue to make this business better. I think we have more opportunity, but then also the way that we are investing in the future, which I think is huge opportunity with transportation-as-a-service, building on the platform for transportation-as-a-service is connectivity, we have a lead with OnStar and as we continue to roll that out very quickly around the globe and continue to not only provide that connectivity in each of our vehicles, but to build on what we can do with that connectivity, I believe we're just scratching the surface of what we can do with the data we have in the vehicle and continuing to add vehicle for customers.","So, I think that's a huge opportunity. Clearly on electrification, we've got a lead with the Bolt EV having that vehicle in the marketplace, getting great reviews, it's not just a great electric vehicle, it's a great vehicle and that's the feedback we're getting from customers that gives us the foundation to really push forward in electrification and be very successful from an electrification perspective leveraging our global scale, so that's something that I think is a huge opportunity.","Autonomous and transportation-as-a-service and sharing clearly the work that we're doing from an autonomous perspective and really looking from the traditional business to miles travelled, and how we can participate strongly. And that's why we've made the investments and have made great progress last year, really accelerated our progress on autonomous. And we released a video a week or two ago showing the progress and that progress is happening on a weekly basis, not monthly or quarterly.","So, I look at how we're working to make sure we're as efficient as possible in the basic business of cars, trucks and crossovers around the globe, but then looking at all the opportunity that technology has to transform this industry. And I think we're well positioned. And that's what we're working hard on every day because I think that will change the dialog and change the calculus of how this company is valued.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Colin Langan with UBS.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just following up on your comments on the potential for a border tax adjustment, could you frame the kind of cost increase you might expect if a border tax were implemented? And would you need to do any structural changes? I know some of your pickup capacity is down in Mexico; would you have to relocate it? I mean how are you sort of thinking about the planning if something actually does go through?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Well. One, I think it's too early to speculate on the potential implications of the border adjusted tax. That's one part of tax reform, there's a number of moving pieces. And what we want to do is engage constructively around how we can best work with the administration to make sure that this is good for the economy, good for manufacturing footprint. As you can imagine, very, very complicated dynamic with supply footprint, manufacturing footprint, long lead investment, so a number of moving pieces here that we want to participate in and engage in around transition timing and other aspects of this. So again, too early to speculate on what the potential implications are.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","But do you think you're better at the position than the industry, what you said in your comments?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","When I look at the percent of import content, yes, we are better positioned than the industry on average.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And in your comments, I don't think I got this right, you said in the auto other line, the Q4 run rate of $400 million would continue, I think that implies around a $500 million year-over-year increase in other auto. One, is that correct? And then when we're thinking about adjusted EBIT being higher what are the main pieces that would offset that increase?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Well, I think you're thinking about it correctly. As we talked about the expenditures that we'll be making on autonomous vehicles will be in the corporate sector, as we look to start to provide more visibility around that, especially as we start to monetize that opportunity on a go-forward basis. And the puts and takes on that as you look at the overall results, I would expect aggregate profitability to be better in North America. I would expect profitability to better in South America, in GM Financial as well, and relatively flat in Europe, relatively flat in China. Those are the big drivers.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","And just lastly, in your outlook, what is the raw material impact is that \u2013 how much of a headwind should be expect...","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","It is a headwind in 2017, I would say, in the low hundreds of millions of dollars at a corporate level at this point in time, not a significant magnitude, but certainly factored into our outlook.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Thank you very much.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning, everybody.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Good morning.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Just a follow-up on the last question. So, Chuck, I think you mentioned in 2017, North America cost should be favorable, if we tie that back into slide 16, is that sort of a fixed cost being favorable or is that the net of fixed as well as material carryover being favorable?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","The net of the two.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","The net of the two. Great. And then just as we think about the autonomous costs in 2017 and the fourth quarter, are there any metrics you can share in terms of by the end of year where you think you're going to be in terms of the size of your fleet, in terms of testing and other kind of metrics that we should be following as we track your progress?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Yes. Not at this time, I think as the year unfolds, you'll hear more about that from us of what our plans are and some of those milestones that we'll be sharing.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. And just lastly, I mean maybe for you Mary on the same topic, as you meet with the administration, I know there's a lot of discussion on tax and policy, what are your early thoughts on how the administration's looking at autonomous and future driverless cars and ride sharing, any initial thoughts on how they're approaching that element of it?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Well, I think we've had a very constructive and positive conversation about the regulatory environment and clearly putting safety at the forefront and doing the right thing for the environment. But looking at the opportunities of how do we streamline and how do we enable technology. So I think it's been a very positive dialog that has covered in a general sense autonomous.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Very helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everybody.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Hi, Rod.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I had a couple of questions. First, maybe for Mary, in your discussions in Washington about border adjustments, I'm wondering if there's been any discussion about a phase in of any changes at this point given the reality of the lead time required for any changes to the industrial footprint. And in addition to the border adjustments, do you see any potential changes to tariffs and your ability to bring in trucks without significant tariffs?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","So in the conversation that I've done a lot, as have others recognizing we had an automotive industry focused meeting as well as the strategy and policy meeting, but to really make sure everyone is grounded and understands the complexity of our supply chain as well as the capital-intensive long lead nature of our business. And I think that understanding has been well received.","Clearly, as Chuck said, there is a lot of moving pieces right now. We want to \u2013 and that's why we're at the table and also working at all levels of the administration to make sure we're providing the input because let's recognize the number of jobs that we do provide here 100,000 jobs. If you look at the number of vehicles that we sell here versus the number that is produced here, it's almost 80%. Now there is puts and takes with exports, but a very high percentage of products are built in this country.","So we've been really providing all of those facts and then clearly talking about if there are shifts that they have to happen over time. So that's the input that we've given and I would say it's been very constructive.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thanks. And just two questions on the outlook for 2017. First, at a high-level, obviously you're expecting a little bit of improvement in North America, and flat China, you said that a few times, Chuck. And presumably you're taking into account the headwinds in North America, the non-recurrence of the inventory builds and pricing maybe on legacy products, raw materials, D&A, and in China, you talked about the 5% price deflation that you're expecting. A big offset to that is the cost savings that you're expecting, the $1.5 billion. I was hoping you can maybe give us a little bit more color on the price and mix benefit that you're anticipating from the new product, the magnitude of the pipeline that you're anticipating, and how that kind of plays a role in your bridge?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","In which sector would you like me to start, North America or China?","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","North America and China. I guess whichever you want to do first.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes. So, from a North American perspective, yes, we would expect aggregate profitability to improve year-over-year. As I indicated earlier, we expect volume to be a headwind and mix to fundamentally offset that, so the favorable mix associated with some of our recently launched products. Pricing will be favorable.","Again related to our crossover launches, largely reduce sales allowances. And then, overall fix will be slightly favorable when you look at material on carryover versus fixed. Fixed costs are going to be relatively flat year-over-year. So, and that will offset some FX headwinds primarily related to the Mexican peso. So, those are the big drivers.","In China, it's the same kind of dynamic that we've been talking about. Mix will be favorable, pricing will be \u2013 we're assuming another 5% headwind. Carryover material and mix will largely offset the pricing and cost. And cost should be slightly up in China as we get the full-year ramp of some of the recently-opened facilities, but the dynamics over the last couple of years aren't changing in China.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you. And just \u2013 that's really helpful. And just lastly in your outlook for GM Financial, how are you thinking about the impact of the higher borrowing costs and lower residuals in the forecast?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Factored in. I mean we factored in the expectations from a used \u2013 at least ALG and others expectations for what's happened with used car pricing. So, a continued normalization of used car pricing obviously we factor into our pricing and cost of funds expectations continuously rising interest. So, that's factored in.","I mean going back to the conference we were at in January, we laid out all of the downsides and headwinds that we saw in 2017 and what we're doing to mitigate that in the context of our guidance. And the fact as you mentioned, we're part of that pricing dynamic, continued investment and new technologies, the pricing environment in the U.S. and China, for example, raw material headwinds in 2017 versus 2016. FX, from a global perspective, I mean that dynamics is not getting any better, but when you look at the things that were under our control, cost, our product launch cadence, which will improve mix and pricing. We again are confident that we're going to see strong results again in 2017.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Thanks, Rod.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions here. It's been asked a couple of times, Rod just asked it too. On leasing and residual values, how did your leasing percentage progress throughout the year? I think you said 26% for the fourth quarter. It sounds like you don't expect to see a slowdown in that or a pullback in leasing, as you're going into 2017. Part of that I imagine is because you're driving the higher prime business through GMF and expect to continue to keep that high. But really wanted to dig into what is the residual value forecast that you have going forward in your model for 2017 earnings? We've seen Ford and now Toyota take down the residual value forecast. Maybe they were just a little bit more aggressive on what residual values would look like before it had to come down. But trying to understand what you're baking in from a price decrease year-over-year for those vehicles?","And then understandingly I know you're pulling back on daily rental, but that's only half the story. If you're continuing to drive lease penetration in the same rates that you are at some point in time, is there not going to be an increased supply of your vehicles coming off lease that could be detrimental to residual values in the 2018-2019 timeframe?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Just to try to answer those in the order that they came in, David. As we move through 2016 calendar year, our lease penetrations came down. Early, you may recall, earlier in the year first quarter, second quarter 2016, lease penetrations were up in the high 20s% and we moved them down to where we ended. As I said, mid-20% is the appropriate level and that's something that we would continue to manage.","Relative to our lease residual exposure or our thinking of lease residual, I've covered this before vis-\u00e0-vis some of the competition, we've got a different mix because GM Financial has been leasing vehicles and been the captive lease provider only for the last couple of years. We have a significantly different mix, lower penetration of passenger cars, higher penetration of trucks and SUVs, and I'm not going to give you specifics on what we're assuming from used car. All I would say is, we're anticipating continued moderation and normalization of used car pricing, not inconsistent with third party type data that you could get out there over the next two to three years. I would say, in total, in the range of about 7% over the next two to three years, but I'm not going to give a year-to-year specific.","And one of the fundamentals relative to how we're running the business residual modeling (45:34), we're working with GMF, our Express Drive 100% of our vehicles being remarketed by GMF is so that we can efficiently absorb and distribute in a way that is not detrimental to residuals the vehicles that are coming off lease. And that's one of the reasons we've significantly reduced our daily rental sales as well. So taking in balance, I think we've got a reasonably balanced view of what's going to happen from a residual perspective over the next number of years.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's very helpful. And then taking your comments on GM pricing, obviously you expect it to be up in the back of product cadence. What are you anticipating for the overall market and how could that potentially change your view. I asked that because during this 3Q 2016 earnings call, I think we were talking about lower sequential incentives from 3Q 2016 to 4Q 2016. However from the data that we look at, it seemed as if GM incentives did go up sequentially in the fourth quarter, and that's partially being market driven.","Given where you ended the January month with your days sales of inventory for passenger cars, as well as for light trucks, I mean, are you anticipating seeing the market continue to drive incentives higher. Obviously I think you guys pulled back a little bit in the quarter and that's why your sales were a little bit lower than where some of us expected. But just trying to understand where you see the overall market going from a pricing perspective, relative to your expectations where you have a product cadence that should be driving positive price?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes. I would say the following, over the last number of years the pricing environment has been moderating. If you look at overall incentive spend as a percentage of transaction price, it's been inching up on a consistent basis, which is certainly not unexpected where we are in the cycle. We continue to be very disciplined, our actual incentive spend compared to the industry has come down back, three or four years ago we were running at 110% of industry, in the 2016 calendar year, we're closer to 103% or 104%.","And I think that just highlights the strength of our product lineup. I would expect to see incentive spending inch up again in 2017. We said that we expected continued pricing challenges or competitive pricing environment in the United States and China. Within that though, when you look at our launch cadence, let's remember, in 2016 we had the oldest compact and mid-crossover lineup in the industry and still performed very well, that's going to be completely refreshed, which should provide an opportunity.","Trucks continue to perform very well, demand is strong, we're running all of our plants on three shifts, full-on. So, supply and demand in balance. Where we have challenges is our cars and we're aligning supply and demand on that by cutting production. So, on balance, a more challenging pricing environment, but we think we're well positioned within that given our product launch cadence.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you. It's very helpful.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Ryan Brinkman, JPMorgan.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just regarding the increase in corporate and eliminations expense in 4Q on autonomous investments, is that due to an actual acceleration in these autonomous investments or potentially to newly or increasingly accounting for them in the corporate and eliminations line or both, and then how should we think about these investments tracking going forward, roughly at the 4Q level or maybe something less? And then I imagine there is still no change right to the guidance that your cost cutting program over the next several years is expected to more than compensate for increased investments and all emerging technologies like electrification, mobility and autonomy such that net cost savings will be a net driver of higher EBIT going forward, is that right?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","The last point that is correct. To your first question, that Q4 I would say was run rate when we have ramped up the AV Engineering and Cruise Automation at roughly plus or minus $150 million a quarter. We weren't spending very much at all until we got into the fourth quarter and I would expect to see a run rate similar to that in 2017, roughly $150 million a quarter, that will we believe be sufficient because we've already got the architecture with the Bolt to put us in a strong position from an AV standpoint and when you look at the overall corporate sector you've get that year-over-year roughly $450 million increase plus there is some incremental legal expense in 2017 versus 2016 related to the ignition switch activities, and as I think about that beyond 2017 who knows, but that should start to moderate beyond that.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great, thanks. And then just my last question is on China. After the earnings there tracked very strong but the margin just a little softer. Is it still the case that the causal factors broken out in the GMIO EBIT bridge in slide 20 that those exclude non-consolidated operations with all of the change in equity income due to whatever causal factor in that other category? And then if so, can you speak directionally to the impact of volume mix, price cost in 4Q? And then, how you would expect these drivers to net out going forward?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","So, the EBIT bridge is on a consolidated basis, so we exclude China. We report China equity income, the drivers of China equity income in 2016 similar to 2015, pretty similar volumes positive, mix is positive, pricing has been a 5% headwind, material cost performance has been a positive. And then as we ramped up plants, the fixed cost has inched up; net-net, in that dynamic we've been able to maintain the equity income, but you've seen the margin compression which we've talked about before on a go-forward basis, due primarily the pricing that the margins were going to compress and we saw that play out in 2016.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And how do you expect that to track maybe in 2017, these different drivers?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Sure. I think the drivers of the industry over there are very, very consistent, higher volume, better mix, pricing is going to be a headwind kind of in the same zip code in the 5% range, material cost efficiency will be a tailwind. And then, between their cost down, efficiency up and full run rate and the plant's fixed cost will be up slightly on a year-over-year basis, but generally consistent with what's been driving the business the last couple of years.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Very helpful. Thank you.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks for squeezing me in here. Chuck, the first question is, in the fourth quarter, in North America, of the $1.2 billion in volume, how much of that was \u2013 if you could dimensionalize it from the stocking up, especially since I believe on a year-over-year basis and you know for the comp purposes in the fourth quarter 2015 you were still destocking?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah, for the fourth quarter 2016 versus 2015, inventory build because you've got to look at the change and the change was about a 100,000 units and when I look at the net impact of that, about a $100 million, volume was up, but mix was unfavorable because a lot of that stock was building up stock of passenger vehicles, which we're now addressing. So that's kind of the impact in the fourth quarter.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, right. And you said volume a headwind for 2017, is it fair to assume you still have a little bit of stocking up and then it starts to tail off in terms of cadence.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Absolutely consistent with what we talked about back in December. We will be building inventories, we moved through kind of first half of the year. We'll be addressing the passenger car part of this with the shift reductions that we've announced. But we'll build inventory of our crossovers leading into the launch as well as trucks and then inventory will normalize in the second half, very similar to the dynamic we had when we transitioned from the GMT900 to the K2 and then we would expect to end 2017 in the same zip code as 2016, roughly 70 days' supply.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then on the autonomous and mobility cost not to beat the dead horse, but I mean you're bringing out in corporate. If you were to somehow allocate it by region, is most of that in North America? And then related, where are your electrification costs or how are those been allocated, are those also in corporate, or are those to the regions?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Well, the electrification costs depending on, they end up in the vehicles themselves and if it's engineering costs associated with electrification, it goes to the region fundamentally based on engineering resources deployed. The reason that we're separating autonomous is because we would expect over time, as we continue to move that business along with Maven forward into a commercial piece of the business that we want to make sure that there is visibility around that on the commercial side of autonomous vehicles, because we would expect to commercialize that obviously.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Are you willing to share how much in 2016 roughly you think you spent on electrification?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","That would have been part of our overall engineering expense. So certainly a portion of the engineering expense, but I'm not going to break that out separately.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And our final question today will come from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. A couple of quick questions. First, can you comment a bit, we beat the border adjustment tax to death, but prior to NAFTA there was a thing called a Chicken Tax, which my \u2013 maybe just could you comment on, my understanding is that still in effect and preventing imports of things like the Colorado and whatnot from Thailand. Would that also apply in the chance that NAFTA goes away to Mexico and if so have there been discussions given the importance of pickup truck lines to dare we say red states about whether that makes sense to apply to the pickup trucks coming up from Mexico?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","As it relates to trade overall or NAFTA, it is just really too soon to tell, but I mean I think, we've got a seat at the table and are providing input, because clearly we don't want to create a situation where we impact jobs in the United States, which will quickly happen when you look at how integrated the supply base is and how things go back and forth. So, it's really way too soon to speculate, what we're looking for is fare free trade, because we believe that with every country because we believe the strength of our product line will allow us to do well around the globe. So, in all the conversations we're making sure people understand possibly some not understood or aspects of the business, so a very informed decision can be made. As Chuck said, we do support overall tax reform, but the details are key and that's why we're having such an active voice in making sure the business is understood, the jobs we provide et cetera.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And second for Chuck more on a quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year level. When you look at the pricing majors minus material majors that was a net $200 million positive, your majors were mostly cars in 2016 and 2017 they are going to be CUVs. Do you expect that roughly $200 million a quarter pace to continue, could it expand or the other extreme is there payback as maybe some of the cars which seem to be driving some of the inventory position need to come out of the system?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","I would expect that our pricing dynamic if you're speaking specifically in North America will be year-over-year on new will be a little bit more robust than the $200 million a quarter in 2016 based on the crossover launches.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. I'll now turn the call over to Mary Barra.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Thank you. So, I just have a couple of quick closing comments here and I want to share a couple of key takeaways. First, the company is producing strong financial results and I think we've given you a lot of reasons and specifics of why we plan to continue to do just that in 2017 and realize stronger financial results.","We believe overall, GM is a better and more disciplined and more focused company and you'll see us continue to drive that focus across all 220,000 employees around the globe, because we believe there are more efficiencies that we can deliver higher quality and continue with strong product as well as our investment in the future of mobility. All of this to drive strong shareholder value.","We are taking the steps to make sure in the very important area of the future mobility that we have a leadership role and we're building on a strong foundation in many of these areas. And overall if you step back and look at 2016 as a whole, we're demonstrating that we can do what we say what we're going to do and continuing to build that track record of delivering on our commitments.","So, we look forward to a very strong 2017 and I want to thank all of your for participating on the call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

During this presentation, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session for analysts only. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on Thursday, July 24, 2014.","It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Randy Arickx, Executive Director of Communications and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Randy Arickx","Thanks, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us as we review the GM financial results for the first quarter of 2014. Our press release was issued this morning and the conference call materials are available on the Investor Relations Web site. We are also broadcasting this call via the Internet. Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the legend regarding forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language.","This morning, Mary Barra, General Motors' Chief Executive Officer will provide opening remarks followed by a review of the financial results with Chuck Stevens, Executive VP and CFO.","After the presentation portion of the call, we'll open the line for questions from the analyst community. Marry Barra will then conclude the call with some closing remarks. In the room today, we also have Tom Timko, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer and Niharika Ramdev, Vice President, Finance and Treasurer, to assist in answering your questions.","Now I'll turn the call over to Mary Barra.","Mary Barra","Thanks, Randy and thanks to everybody for joining this call. On our last earnings call in April, I spoke about GM's resiliency during a very challenging first quarter. As you all know, the ignition switch recall and difficult market conditions in some parts of the world put tremendous pressure on our bottom-line. Nevertheless, we remained profitable. Just as important, we also continued our steady investment in new products and we returned more than 480 million in capital to common shareholders, stockholders through our first quarter dividend. Years of hard work to improve our vehicles, our operations and the customer experience made this possible.","As expected the same issues continued into the second quarter, but once again we had strong operating performance and we earned a profit on both in EBIT adjusted and a net income basis and we stayed on our plan. I\u2019ll speak to all these points starting on Slide 2, which presents a summary of our second quarter results. Then I\u2019ll review the highlights that speak to the heart of our business, which is to build great products, satisfy its customers and do it very profitably.","At the top of Slide 2, you can see that we delivered 2.5 million units in the quarter. As we announced last week, this was our highest second quarter volume since 2005. Sales in North America and China, the two largest and most profitable markets in the world were up 6% and 8% respectively. However, this was offset to a large degree by declines in markets like Russia and Venezuela, where the industry is weak as well as the strategic decision we made to wind down Chevrolet Europe, this also had an impact on market share. Our global market share in the quarter was down three tenths of a point. However, market share in the United States was equal to a year ago. On a revenue basis, we improved our results by more than 570 million, based on large measure to improvements at GM Financial.","Turning to the bottom-line, net income to income to common stockholders was 200 million or $0.11 per share. Combined the recall-related charges and special items we sited in our press release reduced net income by $0.91 per share in the quarter. Absent these items net income would have been about 1.7 billion in the quarter.","Looking at net cash, net cash from our automotive operations activities was 3.6 billion and the year-over-year decline reflects recall activity as well changes in working capital due to timing. And what\u2019s not on shown on the slide, our automotive available liquidity improved by 4 billion from a year ago.","Finally on an EBIT adjusted basis, GM earned 1.4 billion and our adjusted automotive free cash flow was 1.9 billion. Absent recall and restructuring expenses, EBIT adjusted in the quarter would have been improved slightly from a year ago. For the first half of the year, adjusted automotive free cash flow was nearly 1 billion better than a year ago. Chuck Stevens will break all this down for you in just a few minutes.","Let\u2019s look at Slide 3 which presents several highlights from the quarter starting with GM North America, where our core operating performance was exceptionally strong. In fact our EBIT adjusted margins excluding recalls climbed above 9%. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin growth excluding recall. In China, we reported record sales and our margins improved by six tenths of a point from a year ago.","In Europe, the wind down of Chevrolet Europe is ahead of schedule and costs are below expectations. Meanwhile the recovery of the Opel\/Vauxhall brand continued. Opel\/Vauxhall sales increased 3% in the quarter and 4% in the first half. Our share was up in 11 European markets in the first half including Germany, which here rose three tenths of a point to 7%. In June alone, our share in Germany reached 7.6% which is almost up a full point versus a year ago. New products have made a big difference. For example, the Mokka was the best selling SUV in the first six months of the year in Germany.","All of this keeps us on-track to be profitable mid-decade. We are also targeting European market share of 8% and EBIT adjusted margins in the 5% range by 2022. GM South America meanwhile continues to be very challenging with volumes under pressure across the region. But our core underlying performance in the region is improving. Finally GM Financial continues to execute its growth strategy in order to support increased GM vehicle sales. For example the acquisition of Ally Financial European and Latin American businesses in 2013 as well as GMF\u2019s growth in the North America lease market helped increase their share of GM financing activity from 13% to 20% compared to a year ago.","This trend should continue as GMF expands their prime retail loan program in the United States starting in the second half. The next step for GMF is to complete the acquisition of Ally\u2019s joint venture in China, which we expect to close subject to certain regulatory and other approvals late 2014 or as soon as possible thereafter.","Let\u2019s turn now to Slide 4, which discusses our recall activity in the quarter. Let me begin by stating that my total focus is to make GM the best automotive company for our customers as it relates to the safety, quality, reliability and overall value. We are not going to be satisfied by simply solving our current problems. We are completely aimed at being industry leaders. By now, all of you are familiar with the findings of the Valukas\u2019 report which was presented to our Board of Directors in June and then shared with NHTSA and other government agencies.","I have fully embraced the report and pledge to act on all of the recommendations. Importantly a great many were acted on before the report was even released. Actions that we have taken include elevating safety decision making to the highest levels of the company. Creating a new position, the Vice President of Global Safety, that\u2019s Jeff Boyer and he has full access to me and has regular reporting out to our senior leadership team as well as the Board.","We also reorganized vehicle engineering and created the new product integrity organization which I am confident will improve quality safety and the functional performance of our vehicles through a better design, execution and systems integration. We also removed 15 employees from the Company, some for misconduct or incompetence, others because they simply don\u2019t take responsibility or act with a sense of urgency.","We instituted a Speak Up for Safety program to encourage and recognize employees when they report potential safety issues and do it quickly. We have already received more than 280 suggestions. And we\u2019ve now added 60 safety investigators to identify and address issues much more quickly and we\u2019ve aligned the legal staff to help assure transparency and information sharing among the staffs and other business units across the entire company. Overall, we are dramatically enhancing our approach to safety.","You can see it in the aggressive stance we are taking on recalls and the redoubling of our efforts. This year we have looked at vehicles going back to the 1990s and the results were 60 individual recalls in United States covering 29 million vehicles in North America. About two-thirds of the recalled vehicles are no longer in production and more than 12 million of the vehicles will be fixed by simply replacing or modifying the key.","In addition, some of the recalls were quite small. We had 13 recalls of less than a 1,000 vehicles and 5 with less than a 100. The financial impact of this activity in the second quarter is outlined on the slide. A recall related charge of 1.2 billion in this quarter. This work is now substantially complete and I believe we have now addressed the major outstanding issues. But if we see new data we will address it.","Today we are bringing greater rigor, discipline and urgency to our analysis and decision making process with regard to safety and our recall. We are mining every source of data available to us from the factory floor to warranty information to customer calls to social media to legal claims, all sources of information. And we\u2019re not waiting to see if the trend develops. We want our customers to know that if we identify an issue that could possibly affect their safety we will act quickly.","With respect to the ignition switch recall itself, as I have said before, we are taking responsibility for what happened and we are treating the people who suffered physical injury or loss of loved one with compassion, decency and fairness. As you know the compensation program that independent program administrator Ken Feinberg has developed will begin accepting claims on August 1st. The creation of the program has resulted in a 400 million pretax special item in this quarter as you can see on the slide.","Also, vehicle repairs are well underway. More than 550,000 vehicles have been repaired and we are on-track to have enough kits to repair the majority of the recalled vehicles by early October. As parts availability has improved and the pace of repairs has accelerated, we have seen a corresponding decline in the demand for rental cars. This was expected. Okay. Let\u2019s turn back to earnings and I\u2019ll now ask Chuck to walk you through a detailed review of the quarter. And then Chuck and I will take your questions. Chuck?","Chuck Stevens","Thanks Mary. On Slide 5 we again remind you of the results for the quarter. Net revenue for the period was 39.6 billion. So nearly 600 million increase from the prior year is primarily attributable to favorable mix of 1.2 billion, favorable price of 1.1 billion, increased revenue from GM Financial of 400 million, partially offset by a negative 1.8 billion associated with lower wholesale volumes and unfavorable foreign exchange of 400 million primarily due to the weakening of the Brazilian real and the Argentine peso against the U.S. dollar.","Our operating income was a loss of 500 million primarily attributable to 1.2 billion in recall-related expenses, and 1.3 billion in special charges which I will cover in more detail later. Net income to common stockholders declined 1 billion to 200 million and our diluted earnings per share came in at $0.11, again, influenced by recall-related expense and special charges. As Mary indicated, net income was 1.7 billion excluding recalls and special charges.","Automotive net cash from operating activities was 3.6 billion, a 900 million decrease from the same period in 2013. For our non-GAAP measures EBIT adjusted was 1.4 billion in the second quarter including 1.2 billion of recall-related expenses and $200 million of restructuring. And EBIT adjusted margin was 3.4%, down from a year ago again adversely impacted by a negative 2.9% due to recalls. Adjusted automotive free cash flow decreased 600 million to 1.9 billion for the second quarter. However, this is nearly 1 billion higher for the first half of the year compared to the first half of 2013 including $300 million of recall-related cash costs.","On Slide 6, we disclosed the special items that impacted earnings per share. Net income to common stockholders was 200 million and our diluted earnings per share were $0.11. Included in our special items for the quarter is a 900 million non-cash pre-tax charge relating to a change in how we estimate costs for recall campaigns in GM North America. This reduced net income by approximately 500 million in the quarter and I\u2019ll go into more detail regarding this change in the next chart. Additionally, as previously announced GM will implement a compensation program for those who have lost loved ones or suffered from physical injuries as the result of the -- an ignition switch failure related to the 2.6 million vehicles recalled earlier this year.","A special charge of $400 million pre-tax was taken for the GM ignition switch compensation program, which reduced net income by $200 million on an after-tax basis. There is no cap on this program but this charge is to the Company\u2019s best estimate of the amounts that maybe paid to claims. Due to the unique nature of the program, this estimate contains significant uncertainty and it is possible that total cost could increase by approximately $200 million. The impact of these special items had a $0.47 unfavorable impact onto diluted earnings per share in the period.","On Slide 7, we give you an update on our GMNA recall expense. We have substantially completed our efforts to address outstanding recall issues and also enhanced the analytical data available which contributed to better overall estimating capabilities. In addition, we have made several significant organizational changes such as the creation of a new global product integrity organization and the appointment of a new Global Vice President of Vehicle Safety responsible for the safety development of our vehicle systems as Mary mentioned earlier.","As a result, beginning in Q3, GMNA will accrue estimated recall expense at the time of vehicle sale which will be a similar method with how we currently accrue for policy and warranty and will be in line with other manufacturers. Going forward, we expect future recall expense to normalize at levels higher but not materially so than levels prior to the first half of 2014.","Additionally, we expect to identify issues sooner which may result in the frequency of announced recalls increasing but the number of vehicles per recall and the cost per recall event would be down. As a result of changing how we estimate recall campaigns in North America, we took a 900 million non-cash pre-tax special charge during the quarter. This is our best estimate of the remaining recall expense we expect for the next 10 years for 30 million GM vehicles on the road today.","On Slide 8, we show our consolidated EBIT adjusted for the prior five quarters. At the bottom of the slide, we list the revenue and margins for the same periods. Our operating income margin for the second quarter for 2014 was a negative 1.2%, down significantly from the prior period as a result of recall-related expenses and the special items I reviewed earlier. Our EBIT adjusted margin decreased 2.4 percentage points to 3.4%. Our consolidated wholesale vehicle sales were 1.5 million vehicles in the second quarter, approximately an 8% decrease from the prior year and our global market share decreased 0.3 percentage points to 11.3%.","On Slide 9, we explain a 900 million decrease in year-over-year consolidated EBIT adjusted. Volume was 300 million unfavorable due primarily to lower wholesale volumes in GMIO and GMSA as a result of the wind down of the Chevrolet brand from Europe and the challenging market conditions in South America. This was partially offset by higher wholesale volumes in GM North America.","Mix was 200 million favorable primarily attributable to North America. Price was 1.1 billion favorable due primarily to recently launched vehicles in North America like the new full-size SUVs, full-size trucks and vehicles such as Corvette Stingray, as well as pricing performance in GM South America. Costs were 1.6 unfavorable including the impact of the 1.2 billion in recall-related costs in the quarter, 900 million in material costs associated with recently launched products, incremental restructuring expense of 200 million, partially offset by 500 million in fixed and variable cost improvement. Other was 300 million unfavorable primarily related to foreign exchange.","Slide 10 gives our year-over-year EBIT adjusted performance by segments GMNA decreased 600 million to 1.4 billion including 1 billion in recall-related expense. GME decreased 200 million to a loss of 300 million for the quarter primarily driven by 200 million in incremental restructuring expenses. The performance GMIO improved 100 million to 300 million and in South America EBIT adjusted decreased 100 million on a rounded basis to a loss of 100 million for the quarter. GM Financial continued to deliver solid results with 300 million in earnings before taxes adjusted for the period and our corporate sector was a 200 million loss, including 100 million in recall-related legal expenses for a total EBIT adjusted of 1.4 billion in Q2.","We now move on to our segment results with the key performance indicators with GM North America on Slide 11. For the second quarter of 2014, our total U.S. market share was 17.9%, flat versus the same period a year ago but up 90 basis points from the first quarter. Our retail incentive levels on an absolute basis were higher than the prior year period and slightly higher than the prior year quarter. Our incentives for the quarter were 10.6% of average transaction price. This puts us at a 108% of the industry average.","Slide 12 shows GMNA\u2019s EBIT adjusted for the most recent five quarters. At the bottom of the slide, revenue in this segment as a business was 25.7 billion, up 2.2 billion from the same quarter in 2013. GMNA\u2019s EBIT adjusted margin was 5.4% for the second quarter, which included the negative impact of 3.8 percentage points associated with recall-related expenses.","Excluding the impact of recalls, GMNA\u2019s margin is above 9% for the quarter and is up over 115 basis points in the first six months of the year compared to the first six months of 2013. In fact, excluding the impact of recalls, GMNA EBIT adjusted margin has been up for four straight quarters on a year-over-year basis. Our U.S. dealer inventory increased to 799,000 vehicles, up from a year ago, but down approximately 17,000 units from the first quarter.","This is equivalent of 72 day supply at the end of the June, down from 83 day supply at the end of Q1 and up slightly from 70 day supply a year ago. GMNA\u2019s wholesale vehicle sales were 830,000 units, 21,000 units higher than the prior year. North American market share came in at 17.2%, which was a 0.1%, point decline from the prior year period but higher than the prior year three quarters.","On Slide 13, we provide the explanation of the 600 million year-over-year decrease in GMNA\u2019s EBIT adjusted. Volume was 200 million favorable due to the 21,000 unit increase in wholesale volumes driven by a growing industry and our successful products such as the full-size pickup trucks. Mix was 200 million favorable due to our full-size trucks and products such as the Corvette Stingray. Price was 800 million favorable on the strength of our full-size trucks and all new full-size SUVs. Cost was 1.6 billion unfavorable primarily due to the 1 billion of recall-related expenses and material costs associated with new launches, partially offset by fixed cost savings and material performance on carryover products. Other was 100 million unfavorable due to foreign exchange.","On Slide 14, GMA reported an EBIT adjusted loss of 300 million for the second quarter, a 200 million decrease from the prior year. Revenue increased 6.6% to 6 billion for the quarter and EBIT adjusted margin in the segment decreased 3.1 percentage points to a negative 5.1%, primarily attributable to incremental restructuring expenses. GME\u2019s wholesale vehicle sales for the quarter were 305,000 units, up slightly from the prior year. And our European market share was 6.8%, down 0.9 percentage points from the prior year, primarily related to the wind down of the Chevrolet brand.","As mentioned earlier, the Opel\/Vauxhall brand increased sales nearly 4% in the first half of this year and market share increased 8 basis points year-to-date. After adjusting for incremental restructuring expense and despite challenges in Russia, GM Europe is near breakeven and well on its way towards profitability by mid-decade.","On Slide 15, we provide the major components of GME\u2019s 200 million decrease in EBIT adjusted. Volume was flat as improving Western European markets were offset by conditions in Russia. Mix was also flat on a year-over-year basis. Price was flat as competitive pressure in the industry was partially offset by price recovery for foreign exchange. Cost was 100 million unfavorable primarily due to 200 million in incremental restructuring costs, partially offset by material and fixed cost savings. Other was 100 million unfavorable due to foreign exchange. This totals to GME\u2019s EBIT adjusted loss of 300 million for the second quarter of 2014.","We\u2019ll now move on to GMIO\u2019s profitability for the prior five quarters on Slide 16. EBIT adjusted was 300 million including 500 million in equity income from our joint ventures. At the bottom of the slide, GMIO\u2019s revenue from consolidated operations was 3.6 billion. The 1.2 billion declined from Q2 2013 is primarily due to lower wholesale volumes in the Middle East and Chevrolet brand vehicles in Europe. Consolidated operations\u2019 EBIT adjusted margin was a negative 5.7%, down significantly from the prior year, primarily related to reduced volumes in the region.","Our net income margin from our China JVs remains strong at 10%, up 0.6 percentage points year-over-year. The region\u2019s wholesale vehicle sales were 157,000 for its consolidated operations and 830,000 for our China JVs, which was up 7.5% from the prior period in China. Our market share in Asia-Pacific Middle East and Africa region was 9.7%, flat from a year ago. Our market share in China was 14.4% for the first six months of the year, relatively flat compared to the first six months of last year as we work to keep pace with the quickly growing industry.","On Slide 17, we provide the major components of GMIO\u2019s year-over-year performance. Volume was 300 million unfavorable due to 83,000 unit decline in wholesale volumes in our consolidated operations. Mix was flat on a year-over-year basis. Price was 100 million favorable primarily in our Middle East operations. Cost was a 200 million tailwind associated with the wind down of the Chevrolet brand from Europe and lower cost in Australia, India and Middle East markets, partially offset by incremental recall and restructuring expenses. Other was 100 million favorable due to improved equity income from our strong China operations.","Going forward, we continue to expect our China business to remain strong. With regard to consolidate operations, we should see the benefit of important launches of the new full-size pickup trucks and full-size SUVs in the Middle East.","Slide 18, provides a look at GM South America\u2019s performance in recent quarters. Revenue decreased 1.1 billion to 3.2 billion primarily due to lower wholesale volumes and foreign exchange, partially offset by favorable pricing and mix. The EBIT adjusted margin in this segment was a negative 2.5%, 3.8 percentage points lower than the prior year. GM South America\u2019s wholesale vehicle sales were 211,000 units, 67,000 lower than the second quarter of 2013 and South American market share declined to 16.7% in the quarter.","On Slide 19, we look at the change in year-over-year EBIT adjusted, a decrease of 100 million. Volume decreased 200 million primarily due to lower wholesale volumes in Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela. Mix was flat. Price was 200 million favorable due to actions we have taken in Argentina and Brazil to partially offset foreign exchange in those markets. Cost was flat as incremental restructuring expense was offset by fixed cost savings. Other had a 200 million adverse impact primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange in Brazil and Argentina. This totals to an EBIT adjusted loss of 100 million in GM South America in the second quarter.","Slide 20 provides a walk of adjusted automotive free cash flow for the second quarter. As a reminder, our net income to common stockholders was 200 million. After adjusting for non-controlling interests and Series A preferred dividends and deducting GM Financial earnings our automotive income was 100 million. We had 800 million in non-cash special items. And our depreciation and amortization was 1.6 billion expense. Working capital was a 600 million use of cash. The variance from prior year is primarily due to production timing.","Pension and OPEB cash payments exceeded expenses by 200 million in the quarter. Other was 1.9 billion primarily attributable to recall charges during the quarter, evidenced from China joint ventures and timing of sales incentive accruals versus payments. This totals to automotive net cash provided by operating activities of 3.6 billion. We have 1.7 billion of capital expenditures in the quarter giving us an adjusted automotive free cash flow of 1.9 billion.","On Slide 21, we provide a summary of our key automotive balance sheet items. We finished the second quarter with 28.4 billion in cash and current marketable securities and 10.4 billion in available credit facilities for a total available liquidity of 38.8 billion. Our book value of debt was 7.5 billion and our Series A preferred stock obligation was 3.1 billion. Our U.S. qualified and non-qualified pension plans were underfunded by 7 billion and our non-U.S. pensions were underfunded by 12.3 billion. Our unfunded OPEB liability was 6.3 billion in the second quarter.","Slide 22 provides a brief summary of our auto financing activities. GM Financial has already released the results and will hold their earnings conference call at noon. Our U.S. subprime penetration in the second quarter was 8.1% down 0.4 percentage points from the prior year. Our U.S. lease penetration increased 4.3 percentage points to 24.2% in Q2, as we continue to leverage our financing relationships and improve residual values to drive toward industry competitive levels in key segments.","Lease penetration in Canada was at 27.5% up significantly from last year, but more in line with industry. GM new vehicles as a percentage of GM Financial originations rose to 75% and GM Financial\u2019s percentage of GM\u2019s U.S. consumer subprime financing and leasing was 30% in the quarter. GM Financial\u2019s annualized net credit losses remained low at 1.4% and their earnings before tax adjusted were 258 million for the second quarter. Reflecting both continued strong performance of their North American business and international operations.","Finally, on Slide 23 we highlight a few areas of focus for the second half of the year. Customer care remains our top priority as a Company, we will continue to work with our suppliers, our dealers and others to repair recalled vehicles as quickly as we can and to continue to focus on improving our processors around our vehicle safety and commitment to our customers.","We have some important launches in the second half of this year in many of our regions. We will continue to focus on the important work of delivering flawless vehicle launches and introductions in these important markets. With the successful new vehicle launches we\u2019ve had thus far, we continue to generate strong results in the U.S. and China and we remain on-track to be profitable in Europe by mid-decade.","We are confident we are currently on or ahead of plan to deliver the results we promised earlier this year excluding the effects of recalls. Finally, Mary will have more to say about our second half focus in her closing remarks. But I want you to know that we are committed as a Company to continue driving the strong underlying cooperating performance we delivered in the first half of this year, across all regions and despite the challenges we face.","Now Mary and I will take your questions after which Mary will have some closing remarks, Sandy?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. Please note that the question-and-answer session is for analysts only. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed sir.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","Can you help us first of all with that Slide 13 that $1.6 billion cost number, you did say that about a 1 billion of that was recall, would it be reasonable to say that maybe 900 million was content, last quarter was around a 1 billion and that you had maybe 300 million of positive structural cost items is that a good estimation of that breakdown?","Chuck Stevens","Yes. That\u2019s close, Rod out of the 1.6 billion as we indicated roughly a 1 billion related to recall activity. Material on majors was 1.1 billion unfavorable partially offset by GPS carryover material performance of a couple $100 million and the balance was fixed-cost.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","Okay. So, if that\u2019s right material a 1 billion and maybe it\u2019s a 900 million net of some cost savings and older items, how do we kind of put that into context against the pricing that you had in the quarter which was 800 million it would look like the contribution would be somewhat negative and it\u2019s still, it\u2019s kind of early days when you compare the pricing versus the material right now a lot of these products are pretty new, is there anything to kind of read into that?","Chuck Stevens","Pricing on majors for North America in the quarter was $1.4 billion against that material cost, material and majors for North America specifically Rod it was 1.1 billion, so roughly accretive to earnings 300 million. I mentioned material performance on carryover favorable 200 million, so carryover pricing was unfavorable in the quarter on a year-over-year basis about $600 million.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","Okay. But this is arguably the peak of the Company\u2019s product cycle and the combination of new products versus carryover products is not, that doesn\u2019t appear to be favorable at this point. Is that something that we should be thinking about sort of in the context of the longer term margin target and I know you are doing north of 9% right now but the longer-term margin target for North America being closer to 10?","Chuck Stevens","Yes, I would say we are still confident and convicted around our glide path to 10% EBIT margins, Rod. I would suggest that we still have a significant portion of the launch cadence out in front of us. As we\u2019ve indicated before we will be launching products in the 2014 to \u201917 timeframe at twice the pace of the previous four years. So I think that there is continued opportunity from a pricing on new content as I\u2019ve discussed before, the carryover pricing dynamic versus where we were sitting a year ago is becoming a bit more challenging and that\u2019s why we need to focus on cost and efficiency which is really the second leg of our glide path to 10% EBIT margins.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","And just lastly if I can sneak another couple of things in, can you just clarify your wholesale of 830,000 units it looks like it was maybe 60,000 units lower than production, is that just rental car accounting and do you have any just broad color on the outlook for the back half for South America, or the consolidated IO business?","Chuck Stevens","For the first question, Rod, absolutely right that is just rental car, the difference between in service versus auction. So over the next 9 to 12 months that will bleed out, that\u2019s the biggest difference between production and wholesales. Relative to South America, it continues to be a very challenging environment. Brazil and Argentina, the industry continues to weaken, but in the context of overall results, we continue to execute to our plan to driving efficiency in those operations and I would expect absent some change to see slightly improved performance in the second half of the year. Our consolidated operations as we\u2019ve talked before. We\u2019ve got a number of important product launches in the second half of the year primarily led by full size pickups and full size SUVs in the Middle-East. So again I would expect to see some marginal improvement from our consolidated operations run rate as we get into the second half of the year. And while we are at it from a company standpoint, as we\u2019ve discussed before, we believe the second half of the year is going to be stronger than the first half of the year ex-recall and we are still confident that we are on or ahead of plan for the year.","Operator","","Thank you, sir. And our next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup","","Chuck, hoping we can maybe talk about the second half outlook in North America, it sounds like you still are confident in the second half of the year. What are some of the big buckets we should be thinking about there both in terms of in particularly a focus on kind of the pricing versus material cost equation in the second half of the year?","Chuck Stevens","","Yes I wouldn\u2019t say that our expectations for North America is that we will grow margins in the second half of the year versus the first half ex-recalls and also grow margins versus the second half of last year. The big drivers behind that will be continuing the full size SUV launch and getting that up to run and eliminating some of the constraints that we\u2019ve had a from a production perspective. We will have the ATS Coupe launch later this year from a Cadillac perspective, mid-size truck is later in the year I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be a big driver of earnings. Generally 60% of the truck industry is in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. So we expect continued strength from a volume and mix perspective as well.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup","That\u2019s very helpful. And then two quick follow-ups, first it does sound like you raised your outlook for the mid-decade in Europe from breakeven to profitable and maybe a subtle change. But maybe talk a little bit about what may have driven that? And then secondly just a quick housekeeping, what\u2019s sort of the cash recall cost that\u2019s still -- which you will be expecting over the next several quarters?","Chuck Stevens","","Okay, yes. Speaking to Europe first, I think it\u2019s a combination of a number of things. First we continue to get traction in the core markets. Germany, the UK with Opel and with Vauxhall. The brand\u2019s strength continues to improve the wind down of Chevrolet Europe is ahead of planning going much smoother than we expected about 80% of the dealers that are in wind downs have signed up with Opel as well. So that\u2019s going extremely well. And the industry is performing a little bit better than we expected. The other thing that\u2019s driving that with that strength is we are going into the heart of the product launch cadence with the Corsa letter this year and the Astra next year. On the recall cash component of that, our expectations, Itay, is that 60% to 70% of the $2.5 billion that we booked thus far will result in a cash impact in the second half of the year with the balance rolling out into Q1-Q2 next year that\u2019s our latest thinking on that.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup","Great, that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks everyone.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Johnson - Barclays Capital","Yes. Good morning. I have a housekeeping question and then a more strategic question. On the housekeeping question just following up on the wholesale versus sale, retail sales. If we just kind of look at it from retail sales at the dealer level and inventory build, it looks like that number from what you\u2019ve put out there was about 910,000 this quarter you only had 830,000 wholesale units that\u2019s a difference of about 77,000, if I look over the last four quarters of that delta, it\u2019s never got above 26,000. Is there something different going on with either the volume of rental programs, how much they want to do this program versus race cars? Is there anything with GM Financial\u2019s leasing business that\u2019s going to affect recognition of our wholesale sale and then kind of how does that play out going forward or a potential program business outside of daily rental?","Chuck Stevens","Yes, I think your question was around the difference between production and wholesales this time versus the\u2026","Brian Johnson - Barclays Capital","No, actually the difference between dealer sales and dealer inventory build and wholesale sales\u2026","Chuck Stevens","Okay well\u2026","Brian Johnson - Barclays Capital","","In a different way than from production.","Chuck Stevens","Yes as vehicles are sold to daily rental while the revenue and associated costs are reverses and then amortize over the anticipated life of that buyback agreement the deliveries are counted in the quarter that when they are delivered to the rental. So that would answer the first question. And relative to the dynamic with daily rental, the first half of the year is the typical seasonal pattern and if you look over the last few years is always fairly significant difference between production and wholesales especially in the second quarter. I would also say the dynamic within daily rental to your other comment has changed a bit. We are taking advantage of strong our residual value, used car values, and putting more in repurchase so that we can control that and control that inventory as it comes out. Our overall fleet penetration is relatively flat year-over-year. So from a total sales perspective so there is no dynamic there that is an anomaly. It\u2019s just timing and more repurchase versus risk unit.","Brian Johnson - Barclays Capital","Okay. Because I\u2019d like it some of our estimates about a big chunk of the -- your model versus -- your results versus our model seem to be 30k wholesale units and what I am hearing is you\u2019re doing more program business with rental car companies and that\u2019s can affect the timing therefore the wholesale sales?","Chuck Stevens","Correct.","Brian Johnson - Barclays Capital","On a more strategic in China I think this is the second quarter in a row we\u2019ve seen a year-over-year gain and earnings margins are holding. I do know you sent a new executive to China last year and maybe from the point of view of Mary what do you think is driving this improvement in the equity income from China and in particular -- and maybe it is a Dan Ammann question as well is there a mandate now to actually not just hold market share in China but to grow equity income and profits?","Mary Barra","There is definitely a mandate to do that there continues to be huge growth potential when you look across the globe I know people talk about China slowing but it\u2019s still is a huge opportunity from a growth perspective. And if you look at some of what\u2019s feeling that is the SUV that we\u2019ve recently launched but there is still much more work to do and opportunity when you look across the Chevrolet portfolio the dealer\u2019s portfolio which continues to be strong, and then the Cadillac portfolio that\u2019s doing well as well.","So we\u2019re really investing in not only building the brands but then also at our first -- my first trip there at the beginning of the year and I think it was reinforcing messages of the past as the market grows we need to participate in that growth in cases in a disproportionate fashion to make sure that we\u2019re seizing the opportunity. So I think the team has really come together and look for every opportunity we continue to have our plans to increase capacity and continue to build the brand. So I expect that trend to continue.","Brian Johnson - Barclays Capital","And was it one thing specific that maybe added to the bottom-line there it\u2019s just a bunch of actions?","Mary Barra","I think it\u2019s a number of actions I think it was again somewhat product drive somewhat driven by the focus of the team and the clear expectations laid out and the work that we need to do and the convey as it relates to the brands. I think Cadillac is also significant as well.","Brian Johnson - Barclays Capital","Now you\u2019re guiding to margins lower in second half 9% to 10% versus 11% is that just seasonality when the product program launches and kind of should we be thinking about the 10ish percent margin going forward on a full year basis?","Chuck Stevens","Yes, 10% is ballpark the right number to think about on a full year basis. There is seasonality in China typically Q1 is stronger than Q2. We\u2019re holding to 10% EBIT margins on a go forward basis. So as' we\u2019ve indicated we expect the growth of Cadillac and launch of a number of SUVs to be a tailwind from a margin perspective but as you know the market in China from a pricing perspective on carryover is challenging roughly 3% per year, net price deterioration. So we will hold our margins by improving mix and continuing to drive cost efficiency to offset those price headwinds, that\u2019s the broad strokes of the plan, Brian.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS. Please proceed.","Colin Langan - UBS","Great, thanks for taking my question. Can you give any -- you said the cadence of earnings is the same, but it does look like restructuring is a little bit more even through the year. How should we think about the restructuring? Is the $1.1 billion for the year still good, or is it actually coming in a bit lower than you were thinking?","Chuck Stevens","Yes. Colin to you first comment, I think what we said was in the second half we expect earnings to be better during the first half, so not equal on a cadence perspective. And then from restructuring, we talk about the 1.1 billion for the year. I would say in the first half of the year we\u2019re generally on-track on a run rate basis to that 1.1 billion, the biggest driver of that is the restructuring events in Germany. And that is pretty flat quarter-to-quarter. So I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s a material difference in the second half versus the first half of restructuring.","Colin Langan - UBS","And how should we think about the restructuring potential in GMIO? Obviously, with the end of Chevy in Europe, what are the plans for that plant that was supplying those Chevy products?","Chuck Stevens","We continue to look at optimizing our footprint in Korea associated with the wind down take, I would say for the year restructuring across in IO are in the range of a $100 to $150 million it\u2019s really largely dependent on voluntary separation program and we work through that. And we\u2019ll continue to work through that over the next number of years. Australia, as we indicated before we will continue to work through that restructuring between now and 2017 and that will be part of the run rate that I talk about before we would expect in the range of $400 to $500 million of your restructuring on an ongoing basis.","Colin Langan - UBS","Okay and just one last one. Can you clarify when you've talked in the past about mid-decade, that doesn't mean 2015, is that correct, when we think about both Europe getting back to profitability and the North America 10% margin? Is that the right way to think about that, somewhere in that range is the way to think of it?","Chuck Stevens","Yes. The way to think about it is mid-decade. I\u2019m not going to give any more specifics in that Colin aspect to say this. We are on-track in executing to the North American plan, if you look at the last four quarters on a year-over-year basis. Our margins are up, excluding recalls a 150 basis point, clearly we feel more optimistic and forward leading in Europe because we\u2019ve changed our guidance from breakeven mid decade to profit, our mid decade, we continue to work it extremely hard, but I would say for both of those commitments we are on-track.","Colin Langan - UBS","Okay, alright, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on sort of the product cadence and the cadence of earnings that you are expecting in the second half this year, particularly in North America. And Chuck, specifically, and Mary, it seems like there is an over focus in the market that you are sort of it's a one and done product cadence with the K2XX, Silverado and SUV launches. But there's a lot more to the product launch as far as I can tell. I'm just curious if you can maybe either confirm or comment on the product launches going forward. It seems like the HD launches will benefit the second half of this year and the first half of next year. And then over the next two years, you have the launches of the small crossovers, the large crossovers, and some midsize sedans here in North America that should be real positive as the market remains tight. So I'm just curious if you can comment on sort of that statement, and really this concern that you are sort of a one and done product cycle here, because it just seems very misguided right now?","Mary Barra","Yes. Couple of points on that, first you\u2019re absolutely correct specially even if you look at our full size trucks, there is more coming as we continue to look at the -- through the life time of the K2XX they are not going to get out in front and announcing, stick to our announcement cadence, but there\u2019s definitely more substantial things coming to enhance the K2XX over its lifecycle. Also I think the importance of the midsize truck that comes out later this year and then it\u2019s truck is that there is clearly strong cadence of products coming out of it with the next couple of years that I think, there\u2019s been, they\u2019ve had the ability to have the complete focus of our work on material cost for those products and optimization of -- you\u2019ll say revenue in the cost aspect of it. So you\u2019re correct, it\u2019s not just a one and done there is significant more coming not only the K2XX which we understand is very significant to have it do et cetera, but other products as well.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Then just a second question, Mary, on following up on all the retail activity and sort of the re-measurements you seem to be doing and sort of everything you've been digging up. There's always been a question with GM's IT systems and your ability to really measure and metricize and respond to things like these recalls. I am just curious as you are going through this process if there's anything you really think you might need to revamp more on a structural basis on the IT systems in GM, so you can understand better and more quickly what's necessarily going on in the Company?","Mary Barra","I am not sure I completely understand your question, but it is specifically related to recalls. I mean I think there is data, the ease of which data is available but I am not going to pin it on IT systems. I mean it\u2019s clearly the trunk process that we need to have within the company that\u2019s process driven, people driven and I think we\u2019ve addressed that completely with the creation of the Jeff Boyer organization and the way that structures the way that operates across the company. I would also say the way that we\u2019ve really in that area, are comprehensively looking at data to understand what the customer is seeing or experiencing, whether it comes directly from customer calls, emails, or customer engagement center, warranty information, legal claims.","Also we have a team that just mines data off the internet to make sure we understand as customers raise issues. So that is comprehensive of what we are doing that. Now there is an opportunity to do that better and our IT team is working hands in hand with Jeff, because we feel and any extra we\u2019re finding outside expertise as well to make sure we\u2019ve got the right tools to more quickly be able to mine data and spot trends or see connect point. But, so there is an IT aspect of it and we are well underway doing that and we will continue to just advance that. But I think the most important point to make sure that we are looking across and understand what\u2019s happening with our vehicles is the way we completely change the organization, change the process we follow and make it very clear to the entire organization what the expectations are.","Chuck Stevens","Just to speak a bit to the financial systems and IT, I think you\u2019ve seen this, there has been a significant improvement in that over the last two or three years along with the finance transformation and IT transformation and obviously more work to go, but starting with country sale reporting, product line profitability we are launching globally profitability on a win level basis. We are building an enterprise data warehouse with the business intelligence group so there is a lot of work that\u2019s been going on and we will continue to go on from specifically a financial perspective so that we can get the right data, analyze it quickly and react and I think that we are well along the way on that.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And we are looking forward to the VIN level profitability, if you will disclose it to us?","Chuck Stevens","We won\u2019t.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","One last question on subprime, particularly because GM Financial has a big exposure there. There's obviously a great debate in the markets right now of subprime being overheated for auto lending. It doesn't necessarily appear that way to us. I was just curious if you could comment on sort of your exposure to subprime, what you think of it right now, and is it more of an issue or an opportunity?","Chuck Stevens","That\u2019s a good question. It\u2019s been interesting, our share of sub-prime actually has come down because for a while there was a competitive move into sub-prime so it was being reasonably well served, it looked like in the second quarter that there was a back off from that a little bit perhaps because of the exposures. Let\u2019s just say that AmeriCredit, now GM Financial are experts in sub-prime, they never lost money during the downturn in 2008-2009, they know how to manage and score these customers. And I think that manage an appropriate level of risk associated with sub-prime, and again, as they expand our overall product offering. So we feel that that\u2019s a very, very well managed segment of their business.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed sir.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","Thank you, good morning. I guess a couple from me. Just first, I think there was some production constraints, I think, referenced towards the beginning of the call when we were discussing the cadence of margins and the overall North America performance. So maybe we could get into that. Obviously, just sort of the newer truck models and SUV models that are kind of rolling off, sort of how far are you away from the sort of true run rate of production? And as we think about -- how do we think about that, and how meaningful it is in subsequent quarters?","Chuck Stevens","Yes, I would say it\u2019s not an overall system production constraint more specific mix. We talked about this before. The higher penetration trim levels, the crew cab versus double cab versus regular cab mix have performed much better than we expected and we\u2019ve been working hard in the first half of the year with suppliers, with engineering to address these bottlenecks. What we currently have right now from a full size SUV perspective there are some constraints on escalate, up level escalate in Denali, the Yukon Denali. We are continue to work through that, we have the expectation that we will build a free up some of those trim constraints as we go into the second half of the year. So it\u2019s not like an overall capacity but more specific up level trim constraints that we\u2019ve had and I think that\u2019s going to be net of positive benefit in the second half versus the first half.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","Okay, that's helpful clarification. Then my follow-up was just on Brazil and Latin America specifically. I know you did address it a little bit, but I wasn't sure if some of the color you provided was GMIO. So maybe can we just, at the risk of repeating some of that, can we talk about what the anticipation is sort of for the back half? I would also be curious, specifically are there concerns about inventory levels there? It's one of the things that we have been hearing about that, with sort of the general buyers' strike going on ahead of the elections, people are just stuck with a lot of stock that they need to get rid of in the second half.","Chuck Stevens","Yes, let\u2019s talk about Brazil, South America. Clearly, the first half of the year impacted by Venezuela fundamentally no production and we\u2019re carrying all the fixed costs associated with that. There has been I am not getting overly optimistic but there has been some positive movement recently relative to currency releases. It looks like we will be able to put a -- some level of production in the second half of the year in Venezuela. So that would be one of the drivers of the second half versus the first half performance.","The big question mark for us right now is how does Brazil and Argentina, how do those industries perform going forward whether there is just a hangover from the World Cup and things are going to normalize it appears that the government is trying to supportive of the industry by holding off and raising IPI tax. So, we\u2019re optimistic that there is some upside in the second half from Brazil and Argentina. I think the key thing is that we continue to execute the plan that we led out and drive efficiency and fixed costs we continue to do restructuring there and take people out of the system and optimize manufacturing. We\u2019re continuing to drive localization and improve logistics.","And relative to your question on inventory specifically, we saw that coming and part of the challenge in the second quarter on our South American earnings specific to Brazil is we took a lot of production out in the second quarter in advance of the World Cup because fundamentally the country shutdown. So we tried to get out in front of that inventory issue in the second quarter.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Continuing on our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan","Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. I think that the North America margin of 9.2% ex recall likely tracked below some of the higher-end expectations. At the same time, I think investors believed that you would be cyclically helped by product cadence in 2014, to such an extent that your margin ex recall would likely decline next year. You've said before, though, that you think that in the march toward reaching by mid-decade a run rate of margin that personally 10% over the course of a business cycle that the intention would be to turn higher and higher margins each year until you get to that goal.","So my question is if investors are modestly disappointed today with the current GMNA margin because they think it is benefiting from a peaking product cadence, what can you tell them that would give them the confidence in the mid-decade target that you repeated today you have conviction in? It seems like in Mary's response earlier to a similar question, she'd somewhat disputed the fact that product cadence was currently peaking. What other margin drivers are there out there that are going to help you? If you could please just kind of walk us through those multiyear drivers and trajectory margin in a way that would make us excited.","Chuck Stevens","Thanks Ryan. First I would say look at the track record of execution. Going back to 2012 through today and we\u2019ve been pretty clear that our objective was to grow from 7% to 7.5% EBIT margins by 300 basis points and that was going to be over a multiyear period trenched in a 100 basis points roughly over three year time frame more or less. Count to-date for the last 12 months we\u2019ve grown margins in North America 150 basis points on a year-over-year basis ex-recall. So, we\u2019re executing to the plan.","As Mary indicated and I\u2019ve talked about before, our launch cycle, our launch cadence over the next four years is going to be at twice the pace it was in the previous four years. So it\u2019s not a one end done with the full size trucks. As we talked about the glide path, the first trench of the margin expansion was going to be driven to a large extent by launches. The second trench really around cost and efficiency primarily manufacturing footprint, the SG&A initiatives we have with Global Business Services IT transformation and material costs and logistics optimization and those are all in execution mode.","And then the final driver of margin expansion was really around fully leveraging the business and that was the expansion of GM Financial that was growing our customer carrying after sales business by expanding our reach in the after sales market beyond traditional dealer parts with F&I products gap extended warranty and that was really by fully leveraging global connected customer and our capability with 4G LTE and our ability to manage the customer. So, this has been a laid out plan since 2012 we\u2019re executing to it and we\u2019re one third of the way through it and we put the numbers on the board thus far that we talked about and that\u2019s why we\u2019re confident that we\u2019re going to continue to execute to that plan.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan","Okay, great. Thanks. Then just my second and final question, it looks like you are making progress on reducing your losses in consolidated international operations. I thought maybe the moves that you were making their relative to Chevrolet in Europe would benefit earnings for GM Europe, that pressure of consolidated IO as you take out production before you take out capacity. I know that consolidated IO is more there is a lot of moving pieces. But it would seem that the stopping of the export of Chevrolet vehicles might actually have improved profitability, suggesting that the variable contribution on those vehicles might have even been negative. Can we look forward to maybe another leg in improved profitability for consolidated IO as you go ahead and now take out that capacity that's no longer needed to support those vehicles that were previously exported?","Chuck Stevens","Well first, Chevrolet Europe results were reported and are continued to reported in the IO sector. So by itself is as we wind down Chevrolet, you expect that to be ultimately a net positive as a matter of fact in the second quarter, part of the fixed cost improvement that we saw in IOs driven by reduced fixed costs related to Chevrolet Europe. At the same time, we created a fairly significant capacity issue for ourselves in Korea that we need to deal with. We took roughly 200,000 units of Chevrolet Europe volume out that created a underutilized footprint and we are working to address that, that\u2019s got a bit longer tail on it to get fully addressed. We\u2019re going to have to manage through that as we go forward. ","For me, from an international operations perspective, the key that\u2019s going to change the dynamic from our -- significantly change the dynamic from an earnings trajectory perspective is going to be product. And we are working very hard on an emerging market portfolio, that\u2019s first and foremost. Then get the business model, the infrastructure right around that portfolio and then make sure that at the market dealer network, the brands are ready and built to the levels so that we can fully optimize that. So that\u2019s kind of the strategic footprint for IO.","Mary Barra","If I can just add to that I mean I think there, again with the improvements that we\u2019ve made from a financial data availability to manage the business across the country or across the globe, country-by-country as we look at the consolidated international operations, we are really looking at what is the take to winning those markets, to be in the core of the market as Chuck said to have the product cadence and then right systems and business plan around it. And I think if you look at several of the last few months personal announcements that we\u2019ve made, there is also a new leadership team across the board that fully understands their responsibility to look at it holistically but make sure in each of those countries, we have a winning plan centered around products, but broader across the business and so we are watching that closely working with that team.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan","Great, thank you both for all the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley ","Thanks, everybody. My first question was just on the logic of including the majority of the recall costs in adjusted EBIT, which traditionally was a metric to kind of demonstrate underlying profitability. And I know the intentions are honorable and you've explained it that unlike other companies and maybe even yourself in the past, you want to not hide these things and have them upfront and in the adjusted number. But I would imagine recalling 29 million recalls is pretty extraordinary. And just the reason why I'm asking is a lot of investors are owning your stock on the expectation of, let's say, real underlying EBIT improvement. And you maybe unintentionally put yourself in a situation where just holding the underlying profit stable, you could have like a 40% or 50% increase in EBIT next year just on not recalling the vehicles again.","Chuck Stevens","Yes, I am sorry, Adam. Go ahead.","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley","So I just wanted to note of the thought process and logic there because it could create some different let\u2019s say management expectations versus investor expectations?","Chuck Stevens","Historically, we have taken recall campaigns to EBIT adjusted and in the first half of this year, we certainly talked about whether we should think about this as a special item or not but ultimately it boiled down to a responsibility perspective. Operating management-to-management the leadership of this organization, we are responsible for those charges and we wanted to make sure that it was reflected appropriately in EBIT adjusted for a number of reasons. I think that the go forward approach to this as you\u2019ve seen as we\u2019ve got more data in the special non-cash charges we took in the second quarter, we are going to accrue recall campaigns on a perspective basis as sold, which were more closely aligned with the competition and eliminate some of the volatility that we\u2019ve seen on a go forward basis.","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Can I just ask is the incentive structure, are there any adjustments to the management incentive structure though to adjust for that so that you are not let\u2019s say rewarded for just non-repeat of recall costs?","Marry Barra","","I am not sure I have completely understand your question Adam, but\u2026","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley","Just to clarify the -- my understanding is a significant proportion of variable compensation is tied to delta of adjusted EBIT of the company, that\u2019s the heart of what I am asking about.","Marry Barra","","But look I think that the key is part of it wasn\u2019t treated as a special item. I mean we don\u2019t broadly comment on executive compensation other than what we disclose on an annual basis but I would say I think we are responsible, it\u2019s our -- the basic need to do a recall is when you -- something is wrong with the vehicle from a customer perspective and that\u2019s the core of the business and that\u2019s how we treated all of the vehicles.","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley","I appreciate that. Just last as a follow-up and I know you won't be able to pinpoint it, but the recall itself has obviously been a very important stimulus for showroom traffic at dealers. And I was wondering if when you analyze that and in discussion with your dealers, do you think that the recall activity has been a net positive to your volume and a chance to kind of reengage and rebuild trust and maybe offer a good deal, that extra traffic? Or has it been more neutral or net negative in terms of volume, just isolating volume? Thank you.","Chuck Stevens","One specific data point on the program that we offer to the recall, the ignition switch recall population 2.6 million vehicles to-date we\u2019ve sold about 6,600 vehicles under that program so clearly that\u2019s been a benefit for us to build the reengage with some of these customer that had very old products. I would say our dealers are doing an outstanding job dealing with all of these customers that are coming and trying to get their vehicles fixed. We are working with the dealers to use that as an opportunity to demonstrate that our current products are much improved versus some of these older expired architecture vehicles that are being recalled. I think it\u2019s too soon to tell. We need to continue to build that relationship and we\u2019re early in the process. But so far our sales have been resilient. Our loyalty rates seem to be reasonably resilient. And we need to continue to focus on putting the customer at the center and taking care of all these customers they come in that have to have their vehicles repaired.","Mary Barra","Yes, and just let me add to that. I mean it really is one interaction at a time and I have to reinforce what Chuck said that the dealers are doing an outstanding job. When you think that as we talked here at the end of first quarter, we really did redouble our effort and really went back it into the late 1990s specifically as it related to some of the safety assistance related to ignition switches to make sure we were doing the right thing. And our dealers have truly responded and we do see this and I\u2019ve talked to dealers Alan has clearly talked to dealers. And to make sure that we see this as an opportunity to demonstrate the trends of those products that we have available today and the customer the way that we\u2019re focused on the customer and the way that we want to make sure their experience goes well as they go through this process. And it\u2019s a partnership but it\u2019s one at a time, and we still have a lot to go as we look to second quarter or second half of the year so that will be a huge focus.","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley","Thanks for that Mary, thanks Chuck.","Chuck Stevens","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And Ms. Mary Barra, I will turn the presentation back to you for your closing remarks. Thank you.","Mary Barra","Thank you operator and I want to start off by saying I really do appreciate the opportunity for both Chuck and I to answer your questions. As we go forward here I think we started the conversation by talking about the fact that General Motors, I think we\u2019ve demonstrated resiliency as we\u2019ve gone through this. And I think we\u2019d all agree it\u2019s an important quality in today\u2019s business environment but I want to make it clear that we and the senior leadership and the team at General Motors, we understand that we have a lot more work to do and we\u2019re focused on it.","We are working hard to be one of the very best companies in this industry and we feel and are committed to treating the customer right and making sure they stay at the center of everything we do because that\u2019s a long term objective that happens as I said one interaction at a time but we believe it\u2019s key to winning in this business. It isn\u2019t a new strategy for us it\u2019s we rolled out a couple of years ago our core values and the customer being the first and the importance of relationships and then excellence. And we've been consistent as we\u2019ve dealt with the issues that we faced in the first half of this year of staying sure to those core values. And I think it that in terms of purpose that has helped us to be able to stay on plan and drive our operating performance during the first two quarters.","I would also say it underpins everything we\u2019re doing as it relates to product design, the way we engineer vehicles in our power trains, supplier quality, our manufacturing operations and sales and service. To demonstrate that I think if you look at the work that team lead out of the product integrity organization or the way Jeff Boyer is leading the global safety team the work that Alicia is driving in the global quality and the customer experience, those are all concrete examples of us demonstrating our commitment there. So everyone is aligned and I believe we still have a lot that we can do to really unleash the full power of GM and what we can do to make sure we\u2019re putting the customer in the center of everything we do.","As we move forward we\u2019re going to keep this discipline and focus as we repair all the recalled vehicles and also execute a number of other initiatives in the second half of the year. And then if you look and we just kind of quickly go around the globe here. In China, for example, we have launches of the new Chevrolet Cruze the Buick Envision which will be Buick\u2019s third SUV. In Europe, we talked about the strength of the product there and we\u2019re going to be launching the second generation of the Opel Vivaro van and the fifth generation Opel Corsa. And that vehicle has gotten I think very strong reviews. And these are among what we\u2019ve talked about the 27 new Opel models coming between \u201914 and \u201918.","In North America, I am very excited because I think there is a huge opportunity with the Chevrolet Colorado and the GMC Canyon. These trucks make us the only OEM that does have a full line with mid-size light duty and heavy duty pickup. And we believe this is a huge opportunity to help us grow and conquest. Specifically in California which is the largest market in the United States for mid-size trucks. We also will have another market share opportunity in the U.S. when we launched the Chevy Trax early next year. And I think the Trax is a great example of the way we\u2019re leveraging our global products in global scale to grow in key markets including the United States, Brazil and China, whereas already on sale of the Trax is proving to be ahead and is doing very well. In China, it\u2019s already the vehicle is number one in the market and it has only been on sale there for three months and year-to-date deliveries have passed 11,500 units in June.","So those are just a few of the products that kind of reinforce the conversation that we\u2019ve been having throughout this call that are in our pipeline. And I think it\u2019s important to end the call to talk about product because that truly is the life spot of the company and I think it\u2019s one of the strength that we\u2019ve clearly over the last few years demonstrated that we knew how to do great products that are award winning and receive well by our customer around the globe. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re here to do. We\u2019re here to build great vehicles and to make sure we\u2019re doing in a way that everyone satisfies their customers but really creates a unique experience and exceeds their expectations. It\u2019s also our goal to do that to make sure and we understand the importance of exceeding customer expectations but more importantly exceeding our owners\u2019 expectations as well.","So that\u2019s the commitment coming from me and I\u2019ll say it\u2019s on behalf of our entire leadership team. And we look forward to continuing to demonstrate that as we move forward. So I appreciate the opportunity and I know we\u2019re having opportunity to talk soon.","Randy Arickx","Thank you, operator.","Operator","Thank you, sir and ma\u2019am.

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, July 25, 2013.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Randy Arickx, Executive Director of Communications and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Randy Arickx","Thanks, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us, as we review the GM financial results for the second quarter of 2013. A press release was issued earlier this morning and the conference call materials are available on the Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call on the web. Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the legend regarding forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language.","This morning, Dan Akerson, General Motors Chairman and CEO will provide opening remarks followed by a review of the financial results of Dan Ammann, Executive Vice President and CFO. Dan Akerson will then conclude the remarks portion of our call with some closing comments. After the presentation portion of the call, we\u2019ll open the line for questions from the analyst community. Also joining us today are Tom Timko, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; Chuck Stevens, CFO, North America; and Jim Davlin, Vice President, Finance and Treasurer.","Let me turn the call over to Dan Akerson.","Daniel Akerson","Thank you, Randy and thank you to everyone joining the call today. Once again, General Motors has delivered a strong quarter driven by our ongoing success in North America and China, progress in Europe, and some very well received new vehicle launches around the globe. As you can see on slide two, we increased our second quarter global deliveries by about 4% from a year ago. Our net revenue increased by $1.5 billion. EBIT adjusted was up 7% to a robust $2.3 billion and adjusted automotive free cash flow was $2.6 billion. For the remainder of the year, we will continue to focus on delivering great value to our customers executing flawless vehicle launches and addressing business challenges head on.","Looking deeper into the quarter, our aggressive rollout of new products North America is continuing to drive improved results, especially for Chevrolet and Cadillac. In Europe, lower cost, higher volumes in United Kingdom and strong new vehicles like the Opel\/Vauxhall Mokka helped narrow our year-over-year loss, but the demand driven recovery isn\u2019t inside yet. So, we have to keep working on cost, complexity, and brand building. In China, our joint venture has delivered record sales and our results have been particularly strong in the midsized upper, medium, and luxury in SUV segments.","Finally, GM Financial continues to grow side by side with our core vehicle business and deliver very good risk-adjusted returns. Strong results in these businesses are helping to offset difficult conditions in other parts of the world especially in GMIO outside China and GMSA outside of Brazil. Dan Ammann will go in more detail on these issues but I will see we\u2019re working hard to improve the things we can control just like we\u2019re doing in Europe. For example Holden has introduced a redesign of it's flagship of VF Commodore Sedan with a new class, sets a new class standard for performance and refinement and Chevrolet is launching the Spin crossover in Indonesia, Thailand and other Asian markets.","We\u2019re working to improve the competitive position, GM Korea which is under pressure because of the higher cost and the strength of the one versus won versus the Japanese yen. The launches of our redesigned large SUVs and early 2014 will improve our competitive position in the middle-east region. In South America we\u2019re working to offset the impact of currency declines through pricing. Now let\u2019s turn to slide three which summarizes some other highlights for the quarter. I want to start with our quality because it's the report card that matters most to our customers; the good news is third party data shows that we\u2019re right on track. For example in 27 years no American company has earned the top spot in the J.D. Power initial quality study until this year when GM took top honors.","In fact the GMC and Chevrolet were the highest ranked non-premium brands in the study. Just yesterday Buick Encore and three Chevrolet\u2019s, the Volt, Sonic and Avalanche each earned awards in the J.D Power of PL Study which measures what customers like about their new vehicles. Chevrolet actually had more segment winners in any other brands and just today consumer reports announced that the all-new 2014 Chevrolet Impala was their highest rated sedan with a score of 95 point, that puts the Impala in par with cars like the Tesla Model S and fully competitive with the Audi A6. Results like these are changing perceptions about our brand for the better and you can see that trend reflected in our sales results.","For example Chevrolet had record global sales in the second quarter and for the first half of the year, that makes 11 straight quarters of higher year-over-year sales. Chevrolet\u2019s performance is a broad-based both geographically and from a product mix standpoint. Deliveries in the United States and China the brands two largest markets were up about 6% through June. And we have seen strong sales of the Sail, Cruze, Malibu and Captiva which account for about 25% of Chevrolet\u2019s global volume.","Keeping this moment going and making sure we deliver a consistent brand experience around the world drew the recent appointment of Alan Batey as the Global Head of Chevrolet. As Alan can tell you there is plenty of head room for Chevrolet to keep growing on the strength of these new products alone for example this year we will launch the Chevrolet tracker small crossover in Brazil. We continue to roll out the all new Chevrolet Silverado in North America. The launch of the Silverado and the GMC Sierra has gone well so far and things couldn\u2019t be better thanks to the nascent U.S. housing recovery. The new crew cab models were the first to reach the market earlier this summer. The quality and craftsmanship has been outstanding and reaction from our dealers and customers has been very good. The demand drivers are equal parts of value, dual economy, capability, refinement with a healthy dose of pent-up demand.","The next all new models in our launch Skadden are the extended cab models which began shipping to dealers this week. Cadillac\u2019s year-over-year growth has been good thanks to the all-new ATS and XTS. These two products made Cadillac the industry\u2019s fastest growing brand in the first half of the year with sales up more than 33%. The Cadillac\u2019s opportunity is no longer limited to just the United States. There is a proverb that says that the best time to plan a treaty was 20 years ago and the second best time is now. This perfectly captures the opportunity we see for Cadillac in China. This year we began the local production of the XTS, which helps drive a 35% first half sales increase for the brand in the Chinese market.","And just last month, we broke ground on a new Cadillac assembling plant in Shanghai. This plant is a lynchpin of our strategy to triple Cadillac volumes by 2015 and achieve 10% share in the Chinese luxury segment by the end of the decade. This will give us much needed scale and further diversify our earnings base. As we put these growth plans in place, we are taking great pain to make sure the company\u2019s internal systems, processes and controls are robust. For example, we dedicated an all-new GM-owned datacenter this quarter and we broke ground on a second neared fully redundant facility that will go online in 2014. This will allow us to continue winding down 23 least datacenters, facilities, if you will, around the globe.","Between April and June, GM Financial completed the acquisition of Ally Financial European operations. And we also created an all-new global business services group to streamline our back office processes, including finance, HR facilities, real estate, and indirect purchasing. We benchmarked some of the world\u2019s best companies as part of this effort. So, we fully expect that we will meaningfully reduce our overhead cost. These are just a few examples of our progress, but I chose them, because they show that GM is inherently stronger company than it was even a year ago, both operationally and on the showroom floor. That will become clear as Dan Ammann walks you through our detailed results over the next few minutes.","With that Dan, the floor is yours.","Daniel Ammann","Thanks, Dan. On slide four, we again remind you of the results for the quarter. Net revenue for the period was $39.1 billion, the $1.5 billion or 4% increase from the prior year, includes a $400 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Our GAAP operating income was unchanged at $1.8 billion. Net income to common stockholders declined $300 million to $1.2 billion and our fully diluted earnings per share came in at $0.75. Net income from the quarter includes an increase in tax expense of $0.5 billion, or $0.29 per share compared with the second quarter of 2012. Automotive net cash from operating activities was $4.5 billion, a $700 million increase from the same period of 2012. For our non-GAAP measures, EBIT adjusted was $2.3 billion in the second quarter, and the EBIT adjusted margin was 5.8%, up from a year ago. Adjusted automotive free cash flow increased $900 million to $2.6 billion for the second quarter.","On slide five, we disclosed the special items that impacted earnings per share. Net income to common stockholders was $1.2 billion, and our fully diluted earnings per share was $0.75. Impacting these numbers was a $200 million loss related to the acquisition of GM Korea preferred shares. This charge had a $0.09 unfavorable impact on earnings per share. I would also like to point out that due to our recent increase in our common stock price we now use the if-converted method to calculate EPS. More information on this change in methodology is available in our supplemental slides.","On slide six, we show our consolidated EBIT adjusted for the prior five quarters. At the bottom of the slide, we list the revenue and margins for the same periods. Our GAAP operating income margin for the second quarter was 4.5% slightly lower than the prior year period and our EBIT adjusted margin increased 0.2 percentage points to 5.8%. Our consolidated wholesale vehicle sales were 1.6 million vehicles in the second quarter, a slight increase from the prior year and our global market share decreased 0.1 percentage points to 11.5%.","On slide seven, we explained the $200 million increase in year-over-year consolidated EBIT adjusted. Volume was $300 million favorable due primarily to higher wholesale volumes in GM North America. Mix was $500 million unfavorable spread across North America, Europe, and GMIO. Price was $400 million favorable due to strong performance in North America and in South America. Cost was $200 million unfavorable as we maintain tight cost control and another was a 100 million favorable. Slide 8, is our year-over-year EBIT adjusted performance by segment, GM North America increased a 100 million to 2 billion, GM Europe had a much improved performance but still recorded a $100 million loss. The performance in GMIO deteriorated by 400 million to 200 million driven by consolidated operations and in our South American business had a slightly improved EBIT adjusted of a 100 million. GM Financial improved 300 million in earnings before taxes and our corporate sector was a 100 million for total EBIT adjusted of 2.3 billion in the second quarter.","We now move on to our segment results for the key performance indicated for GM North America on slide 9, for the second quarter 2013 our total U.S. market share was 18%, our retail incentives on an absolute basis were higher than the prior year period slightly lower than the prior quarter our incentives for the quarter were 11.2% of ATP which was at 114% of the industry average. We expect further improvement in these numbers through the balance of the year.","Slide 10 shows GMA\u2019s EBIT adjusted for the most recent five quarters. The bottom of the slide revenue was 23.5 billion up 1.9 billion from the same quarter in 2012. EBIT adjusted margin was 8.4% for the second quarter a slight decline from the prior year, our U.S. dealer inventory declined sequentially to 708,000 vehicles approximately flat to a year ago despite higher sales. GMA\u2019s wholesale vehicle sales were 809.000 units 49,000 higher than the prior year. North America market share came in at 17.3% which is a 0.1 percentage points decline from the prior year period but higher than the previous three quarters. On slide 11, we provide the explanation of the 100 million year-over-year increase in GMA\u2019s EBIT adjusted.","Volume was 400 million favorable because of the increased wholesale volumes driven by growing industry in our successful vehicle launches in new segments including the Buick Encore and Cadillac ATS. Mix was 200 million unfavorable due to our recent entrance into the small crossover and mini-segments and lower sports car production as we prepare for the launch of the 2014 Corvette Stingray; price was 300 million favorable on the strength of our recently launched vehicles including the Chevy Impala.","Cost was 400 million unfavorable primarily due to fixed cost increases related to manufacturing launch costs, reduced pension income and increased depreciation and amortization. On slide 12, GME reported an EBIT adjusted loss of a 100 million for the second quarter a $300 million improvement from the prior year. Revenue declined 7% to 5.2 billion for the quarter however the EBIT adjusted margin in the segment improved 5 percentage points to a negative 2.1%. GME\u2019s wholesale vehicle sales for the quarter were 276,000 units, 14,000 less than the prior year and our European market share was 8.5% down 0.3 percentage points from the prior year with a small increase from the prior two quarters.","On slide 13, we provide the major components of GME\u2019s $300 million increase and EBIT adjusted. Volume was a 100 million unfavorable due to a declining industry. Mix was a 100 million headwind because of negative car line mix and price was 100 million unfavorable due to continued competitive pressure in the industry. Cost was 400 million favorable due to 200 million in lower depreciation and amortization and 200 million in savings and other fixed costs including engineering cost and other ongoing initiatives transform the business. Other was a 100 million favorable due to foreign exchange; this totaled the GME\u2019s EBIT adjusted loss of a $100 million for the second quarter of 2013. Although we\u2019re pleased with a favorable year-over-year performance we expect financial performance in GME results to exhibit some seasonal decline in the second half of the year. We now move on to GMIO\u2019s profitability for the prior five quarters on slide 14, second quarter performance was affected by strengthen in China, volume price and mixed pressures in the consolidated operations and the impact of several warranty and recall campaigns.","EBIT adjusted was 200 million including 400 million in equity income from our joint ventures, at the bottom of the slide GMIO\u2019s revenue from consolidated operation was 5.3 billion, the 600 million decline from last year reflects the challenges in our consolidated operations where our EBITDA adjust margin was a negative 3.6% down significantly from the prior year. And net income margin from our China\u2019s JVs remain strong at 9.4% approximately flat year-over-year. Recent wholesale vehicle sales were 268,000 units for the consolidated business and 772,000 units for our China JV. Our market share in the Asia-Pacific region was 9.3%, a small improvement from last year due to the growth in our China sales.","On slide 15, we provide the major components of GMIO\u2019s year-over-year performance. Volume was $100 million unfavorable due to 27,000 units decline in wholesale volumes in our consolidated operations. Mix was $200 million unfavorable due primarily to country and product mix and price was $100 million unfavorable as the devalued gain continues to drive competitive pressures across multiple markets in the region. Cost was $100 million headwind and other improved $100 million because of the higher equity income from our China JVs. Going forward, we expect our China business to continue to be strong. In regard to consolidated operations, we should see the benefit of important launches in the region in the second half and we are developing and implementing action plans to adjust the ongoing challenges in the marketplace.","Slide 16 provides a look at GM South America\u2019s performance in recent quarters. Revenue improved $200 million to $4.3 billion despite a $400 million headwind from foreign exchange. EBIT adjusted margin in the segment was 1.3%, nearly a 4 percentage point higher than the year. South America\u2019s wholesale vehicle sales were 278,000 units, up 13,000 from the prior year. South American market share declined slightly to 17.1% in the quarter, although our deliveries were greater than the prior year. In the six months ended June 30, we have the number one market share in South America of 17.2%.","On slide 17, if you look at the change in year-over-year EBIT adjusted, which rounded to zero. Volume and mix had no impact. Price was $200 million favorable due to actions we have taken in Venezuela and Argentina in response to inflationary and FX pressures. Cost had no impact and other had a $200 million adverse impact due to unfavorable foreign exchange in Brazil, Argentina, and Venezuela. This totals to a $100 million EBIT adjusted in South America for the second quarter.","Slide 18 provides our walk of adjusted automotive free cash flow for the second quarter. As a reminder, our net income to stockholders was $1.2 billion. After adjusting for non-controlling interests and Series A preferred dividends and deducting GM Financial earnings, our automotive income was $1.2 billion. We have $200 million in non-cash special items and our D&A expense was $1.5 billion. Working capital was $300 million source of cash. The variance from the prior year is due to production scheduling differences and a reduction in inventory as we continue to drive working capital efficiency. Pension and OPEB cash payments exceeded expense by $100 million in the quarter. In other words, a $1.3 billion source of cash, $400 million decline from the prior year. This totals to automotive net cash from operating activities of $4.5 billion. We had $1.9 billion of capital expenditures in the quarter giving us an adjusted automotive free cash flow of $2.6 billion.","On slide 19, we provide a summary of our key automotive balance sheet items. We finished the second quarter with $24.2 billion in cash and current marketable securities and $10.6 billion in available credit facilities with total available liquidity of $34.8 billion. Our debt was $4 billion, a decline from the prior quarter is due to the redemption of GM Korea preferred stock and the elimination of $700 million of GM wholesale financing upon the consolidation of the Ally International operations. Series A preferred stock obligation remained at $5.5 billion. And on a reported basis, our U.S. qualified pension plans were under-funded by $12.9 billion and our non-U.S. pension plans were under-funded by $13.1 billion. Our unfunded OPEB liability was $7.6 billion in the second quarter.","Slide 20 provides a brief summary of our order financing activities. GM Financial has already released their results and will hold their earnings conference call afternoon. Our U.S. sub-prime penetration in the second quarter was 8.6% flat to the prior year. Our U.S. lease penetration increased further 4.6 percentage points to 20% in Q2 as we continue to leverage our financing relationships and capabilities and improve residual values to drive towards industry competitive levels in key segments. Lease penetration in Canada was at 9.2%, up slightly from the prior year. GM new vehicles, as a percentage of GM Financial originations rose to 68% in the quarter with the closing of a portion of the Ally IO transaction. And GM Financials percentage of GM\u2019s U.S. consumer sub-prime financing and leasing was 25% on the quarter. GM Financials annualized net credit losses remained low at 1.4% and earnings before tax was 254 million for the second quarter reflecting both continued strong performance in the North American business and the acquisition of the IO business in the quarter. Finally on slide 21, I would like to emphasize several initiatives we\u2019re focusing on in the second half of 2013. We must continue to successfully execute the launch of that new vehicles for design and performance that will consistently exceed customer expectations. We will be focusing on reducing cost and complexity in the business to insure we can deliver winning vehicles at a price that works for the customer and a cost that works for us. We will build on the moment we have received with our recent IQS Award from J.D. Power and we will develop and execute initiatives to improve our performance in the consolidated operations on GMIO. And here again is Dan Akerson with a few closing remarks.","Dan Akerson","Thanks Dan, quickly as you can see from the quarter strength in our brand, improving quality and streamlining the organization is starting to pay off. Not only our GM products the best in memory our business is much more resilient in the face of economic headwind. I say resilient not immune. There always be currency shifts, recessions or unrest somewhere in the world that we have to manage through. But in GM the short-term challenges are no longer the tail wagging the dog, that\u2019s the benefit of our fortress balance sheet and aggressive new-product program and our systemic attack on the issues that hold us back including complexity and cost. With that said, we\u2019re now happy to take any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America. Please proceed.","John Murphy - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","First question on Europe given the great performance there is there any consideration in moving forward your target from 2015 to 2014 on your breakeven there because everything you\u2019re doing is real self-help, you\u2019re not getting a lot of help from the market itself, you\u2019re really creating this performance on your own. I\u2019m just curious what your thoughts are there.","Dan Ammann","Yeah John we don\u2019t have an updated target at this point in time. We\u2019re a few quarters into our plan and executing to our plan and the market environment remains quite challenging as you\u2019re well aware. We\u2019re pleased with the year-over-year improvement we\u2019re showing through the first half of the year. We do typically have as you know some seasonal sort of challenge more in the second half so we got to work our way through that but we\u2019re pleased with performance that are but still long way to go particularly with the macroeconomic environment.","Dan Akerson","John we\u2019re pleased not satisfied, we\u2019re going to continue to push both play offense and defense. The new product roll out so help on offense but we\u2019re going to continue to focus on taking cost out of the business.","John Murphy - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Second question, truck maybe on pick-up pricing, it's been much stronger than expected, I know on the new truck versus the old truck you\u2019re keeping MSRPs flat but obviously that\u2019s not the full story on average transaction prices. I\u2019m just curious is there a possibility that you might get even better pricing than you initial expected on the new truck at the back half of the year because the pricing on the outgoing truck has been better than expected.","Dan Akerson","Yeah John I it it's too early to make predictions about whether we\u2019re going to have upside or not on the new truck. We have just launched it in the month of July about 20% of our sales will be the new truck which is the crew cab. I would say that what we have seen in the market over the last three or four months with a stronger segment share our performance with the outgoing GMT900 in the reduction and incentives would give us cautious optimism that the pricing will hold-up and we may have an opportunity but it's really too early to tell on that truck.","John Murphy - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Okay then Dan just on the (inaudible) on slide 19, the 12.9 billion underfunding for the U.S. plan does that include a remeasurement for discount rates or any other actions?","Dan Ammann","No it does not.","John Murphy - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Okay good and then just lastly, Dan Akerson I mean you talked about it in your opening comments the global business services group and it sounds like a great idea and it sounds like it's in it's early stages, I\u2019m just curious as you work through that process is that going to be more at a cost saving exercise or is that going to create more efficiency through the organization. I was just trying to understand really what the true aim of that is and what we can expect out of it?","Daniel Akerson","The way I have seen this done when I was on the Board of American Express, we benchmarked off, then we benchmarked off of P&G, and what you do is you consolidate your back office systems and try to get more efficient and take cost out, and it does have organizational implications.","John Murphy - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Okay. And the timeframe for that, is there targets?","Daniel Akerson","We just started it in earnest. We are really in the early stages of it, but over the next year or two, we hope to take. Well, I don\u2019t want to give a number, but it\u2019s we have strong ambition, strong targets to reduce our cost.","John Murphy - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley","Hey, everybody. Just a first question on GMIO, can I ask kindly to give a bit more detail about where the execution issues are maybe between India or Australia or other factors? And also within that question, has the change in the segment reporting shifted a little bit of profit out of GM, out of GMIO and into GMIO from the GM Korea ops, has that also been an impact here that you like to quantify?","Daniel Ammann","Yes. Let me address the second piece and then I will direct the first piece. The short answer to the second piece is no, there is no impact on the year-over-year comparisons, because last year was represented on the same basis. Back to the first question, there is really three aspects of us that I identified. One is there are couple of markets that have underperformed from a volume point of view, the overall market, so think about the softness in India as an example, Russia to some extent. The second dynamic is more to the Southeast Asia, including Australia, where we have a lot of competition from the Japanese manufacturers who are sourcing to those markets out of Japan, whereas we are sourcing more out of Korea. So, there has been a currency impact there. And then the third element more on the cost side is we have had a handful of our warranty and recall items stood us in the second quarter. So, the way to think about this going forward is we will continue to have some impact from all of those things probably rolling into Q3, but as we exit the year, we do have some important launches ahead of us in the second quarter. We do hope to see warranty recall related items will fall away, and obviously, we will need to address whatever those competitive dynamic is in the market from a currency perspective as we go, so\u2026","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley","Can you quantify that, so the warranty recall seems to more fall on execution and the others are more market conditions and competition, I mean, can you quantify the warranty recall, is it $100 million or $200 million order magnitude?","Daniel Ammann","I would say it\u2019s the \u2013 more than half of the impact is market related and less than half is the warranty and other expense related.","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley","Okay, that\u2019s great. A question on North America, would you describe kind of big picture that the truck changeover year-over-year in the quarter was a net positive, negative, or neutral when you factor in kind of say benefits on pricing versus kind of the delta year-on-year with the changeover knowing that you are also doing some changeover pre-production in the deferred maintenance last year as well, what was the balance of the truck isolating, if you could directionally?","Chuck Stevens","Yes, from a financial perspective net, slightly negative in the quarter in fact. There was $300 million in manufacturing, pre-production and startup. We only produced about 50,000 K2s. So, I would say from that aspect slight negative. Overall truck performance in the quarter quite positive from a share standpoint, our retail segment share primarily on the strength of the GMT900 and retail was up 140 basis points year-to-date. So, I would say, that had a benefit in health from a pricing perspective as well on the GMT900.","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley","That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks. And last question just on GM Financial credit losses, would the credit losses still have improved year-on-year, even excluding the Ally IO addition? Thanks.","Daniel Ammann","Yes, is the short answer to that.","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley","Great. Take care guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan from UBS. Please proceed.","Colin Langan - UBS","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Can you just give an update on your guidance for North America? Do you still expect second half to be stronger. I think you started, you were saying that the percentage margin should be five year-over-year and I guess related to the question on the (inaudible), the 300 million in pre-production cost will that go in the second half or do you have similar cost there.","Dan Ammann","And the first question I don\u2019t think we\u2019re really changing our guidance, our guidance was aggregate EBIT would be up year-over-year with the cadence you know more back-end weighted and I think the plan is being executed to that and nothing has changed versus that. From a pre-production startup perspective relative specifically to the K2XX in Q3 and we\u2019re going through the kind of saying launch process we went through was slow (ph) in Q2 so those costs will be present in Q3 and I would expect them to start to mitigate a little bit going into Q4 with the launch of the heavy duties and full size SUV in Q1 next year.","Colin Langan \u2013 UBS","Okay and you had very good cash flow in the quarter, any thoughts on dividends for common shareholders and what factors would sort of drive that decision to add a divined?","Dan Akerson","We have no decision on dividends at this point in time, well what we have outlined from a capital allocation point of view first and foremost we\u2019re going to be reinvesting in products and the product portfolio and you have seen us do that over the last year or two, we\u2019re obviously looking to preserve our fortress balance sheet we took some action in the quarter along those lines retiring some expensive debt that we had internationally which is obviously accretive to the bottom line and as we look at over the next 12 to 18 months we do have a significant opportunity later next year to redeem the very expensive preferred that we have outstanding for the (inaudible) trust who want to address and balancing with all of that is returns to shareholders. We obviously took an aggressive move at the end of last year with a significant stock repurchase to help us solve the U.S. treasury exit and we\u2019re going to look to keep a balanced approach between those three buckets between reinvesting in the business, strengthening the balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders that balanced approach that you\u2019ve seen so far will continue.","Colin Langan \u2013 UBS","Okay and just lastly any update on your partnership with Peugeot I mean there was some media reports I guess a month or so ago, expect claim you may be interested in increasing your stake. Any thoughts on that will be helpful.","Dan Akerson","Our focus right now is on executing the alliance that we have discussed over the last year plus we have product programs that are being actively worked on, logistics work that\u2019s been done, purchasing work that\u2019s been done and that\u2019s really where the focus is right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays. Please proceed.","Brian Johnson - Barclays","In South America we did see improvement yesterday from one of your competitors there, I don\u2019t think we have seen the Fiat numbers yet. But just you know what is the path to sort of getting back to sort of 2% - 3% profits there and since you\u2019re on a product roll out why aren\u2019t we seeing some of the benefits or are we just seeing that\u2019s swamped by currency or things in other regions?","Dan Ammann","I would say there is really a couple of dynamics, as you point out we do have essentially a brand new product portfolio in Brazil which is fairly the biggest market and that is performing the way that we wanted to and we\u2019re in the marketplace getting the results that we\u2019re looking for. There has been really two dynamics that have impacted us to-date this year that we\u2019re not fully baked into the plan if you like from the outset, the first being the just political unrest that we\u2019re seeing in Venezuela which has disrupted our operations on multiple occasions through the year and that\u2019s an important market from a profitability point of view for us, the second component is there has obviously been some very substantial moves on an FX basis, while we\u2019re significantly localized in the market from a production point of view we still have some meaningful amount of imported components and so on for the market and so when we have the Brazilian currency for example devaluing in the way that have has, that does cause an impact to us. So portfolio working well, Venezuela disruption making an impact and FX making an impact.","Brian Johnson - Barclays","And last year we asked a similar question and you talked about the process to localize component sourcing, is that underway and is there a flip over point in model years or anything we can look forward to? Is it just going to be very gradual?","Daniel Akerson","It\u2019s going to be a sort of component by component activity and it\u2019s underway, but further to go on that.","Colin Langan - UBS","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","Good morning everybody. Just first to follow-up on that last question, as far as the outlook for Latin America in the back half, are there any factors maybe product-related that could offset a bit of a weaker macro environment?","Daniel Ammann","Well, obviously, we will be looking at what\u2019s going on in the marketplace from a pricing point of view as to what we can recover on the FX side there. So, we will pay close attention to that. And then the Venezuela situation will be a variable, but from a product point of view, we are finishing up the launch activity through the first half. So, it wasn\u2019t all, we didn\u2019t come into the year with the whole portfolio launch, but we are getting, excuse me, close to that point now. So, we will get a little bit of tailwind from that in the second half.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","Okay, but relative to what we see in Q2, it might accelerate a little bit, is that fair?","Daniel Ammann","Yes, there is a possibility. Again, it\u2019s going to be a function of sort of Venezuela situation and currency and what we have been offsetting the marketplace.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And can you pass along any thoughts on China, what is the impact of a bit more moderate GDP growth and SHIBOR issues there. Is there sort of a range of expectations that you might have if GDP growth there has a six handle instead of an eight handle, any kind of broad macro thoughts on that market for you?","Daniel Ammann","Yes, our industry view is still to see the industry up high single-digits for the year 7% to 9%. We are obviously participating nicely in that and both from a share point of view and margin management point of view. So, our outlook remains reasonably favorable, but obviously, we are keeping a close eye on the short-term dynamics in our credit markets and all those things.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","Alright. And then just lastly a pretty impressive number for Europe in terms of the cost savings, is this the run rate that we should be thinking of going forward? Are there elements here whether it\u2019s restructuring that takes a while to get implemented or the PSA cost savings that actually continue to, they would be accretive to this?","Daniel Ammann","Well, remember, a piece of this is obviously the DNA savings that we talked about.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","Right.","Daniel Ammann","At some length, so that will roll through. Beyond that, it\u2019s really just what you are seeing is the result of just day-to-day walking and tackling and driving hard on the business. We got a terrific team on the ground there that\u2019s really executing. We still got a long way to go to get figured to where we want to get to. We will see as we go along some restructuring items come through as we make progress on some of our rationalizations, but we are driving very hard. So, it continued to deliver good year-over-year improvement.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","Okay, great. Thank you. Congratulations.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan","Hi, thanks for taking my call. Just on pension, I am curious if the rise in interest rates changes in any way you think about the pension, does the rise in interest rates, does it make strategic actions less imperative or could it impact to the opposite that an improvement in the funded status we knew that you could take that improvement and reinvest it in strategic actions, that increased the under-funding, but decreased the overall liability and risk such as the transaction that you did with Prudential?","Daniel Ammann","Yes, I would say, that as the plants get more fully funded, it gives us ultimately more flexibility. We have been on a long journey now for the last few years and we have talked about it at great length of de-risking and having the plants get more fully funded. I think we have made some very significant strides so far. I think everybody has been anticipating at some point that interest rates would increase. We have seen obviously a piece of that happened so far. Rates can also go down just as you believe they have gone up here, but as and if we get more fully funded, I think it gives us more rather than less flexibility.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan","Okay. Then just lastly, obviously, you continue to have very strong results in China overall, and I know that your 1Q performance there was unusually strong and those margins were unlikely to continue at that rate. I think it was indicated few months back, but I am curious just that given that your wholesales in China were up something like 11% and why there was not much resulting operating leverage there with the net income margin rising only 10 bps year-over-year, is this about the pricing pressures that we often read out or is it maybe something else like lumpiness of reinvesting in the business or something, thanks.","Dan Ammann","Well I think it's a reasonable representation of where we\u2019re from a run rate point of view so the business grew but it's a competitive market but we were able to within that competitive market not only hold margins but increase then slightly. So we think that\u2019s the solid result and we\u2019re obviously be continuing to try to work that on court (ph).","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","A follow-up question on the pension front, the sensitivities is just going off of what\u2019s in the (inaudible), on the U.S. plan I think it's something like 2.2 billion for every 25 basis points in rates, of course it's sort of being well publicized that your allocation to fixed income you know is now a lot higher at about 60% I believe so clearly there would be some offset from the decline into your bond portfolio. Can you help us think about how we might put together a net sensitivity either in dollar terms or how we think about the duration of your asset portfolio?","Dan Ammann","I would say the simplest way to think about that is to have the sensitivity that we have put out there, so take the liability side and divide it by half and you get the results. Another way is that the effective asset allocation approximately half on the asset side to fixed income.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","Right like 1.1 billion negative for every 25 bps.","Dan Ammann","Yep.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","Okay that\u2019s straightforward. I had a follow-up question on Brazil you know just with some of the social unrest that you\u2019ve seen there and people sort of broadly starting to take down or are continuing take down I should say their GDP expectations. How are you guys thinking about the end market demand for that regions or does that region and Brazil specifically, are you starting to see that show up and slower showroom traffic or it has been fairly resilient.","Dan Akerson","I wouldn\u2019t say we have seen anything really tangible yet although it creates a little bit of a risk element for the market in the second half of the year but like I said no real signs at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Stover from Guggenheim. Please proceed.","Matthew Stover - Guggenheim Securities","Most of my questions have been addressed, I guess just sort of a big picture question and there has been a lot of discussion about the housing market and pick-up trucks and with the snap up in rates and the adjustments that we have seen mortgage rates and the adjustments that we\u2019re seeing in some of the housing stocks right now. Is that causing your folks to change your view on how the pickup truck market could or should develop over the course of next year.","Dan Akerson","I wouldn\u2019t say that there is a fundamental change, I mean we\u2019re quite focused on what\u2019s driving the underlying demand of the business and the role that interest rates play in that EBIT directly or indirectly through the housing market. So where we are keeping close eye on that but there is more than just the housing market that\u2019s driving the truck business at this point in time you know obviously our product cadence, lot of pent-up demand as generally.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citigroup. Please proceed.","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citigroup","Just one clarification on cash, free cash flow was at 2.6 billion but it looks like the cash balance, the automotive cash balance was flat sequentially, if you can just help us walk through that?","Dan Akerson","Yeah there is couple of components, really three main ones and some are the cats and dogs, the first one is we invested 1.3 billion in the quarter into GM Financial to facilitate the our international acquisition the first part of that. Remember when we announced that deal last year we said that there will be a $2 billion capital contribution from GM and to GM actually it's somewhat (ph) first leg of that this quarter and we spend about 700 million to redeem the remaining portion of the GM Korea preferred which shows up as a debt instrument on the balance sheet, so it's a 7% coupon instrument that we\u2019re able to redeem as we view that as expensive. And then the final piece is we have our preferred dividends that we pay every quarter that rolls through below the cash flow or after the cash flow measurement line. So, those will be the main components.","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citigroup","That\u2019s helpful. And then going back to the Europe, I mean last year, you identified about $500 million of fixed cost savings between 2013 and 2015, can you update us on how much of that $500 million are you realizing this year roughly?","Daniel Ammann","We are getting into a reasonable chunk of that. And we are not constraining ourselves obviously to $500 million. We are going after everything that we can find, but as you know the first dollars on those kind of exercises are the easiest ones to get and you have made some good progress, but we still got a fair amount of work to do.","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citigroup","Great. Just lastly, Chuck, you may have mentioned it in the past question, but did you quantify how much if any positive pricing you saw in the wholesales for K2XX in the second quarter?","Daniel Ammann","I did that, indicate that specifically. I would say generally, when we looked at K2 pricing, the overall impact of new measures, including the K2, Impalas, and other vehicles net-net was about $600 million of the tailwind in Q2 with carryover products, primarily the GMT900 had $300 million headwind.","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citigroup","Perfect, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks so much, guys.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. Our final question comes from the line of Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. Mr. Spak, your line is open. Please proceed with your question.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks for taking my question. First one is just a point of clarification on Europe, you talked about the tougher second half seasonally, but you are still counting on improved performance on a year-over-year basis that was just versus the first half?","Daniel Ammann","Yes, that\u2019s correct. We are driving obviously for year-over-year improvement, but if you go back and look at the last two, three years you will see clearly a seasonal decline in the second half.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And then maybe if you could just give us some color (inaudible) to the fixed income call later I guess, but of what the impact of rising rates has been so far, and whether you are really seeing the consumer rates move up in tandem with rates or whether you guys internally and maybe some of the independents have been getting some of that interest rate increase?","Daniel Ammann","Yes, we haven\u2019t really seen it at all in terms of big consumer rates in a meaningful way from, you remember again, we are more operating from that perspective at the shorter end of the curve and so the short answer is no meaningful impact at this point.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Mr. Arickx, I will now turn the call back to you please continue with the presentation or closing remarks.","Randy Arickx","Thank you, operator, and thank you everyone for joining us today. I appreciate it.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. Have a great day everyone."],"10128":["General Motors Co.

Welcome to the General Motors Company Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Tuesday, July 25, 2017.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Dhivya Suryadevara, Vice President of Corporate Finance. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.","Thanks, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us as we review GM's financial results for the second quarter of 2017. Our press release was issued this morning, and the conference call materials are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast.","Included in the chart set materials published this morning, we had the key takeaways from each chart in the notes pages in order to provide color on the results. This morning, Mary Barra, GM's Chairman and CEO, will provide some brief opening remarks; followed by Chuck Stevens, GM's Executive VP and CFO. We will then open the line for questions from the analyst's community.","Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language. In the room today, we also have Tom Timko, Vice President, Global Business Services, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; and Rick Westenberg, Vice President and Treasurer to assist in answering your questions.","I will now turn the call over to Mary Barra.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Thanks, Dhivya, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining. We delivered a strong second quarter despite a more challenging business environment that included softer industry sales in the U.S. and pricing challenges in China.","Results from our continuing operations adjusted for the pending sale of our Opel\/Vauxhall brands and GM Financial operations in Europe include net revenue of $37 billion, income of $2.4 billion, EBIT-adjusted of $3.7 billion, and EBIT-adjusted margin of 10%, EPS diluted of $1.60 and EPS diluted-adjusted of $1.89, EPS-adjusted of $3.5 billion in North America and EBIT-adjusted margins of 12.2%, adjusted automotive free cash flow of $2.6 billion, and our return on invested capital adjusted is 30.4% on a trailing four-quarter basis. This reflects the positive impact of our disciplined capital allocation framework.","Also, important to note, that during the quarter we returned about $2.1 billion to shareholders, $600 million in dividends and $1.5 billion in share repurchases. We expect to return up to $7 billion to shareholders by the end of 2017 through dividends and share buybacks, subject to market conditions.","We made significant moves in the quarter to strengthen our core business performance and capitalize on growth opportunities for the long term. In May, we announced our intent to restructure our international operations, to focus GM India on export manufacturing only, to transition our business in GM South America to ISUZU Motors and to phase out the Chevrolet brand in both markets by the end of the year.","Combined with the pending sale of our Opel\/ Vauxhall brands and GM Financial's business in Europe, our recent restructuring actions will allow us to deploy resources and capital to higher return opportunities, such as refreshing our profitable global SUV and U.S. full-size truck portfolios and our global emerging-market vehicle program. We will also continue the growth of GM Financial and our very profitable after-sales, will continue leveraging our connectivity leadership through OnStar, and transforming Cadillac to lead in the global high-margin luxury segment.","We're also investing in transformative technologies around electrification, autonomous technology, connectivity, and shared mobility services as part of our continuing work to redefine the future of personal mobility. We will continue to build on our significant progress by driving improvements across markets and in product segments to deliver the appropriate returns.","Now, let's take a look at a few of the regions that really drove our performance in the quarter. First North America. In the United States, our total sales and retail sales and market share are on pace with last year's first half performance and ahead of the industry. We believe our disciplined go-to-market strategy is paying off. Our retail sales mix of 6% in Q2 was not only the lowest among full-line automakers in the U.S., it was our lowest for GM in eight years. We are also seeing disciplines on incentives. Our incentives spend, as a percentage of average transaction price, was about 12% in the second quarter, down two full percentage points from the first quarter.","We continue to grow in the critical crossover segments that are most popular with consumers. GM's retail crossover share in Q2 was up 24% year-over-year, representing the best quarter in our history for crossover sales. As we prepare to launch four more crossovers in the second half, this is a strong starting point. Overall GM's crossover retail market share increased 1.7% year-over-year, or 1.7 points year-over-year. Cadillac SUV sales were up 16% year-over-year, the best Q2 in history. Buick sales were up 16% year-over-year, its best Q2 since 2005.","Our average transaction price in Q2 of $35,000 was essentially flat year-over-year exceeding the overall industry by about $3,800 and we continue to make strides on vehicle quality. In the J.D. Power Initial Quality Study, Fort Wayne assembly received the 2017 Gold Plant Quality Award for the Americas for the highest manufacturing quality. The plant builds light and heavy-duty Chevrolet Silverado full-size pickups, which led their segments, and the GMC Sierra and Sierra heavy-duty.","As we moved to China, GM China set a Q2 sales record with deliveries of 852,000 vehicles, up about 1% year-over-year. Cadillac and Baojun also set Q2 sales records on strong sales of the Cadillac XT5 and Baojun 510. Cadillac sales were up 62% and Baojun sales were up 66% year-over-year in the quarter. Year-to-date Cadillac is up 70%.","Deliveries of the Chevrolet Equinox SUV in China surpassed 10,000 units since its launch in late April. And the Velite 5, Buick's first extended range electric vehicle made its global debut in April. We expect it to go on sale later this year.","I also want to make a few points about South America. Despite challenging macroeconomic conditions, we posted a year-over-year improvement to essentially breakeven. Our sales and market share gains outpaced the industry and Chevrolet continues its 17-year market leadership. In the quarter, South America delivered 160,000 vehicles, up 18% year-over-year and market share rose 0.7 points. Throughout the first half of 2017, sales were up more than 14% compared to a year ago.","As we look at the technologies that are transforming our industry, our commitment to leading in this transformation and the future of personal mobility includes making game-changing technologies available to as many customers as possible. We are excited that the Chevrolet Bolt EV, the first affordable long-range electric vehicle, goes on sale nationwide August 1 at certified Chevrolet dealerships. More than 80% of Bolt EV customers have not previously owned a Chevrolet. Chevrolet has sold nearly 8,200 Bolt EVs since they went on sale in December of 2016.","Our Cruise Automation team in San Francisco and our technical experts in Warren are making significant progress in our drive to safely deploy our self-driving electric vehicles in commercial ridesharing networks. Last month GM became the first company to use mass production methods to build 130 autonomous vehicles, growing our test fleet to 180. We plan to deploy these vehicles in the challenging driving environment of San Francisco, as well as Scottsdale, Arizona, and Metro Detroit where we are already testing our vehicles today.","In addition, technologies like Super Cruise are helping us create a safer future. As we prepare for the fall introduction of Super Cruise on the 2018 Cadillac CT6, GM engineers have logged roughly 160,000 miles of driving on U.S. and Canadian highways as part of the final validation of the system. And when it comes to shared mobility, we keep refining Maven to meet customers' needs as we learn more about the growing sharing economy and freelance economy. In addition to expanding Maven City in New York, we announced that Maven Gig will be in California in three cities. Freelancers can rent Chevrolet Bolt EVs for delivery and ridesharing services.","So as we look at H2, we clearly see a tougher business environment and the entire GM team has a disciplined and relentless focus on doing what is necessary to address challenges. For example, in addition to the actions in Europe and our international operations, we are managing passenger car output to ensure our inventories are appropriate and to protect our brands.","In North America, our crossover launches continue with the Chevrolet Equinox and the Chevrolet Traverse, the GMC Terrain, and the Buick Enclave. We will also launch the Equinox in Q4 in South America and launch 10 newer refreshed models in China. As Chuck shared with many of you last month, we expect another strong year in North America with EBIT-adjusted margins of 10%-plus. In addition, on a continuing operations basis, we still expect our EPS diluted-adjusted to be in the $6.00 to $6.50 range for the full year.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Chuck.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Thanks, Mary. We had another strong quarter capping off a record first half of the year. On a continuing operations basis, we generated net revenue of $74.3 billion, EBIT-adjusted of $7.2 billion, and an EBIT-adjusted margin of 9.7% in the first half of the year. Our strong second quarter is another proof point of our commitment to price and cost discipline. Our performance also underscores the benefits of the strategic actions we've taken to focus the company on markets and segments where we have strong competitive positions and believe we can drive higher returns.","North America continued to lead, overcoming softer industry conditions to generate first half revenue of $57.8 billion, up nearly 2% year-over-year. EBIT-adjusted of $6.9 billion, up 13% versus the first half of 2016, and a 12% EBIT-adjusted margin, an increase of 1.2 percentage points versus 2016.","For the second quarter, North American EBIT-adjusted was $3.5 billion with a 12.2% margin, driven primarily by solid cost improvement of $600 million and improved mix of $500 million as we are just starting to see the benefits of our strong crossover launches and our focus on cost continues. Through the second quarter, we've generated about $5 billion in cost efficiencies since 2014 and are on our way to achieve our goal of $6.5 billion by the end of 2018.","Shifting to inventory, as we have indicated, we built inventory in the first half in preparation for our previously announced downtime in trucks and crossovers in the second half of the year. We're also committed to take action on passenger cars, which we have done and will continue to do as required to align supply and demand. And as we exit the second quarter, we are generally on plan with days supply at 105 days. We are committed to bring inventory in line with year-end 2016 levels of about 70 days supply by the end of this year.","Clearly, our production will be impacted in the third quarter and the second half. We expect factory unit sales in North America to be down about 150,000 units in the second half versus the first half. With that said, and consistent with our last Office Hours session and the comments Mary just made, we fully expect to generate strong 10%-plus margins in North America in 2017.","Moving on to China, China generated another $500 million of equity income in the second quarter for a total of $1 billion of equity income for the first half, both flat year-over-year. We continue to benefit from shifting consumer preferences and our strength with new products in the luxury, SUV and crossover segments. Again, we are very much on track to deliver another year of strong equity income in China.","Turning to South America. In the first half, revenue was $4.3 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion, or 43% year-over-year and the EBIT-adjusted loss was about $100 million, a $40 million improvement from a year ago. As Mary mentioned, we essentially broke even in the second quarter, highlighting that our new breakeven SAAR is approximately 2.2 million units in Brazil. Based on that, we have reduced our breakeven point by about 40% from the last peak in 2012. We expect our second half results to continue our year-over-year improvement, driven by a modest industry recovery and the strength of our portfolio on brands in South America.","A few words on GM Financial, the corporate sector, free cash flow and share buybacks. GM Financial generated quarterly revenue of $3 billion, up 40% from $2.1 billion in 2016, resulting in record earnings before taxes of about $400 million in the quarter, up about 67% year-over-year despite continued pressure in residual values. Through the first half, GM Financial generated almost $600 million of earnings before taxes, up about $200 million, or 44% versus the first half of 2016, driven by a 41% increase in revenue to $5.7 billion.","We do expect the decline in used-car pricing to continue to put pressure on GM Financials' residual values through the second half of 2017, and we would expect some moderation in earnings in the second half, but we will still deliver solid year-over-year earnings growth for the full year.","Corporate costs were about $500 million in the second quarter with the first half total of approximately $800 million, including spending on autonomous and other future mobility initiatives. As discussed during our recent Office Hours webcast, the corporate sector will include about $200 million of annual legacy European costs going forward, primarily related to retained pension expense.","Also going forward, we would expect the corporate sector will result in a net expense of approximately $400 million to $500 million quarterly. Adjusted automotive free cash flow for the second quarter was $2.6 billion for a first half total of $2 billion. This is an improvement of $300 million compared to the first half of 2016, driven primarily by improved automotive net income. CapEx was $4.1 billion for the first half and we expect full-year capital expenditures on a continuing operations basis to be approximately $8 billion. Our strong cash flow performance enabled us to repurchase $1.5 billion of shares in the second quarter, along with $600 million in dividends.","Due to the pending sale of Opel\/Vauxhall and GM Financial's European operations to the PSA Group, GM has provided our 2017 outlook on a continuing operations basis, which is described in more detail in our Analyst Deck. We expect revenue, EBIT-adjusted, and EBIT-adjusted margins to meet or exceed our 2016 performance on a continuing operations basis. And it's fair to say that when compared to what we reported in February for 2016, we expect EBIT-adjusted and EBIT-adjusted margins to improve.","Adjusted auto free cash flow is expected to be approximately $7 billion. This is in line with our original guidance of $6 billion after taking into account the approximate $1 billion impact of European related cash flow. And we anticipate to generate a ROIC-adjusted of greater than 25% for the year. We expect our cash generation, along with our ability to reduce our cash balance by $2 billion after the Europe transaction closes, to allow us to return up to $7 billion to our shareholders in 2017 through dividends and share repurchases, again, subject to market conditions.","And as Mary mentioned, we still expect to deliver EPS diluted-adjusted in the $6.00 to $6.50 range, supported by our strong first half performance and the benefit of the Opel\/Vauxhall sale. This concludes our opening comments.","We'll now move to the question-and-answer portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question is going to come from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. I want to follow-up more on the strategic question. First, can you give us some sense on the car side, especially after your exit from PSA? Just sort of what your ongoing investments in sedans are going to be over the next several years? How you're thinking really about South America and Asia-Pac ex-China? And was there any discussion of those potentially going along with the Opel sale? I think South America might've been originally established as an Opel branch. And just kind of as you think about your capital, what's the incremental return of putting it into cars versus crossover and pickups?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Good morning, Brian. So, first, I think with the Opel\/Vauxhall transaction, we've said that \u2013 and with the announcements that we made in India and South Africa, that we believe we're in the right market. We have a very strong franchise in South America and as I said in my opening remarks, we're going to continue to work to improve performance and efficiency in each country and by segment. So from a where we intend to play, I think that outlines that.","When you look specifically at passenger cars, recall we just launched the compact and midsize architectures, the Chevrolet-branded Malibu and Cruise, a very, very efficient architecture that we believe will get two-plus lifecycles out of because of the design of that architecture. So we think we're well positioned. And although to your point, we are seeing smaller car segments and the impact of consumers choosing crossovers and trucks and SUVs, to a certain extent around the globe, we feel \u2013 and I'm not going to go into specifics of outlining the entire product portfolio, but we have taken a very much an over-the-horizon look of where we think that's going.","We have very efficient architectures that are installed. And so I think we can leverage that very effectively to be well-positioned as the market continues to transform. As we talk, we also have very strong SUVs and crossovers that we're rolling out first half of this year, continue to do that in the second half. So I think we're going to be well-positioned to capitalize on that growth and then well-positioned from a car perspective.","Finally, from an emerging market, those China, South America, Mexico, and some of the other more developing markets recall that we have made the investment in our global emerging markets platform that will have a range of vehicles coming off that \u2013 and this is a purposely designed architecture from a safety perspective, from an efficiency perspective, from a fuel economy perspective that we think will also be very well-positioned in those markets. So, again, we've looked at where we think the market is going and the trends are consistent with what we believe and the investments we've made in the plans that we have.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And I'm just looking at that capital allocation chart you put out for the recent conference, and propulsion is a chunk, it looks like $2-ish billion of that but stepping down post 2020. Is there any kind of way you could dimension how much that's going for ICE versus hybrids versus your pure electric efforts?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","We haven't broken that out, specifically, but what I would say is that I believe we are making the right investments from an electrification, and looking to really have platforms that go from eAssist to plug-in hybrids to full electric vehicles. And looking at that holistically across the portfolio. So that's the comment I would make but we're not breaking that out.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everybody.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Morning.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I had a couple questions. One is the fixed cost savings that you are achieving in North America looks like it's quite high. Is North America basically already benefiting from the lower spending on passenger car development? Because your comments on longer-lasting platforms and gens coming? And at this point, on a continuing basis, ex-Europe, going forward, can you just talk about maybe some of the key earnings drivers that you have looking out to next year? Could this run rate of fixed cost reduction be sustained? Do you see some other positives starting to kick in?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes, I would say, Rod, to your first question on the cost performance and the fixed cost performance in North America, there is very little engineering in there at this point in time. As you know, with the launch cadence of the crossovers here and then leading into the full-size pickup, the next-generation SUVs, we're probably at the peak from an engineering spend perspective and North America absorbs a pretty significant chunk of that. Where we're seeing the fixed cost opportunities are in manufacturing, SG&A, and you know, the non-engineering pieces of the business and consistent with our $5 billion run rate, and really being supported and driven with operational excellence at Global Business Services and a lot of focus from our manufacturing perspective.","When I think about North America next year, and I don't know if the drivers of your question are specific to fix costs or specific to kind of the continued run rate at 10%, clearly our product launch cadence is going to be supportive. We're going to continue to drive efficiency across the board wherever we can find it from a cost standpoint. I would expect to see engineering costs, over the next couple of years, start to wind down as we work our way through this very large portfolio launch cadence that we have in front of us here in 2017, 2018 and 2019. We still have opportunities in manufacturing for sure. When you look at benchmarking on where we stand versus harbor from a productivity perspective.","So, I think that we're going to continue to very much focus on driving efficiency across the board, not just fixed cost but commercial performance, quality, warranty, the whole nine yards because I think there's opportunities across all of those in North America. And we're seeing some of the benefit in the first half of this year across all of those dimensions.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So can you quantify what kind of targets you might be looking at in terms of net cost reduction or fixed cost reduction in North America looking forward beyond this year?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Not at this point. In July, I would say, again, we've delivered $5 billion of efficiency through the second quarter against our $6.5 billion target through 2018. That's overall level. Clearly, most of that accrues to North America. We expect to achieve that $6.5 billion. So that will kind of size up that run rate but to get into the specifics at a North American by component perspective, not at this point beyond. We're very much on track on that $6.5 billion and the vast majority of that will accrue to North America. And we had said before that roughly half of that would fall to the bottom line, right? Net of incremental investment, marketing, D&A, technology. So there will be a benefit to North America from that perspective.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then lastly, obviously there's a lot of focus in the industry on the auto 2.0 businesses that you guys have been investing in. Financially today, the biggest needle mover that you've quantified, I think, is Cruise. You guys had said that you're going to spend about $150 million a quarter on autonomous. OnStar today is contributing revenue. Can you just update us on where OnStar is? What's the run rate of that business? And any high-level thoughts on financial targets for these businesses or the value that you see in them?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Well, let me speak specifically to OnStar. And Mary will talk to Cruise slash autonomous vehicles. As we've talked about before, yes, OnStar is generating revenue. We don't disclose that separately. It continues to grow. What we have said was we expected to see improved profitability rolling through North America of roughly $0.5 billion by the 2018, 2019 timeframe associated with the growth of OnStar. I'd say we're still executing to that. Feels more like a 2019 timeframe and that was compared to 2015. So, we expect to see some accretion from a earnings perspective on OnStar. And that is, obviously, taking full advantage of 4G LTE, our revenue share with AT&T, and the services that we provide, application framework, et cetera, et cetera. But that's still what we're executing to.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","And from an auto 2.0, as you look at specifically autonomous vehicles, of course, built on which we think is the most efficient platform on the all-electric vehicles. So leveraging the Bolt EV platform, I think we are moving aggressively in the development of that technology. As I noted, that we built the next 130 vehicles that we are in the process of deploying onto roads in San Francisco, Scottsdale, and Metro Detroit, leveraging manufacturing at scale methods to be able to build those vehicles.","So when I look at where we're at, we're working aggressively at leveraging the assets General Motors brings to this, also learnings that we have from Maven. You know, we've talked about the true opportunity in this business which we think will first come in ridesharing. And we think that can be significant and then grow even further. We haven't sized that yet, but I would say we're working very aggressively on auto 2.0 to make sure we have substance and technology that we believe will generate significant shareholder value. And as we move forward, we'll be able to size that and put some milestones and timing around that. So I would say stay tuned.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Thanks, Rod.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Congrats on the quarter. Could you talk about the profit strength at GM Financial? It looks like 2Q was a record profit even as investors have been worrying about subprime defaults and lower used-car residual prices. So what has the trends been in charge-offs and provision? And how would you rate the sustainability of the better GMF results?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes, I would say, first, from a credit perspective, the overall headline numbers are improving and that's a function of mix as we take on more prime business. But I would say within that, GMF continues to perform very well. Subprime, we have been relatively flat-lined on our subprime business over the last number of years and haven't grown that. And we perform, actually, better than the market does from a subprime perspective. So overall, stable results from a credit perspective. Clearly, we grew revenue in the quarter as we continue to grow our prime business and that drove a fairly significant portion of the improvement. We continue to be very focused on operating expense and that was a benefit in the quarter as well.","As I said earlier in my comments, though, we do expect to see that run rate moderate in the second half of the year. Clearly, the used-car pricing and the impact on residuals was more, maybe not clearly, but I'll provide that perspective. Now is more backend loaded into the second half of the year. We're still guiding around a 7% reduction on a year-over-year basis in 2017 versus 2016 and further moderation in 2018, and we want to make sure we mark to that as we go through the year.","With that said, I would still expect to see overall performance improve on a year-over-year basis, solid improvement at GM Financial and another driver is we're growing our business in China as well and that's flowing through GMF from a equity income perspective. And that's going to provide a year-over-year tailwind as well.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's very helpful, thanks. And then just lastly from me, a question on consolidated IO. It looks like their losses there narrowed quite a bit. What was the driver of that? Were any of the operations in either India or South America maybe moved into discontinued operations, or is it pretty comparable year-over-year? And then what should we think about the cadence of the expected savings from the restructuring actions announced during the quarter?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes, I would say they're not in discontinued ops. It's comparable on a year-over-year basis. I think one of the benefits that we saw in the second quarter was the sale of our East Africa business and we picked up a reasonable gain on that $40 million, partially offset by some charges we took related to Uzbek. I'd say there was some timing, too, relative to the flows of production into the Middle East. Very little run rate savings associated with the restructuring actions. I would expect to see those play out in 2018.","We will continue to lean out the Singapore headquarters office as we move through the end of this year and complete those restructurings in India and South Africa as we move through this year. And as we indicated, we would expect to see about $100 million a year run rate improvement.","With that said, we still have plenty of work to do in our consolidated operations. The Middle East remains challenging and it is pretty volatile right now when you look at the industry conditions there. We have to continue to focus on cost efficiency in Korea. We're starting to stabilize our business in Australia. We expect to see some improved results in Southeast Asia, but we still have plenty of work to do in the remaining operations but we see a path to continue to improve that.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for all that color.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Good morning.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Good morning.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So just, Chuck, I'm hoping you can talk about just the cadence of earnings in Q3 and Q4 as you tacked up production actions. And also just specifically on free cash flow, I think the guidance does imply a significant improvement second half versus first half. Given the production cuts and the working capital swings, can you kind of help us, walk us through the puts and takes around that?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes. As we've been talking about earnings cadence since earlier this year and the expected downtime in the U.S., North America. And as I generally look at the consensus view of the second half of the year, I think we're in line from a overall cadence perspective, as I said back in January and talked about a couple of times in Office Hours, we would expect Q3 to be our weakest quarter of the year with 13-weeks of downtime in mid crossovers and full-size pickups, and then see a recovery in the fourth quarter.","I think that same trend will impact free cash flow. I think Q3 will be relatively weak from the free cash flow perspective. And then we'll see a pickup in Q4 with improved earnings, and as we wind back up our pipeline, obviously that will have a favorable impact on payables. So those are the broad strokes. Itay, again, mostly being impacted \u2013 when I look at second half versus first half, the biggest driver is volume. And the biggest driver of that volume is North America and the downtime that we've talked about consistently, and that's what's going to drive the cadence.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","That's very helpful. And just a second question. Going back to the $6.5 billion of costs savings. I think back in April, you alluded to seeing potential opportunities above that $6.5 billion post the Opel divestiture. Can you update us on that or able to size that up for us in terms of what that could be and the timing as well?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Itay, we definitely are working to improve that. I think first, we want to make sure we achieve the $6.5 billion and I think as Chuck said, we're well on track to do that. But the specific work that we're referencing is, as the Opel\/Vauxhall transaction closes, we're looking at, how do we take structure and simplify the way we work and out of the company? And that work is actively going on right now and we'll continue to work that through the end of the year. That I think provides additional opportunity.","And as Chuck said, achieving the $6.5 billion, but with the operational excellence toolset and mind-set that we're rolling out to the entire company about constantly improving the business, and we've had a very successful deployment where we have our top 1,600 people engaged in running projects. I think you're going to see a continual cost efficiency improvement mind-set as a company. But I'm not ready to take it up further from the $6.5 billion now, but I think as we move forward you'll see us continue to increase that number or set a new target once $6.5 billion is achieved","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","That's very helpful. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Just a couple of questions. First, so Tesla's been out with a car capable of OTA updates in firmware for about five years now. Now excluding Cruise, does GM currently sell any car capable of OTA updates of firmware? Mary?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","So on the updates. We have done over-the-air updates primarily to the OnStar system. We are in the process of deploying a new electrical architecture which is a pretty comprehensive undertaking, and that's well underway and being deployed as well as a whole new generation of infotainment systems. So you'll see us have that capability as we move forward. Right now it's pretty much limited to updates from an OnStar basis","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So any view on timing of when that new architecture could be out that could enable the, obvious, ability for your fleet to learn and revenue opportunities that are within? What side of 2020 could that be, do you think?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Before 2020.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Go ahead.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. So obviously, with the experience with OnStar and all the work you've been doing in mobility, you recognize that there's a huge opportunity to turn your car customers or your drivers into subscribers and to capture some revenue from the two or three billion miles a day that your fleet kind of conducts. But you don't get that. It's kind of a wasted opportunity right now. So, Mary, what's the plan for getting paid for the data opportunity? I'm curious. We hear from OEMs insurance, insurance, but like putting that aside. That's more obvious. Can you give us any example at all of a kind of revenue monetization you could do with the data?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Well, in our data monetization, I agree with you that the opportunity is there. I would say we are just in the initial steps of not only leveraging the data to provide more value to customers. You know, one of the assets that we have that will \u2013 is actually in touch right now so it will be leveraged shortly, is active health management of being able to assess different components in the vehicle and be able to alert customers ahead of time, schedule them for their vehicle to be fixed, unlock the door with OnStar. So really \u2013 and then fix the vehicle, lock it back up.","That capability that is near-term that we have and will be deploying. So I think there is this segment around the data to how do you use data that we get from the vehicle and because we have the largest connected fleet to improve the customer experience and therefore pull people to our vehicles. And then the second piece, as you indicated, is more of a B2B opportunity. And I don't have any specific examples that I'm going to share right now but I can tell you we're actively working both internally and externally. We just hired a Chief Data Officer into the company, started this month and so there's quite a bit of work going on. You'll hear more as we go forward but I think we're seeing monetization through OnStar with different activities.","And like you said, insurance is one but there's additional framework. We recently also launched OnStar Go with IBM and that creates a marketplace that's able to be customized for our specific passengers or consumers. So more to come on this, Adam, and I agree with you of the opportunity and we've got to seize it.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's great. We look forward to meeting the Chief Data Officer. And one final one to squeeze in. There's been some talk about the Chinese government considering changing rules to allow foreign OEMs a chance to buy out 50% stake of the JVs if they don't already own. Mary is this a trap? I mean, what's the catch here? One could argue that the skills transferability into like auto 2.0 for right now from your partners, could be challenged, particularly with the uncertainty around the rulemaking from the government. I'm just curious how you view that. Is that something, if there was an opportunity to acquire, is that something \u2013 how do you feel about that opportunity? Or is it not an opportunity? Thanks.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Well, as I look at potential changes in the rules, we have a very strong partner with SAIC, been very productive and are working together and I think it's been demonstrated in our market performance, we do joint development. A big portion of the global emerging-market platform that work is being done in China. So we've integrated the PATAC Center. So as I look at regulatory changes or rule changes from a China perspective, this isn't one on the top of my list because I think we work together well and I think there's benefits to that.","What I am looking for is to make sure that we have a level playing field and that we have rules that are aligned with the timing required to effectively implement from an automotive company perspective. When you look at some of the latest rulemaking around electrification, being implemented now and being rolled out now with implementation next winter, that's a pretty short timeline to effectively and efficiently meet those requirements. So that would be something I'd look for before I'd look for relaxing of the 50%.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you, Mary.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Thanks, Adam.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you for taking our questions. Maybe we just come back to North America for a second. We think about your production cadence. It sounds like a lot of the downtime is going to be taken in the third quarter, but with the market a little bit softer year-over-year, do you see a need to raise your incentive levels in order to move your passenger cars in order to hit that 50 days of inventory by the end of the year? Do you expect a rebound in retail sales or demand for pass car in the back half?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes, I would say that we're going to remain disciplined from an incentive perspective as we go through the second half of the year. The first lever that I would pull, and this is Chuck Stevens speaking. The North American team will probably have their own perspectives but the first lever I would pull would be the production lever to ensure that we align supply and demand. We do not want to damage the brand.","Clearly, there is a shift in passenger cars to crossovers but the compact segment is still a big segment here. And we still want to continue to improve the financial performance of those cars at whatever buy-in levels that we sell. And we want to reach kind of a natural demand so that we can get our manufacturing footprint, and logistics, and supplier footprints all aligned around that. So I would say we're going to pull the production lever. With that said, we will be competitive, but certainly wouldn't anticipate significant price moves or incentive moves from that perspective.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. So embedded in that you are expecting somewhat of a pickup in passenger car demand in the back half of this year since we've seen a passenger car recession if you will, beginning what, a couple years ago?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes. I would say broadly speaking what we expect to see is better sales in the second half versus the first half, which is kind of the way the industry runs. Within that perhaps marginally better passenger car, but we're certainly not counting on a recovery. Obviously, our launch cadence is pretty critical from our perspective with all the new crossovers that we're launching, and that's going to help in the second half of the year. But we're not \u2013 we will take production out to align supply and demand on passenger cars wherever that demand lands.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Understood. Thank you, Chuck.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And then just moving to your autonomous vehicles, I've got a couple of questions there. First, when you think about the breakdown of a fully autonomous vehicle, a lot of compute power needed, a lot of power draw. Where do you fall on the line of needing a pure battery-electric vehicle versus a plug-in hybrid approach?","Second, when you think about the current sensor suite, specifically to LIDAR, do you believe that hardware is necessary? Or do you think you can operate your vehicles autonomously without a LIDAR? And then I'll have a third one and a follow-up for Super Cruise.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Clearly the \u2013 we believe that most efficient way to execute autonomous vehicles is with the pure EV, that's why we are using our Bolt EV platform. And we think it allows for more efficient integration to the vehicle. We do believe in a sensor suite that LIDAR is a part of its solution to have the right sensing to provide the right safety level.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then the last one, thank you, Mary, is just on the miles needed for validation. I think the shareholder letter mentioned about 160,000 miles of validation for the Super Cruise currently. Is that enough? And how do you gauge that as being enough? And then if we extrapolate from there to fully-autonomous vehicle, what do you think is going to be necessary for validation in terms of miles for fully autonomous?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","So, first on Super Cruise, recall that we actually held that technology till we did appropriate validation, the 160,000 miles that we talk about, I'll say, would be final validation. That was substantially more work done from the Super Cruise development, testing and validation for the company to feel that it met our requirements from a safety perspective to launch into the public.","From an autonomous vehicle perspective, miles driven is certainly a factor, but it's not the only factor, because what is the quality of the miles driven? Right now, to our knowledge, we're the only one testing our autonomous vehicles in Downtown San Francisco, which is a pretty dense urban environment with a lot more, I'll say, opportunities to learn from different situations. So it's not just the miles traveled. It's the quality of those miles in the number of incidents that you're exposed to that the vehicle learns. And so although we don't have a very specific mile, there's quite a bit of work we're doing, even with agencies or groups outside of the company to put that together.","As we move forward, we'll share, because as we understand it today with the NHTSA requirements for U.S., a big portion of the guidelines they put out is to demonstrate how you're measuring, and then share that as they look at authorizing, pulling the driver out of the vehicle. So there's quite a bit of work going on there. So I would say it's much more involved than just miles traveled. And that's what we're working on right now, and we'll share more as we go forward.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Understood. Appreciate the time. Thank you.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. Just a first relatively I think simple question, as we look at sort of the bottom line guidance, it hasn't really changed much, but you've put Europe on a discount basis. So that should be about a $400 million benefit. Is basically the pressure that you're seeing, or the deterioration in North America market just generally the offset? Or is that a oversimplification? And are there other factors that are at work here?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes. I think you're drawing the conclusion that we have fundamentally reduced our guidance, or used the European dynamic to offset other impacts. If you start at the top, and say on a continuing ops basis, we haven't changed our guidance on EBIT or margins, that would lead you to we haven't changed. And in fact, we've probably improved our guidance on EPS. It's in the range of $6 to $6.50 and still in the range of $6 to $6.50, but you guys can do the math and the impact of excluding Europe is probably depending on whose model you pick, $0.12 to $0.15 a share. We're still in that range, so we didn't change the guidance, but certainly if again, starting at EBIT and EBIT margins, we expect to be greater than or equal to 2016 results on a continuing ops basis.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. That's very helpful. And then a second question. If we think about the pressures in North America and if they continue, Chuck, are there any other levers other than sort of the structural items that you've outlined so far, maybe going to external measures and looking at your partners on the dealer and supplier base that are, in some cases, making a lot more money? Is there an opportunity to spread the pain through the value chain and work with your partners?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Well, we work with our partners across the value chain on a day-to-day basis. I think we get into a slowdown thing. The first thing is to take full advantage of driving as much efficiency as you can in the things that you control. And what we control directly, to a large extent, is our own cost base and our own fixed cost. And that's where, as you know, we have significant leverage, much more so than we did back in 2008 and 2009. And as we've talked about before, we believe there's $3 billion to $4 billion of cost efficiency that we could drive as we entered a downturn, assuming it was a 25% downturn.","We work continuously with our suppliers. We've been strategically engaged with our suppliers over the last number of years. You look at the commercial and technical performance that we've been generating and as a big part of that $5 billion that we've generated to date, that's because of our relationship with the suppliers, much different than it used to be in the past. Work, bring their best ideas to the table, innovate. So I'm sure if we were in a challenging environment, we would work it with our suppliers. We worked with our dealers in 2008 and 2009. I'm sure we would continue to work with our dealers on a go-forward basis.","One example of that is when we had the challenges back in 2014. We never lost any share. The dealers repaired millions of vehicles while taking care of customers, while continuing to help us achieve our business objectives, and that's a strong partnership. The other thing I would say is in a downturn and we don't talk about it a lot, customer care and aftersales is countercyclical and that will help us to keep our earnings robust and outperform going through the downturn, as well. So again, a number of levers to pull, a number of partnerships we'd certainly want to leverage as we go into it, and we leverage those today.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. And then just lastly on the crossover launches. I mean, was curious what kind of an opportunity you think there is directionally and maybe even in numbers on the pricing on these crossovers in the near term. And then in the long term, that is a segment that a lot of folks are obviously chasing. It looks like the nameplates based on our estimates are going to go up 40% the next year. So that segment does get a little bit more crowded. Do you think in the near term pricing opportunity and then the long term, is there risk that the competition erodes maybe some of these excess economic profits in the segment?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes, we expect that there's a pricing opportunity in the near term and clearly in the second half of the year. When you look at second half of 2017 versus second half of 2016, we think price is going to be a tailwind for us from a crossover launch perspective. But I'd also agree with you in the medium term that there's likely to be margin compression in the crossover segment, especially the small and compact. Mid-crossover, I think there's a few less competitors, but in the small and compact segments. And again, that's why we're so focused on driving cost efficiency and taking advantage of our scale from that perspective because we anticipate price erosion as we move through the lifecycle of these vehicles and margin compression, at least from a pricing perspective.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Just one last quick housekeeping. The lease levels in the U.S. in the quarter, what was that and what do you see for the industry?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","In Q2, we were at 31%. The industry was about 30%. We're generally in line with where we were last year and in the first quarter, so we're running generally at industry levels. June, we came down to 29%, so on a downward trajectory. I think we're reasonably comfortable in the 25% to 30% range depending on the dynamics. So again, running at industry levels, been relatively consistent over the last number of quarters. Probably at the top end of where we want to be from a leasing perspective and we'll work to bring that down, especially as rates increase, then subvented financing has a tendency to pick up as well.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you very much.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Guggenheim.","Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Good morning.","Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities","Chuck, I wanted to come back to some of the early 2018 outlook factors for GMNA. And clearly the product launch cadence will be supportive and the engineering costs you expect them to keep coming down. How should we think about the volume piece of the equation for GMNA? Is the downtime for the continued changeover process, is it comparable to 2017 or could it be a longer downtime and we could see some volume pressure there?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes, I would say that early days, right? We're in July. We're certainly operating in an environment right now kind of month-to-month to see how the U.S. industry develops, but I would say all else being equal, we would expect to see more truck downtime next year versus this year. But by the same token, we will have incremental opportunities for compact and mid-crossovers next year because we've got significant downtime. But if I was providing an outlook right now, I would say probably production volume is going to be down in 2018 versus 2017 given the downtime. But I still, again, in July still would suggest that North America in a 17 million-ish SAAR environment is a 10%-plus EBIT margin company next year as well, absent some unexpected events.","Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities","That's extremely helpful. And then, Mary, you were mentioning on the autonomous side, the first opportunity will come in ridesharing. And over the past week, Lyft announced that it's starting its own autonomous driving research efforts. And what is the impact from that on your own autonomous strategy and then your partnership with Lyft?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","I don't think it affects it. The partnership that we have with Lyft was never exclusive for either Lyft or for General Motors. We're quite far along in our autonomous vehicle development based on the fact that shortly we'll have 180 vehicles testing. I don't know if you've had a chance to see the different videos that we posted of the capability of our autonomous vehicles to date that grows frankly on a weekly basis. So we still think the opportunity to deploy in a ridesharing. And the reason for that is as you first have electric vehicles as the capability will go up in those vehicles from the speed at which they can travel, the different circumstances, tunnels, et cetera, that the vehicle is capable of learning.","So integrating in a shared fleet \u2013 in a ridesharing fleet I think allows to get the best exposure for the vehicle to keep learning as we go forward, but I would say that's in the early stages of sub-deployment. So again, we have a good relationship with Lyft and we think that opportunity presents itself, but that's how we see it playing out right now, and again, understand their work that they're doing on their own as well.","Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities","Understood. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our final question for today will come from the line of Colin Langan with UBS.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Oh, great. Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up on Emmanuel's first question. I adjust forecasting and pretty significant double-digit decline and pick up next year. I mean from your tone, do you think that \u2013 any comment on that? Is that too bearish given what you're looking at now?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Help me with a little bit of context on that. I just was looking at a double-digit decline in production for full size pickups next year for General Motors.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Yes. Yes. Sorry. Yes.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes. Again, it's early days as we think about next year and I would say built in kind of the baseline plan at this point in time when we think about the incremental downtime next year, could we be off 10% production next year versus this year? Yes, that's a possibility, but I think it's just too early at this point in time because we always are looking at trying to optimize the timing and the amount of downtime that we have related to launch cadence. So surely we will provide more visibility around that as we close out the year and early next year.","Again, I would just return to my earlier comment and similar to the comment I made for 2017, the North American business model is proving to be very resilient to some of the challenges that we're facing. We believe this year we will generate 10%-plus EBIT margins based on our first look at 2018 under a reasonably constructive macro environment. We believe that we'll continue to generate 10%-plus EBIT margins. There will be puts and takes. More visibility around that as we move through this year and get a better sense of where the market is heading.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","And when we look at your target of getting inventory to around 70 days by year-end, is that all driven by the, I think you mentioned, 150,000 first half versus second half reduction in production or is there some assumption that market share, actually, picked up by the end of the year?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Well, I think it's a bit of both. Largely, the production, because just to give you the data points, last year we ended at 980,000 units of inventory. We want to be in the 800,000 to 825,000 at the end of this year. That would equate, based on our view of the industry, to somewhere in the ZIP Code of 70-day supply. So a significant portion, the majority is going to be production cuts but we also grow share generally in the second half the year because trucks, generally, you sell 60% of those in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. So obviously, we expect to see \u2013 and by the way, with our launch cadence as well, we expect to see some sales performance but the vast majority of the reduction in inventory will be related to production cuts.","Operator","Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing comments.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","I want to thank everybody for joining us today. We believe the strong results we reported today reflect on our ongoing work to transform GM into a more focused and disciplined company. This team has demonstrated quarter after quarter that it has the right mindset to capitalize on opportunities, make the hard decisions, overcome headwinds, and meet our commitments all with integrity.","We're going to continue to take bold and decisive actions to execute our strategic plan and that's in the core business or Auto 1.0 where we're working to make sure we have the right product portfolio as we move forward, as well as the very, very efficient business on all aspects. And then from a future of personal ability, or Auto 2.0, we are taking very deliberate steps and working, I'd say, quite aggressively to make sure that we leverage all the assets we bring to this equation. We believe we can translate that into significant shareholder value and that's what we're focused on doing. So again, thanks for participating.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

Welcome to the General Motors Company Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, Wednesday, October 21, 2015. I would now like to turn the conference over to Randy Arickx, Executive Director of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Randy C. Arickx - General Motors Co.","Thanks, Operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us as we review GM's financial results for the third quarter of 2015. Our press release was issued this morning and the conference call materials are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast on the Internet. Included in the chart set materials published this morning, we have included the key takeaways from each chart in the notes pages in order to provide color on the results.","This morning, Mary Barra, General Motors' Chief Executive Officer, will provide some brief opening remarks; followed by Chuck Stevens, GM's Executive VP and CFO. And then we will open the call for questions from the analyst community.","Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the legend regarding forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The contents of our call will be governed by this language. In the room today, we also have Tom Timko, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer, to assist in answering any questions.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Mary Barra.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Thanks, Randy, and welcome everyone. I'm glad you could join the call today, and I'm very pleased to share with you that we continue to drive strong performance and shareholder value in Q3.","Let me give you some of the financial highlights. First, our revenue was $38.8 billion. Our EBIT adjusted of $3.1 billion was up $800 million year-over-year. Our EBIT-adjusted margin of 8% was up 2.2 percentage points from a year ago.","Earnings per share adjusted of $1.50 was up 55% from last year. Adjusted automotive free cash flow of $0.8 billion reflects seasonality and the settlement of several uncertainties, and our 26% return on invested capital based on a trailing fourth-quarter average demonstrates that our disciplined capital allocation is paying off. Our strong year-over-year performance in the quarter was led by North America. It had $3.3 billion in EBIT adjusted with an 11.8% EBIT-adjusted margin. These are both records for North America.","Regarding China, you'll recall that last quarter, Chuck and I discussed with you the slowing growth in the China market, but we shared our plans for sustaining our margin in the second half based on our strong product mix and the ongoing work to drive cross-efficiencies.","So, in the quarter, we maintained strong performance. Our equity income was $0.5 billion, and we achieved a 9.8% net income margin, which is up from a year ago. Overall, strong performance in cash generation enabled us to return $4.6 billion to our owners as of October 19 through both share buybacks and dividends.","In addition to the strong performance in the quarter, I want to provide a couple updates on the progress we're making on our strategic priority. As we indicated in our Global Business Conference, we intend to lead and win in the future of personal mobility and create new revenue streams that will drive shareholder value.","We are leveraging our connectivity leadership to enhance our relationship with the customer both inside and outside of the vehicle. One of the announcements we made was the Let's Drive New York City. This is a car-sharing program that uses our GM platform and app to connect Ritz Plaza tenants to GM vehicles and to Icon Parking. And we've gotten a good response.","We've also announced that we plan to launch a city-wide car-sharing service in the U.S. in the first quarter of next year. Now, both of these are built on the work that we've done in the past and the success of the Opel CarUnity car-sharing app, as well as the learnings from our Google car-sharing pilot.","In addition, let me talk about autonomous for a minute. We announced that we will implement a fleet of autonomous 2015 Chevrolet Volts at the Warren Tech Center next year. Not only will this accelerate our autonomous technical learnings, but it will also have us learn from an ecosystem perspective. And this builds on top of our previous autonomous announcements with the launching of Super Cruise and V2V that will both be on Cadillacs next year 2017 models.","And we are strengthening our relationship with the customer inside the vehicle as well. OnStar is now on four continents; North America, Europe, South America and China. We have more customers connected to their vehicles than the rest of the industry combined. By yearend, brands on three continents will have 4G LTE technology \u2013 Cadillac in China; Chevrolet, Buick, Cadillac and GMC in North America; and Opel and Vauxhall in Europe.","Let's turn to a minute for the markets. First, in North America. Clearly, trucks, crossovers and SUVs drove strong sales gains. U.S. retail market share in Q3 was up nearly 1 percentage point from a year ago, 16.5% compared to 15.6% in 2014. GM's share of the entire retail full-size pickup segment is approximately 40%, up 2 percentage points from a year ago.","And in the mid-size pickup segment, our new Chevrolet Colorado and the GMC Canyon pickups are already earning 40% of the retail share. And we have more coming from our three-truck strategy with the redesigned 2016 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra. Not only will we have greater availability of the 8-speed transmission, we'll also have new safety features, including Lane Keep Assist and forward collision alert as well as enabling Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.","Moving to Europe. We're very excited about the all-new Opel Astra. And when we launched it, we had 30,000 pre-sell orders. The Astra has segment-leading active safety technologies and connectivity with OnStar and 4G LTE and also Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are also enabled.","In China, we had record sales of 2.5 million vehicles through Q3 driven by the strength of SUVs, MPVs and Cadillac. GM's year-over-year SUV sales were up 171% in September, led by the Buick Envision and the Baojun 560. And Cadillac is up 12.4% year-to-date.","At GM financial progress towards full captive capability is accelerating. Our North America retail penetration of 32% is up 21 percentage points versus a year ago. And looking ahead, we also announced in the quarter that we plan to invest $5 billion through 2019 to enhance the Chevrolet brand in key markets of China, Brazil, Mexico and India.","And this really represents a new way of addressing these markets. It represents about a 2-million-vehicle opportunity annually. And what we're doing is replacing multiple legacy products with an all-new vehicle family that will have leading design and the right technology and the right value for those customers. We're leveraging our scale across the value chain to develop this new vehicle family that will require less capital, generate more volume, and drive more profitability.","And as we look at cost efficiencies, we continue working across the entire value chain to make sure that we are as efficient as possible so we can enhance the customer experience and also drive shareholder value.","As we talked about in the Global Business Conference, we have identified $5.5 billion of savings from the 2015 to 2018 timeframe. And that's from purchasing initiatives, manufacturing, driving for efficiencies and reducing administration expenses.","These savings more than offset the additional brand and technology investments that we're making. And we also continue to work on the right partnerships. We announced the Navistar partnership that will allow us to provide a Chevrolet medium-duty truck in the U.S. in 2018. And not only is this a segment we're not in right now, but on the commercial side, it also will help us drive adjacent sales.","We also continue to have a very productive partnership with Honda, focused on fuel cells. We're developing not only the next-generation hydrogen stack and storage system, but we're looking for other opportunities and the fuel cell work should be in the 2020 timeframe is what we are targeting.","As I \u2013 as strong as the third quarter performance was though, we do understand and we are working to mitigate the headwinds that are in several areas around the globe. South America continues to be very challenging. The Brazil market is down 27% in the third quarter versus a year ago, and there's really no clear economic recovery in sight.","As we talk about China, it is quickly maturing and we now expect average annual industry growth to be about 3% to 5% for the next few years. And the China slowdown is not only affecting our business in China but also in the other international operation markets outside of China because these economies are so dependent on China. This means growth will remain slow.","But as I've said, as we look at the global auto industry, there will always be headwinds across the globe and we are committing to achieving our targets. As we said in January, for this calendar year, we fully expect EBIT adjusted and EBIT-adjusted margins to be higher. And we continue to be confident on our trajectory towards the 2016 goals that we've outlined.","Quickly, they are in North America, and, again, we're expecting to achieve the 10% margin this year ahead of schedule and plan to continue and sustain that performance into 2016. In Europe, we expect to be profitable in 2016, and we will earn that by capitalizing on the success of the Astra and Corsa launches that have higher variable profit.","And despite the slower growth, there is still significant growth potential for China. Much of the growth will be in the tier 2 to 4 cities and that currently represents 85% of GM's volume. We will continue to focus on sustaining strong margins between 9% and 10% through the sales growth that is afforded by MPVs, SUVs, and Cadillac.","And we also have other drivers that we've outlined of continuing to drive cost efficiencies, increasing our after sales, growing captive finance, and generating OnStar and connectivity revenue. We're also taking practice steps to manage the volatility in South Africa until there is a recovery.","Our progress, or our work there started in 2011 to really drive efficiencies and we continue with several additional rounds, and we'll be doing that as we move forward. So, despite challenges in some markets, we are capitalizing on the strength for a \u2013 we capitalize on the strengths for a record-setting third quarter, and I'm very proud of the team. This performance increases our confidence and our plan to drive shareholder value.","With that, I'll now turn it over to Chuck.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Thanks, Mary. I just wanted to take a few minutes to provide some perspective on the quarter and GM's results for the first nine months of the year. In addition to the record results that we posted in Q3, we've also put up some very strong results year-to-date. EBIT-adjusted results through September grew to $8 billion, up $1.3 billion year-over-year when you adjust 2014 for the impact of recalls. EBIT adjusted margins were at 7.1%, up 130 basis points again year-over-year after adjusting for the impact of recalls. Important to note that these results are very much on plan that we laid out earlier this year.","Our adjusted earnings per share for the year-to-date period nearly doubled to $3.63 compared with last year. And as you step back and look at the results, they were broad-based on a year-over-year basis with all but one of our automotive regions posting year-over-year profit improvement during the first nine months of the year. So clearly, we're on track for a very strong 2015 as we committed to deliver earlier this year.","And now that we are very pleased with our performance year-to-date, we will continue to take additional actions to drive efficiencies into the business. As I covered at the Global Business Conference and Mary just mentioned, we expect to drive $5.5 billion of run rate efficiency improvements by 2018 across the entire business. And these efficiencies will more than offset economics, increased investments in brand building, increased depreciation and amortization and technology costs during that timeframe.","And all of these costs and cost efficiencies are underpinned by operational excellence, which is our corporate initiative to drive common tools, common processes but really most importantly, a continuous improvement mentality throughout our organization and we are getting significant traction on that even in 2015. So the GM team is very focused on finishing the year strong and really carrying that positive momentum forward into 2016 and beyond.","Just a few comments on a couple of our regions. First, China. As Mary mentioned, the company sustained strong operating results in Q3, which is consistent with the guidance that we provided you back in July. Although it's clear the industry has moderated, I think it's also clear that the region has not fallen off a cliff, as some observers predicted. In fact, as we talked about after our Q2 earnings, industry sales began to improve sequentially as the third quarter progressed. And we continue to see improved performance thus far in October. And despite the moderating industry, we generated strong performance for the first nine months of the year, $1.5 billion in equity income and 10% net margins.","And as we've talked about on a number of occasions, we've been able to generate these results specifically because the team in China has been proactively managing the market risks with several actions such as optimizing mix, and you saw the results with the September sales being up significantly from an SUV perspective, aggressively reducing costs by rolling out cost-down-efficiency-up initiatives and really working to manage our inventory levels and ensure that we're aligning supply and demand.","And we are encouraged by China's cut in the purchase tax. And we are encouraged that it will provide a tailwind to the industry for the rest of the year and into 2016, but our plan is to continue to proactively manage the market risks as we've been doing to protect the profitability of the business.","So our previous guidance growth in the low-single digit range, and our ability to sustain our strong margin performance has not changed. Our guidance for Q3 is consistent with the guidance that we provided after our Q2 earnings.","Moving closer to home. Clearly, North America has put up some impressive numbers for the quarter. Again, record EBIT-adjusted and EBIT-adjusted margins of $3.3 billion and 11.8%. Importantly, year-to-date, we've achieved EBIT-adjusted of $8.3 billion and a corresponding margin of 10.5%. And despite typical seasonality in Q4, increased launch costs and other seasonal impacts like lower production due to the holidays, we are very much on track to achieve a 10% margin in the region in 2015. And importantly, that's an accomplishment that we're going to deliver ahead of our longstanding 2016 commitment.","We're in the process of finalizing our 2016 planning assumptions and will provide you with additional color in January on what to expect for 2016. But as Mary said, we certainly plan to deliver 10% margins again in 2016.","With regard to our outlook for the remainder of this year, as I said, we're very much on plan for improved full-year profit and margin growth versus 2014. This will translate into EBIT-adjusted from a total company basis north of $10 billion for the year. South America remains challenging, and there really is no near-term macroeconomic recovery in sight. But we will continue to take actions to help mitigate the negative headwinds that are impacting the industry and our results in that region. And I would just emphasize that our view is that we are highly leveraged to the recovery when it comes in South America because of the actions we've taken over the last number of years.","With specific regard to capital spending and free cash flow, I'd like to provide an update. First, on the capital spending front. Due to the timing of cash payments versus the accrual of our obligations, our revised cash CapEx forecast for the year is now $8 billion compared to our previous guidance of $9 billion. We continue to expect that our capital spending accruals will be in the range of $9 billion this year, so this is just a timing issue.","Although we're still finalizing next year's planning assumptions, I would not expect this change and timing to materially impact our prior guidance that cash capital expenditures would be approximately 5% to 5.5% of revenue on an ongoing basis. As I said earlier, we will provide more specific guidance in January, but from a general planning perspective, the 5% to 5.5% still applies.","And although we're expecting a lower amount of capital spending this year from a cash perspective, our free cash flow forecast is still expected to be about flat compared with 2014. The cash outlays associated with our recent legal settlements will offset the lower capital spending amount, enabling us to maintain that outlook that we provided after the second quarter earnings.","We also remain very committed to enhancing shareholder value over time as evidenced by the $4.6 billion of capital return to our owners thus far this year. And we will continue to execute to our transparent capital allocation framework.","So, that concludes our opening comments. We'll now move to the question-and-answer portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will pause for a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Good morning, and congrats, everybody.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Thank you.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Thanks, Itay.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Chuck, I was hoping you can just maybe kind of quantify the rental impact this quarter in North America on variable profits?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","I would say that the impact of rental in wholesales, if you look at the wholesales on a quarter-over-quarter basis, up about $100,000. About two-thirds of that was related to rental auctions. And then I'm not going to give you specific input on the variable profit itself, but from a pricing perspective, the Q3 pricing, roughly $100 million of that was associated with the rental auction issue as we cycle through that.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. And then I know it's a little early to talk about 2016, but I'll give it a shot, and congrats, of course, on reaching or expecting to reach a 10% target this year. As we think about some of the product cycle tailwinds next year on new product mix, is it fair to say that margin expansion next year is a fair early assessment for the year versus 2015?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Itay, I am absolutely surprised that somebody would ask that question about 2016. We will provide specific guidance on that in January. Our objective, our commitment and what Alan talked about on October 1 at the Global Business Conference is to drive this business to sustain 10% margins through the cycle.","So, as we evaluate how the industry is shaping up and everything else for next year, we'll come back and talk about that in January. We've reached the first milestone. We expect to generate 10% for this year. And then clearly our objective is to make sure we build this business to sustain that again throughout the cycle.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Just one last quick housekeeping, of the $5.5 billion of efficiencies through 2018, Chuck, just remind us how much is left of the 2016-to-2018 period? I know you're realizing some of that this year.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. I'll provide a further input on that in January as well. But if you look just one of the components of that, this year we've talked about non-raw-material performance of $2 billion. We're very, very much on track to deliver that. So, broadly speaking it would be $5.5 billion less that \u2013 I mean, generally, so about $3.5 billion left to go.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Terrific. Thank you very much and congrats again everyone.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everybody. Congratulations.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Hey, Rod.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I had a couple questions. I was hoping first you might be able to give us a little bit more color on the China earnings bridge. Obviously, you had a 4% decline in wholesales. And I'm assuming that you experienced this that you were talking about a 5% decline in price on your Q2 call. So, if we were to construct a bridge year-over-year from 3Q to 3Q, what would the dollar impact be if we thought about some of the buckets that you usually provide like volume, price mix and cost?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. I'll give you the breakdown from a driver-perspective base, Rod, but not the specifics on the EBIT bridge. Clearly, the volume would be down and price would be down largely offset by mix and improved cost performance, I mean, fundamentally the cost performance is largely in material cost performance.","And we've talked before around kind of the pricing headwind year-over-year on a quarter-over-quarter basis, and it's been running generally about $100 million. I mean, that's what that equates to \u2013 from that bridge perspective. So, volume down, price down, largely offset by improved mix \u2013 and, again, you've seen that in the sales results with SUVs and Cadillac sales being up \u2013 and material cost efficiency.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","You're targeting flat IO for the year, which implies a little bit of a drop in the fourth quarter. Should we be thinking that China starts to look a little a bit better from a volume perspective given the stimulus? And that it's the consolidated IO that's coming off? Could you just give us a little bit more of a feel for what you're expecting there?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. As we talked about in the second quarter and we're maintaining here, we expected to sustain China performance in the second half of the year, similar to the first half of the year. So, we earned about $1 billion of equity income in China in the first half; we would expect to earn in that range in the second. So, we're $1.5 billion in so far, so you can do the subtraction.","What we said about GMIO in total including China is relatively comparable results year-over-year. And again, I would suggest that we're very, very much on plan from a China perspective. GMIO, if you look at last year, the results there \u2013 or even year-to-date, the results that we've generated there, a loss in the range of $500 million to $600 million is what would \u2013 for the year, what would generally be consistent on a comparable basis.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And just lastly, two quick ones. When we \u2013 if we were to add up all of these actions that you're taking in South America, could you give us a total of what you're anticipating as the cost savings? And on North America, you mentioned you're expecting pricing flat to down. Is that a change versus what you had been anticipating previously?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","For the latter question, if you go back to the discussion we had back in January, I remember a chart that I showed. It showed carryover pricing in 2015 versus 2014 from a North America perspective was going to be down. I would say what we're seeing in North America is the general pricing dynamic on a year-over-year basis is consistent with our prior guidance.","Retail pricing is going to be relatively flat, and most of the year-over-year deterioration is due to this, the rental car issue that we were dealing with. So, as I think about a go-forward basis or just the fundamental market dynamics, I think stronger retail performance, but generally, overall pricing in line with what we talked about before.","Relative to the South America question, where do you want me to go back to, 2011 or 2012 or just this year on a run rate basis?","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Well, we see what the profitability is there, right? So what \u2013 how do things improve from the run rate that you're at right now, if we were to add all these actions together?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","So, yeah. Assuming consistent macro conditions in 2016 versus 2015 and we're not really assuming anything different. I'm not trying to give guidance for 2016 yet, but we took out 20% of the workforce down there, both hourly and salary, that's 4,000 to 5,000 people. That action in and of itself, on a run-rate basis, is worth a couple of $100 million a year.","But there's other puts and takes, Rod, that I don't think you can just directly translate that into a guidance for 2016. Economics is pretty significant. We have productivity. We have other actions that we'll take to improve mix. Relative to specifics for 2016, we'll have more to say in January.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Galves with Credit Suisse.","Daniel V. Galves - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thanks. Yeah, first question and back to the kind of the pricing in China, have you seen any sort of improvement in pricing as inventories appear to come down for the industry throughout Q3?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","I would say that the pricing dynamic is developing as we anticipated at least through Q3. Obviously, we'll continue to monitor that as we go through Q4. As we talked about before, we expected Q4 to be better from an industry performance driven by seasonality and product launches. The product launches could change the dynamic from a pricing perspective. But I'd say, generally consistent and too early to tell if that's changing as dealer inventories are getting kind of more in line at the industry level.","Daniel V. Galves - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Got it. And then I had a couple of questions related to the issues that Volkswagen is having in Europe. Number one is have you seen any industry-wide impact to demand overall or to demand for diesel vehicles yet, or is this still too early to tell? And also, I mean, not asking to comment, but the \u2013 some of the numbers being thrown around for impact of Volkswagen are very high. Does that change your \u2013 GM's thinking at all in terms of the minimum cash required to protect against any kind of catastrophes?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Let me start by saying right now, our outlook for diesel remains unchanged. I think it's too early to look and make any judgments on that. Related to \u2013 again, we're not going to comment on the VW. But I think as we've gone through and looked at the very robust planning that we did last year as we put together the capital allocation framework, we remain committed to the $20 billion.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","And let's not forget, Dan, that we also have a revolver. And the revolver is an emergency backstop. And total liquidity is at $32 billion and I don't think that you can really plan your cash balance around a potential \u2013 I'm just using this in a general term, I'm not speaking specifically to Volkswagen. But a company type event. So, just not a good use of shareholder capital.","Daniel V. Galves - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, makes sense. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, guys.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Good morning.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a first question on North America. I mean, obviously there's a lot of strength here. And it seems like mix in price were actually a little bit of a negative. So just curious, how we should think about the contribution of new products are playing the profitability in North America. I know you kind of talked about the $1,500 per copy on the new products, but obviously, a lot of people are very skeptical about that, but it seems to be coming through. Just kind of understanding what role those new products are playing and what we should expect really in the fourth quarter and maybe even going into 2016.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Well, first, mix is unfavorable largely because of the rental auction vehicles, right? I mean, buying was favorable, $400 million roughly; mix, unfavorable, largely offsetting that due primarily to the impact of those vehicles. We are committed on the next-generation vehicles as we roll through the launch cadence being more profitable than the vehicles that they replace.","I just think about it, broadly speaking, if you look at the Cruise, the Malibu, the next-generation compact SUVs, the Equinox, Train and then the next-generation mid-crossovers, in total, that volume is more than the entire K2XX platform. And we delivered with the K2XX platform an improvement in profitability, as we talked about way back in 2012, of over $1,000 a vehicle. And that's generally the perspective that we're going to see and what we've talked about relative to the next product launches. So that's going to help us.","Specific to your Q4 question on pricing, I think \u2013 and this is typically what happens in Q4 sequentially as you launch the new model, years and everything else. I think it will be a slight favorable overall pricing environment. Retail will be up and partially offset by fleet. And that would just be the typical fleet cadence as we roll through the rental auctions.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","And a large part of that retail price favorability in Q4 will be associated with the launch of the new Malibu.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And just as we think forward, I'm not asking for 2016 guidance, but I mean, you're talking about 10% margins for North America, you did 10.5% year-to-date as we look at the LTM, you're kind of in that range or maybe even a little bit better on adjusted basis. I mean, is there some sort of negative factor that you're looking at into 2016 that's going to suppress numbers or something that's not going to repeat in 2016, or is this really just an initial guide and we should revisit this in January?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. Well, first, we're 10.5% calendar year-to-date, and if you go back and look at Q4 from a seasonal perspective, that's typically one of the weak quarters from a margin perspective due to everything that we understand, Thanksgiving holiday, Christmas holiday, a lot of marketing spend around football. And in our case this year, some launch products. So, I would say for 2015, we are very confident that we're going to generate 10% margins.","As we talked about before, we are going to continue to invest in marketing to build our brands. We're going to continue to spend engineering associated with our product launch cadence and next-generation products so that we can sustain 10% margins throughout the cycle, and we'll have a more specific guidance around that. But the real way to think about this, John, is we're at 10% in 2015, a year early. We're going to run the business to sustain that 10% kind of margin on an ongoing basis.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Makes a lot of sense. Then on, just on GM Financial, revenue was up 36%, EBIT up 13%. I know that's a potential area for structural improvement in EBIT over the next couple of years. When do we see sort of a linear or sort of parallel step-up in EBIT along with just a growth in revenue and loan book there? Just curious like, I mean, it just seems like at some point we're going to see a real step-up. Is that 2016, 2017, or 2018?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. I think it will be beyond 2016 as we continue to ramp up both the operations, but also you're taking on debt in advance of the assets. I think the real lever point will be beyond 2016, John.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Just lastly on buybacks, you've clearly gotten a lot of stuff out of the way here on the DoJ fine, a lot of the ignition switch settlements pretty much wrapped up. You're looking at a pretty strong 2016. I mean, when do you think you could reconsider more buybacks? I mean, is that late this year or is that sometimes in 2016 when you get better visibility on year-end balance sheet and liquidity and 2016 results?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","So, we did extinguish some risks. We still have a handful of open items that we'll work to resolve as timely as we can but done in the right way. And we'll be ready to talk about that in January of next year, of where we're at from a capital allocation perspective.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Mary, what are those specific hurdles or items that still need to get resolved?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","There's still a couple of investigations with the Federal Trade Commission and the SEC. Then there's also parts of the multidistrict litigation. There's still some state attorney claims and there's also the economic loss.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you very much.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Thanks, John.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with CLSA.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Good morning.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Hi.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","First question on the pricing in North America. So, the retail pricing was somewhat negative. Can you maybe give a little bit of color on where specifically on retail you saw sort of like this pricing pressure, in either segments or vehicles? And how does that reflect or not some of the U.S. market dynamics right now?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Well, let me just start at 10,000 feet Emmanuel, 11.8% margins, so that's what we generated in the third quarter. So just very, very strong outstanding performance. Within that, there was carryover price headwinds which is typical in the third quarter as you work through and sell down your prior model year products. And when you think about as where we are in the launch cadence, it's no surprise that some of our vehicles are getting longer in the tooth. And we continue to support those products. But I think you need to look at it in the context of 11.8% margins. We already talked about Q4. And we talked about the calendar year from a pricing perspective.","Overall, the dynamics in the industry remain reasonably rational. Overall incentive spending and incentive spending as a percent of transaction price is up slightly on a year-over-year basis. Our incentive spend as a percentage of, compared to the industry average ran at 110%, which is consistent with last year. So, we feel reasonably good about the competitive dynamics. But we're really feeling pretty constructive on our launch cadence and the products that we'll be bringing into the market next year, which will come with favorable pricing.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. That's good to hear. And then just on GMIO ex-China, maybe I'm just nitpicking here, but seemed like a slight deterioration in the last maybe versus the past few quarters. When can we expect, I guess, this region to turn to breakeven ex-China, ex other unusual items?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. We will talk more about that in January as we go through the planning. I would say that the viewpoint should be that we continue to aggressively look at all of our operations, all of our countries where we're currently not generating a return to drive efficiency, to drive structural change, to position the business for future success. We were making good progress in GMIO.","The current macro situation there with the slowdown in China that Mary talked about is having an impact, but we will continue to take those actions and we'll provide an update on that on a go-forward basis. Again thinking about the broad context from a company perspective, $3.1 billion in EBIT and 8% margins, and I think the real opportunity is once we get the rest of the regions operating very well, that will even be more accretive to what was a very strong, actually a record quarter.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","I agree. Thank you very much.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Stover with SIG.","Matthew Stover - Susquehanna International Group, LLP","Thank you very much. I was just wondering if we could go back into the North America accounting issue with the rental car fleet. If I heard you correctly, Chuck, you'd indicated that most of the excess of wholesale versus production was related to the rental car volumes, is that correct?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","That's correct.","Matthew Stover - Susquehanna International Group, LLP","And then, you'd mentioned the pricing was $100 million. Is there a bigger impact on the profit side, because if I look at the incremental operating leverage in North America, at 50% it seemed awfully strong. I know there's a lot of good things going on, but that just seemed like a really strong incremental operating leverage.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Well, one of the things that we talked about and if you look at the share performance year-to-date is our real focus on shifting our volumes out of fleet and into retail because retail is more profitable than fleet. And part of that as you're seeing with this higher rental vehicles going through auction as we sell less than obviously we're going to be sending more into the auction. Generally, at 10,000 feet \u2013 fleet \u2013 the fleet business is profitable especially commercial and government. Daily rental, pretty close to breakeven, when you look throughout the whole value chain impact on that. But clearly our objective is to drive more in the retail which is more profitable.","Matthew Stover - Susquehanna International Group, LLP","Okay. The second question is, is if we look at the IO results ex-China, you've announced restructuring actions in Australia, Indonesia and Thailand. When should we expect to see the impact of those actions in the financial results based on the execution of the restructurings?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. More to come on that, again, in January. We're still working through the Australia actions, and those won't be completed until 2017. We're still working through the Thailand actions and hoping they leave the shift of moving to fundamentally a truck SUV platform there will happen through 2017. So, these are ongoing.","I would suggest that in a more historical macro environment versus some of the headwinds we're facing there this year, slowing growth in Southeast Asia, a very weak Aussie dollar, some of the other challenges related to China, we would be seeing year-over-year improvement already.","Matthew Stover - Susquehanna International Group, LLP","Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Three questions around commodities around Europe and then kind of a broader one around self-driving cars. First, commodities. You mentioned the material benefit in GMNA as well as globally. To what extent was that driven by the whole commodity complex being lower versus supplier, value engineering efforts and if it's mostly from the latter, working the suppliers, as some of your commodity contracts renew, can we expect a tailwind from commodities going forward?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. The overall impacts in the quarter from commodity pricing was minimal. It was largely driven by commercial performance and logistics performance. And on a go-forward basis, just to provide a sensitivity on commodity, when we look at the year, I would say year-to-date, the year-over-year impact is a couple of hundred million bucks. And we would expect that to be kind of the calendar year impact.","Overall, our APV or our annual purchase value of commodities is about $28 billion. About 30% of that or so is indexed, which means we take the risk. 5% movement in commodities is worth $400 million to $500 million on an annual basis, all other things being equal. And as we look at 2016 versus 2015, if current commodity prices continue, I would think it would be a tailwind. But, again, that will continue to work through our planning for 2016 and provide more guidance on that in January.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Second question, around Europe, two questions. Are you seeing any \u2013 you saw pricing firming in 3Q. What impact do you see on pricing from Volkswagen's issues? Is it on the one hand, they could potentially become desperate and pull the price down or on the other hand, can you get paid for some of the value you can add to drivers?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","The pricing strength in Q3 specific to General Motors and Opel Vauxhall was the launch of new products and new product pricing. So, our new products are getting traction and that's good. And we would expect to see that continue as we work through the launch cadence. It is really too early to tell and too early to speculate on what could happen with the competitive dynamics in Europe. Our focus is to launch our products, deliver great products that have compelling value, continue to drive improvements in the Opel brand which, in general, under any circumstance, will provide pricing power vis-\u00e0-vis where we're at today. The overall environment could change, but at least on a relative basis, by executing our plan, we should have better pricing power than we have today.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And if the consumer comes into the showroom, and on the margin goes more for gas engines than diesel engines, do you have the gas engine plant capacity to satisfy their demand?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes. From an industry perspective, in Europe we're underweight diesels versus the competition. Our diesels run at about 40%, and the rest of the industry is somewhere between 50% and 70%. They certainly have the flexibility.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. And final question kind of around self-driving cars. We had a new entrant automaker rollout, what they're calling autopilot, last week. Can you remind us of the timing of the Cadillac Super Cruise? And then just more broadly, how do you think about how fast to get these things to market versus making sure that they run effectively and you're not in a sort of \u2013 folks in Silicon Valley would say, throw stuff out there, and let the users beta test it. Just kind of your philosophy on that technologically.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Well, I think, for some, with the tremendous experience that General Motors has as we look at safety and we look at integrating and \u2013 one of the reasons we announced that we, by the end of next year, will have 2017 Chevrolet Volt on autonomous fleet at our tech center is to not only advance the technology, but also to understand it in the ecosystem, also have tremendous exposure to our engineering team at that site. And all of those things I think will point to advance the work we're doing, accelerate it from a technical and from all of the other aspects that you need to have come together from an autonomous perspective.","And the way I look at autonomous in general is that there's two paths, and we're working on both. I mean there's the path that we're on where if you look at especially a Cadillac today, there's tremendous technology around it that is on the road to full autonomous with all the safety features and all the warning and the ability to have forward collision braking, et cetera. When you look at Super Cruise and the V2V communication, those will both be on 2017 Cadillacs, but they'll be in the marketplace next year.","And then we have also announced a strong partnership and the work we continue to do with Mobileye. We were their first customer. We're their largest customer. We continue to work closely with them. And we're also exploring some other opportunities. So, I look at it is there's the evolutionary path where you're putting a technology on and customers get the opportunity to experience it. And then there's the revolutionary path where you go full autonomous. We're executing both. But I assure you that we're doing it with a huge focus on safety as we go forward.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Oh, great. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on a great quarter.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Thank you.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Can you remind us about the impact that rental pricing has had year-to-date because despite your 10%, 10.5% year-to-date margin, that was actually a pretty big headwind. And is that going to go away next year? Or is that still going to be a residual risk next year? Is that actually going to be a pretty large tailwind?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","I would again, think about pricing in an overall broad context, I think our guidance for the year is that pricing is going to be consistent with what we talked about back in January, which was more of a headwind in 2015 versus prior years.","Year-to-date kind of the fleet-alone impact is roughly $700 million to $800 million of negative net price. As you recall, it was $400 million in Q1, a couple of hundred million dollars in Q2, and then $100 million in Q3. We aren't ready to provide guidance on pricing going into 2016 yet, although, I would say that, overall, we would expect a net favorable positive pricing environment really being driven by the launch of our new products.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Can you give any color on what you're seeing in initial demand following the stimulus in China? I mean, because you've kind of said that you think now 3% to 5% is the long-term outlook? Is this having a big help in the near-term though?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","I didn't catch the beginning of your question, I'm sorry, Colin, I couldn't hear.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Oh, sorry. Any color on the near-term impact from stimulus? Have you seen a spike in demand following the announcement?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Not yet. And there is, obviously, something that we continue to closely monitor. What we've seen so far in October is our retail sales are up over 10% on a year-over-year basis, all right, it's early days in October, the industry is up, but we expected that as well.","We're dealing with, in China right now, holiday season, so there's some specific nuances from a market perspective, but that's something we're going to continue to monitor. And remember, this programs runs through the end of 2016. So typically, with any of these kinds of things maybe you'll get some rollover from the tail end of September into October, but the real big bump will be near the end of next year depending on what the government does if they announce they're not going to extend it or if they decide to extend it so let's see how it plays out.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. And any color on Europe, can give us the status of the Russia wind-down, the Chevy wind-down and any color on what kind of headwind those were within this year's result?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Well, I'm not going to talk about specific country-level profitability with Chevy Europe, but we talked about before that Russia was a fairly significant headwind and that as we move through the year, that impact would diminish. And it has. From an overall GM Europe perspective, we are very much through the Chevy Europe wind-down, and that has went very much \u2013 as a matter of fact both the Chevy Europe wind-down and kind of the Russia restructuring plans have went very, very much according to plan.","And specific to Chevy Europe, the bright spot is the vast majority of the dealers that were impacted by that have opted to move to Opel based on the opportunities presented there. And part of the strategy with the new Karl, which is doing very, very well was to help fill some of the void that was created when we provided some of that clean air with the Chevrolet Europe exit. So, both of those are going very well, and on a go-forward basis, clearly, we'll provide an opportunity in Europe.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for taking my question.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.","Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Congrats on another great quarter.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Thanks, Ryan.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Thank you.","Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","First question, on mix in China, I think your performance in China this quarter was like better than investors expected. So, our internal checks suggest enhanced pricing pressures in the country although your margin notably rose year-over-year. Can you talk about the drivers of that margin strength? How much is being driven by mix, right, by the new models, SUVs, CUV mix, traction of Cadillac brand? And then, how was that mix improvement accomplished and how should we think about it tracking going forward given there seems to be a consensus that sales in China will move towards the less wealthy tier 3, tier 4 cities in the interior relative to the richer coastal cities?","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah. First, we kind of covered the mix question earlier, that mix and the material cost performance offset kind of the volume and price headwinds. And again, if you'll look at the sales results, September as an example, SUV sales up 171% year-over-year. SUVs as a percent of total China sales were at 17% versus 6% in the year-earlier period. Cadillac, up 12%. So that's all very beneficial.","On a go-forward basis Matt talked about, at the Global Business Conference, Matt Tsien, that where the market was going to develop and the real growth was going to come in SUVs, MPVs and luxury on a go-forward basis, they were going to over-index. And that's why we believe that there's a significant opportunity from a mix perspective going forward.","I would also suggest that in the tier 2 to tier 4 cities, the launch of the Baojun brand and the expansion into SUVs provide us with a unique opportunity to take advantage of not only SUVs in the Chevrolet, Buick, and Cadillac channel, but also SUVs in the Baojun brand as growth increases in tier 2 to 4 cities. So, our perspective is mix is going to continue to be a favorable tailwind for us going forward.","Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then just for my last question, let me try to approach, I guess, what some are calling dieselgate from a different perspective by folks and what it means for your previously communicated strategies. So, one of your DRIVE!2022 goals for Europe is to improve the perception of and therefore the pricing of your vehicles.","We met with Michael Lohscheller in R\u00fcsselsheim earlier in the year. It seemed the team there was already focused on the opportunity to improve Opel pricing relative to VW even before the emergence of this issue just by building better product. And as you know though from your work on Cadillac in the U.S., sometimes you can build much better product, then there's sometimes a time lag between when you field the better product and when you get fully rewarded for it because you also have to change the consumer mind. So, does the VW situation chip away at all at this consumer perception in Europe at least of engineering superiority associated with that brand, and so therefore play into the look-again theme relative to Opel?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Well, I think if you look at the plan that we've been on to not only have a winning product into the marketplace for Opel and Vauxhall but also build the brand. And there's been tremendous work done by Tina M\u00fcller, our Head of Marketing for Opel and Vauxhall, of doing just that, and the metrics prove out that we have changed minds, and there is more favorability around the Opel brand.","And then when you look at the strong products that we have, the Corsa, the Karl and then when you look at the Astra. And the Astra not only is a great vehicle from a styling and I'll say a fundamentals perspective, but it has safety features that are industry-leading. It has connectivity that's not available across and also some features that are generally only available in luxury. So, as we look at the strengths of Corsa, Karl and the whole portfolio, there is the youngest \u2013 it's everything I think approximately four years or less. So, we feel that we're very well positioned going into the market with these launches. And we're going to work hard to earn every sale.","Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. Congrats again.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs.","Patrick K. Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Yeah. Good morning. And thanks for taking my questions. I guess my first one is just on the implied margin for the fourth quarter in North America. And I guess I would just frame this question as not being nitpicky. It's more of a function of just third quarter being so good that when you back into the fourth quarter based on the 10% margin for the year, it implies somewhere close to 9%, which would be slightly better than what you did last year, maybe 30 basis points or so, but certainly short of the 200 basis points of margin improvement year-on-year that you saw this quarter. So, is a lot of that just the incremental launch costs? I mean, I think you mentioned 16 vehicles basically ramping up. So, I wanted a little bit more color on that first.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Yeah, sure. Clearly, as you continue to drive the business towards a 10% sustainable margin the year-over-year comparisons are going to get more and more challenging. We've had nine straight quarters of margin expansion. You can do the math. We're at 10.5% year-to-date. So, it's not hard to figure out the floor for Q4 in order to hit 10% or something better than that for the year.","I would say this year, we do have some incremental launch costs in the fourth quarter associated with the Malibu and a number of other products, and it's both manufacturing and marketing that are going to be somewhat of a headwind. But again, I would say as we continue to rotate through the next number of quarters, the year-over-year comparisons for margin expansion aren't going to be as strong as they have been when we've been driving from a 7% margin to a 10% margin. But I think broadly speaking, Patrick, your math is kind of correct. I mean, it's not a hard math exercise to solve.","Patrick K. Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. Well, thank you. No, that's helpful color on the reasons for it. I guess my other \u2013 a lot of my questions were answered but one that I was curious about just on the V2V product, which I think is the Cadillac, that's going to be fitted on the Cadillac in, I think 2017. It seems like you guys are going ahead of the NHTSA mandate on this, right? I mean, they are working on rules to make this required and you'll be ahead of that. And just wanted to understand what benefits you get from that technology? Because it seems like there needs to be a certain critical mass for it to work, especially if it's based off of communicating with other vehicles. So, just wanted your opinion on that.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Well, I think the biggest benefit is getting it into the marketplace, getting the learnings. Clearly to your point, you do need the communication, you need everyone to play but someone's got to start and take the leadership role. We do work in a very strong fashion with NHTSA, our regulator, and looking at what we're doing, how we're driving it and how the regulations and the rules around this will be. But we think it's very important to get it into the marketplace to drive the learnings, to drive the scale, because with any new technology, there is always something you learn when you get it into the marketplace.","So, that's our look at that and again, same thing with Super Cruise. I mean, Super Cruise, first of all, is built on the embedded connectivity capability that we have but getting that in the marketplace, having customers get to experience it is very important steps along the journey because we're working hard to be in a leadership position with autonomous as we move forward, but in a very responsible way, aligned with our goals to be industry leaders in safety.","Patrick K. Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Understood. Thanks for the color and congrats on the quarter.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Thank you.","Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.","Thank you.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.","Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just one quick one, a little bit bigger picture, appreciate the color on your relative less dependence on diesel in Europe, but clearly, diesel was still part of the plan towards hitting 95 grams per kilometer of CO2. So I guess what I \u2013 my question is are you drawing up contingency plans? Do you need to sort of double down on electrification or other alternative powertrains, just in case either something from a consumer demand or regulatory perspective happens?","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Well, so I mean, if you go back \u2013 and Chuck mentioned the fact, we have a lower diesel impact than some other OEMs if you look at it from a global perspective. But we do have both capability in diesels as well as \u2013 we're driving a lot of improvements in the internal combustion engine, again, from an electrification perspective, not only with the second generation Volt that has been not only improving the power density, but also driving cost efficiencies, and then you look at the Bolt.","And we talked about where we will be with our kilowatt-per-hour target as we launch the Bolt, and then how we'll further take that cost down. And in addition to that, I mentioned briefly in my opening remarks what we have working with Honda from a fuel cell perspective. So we've always believed in kind of our propulsion diversity strategy. I think we've got very good work going on in each of those areas. And so again, we think it's too soon to tell, but we have tremendous flexibility across the portfolio, across the globe as we look at all of our propulsion strategy.","Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. I now would like to turn the call back over to Mary Barra.","Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.","Thank you. Well again, I appreciate everybody being on the call. Our overall results, again, demonstrate the very strong earnings potential of General Motors. Our results through the third quarter lay the foundation for achieving our commitments for the remainder of 2015 and 2016. We are working extremely hard to make sure we deliver on what we say we're going to do. As we move forward, we intend to execute our plan with discipline, and that includes the capital allocation framework. And we are confident that we will drive profitable growth, strong returns on invested capital, and shareholder value.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, October 30, 2013.","I would now like to turn the call over to Randy Arickx, Executive Director of Communications and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Randy Arickx","Thanks, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us, as we review the GM financial results for the third quarter of 2013. A press release was issued this morning and the conference call materials are available on our Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call live on the internet.","Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the legend regarding forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language.","This morning, Dan Akerson, General Motors Chairman and CEO will provide opening remarks, followed by a review of the financial results, with Dan Ammann, Executive Vice President and CFO. Dan Akerson will then conclude the remarks portion of our call with some closing comments. After the presentation portion of the call, we will open the line for questions from the analyst community. In the room today, we also have Tom Timko, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; Chuck Stevens, CFO, GM North America; and Jim Davlin, Vice President, Finance and Treasurer.","Now I will turn the call over to Dan Akerson.","Daniel Akerson","Thanks, Randy. Every quarter on these calls, we talk a lot about what it takes to go from being good to great at General Motors. Fundamentally, I believe there are three drivers: building great products; satisfying our customers better than anyone else, and making sure the company has good bones. In my book, good bones means a fortress balance sheet and a strong organizational \u2013 an organization with capabilities and everything from IT to HR, to marketing to finance \u2013 all of these things, from products to people to technology have to come together to build a sustainable competitive advantage and they are doing just that. As you can see it in the numbers we are posting this quarter.","Looking at the top of Slide 2, you can see that we increased our third quarter global deliveries by 5.5% and grew our global market share by one-tenth of a point. Net revenue increased by $1.4 billion and EBIT adjusted was up 15% to $2.6 billion. This $300 million increase was driven by higher earnings in North America and South America, a small increase in China and a smaller loss in Europe and another very solid quarter for GM Financial.","GM Financial, I would like to point out, has now surpassed $2 billion in cumulative pre-tax earnings since we acquired the company in the second half of 2010.","Two of our automotive operating regions also deserve special recognition. First, the team in North America has done a great job in executing a very aggressive product plan. We are talking about more than a dozen Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, and Cadillac launches so far this year. Combined, they represent more than 1 million sales on an annualized basis. In particular, the launches of the new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra have been nearly textbook perfect.","Since the first quarter of \u201913, GM incentive spending on light duty trucks has been trending down and the average transaction prices have been trending up. The pace of improvement definitely picked up in the third quarter, which reflects an increasing mix of 2014 models, which are now about 75% of sales and stable -- in this period [ph] stable incentive spending on our old 2013 model. In other words, we are very much on plan.","Meanwhile the team in Europe has been tending the green shoots we talked about last January. Specifically, GM Europe has managed to stabilize key metrics, like volume and pricing, in an extremely challenging market. In fact, they increased their revenue year-over-year for the first time in two years. Finally, adjusted automotive free cash flow was a strong $1.3 billion, that\u2019s net of roughly $1.009 [ph] billion in capital spending in the quarter.","Now before we walk through our GAAP and non-GAAP results in more detail, I would like to spend a few more minutes reviewing some other highlights on the quarter. They are summarized on Slide 3. Of course, our cars and trucks are the tip of the spear and product excellence is once again a GM hallmark.","Let me give you a few powerful examples. In July, Consumer Reports magazine named the 2014 Chevrolet Impala as the best sedan in the market. Period. This shocked many people because North American car has ever come up on top.","Then just two months later, the magazine named Chevrolet Silverado as the best truck. The best news is that Consumer Reports is not an outlier among auto critics. For example, the Buick Encore, the Cadillac CTS, GMC Sierra and three Chevrolet, the Impala, Corvette and Silverado are all on the shortlist to be the next North American car or truck of the year. No one has ever stacked a deck like this. But what matters most more than trophies is our consistent execution to high standards. That\u2019s what changes the conversation about brand. The product roll we are on especially in North America is creating tremendous value, which you can see in our EBIT adjusted margins, which topped 9%.","We are going outside of our home market as well. Good products like Onix in Brazil helps Chevrolet sell 1.25 million vehicles in the quarter and achieve another global sales record. Indeed, Chevrolet is on quite a run. The brand has now delivered 12 consecutive quarters of higher year-over-year global sales.","Cadillac is also on accelerated growth trajectory and the brand, its products, have played key roles in our global market share increase. In the first nine months of the year, the brand\u2019s global sales were up 31% versus 2012, thanks to launches of the ATS, CTS and XTS in North America and our expansion in China. If product discipline is one half of the coin, the other is financial discipline.","Our financial goals are just as well defined as our product and customer strategy and we are equally systematic when it comes to execution. For example, during the quarter, we financed \u2013 refinanced a substantial portion of our Series A preferred stock in September to reduce interest costs and simplify our balance sheet. All this progress opened the door for Moody\u2019s to return GM to investment grade status in September \u2013 something we are very proud of.","The upgrade recognizes our progress. And it\u2019s emblematic of the potential this company represents. If anything, I think we are just starting to scratch the surface of what we can accomplish.","With that summary, I will now turn the floor over to Dan Ammann. Dan?","Daniel Ammann","Thanks, Dan. Now on Slide 4, I will start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter. Net revenue for the period was $39 billion. The $1.4 billion increase includes an $800 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange translation. Our GAAP operating income increased to $2.3 billion. Net income to common stockholders was $700 million. The decline from the prior year was due to stronger operating performance, being more than offset by an incremental $500 million in tax expense and the $800 million charge we took to redeem a portion of the Series A preferred stock during this quarter.","Diluted earnings per share came in at $0.45 and our automotive net cash from operating activities was $3.3 billion, up $200 million from 2012. For our non-GAAP measures, EBIT adjusted was $2.6 billion in the third quarter and the EBIT adjusted margin improved to 6.8%. Adjusted automotive free cash flow increased $100 million to $1.3 billion for the third quarter.","Slide 5 lists the special items for the quarter. Again net income to common stockholders was $700 million and our fully diluted EPS was $0.45. We took another impairment of goodwill in the GM Korea business that was less than $100 million. In addition, we booked an $800 million charge for our recent redemption of Series A preferred shares. These charges had a $0.51 unfavorable impact on earnings per share.","On Slide 6, we show our consolidated EBIT adjusted for the prior five quarters. Our 6.8% EBIT adjusted margin is our highest in nine quarters. Our consolidated wholesale vehicle sales were 1.6 million vehicles in the third quarter, a slight increase from the prior year and our global market share increased to 11.7%.","Turning Slide 7, we explain the $300 million year-over-year increase in our consolidated EBIT adjusted. As I just covered, global wholesales were essentially flat resulting in no change in earnings from volume. Mix was $500 million favorable due primarily to vehicle mix in North America. Price was $800 million favorable due to strong new products in GM North America and price actions we took to offset FX impacts in South America. Cost was $200 million unfavourable due to increases in North America and IO, partially offset with savings in Europe. Other was $700 million unfavourable, primarily due to FX impacts.","Slide 8 gives you our year-over-year EBIT adjusted performance by segments. GMNA increased $500 to $2.2 billion. GME improved to a $200 million loss. The performance in IO deteriorated by $500 million to $300 million for the quarter and in South America we improved to $300 million and GM Financial again recorded $200 million in earnings before taxes. Our corporate sector rounded to $200 million of expense.","I will now review the key performance indicators for GM North America on Slide 9. For the third quarter of 2013, our total U.S. market share was 17.3% and our retail share was 16%. Retail share increased 0.3 percentage points from the prior year, as our fleet market share decreased due to the repositioning of the Chevrolet Impala and generally lower rental sales. Our incentives for the quarter were 11.2% of average transaction price, which put us at a 114% of the industry average.","Slide 10 shows GMNA\u2019s EBIT adjusted for the most recent five quarters. Revenue increased $1.2 billion to $23.5 billion despite flat wholesale volumes. GMNA\u2019s EBIT adjusted margin was 9.3% for the third quarter, demonstrating clear progress toward our mid-term goal of 10% margins. Our U.S. dealer inventory declined to 670,000 vehicles as we worked through the launch of our all new Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra. North America market share was 16.7% in the quarter.","The primary drivers of the $500 million increase in GM North America EBIT adjusted are on slide 11. Volume had no net impact. Mix was $400 million favorable due almost entirely to our new vehicle introductions, including full-sized pickups. Price was $600 million favorable as the $1.1 billion favorable pricing from our recently launched vehicles was partially offset by $500 million in unfavorable carryover pricing.","Cost was $400 million unfavorable due to $500 million in increased material and freight expense and $200 million in increased engineering expense, partially offset by a $300 million reduction in unfavourable policy and warranty reserve adjustments. Other was $200 million unfavourable due to FX headwinds in non-operating income items, which are largely non-recurring.","GME on Slide 12, reported an EBIT adjusted loss of $200 million for the third quarter, a $300 million improvement from the prior year. Revenue improved 3% to $4.9 billion for the quarter, marking the first year-over-year revenue increase in at least two years. The EBIT adjusted margin in the segment improved six percentage points to minus 4.4%. GME\u2019s wholesale volumes for the quarter stayed relatively constant at 253,000 units and our European market share improved to 8.6%.","On Slide 13, we provide the major components of GME\u2019s $300 million increase in EBIT adjusted. Volume had no impact. Mix was $100 million headwinds and price was flat. Cost was $400 million favorable due to $200 million in lower depreciation and amortization expense and $200 million savings in other areas.","I would like to remind you that we plan to close our Valcom [ph] assembly and powertrain operations by the end of 2014. We will disclose in our 10-Q that we expect to incur a significant restructuring costs as a result of this action and some of these charges may affect our results as early as the fourth quarter of 2013.","We now move on to GMIO\u2019s profitability for the prior five quarters on Slide 14. EBIT adjusted was $300 million, made up of continued strong equity income from our China joint ventures of $400 million, partially offset by a $100 million loss from our consolidated operations, which includes approximately $50 million in restructuring charges. GMIO\u2019s revenue from consolidated operations was $5.3 billion. The 400 million decline from Q3 of \u201912 includes $200 million in unfavorable foreign exchange translation.","The EBIT adjusted margin for our consolidated operations declined to negative 2.8% from the year ago as we again experienced industry and competitive pressures in the segment of the business. We expect these challenges to continue to affect our performance in the fourth quarter. In response, we have strategic reviews underway in select markets the results of which may lead to future charges.","The net income margin from our China JVs came in at a solid 9.4%. GMIO had wholesale vehicle sales of 267,000 units for the consolidated operations and 761,000 for the China JVs. GM market share in the Asia-Pacific region improved to 9.6%, reflecting our strength in China [indiscernible] faster than the rest of the region.","On slide 15, we provide the major components of GMIO\u2019s year-over-year performance. Volume had no impact. Mix was a $100 million unfavourable in GMIO\u2019s consolidated operations and price was a $100 million headwinds. Cost was $200 million unfavourable due to $100 million decline from our parts and accessories business and higher manufacturing expense, offset by some favourable material and freight items. Other had no impact as the $100 million unfavourable FX was offset with a small increase in equity income.","Slide 16 provides a look at GM South America\u2019s performance in recent quarters. Revenue improved $100 million year-over-year to $4.4 billion despite a $600 million unfavourable impact from foreign exchange translation. The EBIT adjusted margin in the segment rose to 6.5%, 2.8 percentage points higher than the prior year. GM South America\u2019s wholesale vehicle sales were 282,000 units, 14,000 unit increase from the prior year period and our market share in the region declined slightly to 17.8%, despite a higher share in the Brazilian market.","On Slide 17 we will look at the drivers of the $100 million increase in EBIT adjusted. Volume had no impact, mix was $200 million favorable due to country mix and the successful introduction of new vehicles in Brazil, including the Chevy S-10. Price was $300 million favourable due to actions we\u2019ve taken in response to inflationary and FX pressures. Cost had no impact and other was $400 million headwind because of foreign exchange. This totals to $300 million EBIT adjusted in South America in the third quarter.","While we are pleased with South America\u2019s improvement in profitability this quarter, our performance in future periods will likely to continue to be impacted by currency and regulatory actions, particularly in Venezuela.","Slide 18 provides a walk of adjusted automotive free cash flow for the third quarter. From our net income to common of $700 million we add back the impact of non-controlling interest, preferred dividends and the Series A redemption and then deduct GM Financial earnings to arrive at an automotive income to $1.5 billion. We had a 100 million in non-cash special items and our depreciation and amortization was $1.4 billion. Working capital was $100 million use of cash.","Pension and OPEB cash payments exceeded expenses by $200 million in the quarter. Other was $600 million use [ph] of cash, a $200 million increase from the prior year, which can be more than explained by an increase in deferred tax expense. This totals to automotive net cash provided by operating activities of $3.3 billion. We had $1.9 billion of capital expenditures in the quarter giving us an adjusted automotive free cash flow of $1.3 billion.","The positive cash flow helped improve our liquidity position on slide 19 to $37.3 billion, including $26.8 billion in cash and marketable securities. The debt increase to $8.4 billion is due to our recent $4.5 billion refinancing transactions. $3.2 billion of the new debt was used in the third quarter to redeem Series A preferred shares that had a book value of $2.4 billion. The remaining $1.2 billion was used after the quarter end to retire the Canadian Healthcare Trust notes. This transaction will be reflected in our fourth quarter earnings announcement.","Our U.S. qualified pension plans were underfunded by $12.8 billion and our non-U.S. pension plans were underfunded by $13.6 billion, the $500 million increase from the prior quarter was primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange translations. Our unfunded OPEB liability declined to $7.3 billion because we modified retiree life insurance benefits for our U.S. salary population.","Slide 20 provides a brief summary of our order financing activities. GM Financial released their results this morning and will hold their conference call at noon. Our U.S. sub-prime penetration in the third quarter declined 0.3 percentage points to 7.8%. Our U.S. lease penetration experienced a year-over-year increase for the sixth consecutive quarter to 21.3% in Q3. Lease penetration in Canada improved 1.5 percentage points to 8.1%. GM, as a percentage of GM Financial loan and lease originations, rose to 67%. And GM Financial\u2019s percentage of GM\u2019s U.S. consumer sub-prime finance and leasing was 20% in the quarter. GM Financials annualized net credit losses were 1.9% and its earnings before tax were $239 million for the third quarter, including the profitability of the recently acquired international subsidiaries.","On October 1, after the quarter end, we closed the acquisition of the Brazilian business of Ally International.","To summarize our financial performance on the final slide, we have strong third quarter results with revenue up, market share up, EBIT adjusted up, margins up and cash flow up. We also continue to strengthen our fortress balance sheet by refinancing a significant portion of our preferred share and debt at lower costs. The continued focus of this management team is to deliver great new cars and trucks to our customers with a compelling value proposition and great quality. Our third quarter results further validate that we\u2019re consistently delivering on our plan.","Now I\u2019d like to pass it over to Dan Akerson for his closing remarks.","Daniel Akerson","Thanks, Dan. For all of us successfully enjoying the third quarter let me make one thing perfectly clear, we have a lot of hard work ahead of us especially in our focus areas of complexity reduction, material costs, logistics cost and quality. I can assure you the team is very focused on making steady progress. Consistency is the name of the game. Given how far we\u2019ve come and what is just over the horizon, we\u2019re all pleased with our position and feel we\u2019re well positioned for the future. And when we have great products that wed into competitive cost structure, I think we\u2019re in a unstoppable position.","Now, we\u2019ll be happy to take any questions you might have. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Brian Johnson at Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays Capital","Good morning. I want to just focus on an overall strategic question, we can later on drill into the details afterwards, but there seems to be an emerging market SUV boom going on. Sales up 45% in China, other emerging markets gravitating towards SUVs and even the Europeans showing signs of following the SUV craze. A couple of questions, one, where do you think GM is positioned on that now? Two, quickly can you beef up your product lines in key markets for SUVs? And then three, what kind of factory flexibility do you have to be able to pivot between sedans and SUVs as perhaps gas prices fluctuate or tastes change?","Daniel Akerson","First of all we would agree with the general observation of the market trends. Our position relative to that market trend differs by market around the world. There are places where we are the very forefront of the trend, like in Europe with the Mokka, I think we have really redefined that segment, there is an example. There are other places where we are not exactly where we want to be from a product timing point of view and so we are obviously working to make sure that we are going to capitalize on the trends as we see them emerging. And then finally from a plant flexibility point of view, as you know I think many of the SUV programs both for us and for other manufacturers, [indiscernible] car derived from an architectural point of view so we have a pretty high amount of flexibility from a manufacturing perspective to meet that demand once we have the product localized. So it is clearly an opportunity, it is clearly a longer term trend and we feel good about where we are in parts of it and we are working to capitalize it in other places.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Colin Langan \u2013UBS","","Okay, thanks for taking my question. Do you have any color on the reported production, or supply issues around the new pick-up, I think there was a new engine component that constrained and there was some axle issues, will that impact you at all going forward in terms of sales or production as we go in to Q4?","Chuck Stevens","","This is Chuck. We have had some short term issues with American Axle around some specific components. We are working very closely with them and it has had a small impact on production in the month of October but we expect to make that up here yet in Q4 and have no impact on the full size SUV launch. So there is a lot of focused attention being given to this and we expect to be resolved here in the relatively near term.","Colin Langan \u2013UBS","And what about the reported issue with some engine components, is that impacting your availability of some of the V8s?","Chuck Stevens","No, the biggest issue is really around some axle components right now that impacts the mix of V8s.","Colin Langan \u2013UBS","And so we should, with the ramp rolling out, pick-up production will likely rise from Q3 to Q4 as two of the plants are on line?","Chuck Stevens","Well I think those are two different questions. First, we lost some units thus far in the month of October because of some part shortages which we expect to make up. Secondly I think there will be a seasonal Q4 versus Q3 impact on full sized pick-up and SUV production as well as others specifically because we will have holiday shutdown in Q4 and we didn\u2019t shut down any of the plants in July during the changeover.","Colin Langan \u2013UBS","Okay, very helpful. Any color, any update on the Peugeot Alliance, obviously I think they were out saying that some parts of the Alliance were under review, I mean how does that impact your restructuring plan in Europe and the potential billion dollars in savings that the Alliance is supposed to -- the savings to achieve eventually?","Daniel Akerson","","This is Dan Akerson speaking. It is fair to say that we still are working with regard to specific platforms that we see potential benefit for both companies. We are watching the situation carefully, there apparent need to raise additional capital, how that might fit with our plan, but I would say there is nothing new to report until we ascertain precisely what comes out of their capital raise endeavors.","Daniel Ammann","The only thing I would add to that is that a year ago on this call when we outlined our plan to break even in Europe by mid-decade, we said then, and I will reiterate it now, that plan did not include any assumption of material synergies from the PSA Alliance.","Colin Langan \u2013UBS","Okay, great, thank you very much for your help.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","Good morning everybody. On North America you just did 9.3% margin in what is at least historically it has been a relatively weaker quarter, I would imagine maybe it comes down a little bit in the fourth quarter with a heavy duty truck plant down and seasonal costs. But can you talk a little bit about, if we look at this level of profitability, what happens from here as we look out to next year, is it conceivable that you might be able to get to that target, the 10% target, a little bit sooner?","Daniel Akerson","","I think Q3 in this year that 9.3% highest quarter since Q3 2011 obviously favorably impacted by the K2 launch as you indicated, you know, I think from a seasonal perspective there will be a falloff in Q4. And I don\u2019t think you can necessarily extrapolate these Q3 earnings over calendar year. I would say this that we\u2019re at an inflection point, we\u2019re executing to the plan that we talked about earlier this year to drive the organization to 10% EBIT margins. And I would expect on a year-over-year basis to see some pretty significant margin growth next year.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. And just one last one, you\u2019re sitting on $26 billion or $27 billion of cash, you\u2019ve got obviously plenty of liquidity above and beyond that with the revolver, could you just remind us what you\u2019re targeting as a normal level of cash going forward and what your priorities would be above and beyond the reinvestment in the business?","Daniel Ammann","I want to say, we\u2019re comfortable or more than comfortable with our current levels of liquidity. Recall that at the quarter end there was a $1.2 billion sitting there which we\u2019ve now redeemed the Canadian Healthcare Trust note with in October, so the balance sheet was slightly grossed up as of the quarter end. The priorities for cash reinvestment haven\u2019t changed, we\u2019re obviously focused on reinvesting in the business, making sure we got a winning product portfolio going forward and our capital expenditure levels, I think, have reflected that and they\u2019re being consistent with what we had previously articulated. My view is that we\u2019ve come a long way with the balance sheet and we have it in very good shape. we obviously had a very, I think, compelling refinancing transaction that we executed in September, taking advantage of the market window there to clean up some near-term and expensive obligations and replace them with longer data and much more efficient funding. And so that puts us in a good position going forward.","As we look to next year, we obviously still have the remaining portion of the Series A preferred that we will clean up at the end of next year when that becomes actionable from a return to the security point-of-view. We still have shareholders working their way out of our ownership structure, that\u2019s something that we\u2019re keeping a close eye on. And obviously our priority over time is to return cash to shareholders and that\u2019s something that we continue to evaluate.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy of Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Good morning, guys. Maybe just a follow-up on the North American margin question that Rajesh posed. I mean, we\u2019re staring down the barrel of the K2XX launch which is going on right now. You have the HD launch which comes up after that. And then as we look over the next couple of years you got your small SUVs and large SUVs and the market is doing pretty well and you\u2019re doing \u2013 tap with [ph] 96.4% right now, looks like that will improve over time and you\u2019re posting 9.3% margins now. I mean, is 10% a ceiling, Chuck, or is that something you think you can do over the cycle? I mean, is there a period of time where you could potentially be higher than that?","Chuck Stevens","Our objective is to drive this business to +10% EBIT margins by mid-decade and really to generate those kinds of margins at mid-cycle volumes as we\u2019ve talked about before which would be an industry level of 15.5 million, 16 million units. We\u2019re at the early stages of executing to that plan, the product portfolio and launch cadence is the first part of it, we need to continue to drive complexity and cost out of the business to get the cost savings that we need to take the next tranche. So, is there a point where we could be above 10% EBIT margins during the cycle? Possibly. But our commitment is to get to 10% by mid-decade. Once we get there we\u2019ll worry about the next step.","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Okay. Seems like you\u2019re almost there. Maybe \u2013","Chuck Stevens","As I said, John, we shouldn\u2019t extrapolate Q3 over the calendar year, you know there\u2019s ebbs-and-flows within the quarter, so.","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Absolutely. But it\u2019s impressive so far. And maybe just one second question for Dan Akerson. I noticed that your hiring trends on the hourly side were not that aggressive but on the salary side it looks like you hired about 5,000 workers and it looks like it\u2019s a focus on ramping up your IT. Is that an effort, really, just to clean up some of the in-house stuff or is there an opportunity to start mining data and marketing consumers more intelligently or some big data push here that could really push the business forward? I\u2019m just trying to understand what that big step up in IT professionals is for?","Daniel Ammann","Well, we were \u2013 I won\u2019t recite all of the tens of IT path but we had 23 un-mirrored, not connected independent data centers we are trying to get to two. We now have a data center here in Michigan that ranks in with Google and Facebook in terms of the capability, one of the few in the industrial sector with that capability.","Daniel Akerson","Over the last month, just this month we have taken all of the mainframes that were not resident in our sphere of influence and consolidated them without a hitch to the operation. Having been in the high tech environment for a good part of my career, I was very pleased with the transition to our data centers. Along with that we have transitioned away from some of our outsource costs and brought it in and that is the majority of Alliance, more of 90% of our head count has been in IT this year. So that is a positive from my perspective because we aren\u2019t paying the overhead for those people that we were once paying to our third party.","And yes we are a very big data driven company and you can see it just in our marketing. I don\u2019t think it should go without passing to note that we want people to start buying cars over the Internet, it is a potential half step away from our traditional channels. It doesn\u2019t mean we are going to try and bypass our dealers, but why not in this tech savvy culture we have, this economy we have, for the millennial to come in and say I can shop and I just go down and sign and go. So we are trying to evolve not only from an internal perspective but an external perspective to a more 21st century information based marketing company. Your observations are directionally correct, we are also trying to clean up some fundamental basics in how we run the information systems of our company.","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Hey thanks everybody. First question is on the initial reaction to the enhanced employee discounts in the U.S. Care if you can comment on how that\u2019s going so far, early days and perhaps to kind of dynamic, how big were these discounts as a percentage of your total retail sales pre-crisis, because we have heard figures as high as 30%, that might have meant crazy high levels but I just wanted to confirm that and see how it is going so far?","Daniel Akerson","To your latter point Adam, 30% of our total sales were employee based, was that the data point?","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Yes.","Daniel Akerson","That is way too high. So to dispel some of the apparent myths around this employee pricing. We ended up doing two things, one, simplifying the program, we had a very complicated car line specific EVA or rebate program that was very difficult for our employees and family members to manage. So we went to a simple percent of MSRP kind of discount.","Secondly, the incremental costs associated with that is relatively minor in the scheme of our overall incentive spending, you\u2019re talking $200 to $250 a car on average. Third, that really put us in the middle of the pack, as far as employee discounts go between Ford and Chrysler and I think you\u2019re aware especially if you get around the Great Lakes region that there is a lot of interrelationships with family members and employees that have relatives that are Ford or Chrysler employees, or retirees. So we needed to be competitive in order to make sure we were capturing our fair share of employee and related sales. So far it has been relatively successful, that is never going to move a market share point. It is just again, simplify, enhance to be competitive and make sure that we are getting our fair share of employee and related sales.","Daniel Ammann","Let me just add something to that because I know you are trying to read tea leaves and get some sort of perspective that gives you a better idea of what is going on. When we look at our -- when I mentioned my remarks, incentives are down and average transaction prices are up. When we look at our competition we are 200 to 300 basis points lower than some of our competition in this area on incentives. So we have been very disciplined on our incentives and as a result our ATPs are up. That includes employees and non-employees.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks for clarifying that. It\u2019s very helpful. If I can just ask one follow-up. We understand that the CFPB has sent letters to the automotive captive finance companies, curious if you can confirm whether GM Financial received any communication from the CFPB and if so perhaps share the nature of that communication as.","Daniel Ammann","We don\u2019t have any comment on that at this point.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Does that mean that you\u2019ve not received communication or you\u2019re just not commenting on that question, Dan?","Daniel Ammann","It means that I\u2019m not commenting on the question.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thank you for clarifying.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Yeah. Thank you very much and good morning. Just a couple of questions on some of the international ops. Beginning with GMIO, you did see a sequential uptick from the second quarter but I think in your comments you sort of \u2013 it sounded like that you\u2019re hinting that obviously some of the core challenges there remain. Should we interpret this as at least you\u2019ve \u2013 even though you\u2019re down year-on-year and running at lower level than six months ago, things have at least stabilized and you\u2019re working to get them better or is there some risk that there is actually further downside to the profit levels you\u2019re seeing in this segment, that would say, excluding restructuring charges, of course, which nobody can predict.","Daniel Ammann","Yeah, I would say that we\u2019re certainly not out of the woods yet that there are ongoing challenges but at the same time we\u2019re taking actions and we\u2019re taking actions quickly. You saw that we have \u2013 we\u2019ve made a leadership change in the region bringing in Stefan Jacoby to head up that part of the business for us. We should expect to see changes through the business as we look to get the business back on track. You need to remember that this reporting segment is really a collection of very different markets across the big span of the globe and there are different dynamics going on in each market. We\u2019ve talked about, for example, in Southeast Asia where the yen and the competitive dynamic there has created some challenges. We\u2019ve had issues in India that we do talk about publicly in terms of some product related challenges there. So, it is a little bit of a different story by market. We are taking very affirmative action to get the business back on the kind of track that it should be on but this is something that we\u2019re going to be working through over the coming quarters and you know it\u2019s not full year results obviously at this point.","Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And just a similar question actually for Brazil or I should say South America. You know, you had a very good quarter there relative to expectations but you seem cautioned that there are some remaining issues there. Was there any kind of one-off that supported results either, you know, kind of an FX this year or anything like that that kind of reverses in the fourth quarter or are we just talking about sort of ongoing challenges that can hopefully sustain this level of performance?","Daniel Ammann","Well, there are a lot of just external challenges in the region. From an operating environment point-of-view there has been, as is well-known, a lot of FX volatility. I think I described in some detail how we have worked to offset FX volatility with pricing in the various markets where we\u2019ve had the biggest impacts there at the same time we do operate in some volatile economies down there, including in places like Venezuela where overall political situation remain unstable and so on. So, when you\u2019re operating in some of those kinds of environments the business is in some ways \u2013 that we have a week-to-week activity as to exactly what the surprise of the day is going to be in terms of the external environment that you\u2019re operating in. So, we made good progress in the quarter but we want everyone to understand that it\u2019s a volatile environment and we\u2019ll be dealing with those fluctuations in the coming quarters.","Daniel Akerson","Just to add a little bit of more color, when we do our operating reviews in South America, just to buttress what Dan said, many times the first half hour, 40 minutes they spend trying to understand the politics and it isn\u2019t just Venezuela, although Venezuela is one of them, but many of these economies have inflation, hyperinflation. Argentina, you have a President that became ill in the middle of an election and a turn of government could make a big impact on foreign exchange. So it is an area that isn\u2019t a block like Europe, although you get some volatility, but not so much economic policies, variability in Europe. So it is a more challenging political plant economic area than most areas of the world, most regions of the world and we do spend more time trying to understand that. That\u2019s the message you\u2019re trying to deliver.","Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman of JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Ryan Brinkman \u2013 JP Morgan","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just another one on North America margin; how should we think about the year-over-year contribution from pricing going forward after 3Q\u2019s strong $600 million swing? Presumably this was still impacted by, I would guess relatively higher incentives on older model year pickups which should less of a factor going forward, and then also with the heavy duties launch in 4Q SUVs next year, is it possible that this year-over-year swing number could continue to get larger for another couple of quarters now?","Chuck Stevens","I think that from a general proposition perspective, Q4 year-over-year pricing in general will feel kind of like Q3. In other words, we should have a pretty good year-over-year impact; I would say quarter-to-quarter, a bit different story because the seasonality as we move into model year \u201914 as you move through that cycle, incentives historically increase. In summary, kind of Q4 year-over-year growth, quarter-to-quarter probably is a bit of a headwind. Looking into 2014, I would say there is probably going to be continued price opportunity first half of the year as we go through the launch of the HDs and the full size SUVs.","And then I think it\u2019s going to normalize a little bit second half of the year and going forward. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see in \u201914, the same magnitude of the year-over-year price improvement as we saw \u201913 versus \u201912. But I still think there is an opportunity and probably in the first half of the year.","","Ryan Brinkman \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay, very helpful, thanks Chuck. Then just last question; can you comment on the 9.4% margin that you earned \u2013 net income margin that you earned on your China JVs. It was a bit lower versus a year ago, but obviously still very strong. How should we think about that trending over time? Should it naturally evolve lower as the China market matures and we see a higher mix of more affordable cars, more Chevys and [indiscernible] Buicks or could it even go in the other direction if you\u2019re successful with Cadillac over there? Maybe just as a follow on to that can you sort of remind us of your aggressive plans for the Cadillac brand in China and maybe update on how the effort is going?","Daniel Ammann","Sure. So overall, we\u2019re being roughly flat from a China margin point of view for the last few quarters and it\u2019s what you describe which is the business continues to grow. We\u2019ve got some operating leverage. We\u2019ve had some mix -- starting to see early mix favorability as a result of Cadillac introduction on a localized basis although it\u2019s early days for that. And all of that is offsetting competitive price pressure on the market place. So that sort of a baseline equation that we would expect to see continue, generally hold going forward assuming that the market remains reasonably stable from a growth point of view as it has been for the last little while now. So I think that overall trend will continue.","We have talked in length about the plans with Cadillac in China. We believe their market there is very much ready for Cadillac in a much bigger way than it\u2019s been there on an import basis. We\u2019ve started manufacturing locally. We\u2019ve had a significant expansion on the deal and it worked over the last 12 or 18 months, but we\u2019re still at the early stages of really getting the volume equation ramped up and something will continue to work on, not just coming quarters, but coming years.","Ryan Brinkman \u2013 JP Morgan","Thanks. Congrats on the quarter.","","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citi. Please proceed with your question.","","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citi","Great, thanks good morning. Just a two part question on Europe. One Dan, you mentioned you had started to incur restructuring charges for the Valcom [ph] closure. Do you plan on excluding those from an EBIT adjusted or those will show up in the numbers, but called out in the appendix of the future slides? And then two, can you remind us what the savings now going forward that are tied to Valcom [ph] arm? You may have already realized some with the write down and maybe some labor. But what the incremental opportunity for cost savings from Valcom [ph] is going forward?","Daniel Ammann","Sure, on the restructuring, we\u2019ve been very consistent. We view restructuring as part of the cost to doing business. And so that will be in our EBIT number and as has been our practice. We will identify it and call it out, so people can do what they want with it. Restructuring is something that carries on in this business and in this industry and we reported accordingly. In terms of the overall savings, we have not provided specific numbers in relation to Valcom [ph] we have provided our overall cost objective for getting to the break even plan, we\u2019re talked about the $0.5 billion of incremental fixed cost reduction. Obviously capacity rationalization is a meaningful element of that along with other SG&A savings and things that we\u2019re working on would demonstrate good cost progress so far this year and we expect to continue to build on that as we get some of these other steps behind us.","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citi","Perfect, thank you so much.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Jose Spak of RBC Capital Markets.","Jose Spak \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","","Hi, thanks and good morning everyone and thanks for taking the question. One last quick one GMNA, I didn\u2019t hear specifically called out in the cost side anything related to the marketing for the blitz of the new launches, was that any bit of a headwind or not a real issue in the quarter?","Daniel Akerson","","Yeah, I would say quarter-to-quarter it was relatively immaterial, I think sequentially looking at Q4, there is going to be a fairly significant uptick in marketing part of seasonal relative to major league baseball world series, NFL and part of it supporting the ongoing Take 2 as well as the CTS launch.","Jose Spak \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, great and then I realize \u2013 just on capital allocation, going back to an earlier point, realize that these are in a board decisions but can you help us think about order of operations or timing at least because it would seem that you know there has been some technical overhangs on the stock and dividend or a buy back may be a way to stimulate some demand, I know you called out some of the cars on the cash next year with the Series A et cetera but the cash flow is strong and obviously there is \u2013 it looks like it's going to get stronger so just how do we think about timing or order of operations, can any of those occur before there is further balance sheet simplification.","Daniel Akerson","Yeah, like I said earlier, we\u2019re obviously \u2013 I think we\u2019ve made a lot of good progress on the balance sheet, we\u2019ve been reinvesting significantly in the business so we feel like we\u2019re getting into increasingly good shape on that with the refinancing transaction in September and so on. we are watching you know actions of some of the shareholders as they work the way out and you know whether there is any developments there and you know obviously remain fully aware of the desire on the part of our investor base to see incremental returns of capital, we obviously took a big step a year-ago or less than a year-ago, it would be $5.5 billion repurchase of that time and we\u2019ll continue to monitor our opportunities here in the near to medium term.","Daniel Akerson","","I sit on the board so I\u2019ll comment on it. This board understands our shareholders during here to you know this will turn on their money and we have a few tactical issues over the next couple of months in terms of certain shareholders that are exiting the business and that I think we demonstrated our philosophy if you were last December and we spend $5.5 billion to buy a block of our stock and return to capital to shareholder and we understand what we\u2019re here for and wanting to return money to our shareholders and that will be a continuing thing not only this quarter but the next year and the year after.","Unidentified Analyst","Great.

(NYSE:GM) Citi\u2019s 2018 Global Technology Conference  September  5, 2018  3:45 PM ET","Executives","Pam Fletcher - VP Global Electric Vehicle Programs","Analysts","Itay Michaeli - Citi's U.S. Auto Analyst","Operator","Itay Michaeli","Good afternoon, everybody. I'm Itay Michaeli, Citi's U.S. auto analyst, and I'm very pleased to be hosting our next session and to have General Motors back with us at the Citi Global Technology Conference. Today, we're very happy to have back with us, Pam Fletcher, VP of GM's Global Electric Vehicle Programs. Obviously, a major, major topic here in the story of the industry as well as the story for GM, and we're going to keep it to a fireside chat. I'll kick it off with a few questions as we go along. Just feel free to raise your hands and we will definitely call on you for questions.","So with that, we can formally begin. Pam, welcome. Welcome back.","Pam Fletcher","Thanks, Itay great to see you again.","Question-and-Answer Session","Q - Itay Michaeli","Absolutely, so maybe we can pick it off with an overview question of you know where GM is at, obviously you laid out a pretty significant electric vehicle launch program well unto next decade. I think you\u2019ve shown that maybe two vehicles thus far in 2018, maybe just an overview of stat report of where we are at?","Pam Fletcher","Yes, thanks absolutely. So about a year ago, our CEO Mary Barra explained our vision of the future, how we see the world going forward. And we see a world of zero crashes, zero emissions, and zero congestion. And so, by putting that with the vision out there, it\u2019s been a real enabler, a real guidepost as we don\u2019t see getting to zero crashes, zero emission, zero congestion overnight by any means, but it\u2019s a great way to guide decision making everyday to get to what is ultimately our goal. And so with that, we also announced that we would be introducing 20 all new electric vehicles by 2023. And I want to talk about that just for a minute.","There are many claims like that being made, I\u2019m sure Itay you\u2019ve heard that there are many by many auto makers, but ours is very specific to electric vehicles, pure battery electric vehicles. So 20 all new battery electric vehicles by 2023 we\u2019re not talking about hybrids, we\u2019re not talking about 48 volt systems or plug-in hybrids, but pure batts.","Additionally, in China which we believe will lead the globe in electrification and electrification of volume and rollout, there is what's defined as a new energy vehicle. And a new energy vehicle can be battery electric, but it also can be a plug-in hybrid, and there's some requirements in there for range and energy etcetera. But we announced that we will be producing 10 all new NEVs new energy vehicles by 2020.","Now within the last 12 months we said we would do it in 2018, but within the last 12 months, we've introduced the first two of our 20 by 23. The first is the Baojun E200 is the second generation vehicle by Baojun. In addition, the Buick Velite 6 EV, both of those products are targeted for the China market, so we are anxious to talk about the remaining 18 but in a matter of time we have to say something for later, so but those are the first two and we\u2019ve have a lot of work going on in the space and can't wait to show you more as it evolves.","There are many fronts involved in -- electrification that we feel are important for stakeholders to play a role and stakeholders obviously includes ourselves as well as others. We have recently talked about charging an infrastructure. We just announced our participation in a Department of Transportation projects we are doing in conjunction with Delta Electronics to explore ultra -- ultrafast charging. So at 400 kilowatts, the goal being to bring about 180 miles of range on board the car in 10 minutes, so we think that is important work, as well as the rollout of infrastructure and the availability of infrastructure itself.","We\u2019ve recently increased our Volt EV capacity by 20%. We\u2019ve built all of our Volt EVs for the globe. I mean our Orion Michigan plant and we\u2019ve increased that capacity by 20%. Our battery supplier LG is just opening a brand-new battery plant to supply battery packs for that additional capacity and there's many other things that I\u2019m sure will come out in some of the questions, but that\u2019s a big picture overview of what we\u2019re doing in the future that we see ahead.","Itay Michaeli","Perfect. Thanks for the overview. Maybe we\u2019ll kick off like in the near term and then we\u2019ll go into the future outlooks. And maybe you mentioned the Volt EV, how that\u2019s doing versus expectations and can you talk about the capacity increase and what drove that as well as you know where you're seeing, how the vehicle is particularly performing in places like California, are you conquesting [ph] maybe to just highlight the proceeding?","Pam Fletcher","Yes, the Volt EV had a very specific mission. It had a very specific mission, and that mission was to provide an affordable long-range battery electric vehicle. So we, at General Motors do believe that there is a tipping point for electrification. Obviously I\u2019d like to be able to answer exactly when, but instead of being passive in that activity, we want to be active and try and driving the tipping point. So getting cars like the Chevrolet Volt out there, which is the highest selling plug-in vehicle and getting the Volts EV out there to provide affordable long-range battery electric vehicle to the mainstream segment, we saw is very important.","If we look at non-luxury battery electric vehicles in the marketplace in the U.S. today, we have about 44% market share, and we\u2019re very happy about that. We see demand increasing in markets that we\u2019re already in, and we seen new markets around the globe that we didn't originally plan to have evolved in, I'm asking for it. And so we\u2019ll be announcing some of those additional markets here in the not too distant future.","Itay Michaeli","And how are you finding, one of the push backs on GM EV story is the dealer receptivity. You know where dealers want to sell these vehicles and how is that going? I mean and is that changing or is it an issue\u2026.","Pam Fletcher","Yes, so our Volts are available. It is a global vehicle, I guess we\u2019re in the U.S. here, so I\u2019ll give a bit more of a U.S. perspective. Available across the U.S. there are thousand dealers that are trained and authorized to sell the Volts. You know it's availability and access to service we think are very good for the customer and helpful for a customer to know that security of someone\u2019s around the corner, likely able to help them with their Volt and we continue to up the volume and we\u2019re really happy about that.","Itay Michaeli","Okay. And then \u2013 one more kind of the Volt in the near term. As we look at some of the other EV competitor of course the model 3 [ph] comes to mind and the others are out there. As you benchmark GM today, whether it\u2019s the Volt or vehicles you are going to launch, how would you rank them internally your sales with others in terms of your branding technology costs and overall capability and incoming, what are the areas where you think you look strong relative to some of the other vehicles or maybe other areas we think maybe have some room to improve?","Pam Fletcher","Yes, so we\u2019ve been in a marketplace since December of 2016, it\u2019s almost two years with the Volt EV. We launched over 238 miles of range. We\u2019ve delivered the vehicles we thought. We\u2019ve had terrific feedback from our customers. We have over 3.2 billions, so [Indiscernible] billion electric miles travelled by our customers in GM Vehicles. So those are Volt or electric miles as well as the Chevy Bolt EV or electric miles.","So that\u2019s been just a great pathway as we have built all the building blocks needed to really be successful at that tipping point. It\u2019s a great pathway to get experience early to learn what\u2019s important to customers, to learn what\u2019s not important to customers and so we can get laser focused on what\u2019s the right path forward as battery electric vehicles become a more predominant part of the auto segment.","Itay Michaeli","And then maybe we could talk about kind of the outlook in the future as you have plans for 2023 and you have even put out some volume targets for EVs out to 2026 and how you are thinking about \u201cRight Segments\u201d are?","Pam Fletcher","Great question. So I won\u2019t repeat some of what I just said about the purpose of the Volt. But if you remember the affordability point, and the affordability of a long-range bandwidth our number one emission, we really wanted to allow people to experience advanced technology that may not have been able to afford it for a number of subsequent generations of vehicles. And so that again is part of us creating the tipping point.","Now, at the time when we would have been engineering. I mean, I just thought it would have been in the market almost 2 years already with the Volt. At the time that we would have been engineering that, and we were looking at the cost of -- the cost of electrification, particularly the battery and the range that we wanted to provide, we really had to strike that balance of the vehicle configuration with the energy on board. And so you see the Bolt as a B-segment hatchback vehicle. We have a lot of positive feedback from those customers.","If you look at that the B-segment in the U.S. in general, that\u2019s certainly not the largest segment by any means. But another thing I mentioned a minute ago was the building blocks that we've been at. So I've been at this a while, 13 years we have a team that's many of which have participated along most of that way, as well. And starting back with two mode hybrid trucks, new trucks on a new idea, we started forming the building blocks of what it would take to be successful. We built the electronic, we\u2019ve got the controls for motors, so motor control we do in-house. All the control of the inverters, the battery state estimator, going into Gen 1 Volts having this what we thought at the time was a big battery 16 kilowatt hour battery and how you test it, how do you know if it's good.","And so we went and we built our own battery lab. Today it happens to be the largest in the U.S. We just announced an expansion of it to a 100,000 [ph] square feet. We had to build all the test protocols. What are the right duty cycles to use, etcetera. And so I could go on and on as you can tell. But we have built, we have put these building blocks in place, accumulated this over 3 billion miles and so now we feel fully prepared for success as EV start to ramp.","We know that EV customers frankly are not are much alike to conventional vehicle customers. Everybody doesn't like the same thing. In the past it\u2019s sort of been a little bit of a one-size-fits-all in EV space, and we know that\u2019s not the way forward. And so in fact, if you\u2019ll bear with me, there\u2019s a China run show here, and can we go to that please. And before I show you, these are our forward-looking statements as I'm going to tell you some forward-looking information and I could go on about this for but I won't, but this depicts our future EV architecture and we have talked about this publicly in the past.","And so, one of the first things you should notice are there are a multitude of different vehicle configurations on that. So when we talk about this, we talk about multi use. So multi use gets at you see large SUVs, you see compact SUVs, you see on CUVs, you see low Roofs Sedans, you see vehicles into the commercial space.","And so we know one size doesn't fit all, and so with all the building blocks in place we believe we are well-positioned to take this on. And so this future architecture, I want to give you a few highlights and I hope, I can make it clear and simple and quick.","In designing new architecture, you really want to place the center of a \u2013 you want to center it around the high volume entries. And so you can see in the middle of this, our mainstream compact SUV and also a Lux 3 SUV and we believe those to be the high volume segments in the timeframe that this architectural will be mostly in the market.","Once we establish the capability, once we capitalize on this architecture, and I guess before there on the next comment, part of the architecture is not only the underpinnings of the vehicle, but it's also the propulsion system. And so the idea here is a very modular propulsion system with a minimal number of drive units, one battery module, think of a battery module. I just used this as a descriptor, as a local brand, battery cells are like a slice of bread, battery module. So you can take the building blocks of the propulsion system and create very different vehicles. You know maybe that compact SUV is a front wheel drive vehicle, maybe that Lux 3 SUV is a rear wheel drive.","Maybe you put a drive unit on the front of that Lux SUV and all of a sudden, it\u2019s a performance all-wheel-drive. Maybe you put different numbers of modules in those battery packs and so you can offer customers a choice of range, instead of just one range per vehicle. And so those are just some examples of how you can take what's largely some of the most expensive componentry in the vehicle, modulize it, or get very different results for the customer, because the customer in each of those segments has a different priority, a different importance.","Once we capitalize that centroid, to do the additional entries that are of these varying use around on the left side of the charts. I'm sorry for those on the on the webcast this is a basically concentric circles with these compact SUVs and luxury SUVs in the center. Now I'm talking about architectural derivatives that go from large SUVs to clear small SUVs and a number of things in between that I articulated a few minutes ago.","So once you capitalize that architecture, the ability to get the derivatives now becomes a much lesser engineering task, a much lesser capitalization. Also, we established architectural bandwidth that let us get into vehicles that have yet again, different used cases by possibly like commercial vehicle, by possibly shared autonomous vehicle or even lower vehicles, a lower Sedan maybe an expressive low-slung performance Luxury Sedan.","And so I hope that you get from this, the idea of we see customers having very different needs. We intend to provide vehicles to meet varying different needs, but in a very smart way with capital deployed very efficiently, and which I would call reuse very efficiently, reusing it across, across multiple vehicles, but then providing the utility people need in different segments, so I hope that makes sense.","Itay Michaeli","Yes absolutely. And if there are any questions, feel free to raise them. But I do want to ask one and it\u2019s the ones I guess segment of vehicle we don\u2019t see here as a full size pick up pickup truck. But what are your thoughts on an EV pickup in the future, what you know is there a different rationale for a pickup truck in terms of a used case relative to EV, is it just a matter of time or cost and how you are thinking about that? Or is it probably LCV calculator.","Pam Fletcher","So we haven't talked specifically about pickups and electrification. I mentioned more than a decade ago in Denver, where we had hybrid pickups. So we have experienced there. I\u2019m not \u2013 I don\u2019t have anything to say here about pickups in this particular timeframe.","Itay Michaeli","Okay, open to your questions.","Unidentified Analyst","[Indiscernible] profile longer-term with all this different segments being electrified versus the [Indiscernible] engines vehicles where you traditionally never made consistent volume?","Pam Fletcher","So you know the path to profitability includes some technology, but it includes a lot of scale. And so we are a global company with playing an electrification in two of the biggest markets in the world, so driving scale that way. Driving scale through this reuse that I just discussed is a huge lever to profitability.","Just a few weeks ago we had an announcement where Honda has partnered with us in this battery cell and module strategy that I described a few minutes ago. So there we are you bringing together two global automakers to dry scale globally around what is essentially the most expensive components in these types of vehicles.","And so with that our intention is absolutely for this to be a profitable platform and in line with our long-term plan productions.","Unidentified Analyst","[Indiscernible] internal combustion within \u2013 2025 in efficient in terms of the business strategy. Does this mean hydrogen is left behind or is there a hydrogen strategy as well?","Pam Fletcher","So we consider hydrogen an absolutely a contributor to our zero emission strategy. And we had an EV day about a year ago, so we introduced, we talked about hydrogen. We show, we have a number of projects going right now with the military, with a unique architecture dedicated for deployments into military application. So we do consider hydrogen part of zero emissions of future. You asked me about internal combustion engines. You know being a global company, serving a full line manufacture, there is a role for combustion engines for a long long time into the future, but we also believe that there is -- there is a building interest and need around electrification and a tipping point coming to the extent where our largely single entry or when entry at a time approach is it going to serve that demand. And so the gentleman that asked the prior question, you know what's different is you know we\u2019ve taken the second-generation Volt is a great example where the propulsion system there drilled a \u2013 dredged the Volt as an extended range of electric vehicle. It's able to with very little change create the Malibu Hybrid, which is a great, midsize efficient, affordable vehicle.","And so we\u2019ve been able to do that in the past, but we really -- if we want to help drive the tipping point and if we want to meet the demands of these EV customers, which again are not all created the same, we think the strategy that I was showing, I'm going to go is the right one.","Itay Michaeli","Will the company, Cruise \u2013 recently, Elon Musk has elaborated on custom hardware known as hardware free. He stated that Tesla developed models \u2013 works models and advanced computer on autonomous driving. So how do you see your competitive edge over Tesla?","Pam Fletcher","So, we've announced, we plan to commercialize in 2019 with an on-demand ride share network. We have four tenants, four primary tenants with autonomous. The first overwhelmingly is safety. Last year over 34,000 fatalities on U.S. roads, over 94% of those caused by human error, it doesn't take you long at those percentages to build the case for autonomous vehicles and safety.","The second one is scale. We're in autonomous to win. We want to scale. We're full on manufacture with engineering and manufacturing capability. We have acquired and partnered with Cruise for them to develop their AV software to make the car drive autonomously. We are already today producing the Bolt EV on the same assembly line as the production Bolt EV as produced. So, I guess, to get to the third, the third tenant that we have is, we want to be fully capable in a very difficult urban environment, and so if you were to go to San Francisco today you would see many Bolt driving on streets, there is that is where we are doing our aggressive development.","And last is we want a very rapid pace of development because your autonomous is in its infancy. There are many many gains to be made. We'll commercialize in 2019. We're not going to stop there. In the end this \u2013 the intention to be a global, have global capability in the autonomous ride share network, and so by way of those four tenants, by way of the ability to integrate the very agile team, our crews for developing the AV software, with our manufacturing and engineering capability in Michigan, and we think we're well-positioned to lead in that race.","Itay Michaeli","Maybe to follow-up on that question, we were just talking about before the session, few years ago when we were here we talking about the Bolt EV, and you mentioned a few times it was designed for sharing, and so maybe the talk about the advantages that AV networking have under EV and to what extent is as you look at your EV capacity you allocate to a shared AV environment via the Cruise network versus selling to consumers, how you balance that out? Or inside of GM how important is the EV in terms of the overall AV advantage that you're trying to build?","Pam Fletcher","Yes. Good question. So if you remember back to, I talked about our corporate vision, zero crashes, zero emissions, zero congestion, so EV and AV have a role in those three mandates. So we have taken a \u2013 we've created a strategy that couples electric vehicles and autonomous driving. Do those have to be coupled? Absolutely not. It's a situation we feel our case where one and one doesn't equal two, it equals five. If you think about the urbanization of the globe, the formation of mega cities, the issues that cities are going to have to deal with going forward, we think that by coupling electrification and autonomous driving together we now give cities ways to solve a multitude of problems with one solution.","And so, when you can put a vehicle that is safe in a complex urban environments that can have controlled routing to help with congestion, that is emission free or by the way it's quieter, we think that just a start of really helping solve some of the big global problems that are coming at us.","Itay Michaeli","And then maybe as an extension to that, Pam, you talked about the tipping point. Obviously EV affordability is still a topic, an issue out there. And I think about the Maven peer-to-peer announcements and you're seeing, Maven and other companies talk about, if your consumer and you're willing to let your car be shared in peer-to-peer network, it only takes several days to pay your entire monthly payment. And one would think that with an EV that could be an advantage because A, if people want to rent out the EV for the fun-to-drive factor then I as a EV owner my have better usage of my car in that peer-to-peer network, but also because the cost of ownership is lower then maybe you can charge less. I can put my Bolt EV on the Maven network perhaps for less and maybe be able to therefore, move revenue. How integral that is as a share?","And its also reminds me of ask a long question about Mary's comments and I guess maybe some effort to GM to get maybe regulatory credits for EV miles driven. Could that be part of a solution where if you have a peer-to-peer network to supplement the whole proposition of selling somebody in EV in terms of cost offsets and maybe generating credits for company because of miles usage, how important those two together?","Pam Fletcher","Yes. So, Maven, there's a number of really great proof points around Maven, Maven has a number of offerings you talked about peer-to-peer. They have Maven city, which offers vehicle rentals in city locations. We also have Maven Gig and I want to talk about that for a second. That is where Maven does short term leases to consumers that want to participate in the Gig economy, that want to operate their own ride-share service essentially.","Some great statistic around that, just in Maven Gig our customers in Bolt have traveled more than 20 million miles and it hasn't been operational that long. Its also given rides to over a quarter million people that would never have been exposed to EV or to Bolt. That's hugely important, because if one of your questions to me might be which is some of the biggest challenges with EV, awareness and adoption is absolutely at the top of the list. We have a lot of data that shows most people aren't even aware of EV. We're talking about detailed questions here, but the general population, there's a lot of work to do around awareness. So Maven Gig has been a great tool to increase awareness.","We see Bolt and the Maven Gig fleet. They travel the most miles per day of any other vehicle in the Gig fleet. We had Equinoxes. We have Cruises. We have Malibu. The Bolt EV travels the most miles. So this idea of limitations with an EV on a daily basis just isn't proving to be true. The Bolt has turned out to be the most popular vehicle in Maven Gig. So some really great proof points from awareness to validating, use cases and the usability of the car in service.","Peer-to-peer coming more exactly to your point, Itay, its enthusiasm, it helps with awareness and all that is just great for again increasing overall adoption. The idea of EV miles travel we believe is real. You have cars that have shared usage where you probably displacing a number of maybe internal combustion engine vehicles, the usage of that one shared vehicle. In this case we're talking about Bolt EVs. We think these places, the use of more than one conventionally powered vehicle. And there should be \u2013 and there could be strategies around gaining the benefits of that, so people are really motivated for all the goodness that EVs can bring.","Itay Michaeli","And then, as you think about go back the tipping point and the growth in EV, how is GM approaching the supply chain both through kind of ensure and adequate supply of raw materials and just efficient partnerships throughout that if we do start to see even more demand the next several years that you're there and you can sort of run that path and lever up?","Pam Fletcher","Yes. So, a multi-pronged response to that. In a number of our critical or EV unique areas, we have -- we are fully integrated. We've created the ability to design, develop and manufacture. Electric motors would be an example of that. Now with each program we do go through or make buy decision. And we you choose to buy, frankly the fact that we have the ability to engineer ourselves, manufacturers ourselves makes us better buyers. Our drive units, we have the capability to make those and we do make many of them. Battery packs, we design, develop manufacture of battery packs. We also do make buy decision around those. We also do that with drive entity [ph]. No, I didn't mention it earlier.","Battery cells at this moment in time we purchase battery cells, we have a multi-pronged approach around batteries. If you think about the internal combustion engine we've been developing that for over 100 years and there are still breakthroughs coming along. Some batteries are at their infancy. So we have partnerships with great suppliers. We have in-house research and development efforts. We have investments in startups. We have investments in other established engineering activities. And so there will be a long roadmap, a long technology roadmap to get our performance life costs on batteries and there is -- to us there is no one silver bullet. Its going to take a multitude of activities and that's exactly what we have in place.","Itay Michaeli","And maybe to the prior projection that can be provided on battery costs. How is that progressing thus far relative to those expectations? And it was too hard to estimate a tipping point, but as you look at your projection and volume. When you think sort of EVs do become in the U.S. like you said maybe we can go around the world, real stick our price parity or cost of ownership parity with ICE as you kind of really think about, at this cost level you really begin to see some of that inflection?","Pam Fletcher","Well, I think, everything we do has the customer at the center. So when we start talking about cost of the customer, it really needs to be what value, what value is the vehicle provided. Its certainly a lot more history around internal combustion engine pricing and there is around EVs. But I would tell you that the architecture that I describe which is part of the 20x20 \u2013 20 EVs by 2023, that is our profitable platform. We have articulated in the past that we had about $145 per kilowatt hour on a cell basis with Bolt EV. Our target in pathway for in the timeframe of the architecture I show is less than a $100, that's on a cell dollar per kilowatt hour basis. So I'm not here to articulate exactly what the less than 100 is, but that's the glide path that we see, and is necessary frankly for profitability.","Itay Michaeli","And going back to, I think, the earlier question on profitability, so you get to profitable EV platform and arguably, segments, maybe its not so arguable, that today you don't make money on. Is there a further financial dividend beyond that in terms of R&D or running the platforms longer or the vehicles potentially lasting longer even beyond that as well just given that historically with ICE there's a lot of R&D for small incremental improvements? And kind of how do you see longer term I guess profitability equation within EV?","Pam Fletcher","Again, this space is so early, I think for us to be able to paint the picture up exactly what's the supply base is going to look like, the vertical integration look like, the cost structure, it is way too early. We're in year, what 10 [ph] at the most in this space and again over 100 years with the internal combustion engine. So, I've articulate a lot of what we're doing now, what we're going to do in the near term but we're not stopping. I mean we think this is electrified vehicles and propulsion are big part of the future and General Motors future and we're going to \u2013 we've already put a lot of building blocks and space and we're going to continue that.","Itay Michaeli","The question in the back.","Unidentified Analyst","I recognize this is a tech forum and your specialty's electric vehicles, but considering that you are an employee of GM, I did want to ask you question about downside if I could and if can't answer, that's fine, but Chuck Stevens had given a presentation at an industry event a couple of years ago and had this pretty kind of elaborate downside projection in terms of how GM would deal with a moderate-sized downturn in the SAAR, and a lot changed since you gave that presentation. And I want to say if you or anyone else in the room part of GM that could kind of update that downside scenario and just kind of tell us what the thoughts are in terms of where we are on the cycle. What happens when it eventually does rollover?","Pam Fletcher","Yes. So I know we've communicated on that topic, I personally not going to comment on that topic, so just because that's not my -- I'm not the most poised person to do that.","Unidentified Analyst","[Indiscernible].","Pam Fletcher","Let's talk afterwards, if that's all right. Okay","Unidentified Analyst","I rarely ask the question that I know somebody will not answer. SoftBank put a price on Cruise [Indiscernible]? It seems to me the fear EV is at least more considerably more valuable than Cruise as [Indiscernible] is that an incorrect way of thinking? And if its not has that value, what do you think it not reflected at all in your equity value?","Pam Fletcher","Good question. Again, I don't think I'm the right person to answer that. But what I would tell you is I think that we are poised very well, maybe almost the best at being able to take advantage of the electrification tipping point and that's exactly the position that we want to be in.","Unidentified Analyst","But in theory, electrification has significant economic value.","Pam Fletcher","I believe so, I mean, we think it\u2019s a future. We've talked about a world of zero emissions. We're not going to get to zero emissions without electrification and without hydrogen. So it\u2019s a big part of our future. And that's why we're here frankly revealing the future architecture and talking the strategy behind it, that\u2019s probably a lot more than we would typical reveal at this point in time. So, its core to us. We think it has value and the rest of that story yet to be told.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks very much.","Pam Fletcher","Thank you.","Itay Michaeli","Its a bit of follow-up to that on EV leadership. I think company has a projection about million units I think by 2026? And can you share around what is your rough market share assumption around that 2026 target? And is there internally sort of a GM market share target within the EV space?","Pam Fletcher","Yes. So I'll talk a little bit about our history in electrification. I think we've a lot of great breakthroughs and done and created some great products for consumers through two generations of Volts through the Chevy Bolt EV, but those were singular vehicle. We may have done adaptation off of them like I talked about the Malibu Hybrid is an example. But you can see we are going to a strategy of 20 all electric vehicles by 2023 to build out an architecture like I showed in the chart a moment ago to meet a multitude of consumers need. And I'm not here to project market share by any means, but you can see we're absolutely here to play in the significant way in the future of the industry.","Itay Michaeli","And what do other technologies like over-the-air updates, I think the Bolt has some of that capability fit into because of the clear sheet design of electric vehicle and even autonomous outside of the Cruise network, when you think about designing these vehicle where are some of these other facets come into play in term of\u2026?","Pam Fletcher","Yes. Over-the-air is a great topic, and in reality the Gen I Volt had over-the-air update of ability for most all of its proportion modules. That was we call at the time of sort of the awareness around cyber -- the need for cyber security was just become prevalence. Frankly it was a chose that General Motors made erring on the side of safety to not enable the technology, so over the years not a new concept. We do, do over-the-air updates today on some modules. We been public about introducing our new electrical architecture to enable total vehicle over-the-air update and so that won't just be limited to electrification, that's as our entire portfolio flips to our Next Generation electrical architecture. So I think it's convenience for the consumer, and I think its exactly what we want to do.","Itay Michaeli","Great. I think we're just about out of time. So please join me. And thanking Pam Fletcher and GM for another great discussion.","Pam Fletcher","Thank you."],"10258":["General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) Q1 2019 Earnings Conference Call April 30, 2019 10:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Rocky Gupta - Treasurer & Vice President, Investor Relations","Mary Barra - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Dhivya Suryadevara - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants","Rod Lache - Wolfe Research","Itay Michaeli - Citi","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs","Ryan Brinkman - JP Morgan","Brian Johnson - Barclays Capital","Colin Langan - UBS","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the General Motors Company First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Tuesday, April 30th, 2019.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Rocky Gupta, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations.","Rocky Gupta","Thanks Dorothy. Good morning and thank you for joining us as we review GM's financial results for the first quarter of 2019. Our press release was issued this morning and the conference call materials are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We're also broadcasting this call via webcast.","I'm joined today by Mary Barra, GM's Chairman and CEO; Dhivya Suryadevara, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO; and a number of other executives.","Before we begin, I'd like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language.","I will now turn the call over to Mary Barra.","Mary Barra","Thanks Rocky and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining. Our Q1 results are as follows; net revenue of $34.9 billion; EBIT adjusted of $2.3 billion; EBIT adjusted margin of 6.6%; EPS diluted adjusted of $1.41; our automotive adjusted free cash flow was a negative $3.9 billion; and our return on invested capital adjusted was 23.8% on a trailing four-quarter basis.","These results are in line with our outlook that we shared earlier this year. Q1 seasonality, full-size SUV production downtime, and reduced volumes in China impacted our results. We remain confident that our strong new vehicle launches and clean full-size trucks along with ongoing business transformation actions will help us deliver our full year commitment.","Let's begin with our performance in North America. We generated the highest-ever first quarter average transaction prices on the strength of our trucks, SUVs, and crossover segments. Our Truck 1 strategy is focused on maximizing profitability by first introducing a richer mix of popular high-margin models like crew cabs followed by regular and double cabs. We are selling every truck we build.","This strategy is also helping us grow share among higher priced trucks at the expense of our competitors. For example the GMC Sierra has gained four percentage points of share this year among models priced over $50,000.","In addition year-over-year Q1 average transaction prices on our all-new light-duty crew cabs were nearly $5,800 higher than our outgoing model. Our truck launch continues to be well-positioned moving forward. We expect supplies of light-duty pickups will reach an optimal mix of cab styles and trims in the second quarter.","In the second half of the year when industry truck sales are typically surging, we will introduce our 2020 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra heavy-duty pickups. These are very popular with commercial customers and they contribute to adjacent sales of our light-duty pickups.","As previously announced, to meet expected higher demand, we will increase heavy-duty capacity in Flint to build a higher mix of crew cab styles and trims that represent a strong profit growth opportunity. In addition we are on track for our upcoming full-size SUV launch with the planned downtime now behind us.","We intend to build on our truck leadership. And with that in mind I want to address media coverage of the various industry partnerships around battery electric vehicles and trucks.","As you know GM has an industry-leading truck franchise and industry-leading electrification capability. I assure you we will not feed our leadership on either front. We intend to create an all-electric future that includes a complete range of EVs including full-size pickups. And we will share additional information when competitively appropriate.","Moving on to our crossover and SUV performance. We introduced the all-new Cadillac XT6 which goes on sale later this year. We are encouraged that two-thirds of the sales of the segment-leading Cadillac XT4 are to brand-new customers to the brand. And the Chevrolet Trax and Equinox set Q1 records. The GMC Acadia achieved its best quarter ever and the Buick Enclave sales are up 28% year-over-year.","Dhivya will share more about our business transformation actions, but I want to update you on our progress toward offering relocation opportunities to employees at our unallocated plants. There are jobs available for all 2,800 impacted hourly employees and more than 1,300 have already accepted transfers to plants supporting growth segments like trucks, crossovers, and other high-demand vehicles.","This includes our next-generation Corvette where just last week we announced we will add a second shift and 400 jobs at our Bowling Green, Kentucky facility.","Moving to our international operations, In China, as we shared earlier in the year, we expected lower volumes and equity income in the quarter due to ongoing industry pressures.","We stated in January, that we believed the industry would be roughly flat. And this -- there is uncertainty because of the stimulus discussion with nothing being finalized that we believe is creating more downside than upside risk in the near-term.","We need to see the final details and how this will translate into demand for autos. But specific to General Motors we see tailwinds in the second half related to our vehicle launches. And we continue to believe we are well positioned for the long-term.","Our strong brands and partnerships and our favorable mix of new vehicles continues to be a distinct advantage. The first sedan from our new global family of vehicles, the Chevrolet Onix, went on sale two weeks ago.","It will be joined later by the Chevrolet Tracker and the Buick Encore, two new crossovers from this family. And we expect Cadillac's underlying strength in China to continue. Cadillac is updating its portfolio with a refreshed XT5 in May an all-new XT6 in July and the all-new CT5 sedan later this year.","In South America, we have been working with stakeholders to generate appropriate returns in a challenging environment. Recently, we received meaningful concessions from all stakeholders that will enable us to invest nearly $2.7 billion over the next five years at two of our facilities in Brazil.","Because we now see a viable path forward we will build future Chevrolet models at these facilities to strengthen our leading position in Brazil. These investments were contemplated in our overall capital plan.","Turning to our future mobility initiatives, this quarter we announced that we will build a second battery-electric Chevrolet model along with the Bolt EV, at our Orion Assembly facility in Michigan, creating 400 new jobs when launched.","On the self-driving vehicle front, GM Cruise while hire 1,000 employees this year, doubling its workforce as we work to safely deploy Cruise AV. So to recap the quarter, we delivered the results we expected given typical seasonality, full-size SUV downtime, and industry pressures in China.","Before I turn it over to Dhivya, I do want to recognize Barry Engle, Gerald Johnson and Julian Blissett. They all began their new roles as a part of our senior leadership team this month. And they are proven leaders that will help continue our transformation and position the company for long-term success.","Now let me turn it over Dhivya.","Dhivya Suryadevara","Thanks Mary and good morning everybody. We delivered solid results in the first quarter of 2019 in line with our expectations, as we face traditional Q1 seasonality, lower volumes in China and downtime as we prepare for the launch of our full-size SUVs.","The strong performance of our all-new Silverado and Sierra pickup trucks, and favorable impact from transformation actions offset some of these headwinds. With that, let's review the results in more detail.","As Mary mentioned we generated Q1 results of $34.9 billion in net revenue, $2.3 billion in EBIT adjusted, 6.6% margin, $1.41 in EPS-diluted adjusted and a negative $3.9 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow.","The $1.41 EPS-diluted adjusted includes a $0.31 benefit from Lyft and PSA revaluations. Excluding the impact of these items, the core automotive performance was solid and in line with our expectations. The Q1 cash burn of $3.9 billion reflects normal seasonality and is consistent with the cash flow outlook provided earlier this year.","Let's turn to North America. North America delivered EBIT adjusted of $1.9 billion and 6.9% margins despite, downtime for full-size SUVs, lower pension income, increased depreciation and commodity headwinds.","The performance of our all-new light-duty crew cabs, strong mature cost performance and savings from our transformation actions partially offset these headwinds. The launch of our light-duty Silverado and Sierra trucks has been exceptionally strong, and it contributed favorably to volume, mix and price during the quarter.","As Mary mentioned our launch strategy is focused on maximizing profitability. With our transition from old to new architectures, we released the constraint on crew cab capacity, and filled the pipelines with these high-feature high-content trucks. We're seeing strong ATPs, from the new trucks and disciplined -- incentives remain disciplined.","We're not growing our traditional cab and powertrain variants. We expect share in the lower-price segments of the markets to increase as at the mix normalizes. We see additional opportunity for upside from the heavy-duty later this year, as we launch our strongest most capable heavy-duty ever, featuring a powerful all-new Allison 10-speed automatic transmission with a Duramax diesel engine for class-leading towing capabilities. Our crossovers also performed well in the quarter, gaining market share and were a positive contributor to year-over-year profitability.","Let's move to GM International. For the first quarter, EBIT-adjusted in GMI was down $200 million year-over-year, due to lower equity income in China, partially offset by the favorable impact of restructuring actions in Korea.","China equity income for the quarter was $400 million, down $200 million year-over-year, as a result of lower industry volumes and pricing pressure, partially offset by cost efficiencies. The team in China continues to manage the business with an intense focus on cost and finding other opportunities such as growth in adjacencies to mitigate headwinds.","We have been taking actions to right-size our inventories in China, by reducing production in Q1 by almost 20% year-over-year. We continue to work on reducing inventory through production actions, as well as retail sales increasing in the second half of the year with our 20 new launches in 2019.","In South America, we continue to make progress on the turnaround of our business. We had a great franchise with leading market share and Brazil saw its best Q1 share since 2010. In working with the unions the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, suppliers and dealers in Brazil and in Argentina, we've negotiated a historic agreement that allows us to invest nearly $2.7 billion over the next five years, while reducing labor costs, indirect taxes and material costs. These negotiations coupled with continued pricing actions and the introduction of our global family of vehicles will help us move towards generating acceptable returns in this region, despite the macro volatility.","A few comments on GM Financial, Cruise and our Corp segment. GM Financial posted an all-time record quarterly revenue off $3.6 billion in the first quarter and EBT-adjusted of $400 million, as a result of portfolio growth offset by expected residual value pressures.","Cruise costs were $200 million for the quarter and will ramp up through the year as we continue our hiring. We expect to spend approximately $1 billion in the Cruise segment in 2019, up year-over-year as we increase our headcount.","Corp segment income in the first quarter was $200 million, including approximately $100 million favorable impact from PSA warrants and $300 million due to Lyft revaluation, after applying a liquidity haircut to reflect our six-month lock-up agreement. We continue to expect the underlying spend in the Corp segment to be about $1 billion in Q1 -- sorry, in 2019.","Before I close, I wanted to reiterate our outlook for the calendar year. We continue to expect strong EPS-diluted adjusted in 2019 in the range of $6.50 to $7 and adjusted automotive free cash flow in the range of $4.5 billion to $6 billion.","As I've mentioned before, we will face some headwinds, including moderately lower equity income in China, headwinds from commodities and tariffs to the tune of about $1 billion and depreciation and pension headwinds of approximately $1 billion.","Offsetting these are a number of tailwinds, including the full year benefit of our truck launch, a meaningful benefit from Cadillac XT4, Cadillac XT6 and Chevrolet Blazer and the rollout of our global family of vehicles. We also continue to expect transformational cost savings of $2 billion to $2.5 billion through 2019.","We have made significant progress to-date on the cost savings initiative. With the savings front-end loaded, we expect to achieve a significant portion of the 2019 savings starting in Q2. Our effective tax rate assumption for the year remains in the 16 to 18 percentage range.","We expect to achieve our full year free cash flow outlook through strong EBIT performance, a partial rewind of working capital through the balance of the year, as well as dividends from China and GM Financial. This team is committed to improving quality of earnings and free cash flow conversion.","Regarding the quarterly cadence in 2019, the first quarter is expected to be the weakest due to seasonality, full-size SUV downtime and lower volumes in China. In the second quarter, we will take three weeks of downtime in preparation for our heavy-duty pickup launch. By the full year, heavy-duty volumes are expected to be flat year-over-year as we took a similar amount of downtime last year in the third quarter.","As we take additional inventory actions in China in Q2, we expect equity income to be sequentially weaker. As we cycle past the downtime in North America and actions to address inventory in China, we expect the second half of the year to be meaningfully stronger, both from an EBIT as well as free cash flow perspective. In summary, we had solid performance in Q1 and it sets us up well for strong performance for the rest of the year.","That concludes our opening comments, and we'll now move to Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research.","Rod Lache","Good morning, everybody.","A \u2013 Mary Barra","Good morning.","Rod Lache","I just had a couple of questions. One is on China. On your Q4 call, you mentioned that Q1 would be similar to Q4 as you worked on inventory. It's obviously a little bit better. But now you're talking about that inventory correction continuing into Q2 and it's sequentially weaker. I was hoping you might be able to give us some parameters or brackets around how we should be expecting the year to look and what's the magnitude of these adjustments if you were not to be correcting inventory. What's sort of the underlying profitability of the business?","A \u2013 Mary Barra","Well, Rod. This is Mary. I think you, I mean, what I mentioned it's really key that we get some stability from all of the stimulus measures. Because what's happening right now is you see a lot of volatility. There's something talked about. It doesn't get finalized. That's creating a lot of uncertainty for customers. So we're looking for that volatility to get resolved and for decisions to be made because we think that's holding back volume. There are some I'll say green shoots in China that we're observing.","And then second part is -- what's GM-specific is we have a number of I think very important launches coming in the second part of the year. And some of them even started in Q2. So it's hard for General Motors to put a bracket around it when it's an industry issue around giving the consumer confidence of what to expect from a stimulus perspective.","Dhivya Suryadevara ","And if I could add a data point, Rod. In Q4 typically, we do have a higher level of launch costs. So you saw that in Q4 of 2018, we were impacted by about $100 million additional launch costs. So stripping that out in Q1 and we did take production actions of 20% year-over-year there is still as Mary mentioned work yet to do from an inventory rightsizing perspective. And we do see a path to making progress there in Q2 this year. And the rest of the year will be driven by launches as Mary mentioned.","Rod Lache","Okay. Excluding the inventory correction I mean was there an inventory correction that occurred during Q1? So would the underlying profitability be better excluding that?","Dhivya Suryadevara","We had flat inventory -- dealer inventory flattish at the end of Q4 of 2018 versus Q1 of 2019. And yes, there were actions that were taken to address it production actions so the 20% that I mentioned. And because of the volatility that we have seen in China there is yet more work to do beyond what we did in Q1.","Rod Lache","Can you just switch to the pickup truck rollout? At one point you talked about a $2 billion revenue upside and some new platform, was wondering if that's still the case. There's obviously been a bit of volatility on your market share performance since you've been transitioning now with a pretty low inventory so far in the regular and double cabs. What's the status of that objective?","Dhivya Suryadevara ","Yes. So if you think back at the $2 billion there were a few points we made at that time. Firstly, the crew cab capacity in our K2 was constrained and we were running at below-industry averages from a crew cab perspective. And with the T1 architecture, we were able to release that constraint, so that we were able to increase our penetration from a crew cab standpoint by over 10 percentage points. So that was a huge driver as we talked about the revenue opportunity. We're very much in line from the additional revenue opportunity in crew cab mix. And frankly you're seeing that flow through in Q4 of 2018 and Q1 of 2019 as well as that's helped us offset some of the headwinds that we are seeing.","In addition to that Rod, we do have capacity increases in T1 versus K2 that we had already built in. And from the light-duty standpoint we were able to increase capacity by a few couple of tens of thousands units and that drove tailwinds as well that was factored into the revenue opportunity of $2 billion. So between the crew cab mix and the additional capacity we are on track for the $2 billion revenue opportunity.","Rod Lache","Great. And just one last quick one, you gave a range of $4.5 billion to $6 billion free cash flow. It's a pretty broad range. Whatever happens in China obviously wouldn't affect that this year since the dividends would come in next year from this. So how do you see that evolving? What are the factors that would drive upside or the high end or the low end of that forecast?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yeah. I'd say two things. Obviously part of that is driven by the fact that we have an EPS range of $6.50 to $7. So there's the natural earnings range that comes with that. And in addition to that as you well know Rod it's a working capital-intensive business and we have $300 billion of commercial flows in and out happening every single year. And depending on production timing and of downtime actions that we're taking typically that tends to drive volatility in working capital. So I would say, its earnings-driven range plus the working capital seasonality that typically drives the cash flow range.","Rod Lache","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi.","Itay Michaeli","Great. Thank you. Good morning. Just can you tell us what \u2013 this was on slide 16 on the GMNA walk. This quarter I noticed that the material majors of the cost offset the majors for pricing. I think the last few quarters you were positive on that. Can you talk about the twin factors there and how you think about that relationship in the next few quarters?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yeah. So the material on majors and the pricing on majors were typically on the light-duty truck front. And as you take a step back and look at overall K2 versus overall T1 profitability we are able to command a lot more price from a light-duty T1 perspective compared to K2s. Mary mentioned our crew cab ATPs for instance are higher significantly year-over-year. And obviously there's content that's added in the vehicle.","But from a life-cycle-to-life-cycle average perspective Itay that's how I would think about it in sort of quarter-to-quarter noise. I would say that were comparable from an EBIT standpoint for these trucks on a like-for-like truck basis. Obviously, there's upside coming from the mix and the volume that I talked about.","But I would say that, the data point in one quarter is generally not indicative. It will get better between Q2 and Q4. The way to think about it is a higher variable profit perhaps offset by some of D&A leading to flat EBIT between the two trucks on a truck-to-truck basis through the life cycle of the entire truck.","Itay Michaeli","That's very helpful. Thanks, Dhivya. And then just second question just on Cruise AV. Just how was progress in the first quarter relative to your expectation in the previous timetable for Cruise to try to deploy it by the end of the year? Just love to get an update there.","Mary Barra","Sure. First I think we have to step back. We are very pleased with our position and we look at this as the greatest engineering challenge of our lifetime. You look at the societal benefits that will happen when we unlock this not to mention the multitrillion-dollar market potential. I think our approach in the way that we are doing this from a fully integrated perspective and really the only one attacking this and doing it that way and then the continued improvement in our rate of iteration, when I look at it I wouldn't trade our position with anyone else. We have set aggressive goals for the team to motivate them to work in a \u2013 as fast as possible and I think we've made remarkable progress to date. So we expect to maintain the leadership position we're in now. And we will be gated by safety. Safety will be the priority. And that's how we're looking at this.","Itay Michaeli","That's very helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John Murphy","Good morning, everybody. Just a first question on the outlook of $6.50 to $7 because I think there's some confusion in the market. And if we think about that range it excludes any revaluation from Lyft or the PSA warrants. Is that correct? Meaning on a year-over-year basis you would assume those as zero in that $6.50 to $7 range. Because I think there's some people that will think or looking at this as potential guide down with that $0.31 included. Is that correct?","Dhivya Suryadevara","That is correct. There is 0 in terms of profits or revaluation tailwinds that we're assuming in our $6.50 to $7 outlook. That's core operating performance if you will.","John Murphy","Got it. Okay. And then just a second question and I apologize to ask a simple cadence question. But if we look at the $1.10 operating EPS in the first quarter -- or if you normally seasonalize it, it would kind of get you in roughly $5 to $6 range, but if we think about the incremental product that's launching given that will create some upside. But specifically on the cost saves the $2.5 billion would be about $1.75 a year. If we think about three quarters of that that's $1.30 and that kind of gets us into the range quickly. I'm just trying to understand how much of the cost saves you think you'll realize of that $2.5 billion on a run rate basis in the second, third and fourth quarter, and if there was essentially nothing in the first quarter?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Sure. So in the first quarter in our performance\/timing line item in our bridge, we pointed out that there was $1 billion favorable. Within that I would say, John, roughly about $400 million worth of transformational cost savings that flowed through in Q1.","To your point, we do anticipate those ramping up more in Q2, Q3 and Q4. So call it $400 million in Q1 and then getting to the run rate of $2.25 billion, $2 billion to $2.5 billion that I'd outlined in January. We remain on track for that. And since it's front-end loaded the run rate number is pretty close to what you'll end up achieving in the calendar year as well.","But taking a step back on your question on earnings cadence, there's a number of factors that are driving H2 performance being stronger than H1 performance. Importantly, if you think about the downtime we already took 23,000 units for full-size SUVs in Q1.","And the HD downtime that I talked about in Q2, that we're expecting you're going to see that reverse itself. Obviously, we're not going to have SUV downtime for the rest of the year. And once the heavy duty downtime is taken, we're still expecting flat number of units for the whole calendar year, which means H2 truck production will be higher than H1 truck production. And that's what's in our forecast. So that's an important factor as you think about cadence.","When you put that together with the transformational cost actions that are ramping up more in Q2, Q3 and Q4 and the launches that I mentioned from an XT6 perspective as well as Blazer those are all acting as tailwinds. And that's -- Q1 was very much in plan. And the guidance of $6.50 to $7 bakes in this cadence that I talked about which is driven by very specific action items that we have laid out that gives us confidence in our ability to achieve that. Hopefully, that's helpful.","John Murphy","That's very helpful. And then just two quick ones or one I think you meant, but I\u2019d be so quick. But the positioning in HD currently with the current capacity, I mean, I was just wondering if you could sort of dimension sort of where you think you are in positioning and what the capacity currently is and where that is going in the second half of the year. Just maybe in some kind of numbers whether it be the capacity numbers or ATPs that you think you might be able to achieve or the step-up in ATPs just so we can understand the change in the HD business.","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yes. Between T1 and K2, we added some light-duty capacity and some heavy-duty capacity. Frankly, we're more constrained from an HD perspective than we were LDs. So we added about 40,000 units for HD and 20,000 units from an LD perspective. From -- this is comparing T1 to K2.","Transaction prices obviously, typically, when -- this early in the launch you will see a lift in transaction prices and we do expect that. And from the perspective of the vehicle itself as we mentioned, we believe it's going to be exceptionally strong. And we think there's significant benefit from a transaction price perspective that will just come from the -- just the quality of the truck.","John Murphy","And just really lastly quickly. GM Financial dividend what's your expectation for this year and where do you think that goes?","Dhivya Suryadevara","The current expectation is flat GM Financial dividend year-over-year. You may recall we got $375 million last year baked into our outlook of flat expectations. We're going to have to see from a leverage standpoint and their earning assets and residual value how they pan out to see if there's any upside to that. But as of now our outlook is $375 million.","John Murphy","Great. Thank you very much.","Rocky Gupta ","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.","Adam Jonas","Thanks everybody. First question is on trucks. Clearly, a very, very strong full-size and HD truck environment. I mean we're hearing from you and many of your competitors that demand has outstripped supply. I guess looking ahead do you think -- as you look on your own supply versus demand footprint and then your competitors, how much better can this get? It strikes many on this call that maybe this is peak truck. I don't know if you subscribe to that and whether you can kind of hold the peak truck or whether you genuinely think know there is significant room for this industry to go in terms of pushing the mix in ATPs further moving into 2020.","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yes, Adam it's Dhivya. I will take a shot at that. You have heard us talk about how we believe that the truck market is quite different when you look at that versus the overall store. We have cited reasons like how the installed base is growing, the average age of the truck is growing at a faster pace than the average age of the overall light vehicle market. We do see a distinct data point in our use cases where customers are using it for commercial as well as personal purposes.","And the fundamentals point to continuing strength from a truck perspective. The penetration are based at about 13% of the overall industry and you've seen that sort of flat over the last several years. And we are overall bullish because of the fundamentals that I mentioned from a truck standpoint. And within that, you've heard us talk about our own positioning as well and we're -- with the new launches we're very bullish on our T1 franchise.","Adam Jonas","Okay. Sounds like not peak truck. The second question on cost savings. So, if we're in an environment where global production's plateauing, China isn't the gift that keeps on giving any more let's say just for the sake of discussion that truck mix can grind higher, but it's pretty awesome.","So, maybe to get a real delta in profits you got to attack costs. And you've been very proactive at attacking structural costs the measures that you announced late last year. My question is isn't there -- can you share some examples and maybe some opportunity you have to attack content costs and your purchase bill of materials?","It strikes me -- again talking to your competitors as well that electronics costs for example and electromechanical costs around internal combustion architectures that may at the margin be antiquated are just a huge burden. I mean you talk to some of the folks in Germany 40% of their costs are electronics.","I'm not saying you're that high, but can you -- can that stop? Can you start to attack that through design and your new electric architecture to the point where you can get savings from your suppliers to pitch in instead of you doing all the hard work in the factories? So, taking all of the tweaks -- all the tweaks to arm. Thanks.","Mary Barra","Yes. Adam I think it's a really important point. And it's something we're focused on in every single region around the globe be it some of the work that we did in the first quarter in South America where the suppliers came to the party and -- but also we're working with them to make sure that we actually take cost out drive efficiencies so those cost downs are permanent.","It's a culture in China with their efficiency up cost down. And you'll see that is something that they are continuing to work on in material costs contenting. Complexity reductions are all pieces of that. We're also -- have very specific initiatives in the United States.","Looking at how do we take out cost today and do that with our suppliers instead of to our suppliers driving efficiencies, I'm really encouraged by the fact if you look at -- General Motors has really over the last several years and with the work that Steve Kiefer and his team built a very strong relationship with our suppliers.","And looking at innovation, getting them involved early in the design phase so we get their best ideas is something we are definitely driving as well as a very focused effort on complexity reduction and focus on what customers want because it's a constant battle. Because you want to give the customer exactly what they want but you want to do it in the most efficient way.","So, those are initiatives that are running across the company. We have assigned projects vice presidents responsible for it and they report out on a regular basis. So, completely agree and we're attacking it with quite a bit of energy.","Adam Jonas","I'm sure you will Mary. Thanks everybody.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.","Joseph Spak","Thanks. Good morning everyone. Dhivya thanks for the color on the transformation savings in the quarter. I just want to be clear, is that -- that excludes some of the savings also that you -- the billing that you recognized in from Korea that's recognized in GMI?","Dhivya Suryadevara","That's right. The $400 million that I'd referenced, which is embedded in our $1 billion does exclude the Korean restructuring. So the apples-to-apples, Joe that I would think about is of the $4.5 billion that we said we were going to achieve by the end of 2020. And the $2 billion to $2.5 billion that we have laid out for this year, the portion that we have achieved in Q1 is that $400 million.","Joseph Spak","Okay. So then -- and then that's the -- and then if we just look at the GMNA results where it was I think that for you was $700 million. So basically that $400 million and that $700 million is the transformation savings and that ramps as you go through the year?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yeah. There's a -- after $400 million GMNA ends up getting most of the savings. There's some that accrue to the other regions as well. And the other half of that I would say roughly is timing related. Obviously you're comparing one quarter and another quarter, and neither of which are run rate quarters. So there's some noise in there.","Joseph Spak","Right. And sorry if I missed this, but any change to the commodity outlook for the year?","Dhivya Suryadevara","We had said earlier this year that we would see $1 billion headwind from commodities and tariffs. There's a few items that are tailwinds, Joe as it relates to steel and aluminum backing up a little bit as well as delay in some of the T1 tariffs. There's also some headwinds from a palladium standpoint. And, obviously, we could see how the overall tariff environment plays out. We're still baking in the $1 billion. And as the environment changes, we will update you guys on that.","Joseph Spak","Okay. And then just quickly back to China. If we just compare versus the fourth quarter wholesales were down like 25%, but the net income margin and JV income was up. And you mentioned some of the work and I think you also mentioned maybe some benefit from some of the adjacencies. But any more detail you could provide as to what really drove that income higher despite the big sequential decline?","Mary Barra","Well, I'd say there's -- Q4 did have the launch cost that I mentioned of about $100 million. And we've taken actions to right size inventory, nothing specific to add. The adjacencies are helping as well as the cost actions that Mary mentioned. We are intensely focused on cost from a China standpoint and there's been an even more increased effort given the market environment that's happening in China. So other than that I would just say continuing to work on inventory and into Q2 and you'll see that impact in -- playing out in Q2 as well.","Joseph Spak","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs.","David Tamberrino","Yeah, great. Let's head back to North America and just talk about pickup trucks. Within that segment right now it's just -- tactically it seems like there's a lot of inventory from both yourselves and your two main competitors. And one of your competitors refreshed their product already in the first quarter. You guys were shared owners. You're refreshing your heavy-duty for the back half but they are as well. And then you'll have a third competitor with a mid-cycle refresh coming.","Just trying to wrap our heads around where the market share return is going to come for GM and just how you're thinking about your -- competing with the net market that certainly seems to have a little bit more supply.","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yeah Well, I'd just say from a share standpoint it's look we're still in the early innings from a launch perspective. And if you look at what we actually have already rolled out, its crew cabs. And as we go through the rest of Q2, we're going to see the work trucks coming in. We're going to see regular cabs, diesel as I pointed out as well as HD. And as Mary mentioned we're seeing share gains in the areas where we've already rolled out.","Crew cabs are up 20% year-over-year. Sierra has taken four percentage points of share. And I think you got to see the mix normalized before you can get insight from the noise that you're seeing during the transition.","David Tamberrino","Okay. So the point being that as you get through 2Q and maybe finish the quarter you'll have more normalized double cabs, regular cabs and then your HD launching, which is where you'll see the share gains in the back half?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yeah. I think that's a fair assumption. And, obviously, early days yet in April but we are still feeling as we're rolling out the other variants tailwinds from a share perspective.","Mary Barra","I mean we just overall, David we are seeing growth even in -- as we go into the start of the second quarter. So we're confident in the truck. And as Dhivya said when we get the full mix out there and are competing across all segments, we expect to have our rightful share.","David Tamberrino","Understood. And then on the GMF perspective, the residual values, did those come in weaker than you expected? I think you had maybe down 4% of 5% assumed for the year. Is that still the case? Or you're seeing something a little worse a little better?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Residual value for Q1 were down about 2% and we're still anticipating 4% to 5% decline in the residual values year-over-year. And if you actually look at the Q1 performance, it was in line with our expectations. You had some puts and takes. In Q1 of 2018, it's important to note we had some one-time items from a GMF standpoint. So, it's not an apples-to-apples comparison. And our -- if you look at our earning asset growth as well as our revenue growth in GMF, that's per plan. And against that you have the residual value pressures and the credit pressures that I talked about, as well as that -- you got to -- it's important to note our funding plan tends to be lumpy.","We go out in the market, raise unsecured and then the asset growth catches up to that. We did fund early on in this year and we are ahead in our unsecured plan which is also causing some headwinds from an interest -- net interest margin perspective. So you roll all that together, we see a flat year-over-year 2018 versus 2019. And you will see this normalize in the other quarters.","David Tamberrino","Okay. I got it. So even though the residual values will get worse -- or anticipated to get worse throughout the year you prefunded that interest cost headwind will be somewhat negated as you grow your balance sheet?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yeah.","David Tamberrino","Okay. And then lastly, I know you got asked about it earlier from a Cruise perspective. But is there any update on timing, update on thinking as to when we can expect maybe a little bit more of an unveil or further update? Because I don't think we've had one for maybe a year and a half now since that November Investor Day on Cruise.","Mary Barra","Yeah. I think you'll see updates later this year. And just from an overall, again, we are very pleased and -- with where we're at from a continuing rate of progress. I think many underestimate how important it is to use the deep integration that we're doing. Let me remind everybody that we have changed 40% of the components in the vehicle understanding what it takes to have true safety systems in the vehicle when you don't have a driver along with the fact that we're doing our testing in one of the most complex environments in the United States. And so when you put that together that's what gives us confidence that we've got a very strong position.","We also have a very strong safety record. I mean, I think if you look at -- one example is we have Super Cruise. And Super Cruise is a technology that is being recognized -- externally winning a lot of awards from customer feedback once they have it. They're disappointed if they don't, because it's such a great feature. And we look and we develop and we monitor to our safety standards and that's what we're going to do. If this we\u2019re able to launch without the driver we will.","But I also want to remind everybody that's just the start. There is still much more to do to take costs down from all the technologies that is in the vehicle to advance the capability of the vehicle, so it can continue to be launched in other markets to create that multitrillion-dollar market potential.","So safety will gate us. We see a huge opportunity. We think the path that we're on and the way in which we're developing this technology is critical.","David Tamberrino","Okay. Appreciate all, Dhivya. Thank you, Mary. Look forward to the update.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.","Ryan Brinkman","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Is there an update you can provide on the GM International restructuring front? When the transformation actions were announced in November, it was relayed seven plants would close. Five being in North America which were disclosed at that time, but two being I think unnamed international facilities. You've taken definitive action in Korea. China isn't the place we've really thought about you looking to reduce capacity.","So should we think about South America as the next focus of your footprint actions? And how would you say you're progressing with regards to your restructuring actions in South America? And any updated thoughts on when consolidated IO might be able to reach breakeven?","Mary Barra","So I don't have any more details to provide. I would tell you though, the plans from a GM International transformation are well underway. We just don't have anything to announce at that time but everything is still on track.","Ryan Brinkman","Okay. Thanks. And then looking at slide 16 in the appendix, can you talk about some of the factors that roll up into performance\/timing driver that was a $700 million tailwind? How should we think about the proportion of that cost tailwind that relates to structural factors like the transformation or maybe more transient timing-related factors?","Dhivya Suryadevara","I would say about half and half. If you look at it, this was GM North America, right? From a company perspective, Ryan, we had $1 billion in performance and timing. I would say, roughly $200 million of that is commercial and technical savings that we typically achieve every year from a material cost standpoint. And -- so that, I think -- you can't think of that as transient, I would say, that's continuing.","Of the remaining $800 million or so, from a company perspective, I'd say, half and half timing. Half timing and half transformational actions, benefit starting to flow through. The $700 million you're seeing in North America, you could take a bulk of what I just explained for the total company into the same dynamic, as rolling through the North America.","Ryan Brinkman","Okay. And then, just lastly, there's been a lot of pickup truck launch questions already, but maybe from a different perspective. There was increased media and investor attention during the quarter, relative to your market share in full-size trucks, with some observing that -- emphasizing profitability over volume.","It served GM North America profit very well so far. But just a question, if maybe the pricing has been perhaps too disciplined. Can you parse out some of the nuance of this launch in terms of how you're thinking about volume relative to price and if there's any sort of counterpoints you would make on the market share front relative to availability of trim levels, et cetera.","Mary Barra","Yes. I think, as you look at it, we are in transition. We're in launch and the launch is going extremely well. As we said before, we've started with a richer mix and we're seeing the performance already in crew cabs. And so, I think, you can't look at the first quarter and think that that's the performance that's going to be for the year.","As Dhivya mentioned, we'll round out the entire lineup. That will give us opportunities, as we go through the year, not to mention the opportunities in heavy-duty trucks, the opportunities in additional volumes. So we will be appropriately disciplined and respond to the market appropriately.","But we think we've got a really, really strong truck. We're just in the middle of launching all phases of it. And we're on track to our plan and we -- but we do understand where we should be from a positioning from an overall market share perspective and we're focused on that as well.","But we're going to do it in a disciplined fashion. And I think, the way we've launched this has been very well thought-through to maximize profits and make sure we have the representation that we should and be highly profitable end of the truck mix.","Ryan Brinkman","That\u2019s it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays Capital.","Brian Johnson","Hi. I have two questions; kind of a housekeeping one again on pickups for Dhivya, then a broader question for Mary. Back to the question of the 400 pricing versus 400 materials costs, is crew cab and the higher crew cab, do you put that in the mix waterfall or into the pricing waterfall?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Well, it's really both. And to the extent that we have the mix -- the percentage mix of crew cabs being higher year-over-year, you will see a benefit in the mix bucket, Brian. The reason you're not seeing that this time is, it was offset by the full-size SUV downtime that we took as well, which is negative to mix.","So mix is actually flat, but in reality it's a positive number that's being offset by the downtime dynamic that's happening. And the price aspect as well, to the extent that there's an increase in price, you'll see that in the price bucket. And you look at that in conjunction with the cost bucket to see what the material on majors was.","Brian Johnson","Okay. Thank you. And a question for Mary. I mean, we've talked over the years about the cultural change you did at GM and a greater focus on cost accountability, making sure you're in the right product and geographies to drive profit.","But one thing I do hear from investors is, if they look at GM design, broadly speaking, both the vehicles, the interiors, the advertising it just doesn't, in some people's view, have the kind of pizzazz as you might see. I don't always like going back to Tesla, but it's not lost on some of us that one of your designer Elon's created their vehicle lineup.","FILE","the advertising it just doesn't, in some people's view, have the kind of pizzazz as you might see. I don't always like going back to Tesla, but it's not lost on some of us that one of your designer Elon's created their vehicle lineup. So just, how are you thinking about the state of design overall at GM? Is it an important differentiator? Or do you think it's more important to get capable vehicles out there and kind of play it more on the profit and the cost game? And if it is more important, what would you -- what are you trying to do to kind of move it to the next level?","A \u2013 Mary Barra","I think it's incredibly important. You have to do everything to win in this market. And design is a very important piece of it. I think we have a very disciplined process where we clinic data and understand the customers in segment and what they're looking for, how they view products. Full-size truck is different than a Cadillac is different than a compact SUV like the Chevrolet Equinox. And so, we have a very rigorous process on how we develop trucks and really focus on putting the customer at the center as we do those designs.","But all aspects are critically important. I think if you -- you mentioned advertising as well. I think Cadillac is a really good example as you've seen the shift that we've made. And Steve Carlisle can do a better job of telling you, but the list that we've had with Cruise, with the right campaign has been very, very successful. And I would also say, when you look at brand building, there's been tremendous improvement across all of our brands and strengthening from the key brand metrics.","So we're focused on having beautifully designed products that people want and desire and got to have to having the right contenting, so we could have the right package and efficiency and affordability for the customer and winning the marketplace and then having advertising that breaks through. But sometimes the advertising that breaks through and is most effective with the customers isn't the one that wins all the awards.","Q \u2013 Brian Johnson","And just back to the design process. I mean you talked about discipline and focus groups. But how do you create enough room for sort of off the wall creativity and things -- the classic apple things, people didn't know they wanted until they saw it?","A \u2013 Mary Barra","Well, I think not on the design base, but on the technology base, Super Cruise is exactly that. And that's the feedback we're getting from customers. But as it relates to design, one of the interesting things Brian that we do is as we start a new product there's advanced design where almost any designer in the company can participate in putting ideas forward. And there's a process that we try to not -- even if there's a team responsible for a certain brand, certain product, but we allow every designer in the company to provide input. So that's the way we work there.","I would say another great example of innovation coming from every member of the GM team is the MultiPro Tailgate. That's part of the GMC truck. And that came through the creativity and innovation from our workforce and in our manufacturing shops. So we have an innovation process where everybody can participate. I think I've talked about in the past; we also have our own version of what I'd call the Shark Tank with Synapse where we have organized competitions that people from all over the company not necessarily in their area of work, bring in creative ideas. And then chief engineers and designers are kind of the panel and their commitment when they approve an idea is to actually put it into production. So we're working hard to capitalize on the incredible talent and innovation of the entire General Motors team. I've given you a just a couple of examples of both how it can happen and then processes we've put in place to enable it and encourage us.","Q \u2013 Brian Johnson","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS.","Q \u2013 Colin Langan","Great, thanks for taking my question. Maybe just the first, can we just recap the cadence guidance? I just want make sure all my facts are right. The second half will be stronger than the first half. Q1 is the weakest. So that means Q2 will be slightly better excluding the mark-to-market on Lyft and PSA. And I'm not sure did you give a number of the downtime of the heavy-duty? I know in Q1, it was about 25,000 SUVs. Is there a number for Q2 downtime?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yeah. So for your first question from a cadence standpoint, Q1 is the weakest. Q2 will be better than Q1. But H2, both Q3 and Q4 is stronger than Q1 and Q2, primarily driven by downtime. As you saw, we took 23,000 units in Q1 for full-size SUVs. And as you think about the second quarter from a HD standpoint, we're probably going to have roughly 25,000 units down as well.","But that will be offset by the fact that you have absence of downtime in full-size SUVs as well as absence of downtime in our light duties, which we did take a week of downtime in light duties in our Silao plant in Q1.","So putting all of that together, I'd say Colin, Q1 weakest, Q2 better than that, and H2 driven by volumes that I talked about before as well as the cost transformation actions. Both the Q3, Q4 is stronger than Q1 and Q2.","Colin Langan","Got it. And just two last quick ones. How should we think about restructuring cash impact? Will we see that later in the year? And also what is your current guidance for the market in China? If I understand I think originally you had said, it would be about flat. I mean is that still what you think?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yeah. So from a cash perspective, we're anticipating roughly $2 billion of total cash spend, and a bulk of that will be incurred in 2019. There's about $1.5 billion left to be paid yet this year, and there's a tail going into 2020 as well.","And from a China outlook standpoint, Mary addressed it. Obviously, lots of volatility given what's going on, and we're going to have to see how the stimulus and the other measures play out.","Colin Langan","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks for taking my question.","Operator","Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing remarks.","Mary Barra","Thanks, everybody. I really appreciate your participation this morning on the call. I want to close by reiterating our confidence in our full-year outlook of earnings per share of $6.50 to $7 and free cash flow between $4.5 billion and $6 billion. I think we have a track record of delivering on our commitments despite the industry macro challenges. And as Dhivya had said, this quarter was in line with our expectations.","As we move forward, we're going to continue to seize every opportunity to manage what is in our control. In the United States that means we're going to focus on flawlessly launching the next Phase, the heavy-duty full-size trucks our crossovers and our Cadillac vehicles.","We're going to work to realize the 2019 transformational cost savings that we outlined last November that are on track. And we're going to capitalize on the healthy economy in this country. Globally, we're launching an aggressive new vehicle lineup in China, and we've secured the necessary concessions to further strengthen our Chevrolet franchise in Brazil.","So while, we've done much of the foundational work to right-size the business and our portfolio, we know this transformation is far from over. And we also understand what's at stake, and more importantly, the tremendous opportunity that is ahead of us. And I really believe we have the leadership team.","We have the vision, the discipline, the technology and the commitment, and culture to create this win and to create value for our shareholders. And that's what we focus on doing every day.","So thank you very much. I appreciate your attention.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the conference call for today.

Thanks for being here. So welcome to the 2020 General Motors Capital Markets Day. Our press release, presentation and earnings material are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We\u2019re also broadcasting today\u2019s event via webcast. Before we begin, I need to take care of a couple of housekeeping items. First, safety is a top priority for us at GM so please take a moment to look at the two exit doors so in the unlikely event of an emergency, you can access them quickly.","Second, note our forward-looking statements. All the discussion today, including the Q&A, will be governed by this language. It\u2019s going to be an exciting day so let\u2019s get started.","Mary Barra","Well, welcome, everybody. I\u2019m really excited to have this opportunity to share General Motors\u2019 story today. The video you just saw captures our energy, our passion and our confidence as we transform the company and create a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion. This vision drives every team member every day. And we are really enthusiastic about the opportunity we have created to refine the future, redefine the future of personal transportation and all the possibilities that come with it.","Here\u2019s a brief overview of what we\u2019ll cover today. Mark will start and provide an update on the reinvention of the Global Product Development organization. He will also showcase some of our dramatic new launches, including Cadillac and the Escalade that was revealed last evening, and he\u2019ll give us a preview of our electric vehicle strategy.","Barry will cover our truck and full-sized SUV franchise and our 2020 launches as we\u2019re very excited to launch at the full-size SUVs from Chevrolet from GMC and from Cadillac. And Matt, President of our China operation, will cover his update and perspectives on the continuing and evolving macroeconomic situation in China as well as the measures General Motors China is taking to address them and the strong foundation we have and intend to build on because we see a long-term opportunity in China.","Now Matt arrived in the States late last week and out of an abundance of caution, he will actually \u2013 we have taped his remarks and we will show those to you and he will dial-in for the actual Q&A session. Steve Kiefer, who newly took over our GMI region, will talk about our team\u2019s plan to improve performance in our GM international markets and give an update on the early days launch of our global family of vehicles product, the GEM product we\u2019ve talked about.","And then Dan Ammann is here, CEO of Cruise, and he\u2019s going to provide an update on Cruise. He\u2019ll talk a little about the news that we shared earlier this month with our \u2013 or actually, last month, with the Cruise Origin, and then also provide a framework for how we\u2019re thinking about commercialization and how that translates into revenue and profitability.","We\u2019ll then take a break for lunch, and Dhivya will come up and she\u2019s going to review the progress toward our key financial metrics.

Our goal today is to leave you with a clear understanding of our vision and our strategy for the future and how we\u2019re operating the business. And we hope that you believe, as we do, that General Motors is uniquely positioned with all the elements to take the industry forward.","Now let me pause before we go into the content of Capital Markets Day and talk about the coronavirus. Our thoughts and our focus has been on our people and then on the business, and our thoughts go out to everyone who has been impacted by the virus. We are working closely with SAIC, our joint venture partner, as the situation is very fluid. We\u2019re focused on the health and safety of our employees, and we are taking all necessary steps to make sure they have full support and urgent access to any medical support they may need.","Our supply chain and engineering teams are working around the clock to develop and execute contingency plans, and we are doing everything possible to mitigate the impact of the virus. Again, it\u2019s a very fluid situation. As we learn more, we will provide updates. So now if we move back to the Capital Markets Day, let\u2019s go back to last year\u2019s Capital Markets Day.","There, we had recently made announcements for \u2013 and shared the major business transformation in November of the year prior, a transformation that was designed to strengthen our business. The cost savings from that transformation helped us mitigate the effects in 2019 of an increasingly volatile global business environment, including reduced volumes in two of our \u2013 our two largest markets, China and the United States, as well as the work stoppage in the United States.","The team has been working hard to restore lost production while ensuring our inventory is aligned to market demand, and Dhivya will speak on how we continue to not only realize the savings from the transformation but also how we\u2019re looking at production and the ability to recover. In addition, as part of our transformation though, we were working to realign the workforce and our resources with our strategic priorities for the future.","We have streamlined our vehicle portfolio to recognize customers\u2019 overwhelming preference for SUVs, for trucks and for crossovers. We are also investing heavily in the technology and innovation that will help us realize our vision. I truly believe that 2020 is the year when all of our work comes together and we move forward with integrated solutions that will be the groundwork for reinventing how we deliver mobility to our customers. There are \u2013 there\u2019s ample evidence today that our customers are increasingly buying products and services from companies and brands they identify as improving their lives and improving the sustainability of the planet. They want companies to integrate environmental stewardship and sustainability into every aspect of the business.","And it\u2019s a business imperative because it\u2019s a priority for our customers. It\u2019s also a priority for our employees, and it\u2019s a priority for you, many of our investors and we believe the right thing to do. As we compete for the best talent, our employees or our prospective employees are telling us, they want to work for a company that does the right thing, that shares their values and supports their desire to make the world a better place, all of that in addition to making sure that it\u2019s a rewarding career opportunity and there\u2019s growth potential.","Now our belief in the science of climate change drives our commitment to create a zero emissions future. So while you\u2019ll hear a lot today about our vision and the progress we are making to achieve it, we know we have more work to do today to reduce the environmental impact of our operations and of our products. There is excellent work going on across the company, and we are integrating and accelerating that work because we believe it\u2019s critical to the future, and we believe we have a responsibility to aggressively pursue it.","So we are establishing a new set of key goals, and today, we are publicly committing to meet even more ambitious targets as we move forward. We will source 100% of our global electricity from renewables by 2040. This is a full decade ahead of the commitment we had previously made. Now we finished 2019 with 23 sites completely powered by renewable energy.","By the end of 2021, we\u2019ll grow that to more than 28 sites, including our Global Tech Center and the Renaissance Center where our headquarters is at. By 2030, we \u2013 all of our U.S. facilities will be 100% powered by renewable energy, and by 2025, we expect 60% \u2013 to be 60% of the way toward our 100% goal from a global perspective. And while the issue of doing \u2013 what to do with end-of-life batteries is a subject of much debate and concern, GM has been very proactive on this front. GM already enables 100% reuse or recycling of our batteries, and we will continue to engineer our EV batteries for full reuse or recyclability, and we believe they have long-term value and therefore are an asset.","In partnership with our suppliers, we will also increase the percentage of automotive parts with sustainable material content. We\u2019ve established sustainable material target of at least 50% by 2030 for all of our vehicles. And by mass, we already enabled more than 85% reuse or recycling of our current vehicles at the end of their life. And by increasing the sustainable content, we think we\u2019ll get even closer to achieving a circular economy.","To accomplish these goals and develop a more aligned and holistic plan, we have recently named Dane Parker to be our Chief Sustainability Officer and to lead our sustainability office. And this is a team that will work cross-functionally to one, ensure responsible consumption and production of materials; to lead the strategic design and implementation of our EV infrastructure; and also engage internal and external stakeholders to achieve our vision of a zero emission future.","We\u2019ll continue to advocate for policies that are aligned with our vision. Because we believe climate change is real, it\u2019s a global concern and the best way to remove automotive ambitions from the environmental equation is an all-electric zero emissions future, and it needs to be done on a national level and then a global level. We believe that the National Zero Emissions Vehicle program that we have proposed across all 50 states will help accelerate the transition to EVs and all of the benefits that come to the environment and to society.","It would also position the United States as a leader in electrification. It would create economic growth and make EVs more affordable for more customers more quickly. If we want true electrification across the country, which we do, we need the infrastructure, the education and the incentive programs to all align and work together. We strongly believe that focusing on interim technologies such as hybrids and multiple solutions for multiple states actually slows the adoption of full battery electric vehicles.","Now my commitment and General Motors\u2019 commitment has always been that we\u2019re going to do the right thing even when it\u2019s hard, and I am more convinced than ever that we need one national standard on which all parties can respectfully agree and that will benefit all. We\u2019ve really frankly got to get past the politics and do what\u2019s right because we\u2019re talking about a fundamental shift in transportation as we know it.","Now General Motors will continue to have conversations with both California and the federal government so we can speed EV adoption and be ready for customers with the electric vehicles they\u2019re looking for, whether it\u2019s a Chevrolet Bolt EV or a GMC HUMMER EV or frankly, anything in between. By taking these steps and pushing for real dialogue to resolve the underlying issues, we believe we can accelerate EV adoption and lessen the impact of our operations.","But as we look today and as customers continue to choose crossovers, SUVs and trucks, we are also working to ensure these vehicles are as efficient as possible, using 3D printing, parts consolidation, improving aerodynamics and the use of lighter materials. For example, we have removed an average of 350 pounds from each architecture for our new vehicle launches. This has reduced carbon emissions by about 312 metric tons per year, and it demonstrates the strides towards zero emissions will also come from our traditional vehicle lineup.","So while EVs and AVs are key elements in our vision, our work is already underway with our current product portfolio and pipeline. And let\u2019s talk about safety for a minute. Our active safety features are effective, proven technologies that our customers can buy today, and they are also an important step on the road to a world with zero crashes. Last year, General Motors partnered with the University of Michigan Transportation Institute to study the effectiveness of various GM safety-related features and the results were pretty dramatic.","GM\u2019s Forward Automatic Braking with Forward Collision Alert delivered a 46% reduction in rear-end crashes. Our Rear Park Assist reduced backing crashes by 38%. And IntelliBeam headlamps were responsible for a 35% reduction in nighttime animal, pedestrian and bicycle crashes. And then when you look at these technologies and you combine them, combining technologies such as Reverse Automatic Braking with Rear Cross Traffic Alert, Rear Vision cameras and Rear Park Assist, there was an 81% reduction in backing crashes.","So these are safety technologies that are preventing injuries, preventing property damage and the cost to our customers and society. In addition to the safety features I\u2019ve just talked about, we\u2019ve also expanded the footprint and the functionality of our exclusive Super Cruise driver assist technology. I\u2019m really excited about this technology because it\u2019s one of the most popular and promising technologies I\u2019ve seen in a long time. 85% of current CT owners and Super Cruise users tell us they would prefer or only consider a future vehicle with Super Cruise and that\u2019s a pretty powerful endorsement. Mark will have much more to share about this technology and our plans going forward.","Now, let\u2019s talk about electrification. We\u2019ve made tremendous strides in our electrification journey in the four years since we revealed the Chevrolet Bolt EV. And this year and next, we are intensifying our work to bring our third generation of EV technology, or BEV3 as we call it, to market across our various brands and platforms. Just last week, we announced that we will invest $2.2 billion in Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant to build new electric trucks and SUVs and the Cruise Origin SUV \u2013 excuse me, shared autonomous vehicle, and the GMC HUMMER EV that we revealed just last week. This investment will create over 2,200 good paying jobs so it\u2019s a positive development for our Detroit-Hamtramck employees and it\u2019s also positive for General Motors\u2019 future. We are planning a dedicated EV Day to reveal more about our EV product, technology and infrastructure plans, and Mark will share more about that as well.","But what sets the BEV3 infrastructure \u2013 or excuse me, architecture apart from our competitors and what gives us confidence is that it\u2019s an integrated approach and we have significant opportunities for scale. It maximizes the flexible battery architecture to create multiple entries across brands and across segments. Doug Parks, who now heads our Global Product Development and his team, developed this holistic strategy using a design-thinking mindset to understand what customers demand from an EV so we can capitalize and lead in this very important growth segment.","At the same time, we know that the vehicle is just one element of an all-electric future, so we are also focused on leveraging partnerships and technologies to build an entire EV ecosystem to meet our customers\u2019 needs and expectations. And this is all designed to speed the adoption of electric vehicles. We know from our research that customers want a no-compromise vehicle that is fun to drive. And for anyone in the room who hasn\u2019t experienced instant torque, I highly recommend you do and I\u2019m sure we can help out.","They also want beautiful design. They don\u2019t want to compromise. They also want a robust, reliable, fast-charging network that includes home, workplace and public solutions. And they want at least 300 miles of electric range on a full charge. And finally, they want pricing that is in line with internal combustion engine-powered vehicles. So we are aggressively working on all of these customer requirements. And we believe our new battery cell technology and manufacturing joint venture with LG Chem will bring together two leaders in battery science while creating jobs in Lordstown, Ohio. We plan to reduce cost to industry-leading levels and make EVs more affordable across a wide spectrum. With every battery chemistry and scale improvement, we get closer to the tipping point of ICE and EV cost parity.","Now another major growth opportunity for General Motors is commercializing autonomous vehicles and mobility services. AVs matter because they\u2019ll save lives and the billions of dollars spent on debilitating injuries and property damage. Cruise continues to make really great progress. And as I mentioned, we just revealed the Origin, which was the shared autonomous vehicle developed jointly by Cruise, by General Motors and by Honda.","And in addition to Cruise\u2019s approach to shared AVs, the advanced technology underpinning our vehicle systems continues to make them smarter and smarter. Our new digital vehicle platform greatly expands our existing over-the-air updates capability. And when you combine that with insights that we can gain from vehicle data, we will keep growing our capabilities. So this, along with the technology being developed at Cruise, will open up opportunities for the future of mobility, including the potential, however it evolves, for personal autonomous vehicles as we move forward. Mark and Dan are going to talk much more about EV and AV as we move through the morning.","Next, I\u2019d like to talk just a little bit about the continued cultural transformation that we are undergoing at General Motors and that began six years ago. It all begins with our employees because they are fundamental to the vibrancy and success of the company. Everything we accomplish depends on their abilities, their engagement and their commitment. To reinvent transportation, diverse perspectives are critical, and I believe that we are demonstrating today the ambidexterity we need to simultaneously transform the organization while delivering today and also investing in products and services for the future.","And I\u2019m proud of what we are doing as it relates to creating gender and pay equity across the company and our ongoing work to ensure we have diverse slates for candidates and for promotional opportunities. We really want to have a diverse and inclusive workforce, a workplace of choice and a culture where people can bring their true selves to work and where everyone understands our vision and believes their role in securing our future while sharing in this success.","Now since 2009, we\u2019ve invested more than $27 billion in the U.S. manufacturing base. And in October, we committed to an additional $7.7 billion in facility investments that will either create new or retain over 9,000 jobs. These are good-paying jobs that support families and they support the community. And when I sit down and meet with employees from across the globe and across the country, their excitement is infectious. They want to win and they want to be part of a team that wins, and they understand that there\u2019s big opportunities in front of us that also come with significant changes. They want to know how they fit in and because like you, they\u2019re invested in our future, they want to know we\u2019re placing the right bets on the future in our vehicles, in AV and in EV.","Of course, our cultural transformation also applies to other stakeholders, including our dealers. For years, General Motors\u2019 brands have consistently led J.D. Power\u2019s rankings in sales and service satisfaction and we\u2019re working to take that even further. We have charged a new team working across the company to develop a holistic approach for customer interactions. From the shopping experience for vehicles and services, to financing, to customer care, we want to provide a world-class, seamless and consistent experience throughout. And I can tell you, we\u2019re moving fast with our dedicated team.","But as this industry transforms, our dealers are also navigating many changes, and we view our dealers as strategic partners. As we improve and modernize the overall customer experience, we also have dedicated executives that are working with our dealer leadership teams and our dealer partners to maximize customer service and ensure profitability, both at a corporate level and at a dealer level. Now we are moving quickly to the better future we envision, and we will continue to innovate to deliver safe, efficient, connected vehicles and services that lead the industry and exceed our customers\u2019 expectations.","We are delivering on our commitments in terms of our products and setting ourselves up for the future and with our fundamental financial performance. Now I know we have work to do, no doubt, but I commit to you that we are making the right decisions to continue to drive strong performance. And by doing these things better, faster and more safely, with our economies of scale, we believe we will win in the marketplace today and in the future, and that is how we intend to create shareholder value.","So now I would like to bring Mark Reuss up to the stage.","Mark Reuss","Well, good morning, everybody, and thanks, Mary. And I got to tell you, as an engineer, there\u2019s a lot in the future. These are great days because I get to actually talk about what we\u2019ve been working on and then what we\u2019re getting ready to execute. So I\u2019m really happy to be here. I\u2019m happy you\u2019re here and thanks for tuning in, those of you tuning in.","Mary covered a lot of ground and I\u2019m going to try to amplify some of her comments. But I\u2019d like to point out one connecting thread woven through the tapestry of the subjects she covered, and that is this company is still doing what we said we were going to do. For instance, last year at this event, we said we were going to begin the transformation of our Global Product Group. We made a lot of progress. We took out a significant amount of structural cost and we\u2019re still engineering and designing the future of everything every day. And we\u2019re doing it in a new culture, Mary touched on this a little bit.","Yes, we saved a lot of money but the impact of this transformation goes beyond the bottom line by creating and sustaining this new corporate culture that we\u2019re trying to foster right now. We consolidated teams. We integrated the propulsion and vehicle engineers, the hardware and software engineers and created a true one-team mentality. If you think back about this, our company has always had propulsion in a separate location from vehicle engineering and software engineering in another location. So we\u2019ve done that. We knocked down the barriers between the groups and reorganized to keep them from being rebuilt.","We created a strong centralized engineering workforce that can leverage talent from across the enterprise and across the globe. This eliminated the situations we faced before. We were actually competing internally for talent, especially in the software area. And by the way, our product group\u2019s workforce has gotten significantly younger, and more than 50% of our workforce has been with us for five years or less. Think about that for a minute. It\u2019s a tremendous transformation. The new structure provides a framework for more easily shareable, smarter engineering processes. And overall, it helps us work smarter, faster and simpler.","Complexity reduction was a huge goal for 2019 and that continues into this year. Parts reduction, in particular, has been and remains a top priority, what we bring into our plants and put on our cars. Last year, we eliminated about 3,500 parts across the board or about 12% of our parts in plants. In 2020, we plan to eliminate a further 25% of parts in plants. We\u2019ll accomplish that by eliminating more trim levels, exterior colors, engines and transmissions and by bundling more sourcing options to better serve our customer.","Best example, for our next-generation compact crossovers, we\u2019ll have more reused and shared parts. We will reduce total trim levels on Equinox and Terrain from eight to six, and we\u2019ll reduce engine variance from eleven to five. We\u2019ll reduce build combinations from 200 to less than 100 per program. And we\u2019ll see significant cost savings of the next generation of an already paid-for architecture that already took the mass out that Mary talked about. This action will help us self-fund our electrification programs. And beyond that, we\u2019ll continue doing all the big picture things like getting out of footprints that don\u2019t make money, and Steve will talk a little bit more about this a little later. That also includes adjusting our engineering and design centers to maximize impact and profit, all while taking a more modern approach to shaping the future.","A perfect example of the revolutionary new mid-engine Corvette we unveiled last summer, and we\u2019re shipping to dealers and customers this month. In fact, we\u2019ve made number one, which went for a lot of money at Barrett-Jackson, and we funded \u2013 that all went to the Detroit public school systems. So we started that here the day before yesterday and so we\u2019re ramping up production. And we asked our design and engineering teams to re-imagine and recreate what was and is an iconic American sports car, moving the engine behind the cockpit. And all they did in response was come back with the greatest Corvette ever. The model run is sold out for the year, and I think it\u2019s going to be a tough-to-get car for quite a while and that is a good thing, very good thing.","Another thing we\u2019re shaping with this same winning approach is the future of Cadillac. As we said last year, Cadillac is going to be about being Cadillac once again. And since then, we\u2019ve seen a strong finish to our sales year, and we\u2019ve seen the launch of the new vehicles like the XT6 and the CT5 and new retail initiatives like Cadillac Live, and of course, last night\u2019s stunning unveiling of the all-new iconic 2021 Escalade. It\u2019s an appropriate start to the year because we\u2019re confident the new Escalade will continue to win in the full-size luxury SUV segment, and because winning is contagious, that success will spread across our lineup in 2020. Here\u2019s a picture of Steve Carlisle last night on the West Coast so we\u2019re sort of doing an East Coast, West Coast thing here a little bit. But it was a big night for us, a lot of breakthroughs here and we\u2019ll share a little bit of that.","So before we do that, let\u2019s take a look at some of the highlights from Cadillac\u2019s week rolling into the Oscars.","[Video Presentation]","Fun stuff, right? So that was obviously Spike Lee and he actually created that film because he is so passionate about Escalade. So this is the kind of thing that we really need to cultivate and really start Cadillac going in a place, where we haven\u2019t been in a little while. So very exciting.","Before I dive into the Cadillac brand details, let me say a few words about the new car, the Escalade, and those words would be something to the effect of the best full-size luxury SUV on the planet. Escalade remains the best-selling full-size luxury SUV on the market by far. Hope all of you take the opportunity to give the all-new Escalade a look because it\u2019s really something different, and we are excited and proud to put it out there. There\u2019s lots of different personas here if you haven\u2019t noticed as well. Its bold design give it unbelievable presence both on the road and at rest, and it is packed with the latest advanced technology inside the cabin and out, things that people flat out don\u2019t have.","Nothing really demonstrates that more immediately than the curved OLED screen that greets you upon arrival. It\u2019s truly one-of-a-kind. This is \u2013 I mean, you have to experience it. It looks like you can actually reach into the screen and take the icons out of the screen. It\u2019s got more than 38 inches of display area and twice the pixel density of a 4K TV. This is the first OLED in automotive application. This technology enables bold imagery, perfect contrast and the largest color range available in any automotive application. As important as what you see is what you hear.","Cadillac is proud for the first time ever in the automotive environment to present the legendary sound of AKG, an exclusive brand associated with commercial sound and only music studios and theaters, so it\u2019s very exclusive. Also important to this segment is space, and Escalade has even more passenger and cargo space, especially behind the third row with an impressive 70% more cargo room in the short wheelbase model. The whole interior embodies Cadillac\u2019s craftsmanship, style and comfort, which you will see here and feel when you get into it, and this is only the beginning.","And especially when you get it on the road, where this vehicle has taken a dramatic leap forward in its driving dynamics, which were already very strong but this truck is the only luxury SUV to use Magnetic Ride Control, Electronic Limited Slip Differential and 4-corner Air Suspension simultaneously, delivering precise body control and remarkable agility for its size. The 4-corner Air Suspension offers ride-height adjustment of up to 4 inches, 2 inches lower at highway speeds for improved aerodynamics and 2 inches lower when ground clearance \u2013 or higher than when ground clearance \u2013 I got this flipped away so it\u2019s lower for aerodynamics on the highway 2 inches and it\u2019s higher for off-road capability. You can even drive the vehicle up and have it drop 2 inches for people to be able to get into it easier.","So there\u2019s a lot of really creative things you can do with that. And of course, Escalade will be the first SUV with Super Cruise, the industry\u2019s first true hands-free driver assistance system for compatible highways. I\u2019ll talk more about Super Cruise in a moment, but it\u2019s set another example of doing what we said we\u2019re going to do. Just like we\u2019re doing with the entire Cadillac brand, it is focused, it is expanding and it is performing. For the second straight year, Cadillac set a global sales record. In 2019, sales in China grew almost 4%. And here\u2019s another stat that demonstrates Cadillac growth and momentum in China. Last month, we sold our 1 millionth Cadillac in China. 75% of those sales have occurred in just the last five years.","Here in the U.S., last year, Cadillac saw its first year-over-year retail sales gain in the U.S. since 2013. This growth was led by Cadillac SUV sales, which were up 22.4% year-over-year. We have rounded out the Cadillac portfolio with full SUV coverage as well as our new sedans and their performance variance, which have yet to be released quite yet. In fact, the addition of the CT5 and the CT4 sedans to the portfolio year this year, Cadillac now has 94% coverage of the luxury market with the freshest luxury lineup in the industry. This is a big change from where we were.","We\u2019ve also introduced retail innovations like Cadillac Live, an online experience that connects shoppers with a live product ambassador for a two-way guided virtual walkaround of any vehicle in our portfolio. I encourage you to try it yourself to see how it works. It is an incredible application of an all-new sales tool for people anywhere in the world. It educates customers on their terms. It tells them exactly what they want to know exactly when they want know it and then directs them to their local Cadillac dealer. It launched previously in Canada to great success, which by the way, Canada had a great sales month, and Cadillac Live is now up and running in the U.S.","As we said last year, we\u2019re making Cadillac the tip of the corporate spear of innovation and technology at GM, and that applies to these retail initiatives as well as our actual advanced technology in our vehicles. Take Super Cruise, which I just mentioned. It\u2019s the most sophisticated integration of component systems of its type on the road today. And it\u2019s now validated by nearly 5.2 million miles of incident-free customer use. Unbelievable. We said we were going to expand both its coverage and its availability and we have. Last year, we announced 70,000 additional miles of available Super Cruise-compatible freeway, bringing the total to more than 200,000 miles of coverage. And here are some more Super Cruise facts as of November of 2019.","Customers who have it are engaging the system nearly 50% of the time when it\u2019s available. A lot. Customers are driving upwards of 77,000 miles total each week using Super Cruise. And as Mary said, more than 85% of CT6 owners said that they would prefer or only consider a vehicle equipped with Super Cruise in the future. That\u2019s a huge, huge statistics. Those numbers add up to success to me and that\u2019s just the beginning of this game-changing feature. We are continuously improving the Super Cruise technology while expanding its availability. And later this year, we will introduce an enhanced version of Super Cruise that will feature quite a few upgrades.","The most notable announcement and advancement was done last week. Cadillac CT4, CT5 and Escalade models with Super Cruise will offer a new automated lane change feature. This will allow the hands-free system to change lanes on compatible highways when requested by the driver and when conditions are deemed safe. Safety is an anchor of Super Cruise, I think you all know that. We also improved the vehicle control software, the user interface and the hands-free driving dynamics of the car itself. This enhanced version of Super Cruise will first be available on the 2021 CT5, which we\u2019re just launching right now, the CT4 and the Escalade in the second half of this year.","And next year, we\u2019ll add Super Cruise to other brands and seven more models and will add 12 more in the following two years, including our full-size pickups, SUVs and more. We are rolling this out in a very big way. Many of these enhancements are a direct result of our all-new global digital platform, which we just debuted on the CT5. We followed it up with the Corvette, which we\u2019re just launching and going right now. And then we\u2019re going into the full-size SUVs and Escalade.","So, this is really a very good rollout and a very staged rollout and we\u2019re well on our way. The global digital platform is the direct result of years of ramping our software expertise up and hiring an army of talented software engineers. It will be the new electronic architecture for all of our vehicles. And it allows us to expand over-the-air updates for many vehicles\u2019 systems and features. It\u2019s incredible what we can do with that. We have already done some over-the-air capability, but this new digital platform greatly expands it to be a completely customer-focused over-the-air system, updating with what will be an incredible bandwidth and speed. It will have 5G capacity but it\u2019s really about much more than that.","In today\u2019s vehicles and importantly, tomorrow\u2019s, digital processing power is the new horsepower. Just as we fought horsepower wars in the past, we\u2019re now fighting software wars on the front lines with other OEMs and tech companies trying to acquire the top software engineering talent. We\u2019ve been fighting for this talent for a long time but we\u2019ve already stepped it up in the past five years, during which we\u2019ve greatly increased our software, electrical and computer engineering hires, and as a result, our knowledge base and our expertise. This continues full speed ahead in 2020 when we\u2019ll increase our headcount target again, further growing our software engineering footprint and mix, which spreads from Warren, to Markham, Ontario to Israel and many spots in between, as you can see.","We have executed a strategy to have hubs around the world wherever that talent is. And that\u2019s not just in Silicon Valley, by the way. Markham has the second greatest concentration of software talent in North America, for example. And we have a beautiful office there with more than 700 employees that will probably grow to 1,000 this year, alongside of an incubator, and we have a great relationship with nearby Waterloo University. This strategy is paying off already in the form of our new digital platform, the new electronic architecture I just mentioned.","Our new electronic system has 4.5 terabytes per hour of data processing power. Think about that for a minute. 5x the capability of our current electrical architecture. This is what will enable an electric future and autonomous driving. It will lead to, among other wins, EVs with more range and EVs, more of them, period. As far as Cadillac and EVs go, we have publicly said, Cadillac will be the first brand to first brand to launch an electric crossover off of our next-gen electric vehicle architecture.","As Mary said, we will unveil Cadillac\u2019s first EV in April. Cadillac will offer mostly electric vehicles by the end of this decade. And Cadillac\u2019s EVs will have names that are words, not alphanumeric designations. Glad I got a little laugh out of that. That\u2019s good. Yes, no, we are doing that. What I can tell you about one thing for certain about our EV program, we\u2019re going to have another event next month. Wednesday, March 4, in Warren, Michigan that will focus solely on EVs so that\u2019s an event that you\u2019re not going to want to miss, and that will be taking place in our design activity at the heart of the Tech Center and it\u2019s going to be an incredible thing. I\u2019m not going to go into too much of that today, but I can tell you what our broad strategy is and how we deeply committed are to it.","We\u2019ve been at this an awful long time and we\u2019ve learned an awful lot about it. You might think I\u2019m referring to the EV1 of the 1990s but we go back even further than that, as you can see. This photo from 1912 shows one of the several hundred electric GM work trucks powered by lead acid and Edison nickel-iron batteries. Think about that for a minute, that\u2019s pretty cool. Today, 108 years later, we have as a robust a strategy for rolling out EVs as anyone could have. I can guarantee you that no other company is doing what we\u2019re doing because no other company can do what we\u2019re doing. No one can match our combination of advanced technology, flexibility and scale.","And you\u2019ll see this for the first time as our program rolls out. Our EV program is what will help take us and the world to our stated vision of zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion. We\u2019ll have a complete lineup of EVs, including the pickup truck we told you about and its stable mates. Our battery pack design, like our next-generation architecture, is extremely flexible. And together, the combination of the new architecture and the pack will allow multibrand, multisegment applications. You can see this here as it builds on the slide. This is the actual math from our design and the engineered solution that we have. So this is actually real. We showed you a little bit of this last year, but this is the actual \u2013 this is it. It\u2019s pretty much engineered in time and this is the math.","The slide clearly shows how we can use many different of these configurations of the battery pack, all from the same starting point with the same materials, depending on the product that we\u2019re building. This illustrates the ice cube tray metaphor we\u2019ve used before to explain this. You can put in as much water to make as many cubes as you need. The tray still takes up the same amount of space in the freezer. As you can see, this particular ice cube tray allows us to use as many battery packs as the vehicle specifications call for: 6, for a smaller EV or we can go up to 8, 10, 12 or even 24 with two 12s stacked on top of each other.","The new application has significant improvements over the previous generation, including larger footprint with lower height, higher energy density, a flexible modular design, higher-powered DC fast charging and one of the biggest advantages that this approach gives us is how much flexibility we can dial into any one program. This allows us to be as agile as the market dictates, never locked into any one thing. We can meet the market head on, whatever it is.","We can adjust on the fly if we need to. It also means we\u2019re not spending money validating way more designs than necessary. We just slap the configuration we need into whatever product we need whenever we need it. Again, most of our competitors lack this ability. Most of them will have to melt and re-pour. A lot of those are one-off snowflakes, an existing architecture that has a battery that\u2019s been put into it, which is fine, but it\u2019s not the long-term scalable, economic, market-agile solution that we have.","Nobody we know of has this combination of these levels of flexibility, speed and scale. The GMC Hummer EV battery electric truck we announced last week that Mary mentioned is a great example of all of that. And in case you missed it, here\u2019s the ad we ran on the Super Bowl, giving you a little bit of a tease of what\u2019s to come here.","[Video Presentation]","That\u2019s a great commercial. But this will change a lot of minds when we show the whole truck here of what an EV can do and what it is when it\u2019s revealed here on May 20, so we\u2019re very excited about that.","When we go to market, we\u2019ll have 1-motor, 2-motor, 3-motor versions, offering different ranges, different performance at different price points to meet the customers wherever they may be. If the customer wants a basic package, we\u2019ll have that. If the customer wants true off-road capability and towing capability, we\u2019ll have that too. Whether or not we are first on the market, which we just might be here because we\u2019re fall of next year, I am totally confident that we are going to be the best on the market, because we\u2019ve engineered this strategy and this approach with these component sets, and I\u2019m really excited about it. Our offering won\u2019t be just one ticket. This will be architected to be scalable and used for multiple brands with multiple variants for multiple customers.","So when the market demands those variants, where can our competitors go? We can go to variant X, Y or Z quickly. We\u2019ll be introducing multiple models a year, as market responsive as we want to be and the market dictates. We can get into that more next month at our EV Day, but suffice to say, I really like our position heading into the area of electrification and I like it for a lot of different reasons. I think you\u2019ll be very excited about some of the things we go into a little more detail that I\u2019ve talked about today. We are working hard on our own and with our partners that have developed lower-cost, better performing chemistry, and we\u2019re making great progress. We\u2019re developing our own intellectual property in many areas of electrification, which will greatly benefit this company in the future. But there\u2019s a lot of vertical integration. Again, we\u2019ll go into more of that here next month, but this is a very, very well-thought out strategy.","For instance, our battery chemistry development itself could be a new revenue stream for us down the road, and that\u2019s just one example. As Mary said, we\u2019re committed to the reuse and recycling of our 100% of our end-of-life EV batteries, and we\u2019ll be the first full-line OEM to vertically integrate and manufacture battery cells. We have the scale to provide EVs to the mass market, given our strength in North America and China. And we have the benefits of having done all the elimination of waste and reduction of cost and reuse of parts and the materials that I talked about a little while ago. We\u2019re applying all of that knowledge and process and more to our electric vehicle program, and it will boost the bottom line. That\u2019s a big reason why we keep saying we\u2019re going to have a profitable EV program, and it\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re working toward every day.","Everything we\u2019re doing in the Global Product Group and everything we\u2019re doing with Cadillac and our other brands is helping us set the stage for a giant leap forward into the electrification space. And I believe that when all of that happens, and it is happening, we, more than any other company, automotive or otherwise, will be poised to win.","So, I want to thank you very much for listening and coming today. And I want to introduce my colleague and good friend, the President of North America, Mr. Barry Engle. Thank you very much.","Barry Engle","Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for being with us. In our time together this morning, I\u2019d like to do several things. First, I want to give you an update on our 2019 share performance and talk a bit about how we\u2019re navigating some of the segment shifts that are occurring in the industry. Then we\u2019re going to deep dive trucks to discuss how we\u2019re thinking about and managing that really important part of the business. And we\u2019ll end on what\u2019s to come in 2020, including our full-size SUV launches. What we saw last year was a continuation of the segment shifts that are reshaping our industry. Customers keep moving out of traditional sedans to crossovers and SUVs as well as trucks and vans. And GM\u2019s strategy to manage these changes has been to pivot, discontinuing 10 car nameplates and reconfiguring our manufacturing footprint, while at the same time strengthening our lineup of crossovers, SUVs and trucks.","As a result of this proactive refocusing of our portfolio, we significantly reduced our 2019 retail car sales in the U.S. while increasing our sales in the other more profitable growth segments. In the case of crossovers and SUVs, we delivered record retail sales and share, further increasing our number one leadership position in this segment. Similarly, in trucks and vans, we also increased retail sales and maintained our number one leadership position. So in aggregate, our U.S. retail share was essentially flat year-over-year, maintaining our position as the best-selling OEM. I think we\u2019ve managed to pivot pretty well. We were able to hold total retail share despite giving up a full point to discontinued cars and despite significant production losses, both from the strike as well as our full-size truck changeover.","Now the reason that we\u2019re so focused on the retail business is because we see it as the best barometer of true consumer demand and it\u2019s generally more profitable than fleet. We\u2019re committed to maintaining our position as the overall U.S. market leader. We\u2019re particularly focused on growing our retail share and doing so in the most profitable segments. And one of those segments is crossovers, where we increased our U.S. retail sales last year by 10%, posting the industry\u2019s largest share gain. And much of this growth can be attributed to the strength of our unrivaled product portfolio, includes 14 nameplates with multiple entries in each of our four brands to give optimal market coverage across the subsegments. We\u2019re leveraging common vehicle architectures and scale, now more than one million units per year in the U.S. alone to reduce complexity and lower cost of our crossovers.","At the same time, we\u2019re managing customer-facing content and styling to maximize brand and product differentiation. Up-level sub-brands and trims provide further differentiation and drive a richer, more profitable mix. Our crossover portfolio is one of the freshest in the industry. The average age will be just 1.6 years by the end of 2020. Examples of the new products include the recently launched Chevy Blazer, an all-new entry, which steadily gained share throughout 2019. Last year, we also introduced XT6, an important new Cadillac entry and an updated XT5, which is the brand\u2019s best-selling model. Together with the segment-leading XT4, Cadillac now has the freshest lineup in the lux crossover segment. And late last year, we launched an updated GMC Acadia.","In 2020, this year, the new crossovers just keep coming. We\u2019ll launch in the high-volume compact segment two completely new additions to the Chevy and Buick lineups, the Trailblazer and the Encore GX. Additionally, we\u2019ll launch updated models of Chevy Equinox and Traverse, Buick Envision and Terrain and \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, Envision and Enclave as well as the GMC Terrain. So with all this great new product, I fully expect 2020 to be another record growth year for us in crossovers. Another important and very profitable growth segment for us is trucks. And once again, we are really well positioned with an outstanding product portfolio. It\u2019s helped us build the most successful truck franchise in the industry. We sell more trucks in the U.S. than anybody by a wide margin. We are unique in that we have not one but two very strong truck brands and distribution channels in Chevrolet and GMC. We have award-winning midsized trucks, the Chevy Colorado, GMC Canyon.","Last year, we launched our all-new full-size trucks, Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra. Both of these vehicles are available in light and heavy-duty versions. And in the case of Chevrolet, we recently returned to the medium-duty commercial market with a great new line of Silverado chassis cab trucks. So at GM, we love trucks. We absolutely understand how strategically important they are to our business. And that\u2019s why as the industry transitions from ICE to EV, we will continue to lead the way. And it starts with the all-new GMC Hummer EV, a super truck that redefines what an electric vehicle can be. And we\u2019re going to share more of our plans at our EV Day in early March.","Now let\u2019s take a look at how these all new full-size trucks are performing. As a reminder, 2019 was a transition year as we wound down the previous generation models and launched our all-new next-gen trucks. This was the largest launch in the history of General Motors and one of the most complex. To maximize quality, volume and profits, we implemented a phased launch strategy, transitioning one plant at a time, launching with limited configurations and gradually expanding body styles, trims and powertrains.","The light-duty versions ramped up during the first half of the year and the heavy duties began production only in the second half of the year. What that meant in practical terms is that we had limited availability throughout the year. Given those availability constraints, we chose to concentrate our volume in retail and skewed allocation towards our relatively more profitable GMC brand. For the full year, we gained one point of retail segment share versus prior year with GMC driving the gain. However, 2019 was really a tale of two halves. With reasonable availability of light-duty trucks in the second half, we gained nearly five points of overall truck share versus the first half, with both brands growing share.","As availability improves, we continue to see strengthening run rates. And in fact, in January, overall retail share, I just got the numbers this morning, came in at 41%. And there is further upside as the recently launched heavy-duty trucks and light-duty diesels become more readily available. We expect continued year-over-year share \u2013 truck share gains in 2020, given a full year of uninterrupted production across the entire model range of all of our new trucks. And as we do grow our truck business, we are focused on delivering high-quality share. Hence, the emphasis on retail and within that, you can see we\u2019re achieving our strongest shares in the highest price bands.","With the new next-gen trucks, we removed important bottlenecks to allow increased production of the more expensive crew cabs and diesels. We also introduced two new very well-received models, the Chevrolet Trail Boss and GMC AT4. They come from the factory with lifted suspensions, big tires and enhanced off-road capabilities. Other new features, technologies, trims and options allow our customers to configure ever more luxurious and capable trucks.","This chart also demonstrates the competitive advantage of our two-brand portfolio. Our mainstream Chevrolet brand is strong in the middle of the market, while our premium GMC brand nicely complements it and skews heavily towards the higher end. Our strategy is to manage the mix, optimize production and increase share in the most profitable segments of the market.","In our pursuit of truck profits, we remain committed to disciplined pricing and incentives. With the new trucks, we\u2019ve been able to grow our average transaction prices for GMC and Chevrolet in both light-duty and heavy duty. At GMC, we have the highest ATPs in the industry while Chevrolet is positioned between our two main competitors. These ATPs that you see here are full-year averages. If we look specifically at Q4, the most recent quarter, we\u2019d see that incentives across the segment did tick up slightly. But we responded in a disciplined, measured way, maintaining our premium, with both brands still posting solid year-over-year ATP growth.","As a percentage of ATP, GMC incentives were below industry average and Chevrolet was in line. Maintaining a healthy channel mix is also key to maximum truck profits. Compared to our main competitors, we have the lowest fleet mix. Of the fleet business that we do have, with the lowest sales to daily rental fleets, concentrating instead on more profitable commercial and government business. We also have the lowest lease penetration. So, not surprisingly as a result of these strategies, we enjoy the highest residual values amongst our main competitors.","Now starting with Chevrolet, I\u2019d like to quickly talk about what\u2019s new on our full-size trucks and help you understand why we\u2019re confident in their success. Our Chevy Silverado has earned a reputation for being the most dependable, longest-lasting truck on the road. And our new truck is simply the strongest, most advanced Silverado we\u2019ve ever built. The improvements were based on deep insights of how real pickup owners use their trucks and include 50 new industry firsts. We offer more trims to ensure we\u2019ve got just the right truck for every customer. Our powertrain lineup includes best-in-class V8 horsepower and torque and an all-new light-duty diesel with a best-in-class highway fuel economy rating of 33 miles per gallon. We\u2019re not the only ones that are impressed by this truck.","Customers have taken notice as well. In our brand tracking survey, Silverado now has the highest excellent opinion scores in the industry and is at record levels of consideration. This truck is the real deal and it further enhances our strong Silverado franchise that has been built over many years. Unlike any of our competitors, GM has a second truck brand that we have successfully developed to target the most profitable pockets of the business.","Our Sierra pickup leverages the GMC brand\u2019s DNA of bold, capable and precisely crafted to become the only truck uniquely positioned as a premium entry. Within GMC, we\u2019ve developed the aspirational Denali sub-brand that ratchets up the luxury. It\u2019s available across all GMC products, trucks and SUVS. And if this Denali sub-brand were a stand-alone luxury franchise, it would outsell, in terms of volume, Lincoln, Infinity, Volvo, Land Rover, and it would do it with a higher average transaction price, than Mercedes, BMW or Audi.","With the launch of the new Sierra pickup, we created yet another, a second sub-brand, that we call the AT4, and it\u2019s an upscale off-road product. Combined, the Denali and AT4 are approaching half of all new Sierra sales. The new Sierra pickups are loaded with innovations, including the world\u2019s first 6-function MultiPro Tailgate.","Sierra\u2019s the only pickup to offer head-up display, it\u2019s a feature normally found in luxury cars. It also has a rear camera mirror, a great safety feature, which expands the driver\u2019s field of rear vision. The pro grade Trailering system is a suite of new features and technologies designed to make towing safe and easy. Eight cameras provide up to 15 different views around the truck and trailer. And the Sierra\u2019s carbon fiber box is yet another industry-first, offering best-in-class dent, scratch and corrosion resistance. It\u2019s the subject of one of our latest ads that we call Hurricane, and I\u2019d like to show you the ad now.","[Video Presentation]","The heavy-duty versions of our all-new truck are worth a special mention. These models, available as both a Silverado and a Sierra, began production in the latter part of the year and will be very important new weapons in our truck arsenal. For the first time, the heavy duties are completely differentiated from their light-duty counterparts.","With unique sheet metal and a bigger, bolder look, these trucks are also much more capable. Max towing capacity is up over 50% to 35,500 pounds. This is important because heavy-duty customers, they do tow with their trucks, and they will appreciate the new Allison 10-speed transmission that we\u2019ve mated to our proven Duramax Diesel. Additional production capacity will also allow us to better meet demand for these high-end trucks that carry the best ATPs in the industry.","Roughly 80% of our new GMC heavies have been either AT4s or Denalis with ATPs over $70,000. The success of these trucks shows there\u2019s a real customer appetite for very capable premium trucks. And our GMC organization knows how to sell those vehicles, and it\u2019s the right channel to carry the new Hummer EV. The same new architecture that we\u2019ve used for our pickups will support an all-new family of full-size SUVs.","Our full-size SUVs are iconic people and cargo haulers. The Chevrolet Suburban has been in continuous production for 85 years, making it the longest-running nameplate in the global auto industry. Together with the Chevrolet Tahoe and the GMC Yukon, our full-size SUV franchise has historically led the industry, with over 70% market share in the U.S., while in the luxury space, Cadillac Escalade leads this segment. Each of our entries have been redesigned to offer class-leading interior space, exclusive technologies and features and the best driving dynamics in the full-size segment.","Like our pickups, these vehicles also command high ATPs, and we\u2019ll be using similar trim mix and packaging strategies to drive profitability. We\u2019ve unveiled these new SUVs over the last number of weeks. They\u2019ve been very well received and we look forward to bringing them to market in mid-2020.","So as you can see, we\u2019re focused on growing our U.S. retail business and doing it profitably in crossovers, trucks and SUVs. Our product investments have focused in these segments and resulted in a very strong fresh portfolio. 2020 will be a good year as we benefit from the full year impact of last year\u2019s big launches and continue to add momentum with other important new vehicle introductions this year. We\u2019re now going to take a 15-minute break, after which we\u2019ll continue with our presentations. Thank you.","[Break-Out Session]","Rocky Gupta","Okay. Let\u2019s get restarted. So, as Mary mentioned earlier, Matt Tsien was going to be here in person, but out of an abundance of caution, we decided to pretape his message. He is feeling absolutely fine and he\u2019ll be joining us by phone for the Q&A session. So let me turn it over to the taping of Matt.","Matt Tsien","It\u2019s a pleasure for me to speak with you today to give you an update on GM in China and to share with you our plan for sustained development here. After two decades of continuous growth, China\u2019s vehicle market has entered a transition period with challenges that is putting pressure on our profitability, leading to lower equity income from our China operations. Regulatory pressures on fuel economy standards and new energy vehicles continue to increase. The investment required for our new energy vehicle programs and fuel-saving technologies is considerable.","Although we haven\u2019t seen a direct impact on our performance that is directly attributable to the prolonged trade tension between the U.S. and China, we know that it is hurting the Chinese economy and ultimately, weakening consumer confidence. And China\u2019s currency, the renminbi, remains weak versus prior years. This has had a negative impact on the translation of our earnings into U.S. dollars. While these challenges were widely anticipated, the recent coronavirus outbreak is unexpected and is likely to put further pressure on China\u2019s economy. Prior to the virus outbreak, we had estimated the industry would be slightly down in 2020. We now expect additional near-term volume impact. GM\u2019s target is to perform in line with the industry in 2020.","Generally speaking, we expect to see earnings from our China business grow along with industry recovery. China remains the world\u2019s largest vehicle market. Cyclical downturns are normal in mature markets, so it\u2019s no surprise for cyclicality to develop in a market that has witnessed nearly two decades of continuous growth. Having said that, we still believe this market can grow to well over 30 million units annually in the coming years. We\u2019re leveraging our strong business foundation built over the past two decades, combined with China\u2019s scale, to achieve success for the long haul.","With Chinese consumers purchasing power getting stronger, the pursuit of prestige will continue to drive the industry consumption upgrade. As a result, the demand for SUVs and luxury vehicles will remain strong. We\u2019re bullish about our downstream opportunities as well. We have a strong presence covering after sales with ACDelco, automotive financing through SAIC-GMAC, automotive leasing through SAIC-GMF, insurance through INSAIC and connectivity through OnStar.","As the largest EV market in the world, China will play a key role in moving us toward a zero emissions future. Leveraging China\u2019s scale is an enabler for GM to achieve profitability on EVs globally. China\u2019s vehicle market peaked at over 20 million units in 2017. It finished at 25.4 million units in 2019, down 4.2% from the previous year and down 10% since the peak in 2017.","As I just said, a further decrease is expected in 2020. As the environment keeps evolving, we\u2019ve proactively adapted our business, including addressing cost across materials, SG&A and manufacturing. Flexibility is built in to our manufacturing facilities across China, giving us the ability to adjust shift patterns and working hours to rescale production based on demand. While models in high demand, like the Cadillac XT4 and Buick Regal, drove some of our plants to work six days a week, other plants reduced working hours in response to the softening demand for their products last year.","The production schedule adjustments has resulted in a reduction in associated costs, minimizing the impact on our bottom line. Based on market feedback, we improved capital discipline to ensure that we\u2019re making the right decisions and rolling out the right products and technologies at the right time. On the product side, amid the overall market downturn, we have seen variations in segment performance. As I mentioned earlier, the luxury and SUV segments have continued to expand. Our launches of the large SUV models last year, especially the XT6 from Cadillac, benefited from the segment\u2019s growth.","Baojun, however, has been facing more pressure from weak consumer confidence, especially in lower-tier cities, where the brand has a major presence. Baojun has been pivoting to a higher pricing position over the past year. This is a necessary and important strategic move upward but it doesn\u2019t mean that we are abandoning the affordable entry-level price positioning that it has long held.","With cross-brand alignment, the Wuling brand will further expand its passenger car lineup with products that offer compelling value. As SGMW is a fast-moving company, we expect to see sales improvements starting this year. GM is among the pioneers in adopting three-cylinder engines, while improving fuel efficiency, while maintaining dynamic driving performance. Although we firmly believe three-cylinder engines have long-term benefit, we acknowledge that some consumers have been hesitant to purchase vehicles featuring them. This has impacted the performance of a number of our launches.","We have taken steps to address this challenge. While continuously educating consumers on the benefits of three-cylinder engines, we are going to offer four-cylinder engines as an added option in some of our products. We also foresee that improving product mix toward larger and more premium products will increase opportunities for adjacencies. SAIC-GMAC is targeting financing nearly 50% of SGM vehicle purchases this year, up from 44% last year. Its financing of SGMW vehicle purchases increased from 12% in 2018 to 20% in 2019 and is expected to grow to 30% in 2020.","These actions and the strong demand for higher-margin products have enabled us to keep our core business profitable. We expect to remain profitable going forward. Looking ahead, we are fully committed to a zero emissions future. A few years ago, GM committed to launching 10 NEVs in China between 2016 and 2020. We will actually exceed this plan as our local Baojun and Wuling brands accelerate their EV rollout with local solutions.","Here, you can see two of our newest EV launches in China: the Chevrolet Menlo and Baojun E200. Achieving the zero emission future requires significant investment in electrification in the near term, which will impact profitability. However, it will put us in a position to be solidly profitable in electrification over the long term. Major challenges exist at this time, including high cost of batteries, low consumer acceptance and dependence on government subsidies. We believe achieving global scale is essential for profitability. As Mark said, no other company can do what we\u2019re doing.","With our combination of advanced technology, flexibility and scale, GM\u2019s China operations will benefit from GM technology and contribute to GM\u2019s scale. China is already the world\u2019s largest market for NEVs, and we are applying a diverse range of new energy solutions for our global and local brands here. Our established capability in China for battery pack testing and assembly will support the steady rollout of NEVs and help lower battery costs.","With the rollout of our EV architecture, we will enjoy a complete lineup of EVs, including those in the important and growing luxury and SUV segments, translating into profitable growth.","In 2019, while we launched more than 20 new or refreshed models, performance was impacted by the industry downturn, transition to the China VI emission standard, our Baojun brand transition and weaker acceptance of some of our 3-cylinder-based entries. This year, our launch profile is going to be quite different, especially regarding propulsion. Our key launch products in 2020 will come with 4-cylinder engines. While the 2019 launch products with 3-cylinder engines will carry through into 2020, certain products with 3-cylinder engines already in the market will be available with 4-cylinder engines starting in the second quarter. Our launches this year will focus on luxury vehicles as well as mid and large SUVs and MPVs, which, as you have seen, have become the segments with the strongest growth in consumer demand. Following the successful launches of the Cadillac XT6 and Buick Enclave in 2019, the Chevrolet Blazer coming this year will also tap into the large SUV segment.","In the luxury market, the CT4 sedan, being launched in 2020, will give Cadillac its strongest and most complete lineup ever, enabling it to compete in all key luxury segments. Meanwhile, our youngest local brand, Baojun, will maintain its intensive launch cadence to reinforce its new brand image and portfolio. In line with the brand\u2019s upward move, four new models were introduced in eight months last year.","As China enters an era of quality growth, consumption upgrade has led to steady growth in the luxury segment. Cadillac maintained its positive growth momentum and posted another record year for sales in 2019, which we expect to build upon in 2020 and beyond. Cadillac\u2019s compound annual growth rate over the past five years was 28%, significantly outperforming the overall luxury segment CAGR of 13%. As a result, Cadillac has steadily increased its luxury market share in China from 5.4% in 2016 to 7% in 2019, a year that was impacted by the early transition to China VI in many markets.","In summary, we view China as a strategic asset for General Motors. Over the past two decades, we have established a strong foundation in China, which is key to our sustained growth in the future. We have an enduring partnership with SAIC, which has worked closely with us to drive the success of our joint ventures. Our five brands in China have broad coverage across key segments through extensive dealer networks. In addition to our two manufacturing joint ventures, SGM and SGMW, our PATAC automotive engineering and design joint venture enables us to engage in co-development programs. As the market becomes more mature, we have seen increasing opportunities for our successful adjacent businesses, many of them in partnership with SAIC as well.","Through global collaboration, we have built a highly competitive cost structure to continuously drive costs down and drive efficiency up. Leveraging the China market is helping GM achieve considerable economies of scale on a global basis. By 2025, about 95% of SAIC GM vehicles sold in China will share common global architectures with the rest of the world, up from about 70% in 2018. It all adds up to our China joint ventures remaining profitable, self-funding and dividend paying to support our entire company.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to my colleague, Steve Kiefer. He will give us an update on GM South America and GM International Operations. Thank you.","Steve Kiefer","Well, thank you to Matt\u2019s recording, and welcome to all of you. A special welcome to our international sites that are joining us by webcast today. It\u2019s really a pleasure and an honor for me to be leading this GMI team and to be here presenting to you. For these next couple of minutes, I\u2019m going to talk a little bit about where we\u2019ve been, what our plans are this year and where we\u2019re headed in our GMI international markets.","As Mary mentioned, I was named to this role in the fourth quarter of last year. Previously, I was leading our global purchasing and supply chain team and really interacting closely with all of our suppliers around the world. In my opinion, the best automotive supply base in the industry. And of course, we\u2019re going to count on those suppliers as our partners as we move to profitability in all of these international sites.","So just by definition, at General Motors, we define GM International as all of our operations outside of North America and excluding China. We participate in over 60 markets that stretch from one side of the globe to the other, including South America, some key strategic markets in Europe, Africa, Middle East and of course, some key markets in Asia, again, excluding China. Every one of these markets is unique and every one offers us some very interesting opportunities.","In 2019, in these markets, we delivered 1.3 million vehicles and generated $16 billion in net sales across these markets, spanning four of our General Motors brands. Now from a profitability standpoint, the last few years have been very challenging, driven by especially in South America and also some transformation efforts and costs that are now beginning to pay off in these international markets. I\u2019m really excited to enter into 2020 with a clear strategic vision to turn every market we participate in to a profitable market. So, let\u2019s look at our plan to achieve the targeted returns across our markets. At GMI, we use a strategic framework with four pillars to optimize our operations market by market with our objective of improving profitability by $2 billion.","First, in markets where we\u2019re very well positioned, core markets, markets where we have a very strong franchise, we\u2019ll optimize and look to grow. These include markets like South America, where we have a very dominant market share. Second, we\u2019re developing very unique and interesting partnerships to maximize our returns in some key growth markets. One example is Uzbekistan. In Uzbekistan, we\u2019re working with a third-party that manufactures engines, vehicles under a license from General Motors, and they manage their own distribution network.","In that market last year, we achieved year, we achieved record sales of 250,000 units, giving us, yes, 96% market share, 96% market share in that market. Thirdly, in markets where we don\u2019t have historically significant scale, like Japan and like some of the markets now in Europe, we\u2019ll pursue a niche presence by selling high-end vehicles imported from larger markets. Mark and Barry showed you some of these great vehicles that we have at General Motors. These vehicles have high demand in these niche markets. And these vehicles, coupled with a very lean sales structure, have an opportunity to generate solid returns in these markets.","Of course, the final option is to exit markets that do not have a clear pathway to sustainable profitability and to meet our target returns. Today, you\u2019ve seen General Motors take decisive actions to exit markets like India and Russia. And today, several other markets are under active study. Bottom line is, we are taking appropriate actions to ensure we move to generate target returns in every market that we participate decisively and with urgency.","With that, let\u2019s look at our current financial outlook for the non-China portion of GMI. As mentioned before, despite improvements versus 2018, we lost money in 2019. A significant turnaround effort with clear strategies for each of these markets is being executed to return these markets to profitability as soon as possible. Overall, we\u2019re targeting a $2 billion improvement in our EBIT-adjusted earnings to mid-single-digit returns in the medium term and ROIC of 20% in the medium term. This is really a critical year. 2020 will be a critical year for GMI. We\u2019re committed to significant improvement in 2020 and achieving segment profitability in 2021 as a key milestone on that journey to profitability.","The most significant driver of the South America improvement is defending our market share leadership with a new lineup of great products, also with an optimized manufacturing footprint and contributions from all of our key stakeholders across the region: our suppliers, our dealers, our unions and of course, governments. Across the remaining GMI countries and markets, we\u2019re executing a significant business transformation through core market growth and partnerships that I mentioned earlier. One of the major elements of our strategy is the introduction of a new generation of vehicles referred to as our global family of vehicles. You\u2019ve heard us refer to it in the past as GEM. And these were launched last year, and I\u2019ll talk more about that shortly.","One challenge we\u2019ve seen over the last several years, especially in South America, has been macro pressures. We\u2019re expecting a gradual recovery over the coming years, but you\u2019ve heard that before and we\u2019ve heard that before as well. So in parallel, we\u2019re executing actions to derisk our financials, creating natural hedge where possible. So let\u2019s zoom in on a few of the key markets, starting with South America. As I mentioned, GM leads the market in both volume and market share, and we have for nearly 20 years in South America.","We have a long and proud legacy here and our reputation shows it. In fact, Chevrolet\u2019s brand health in South America is the strongest of that brand anywhere in the world. South America loves Chevrolet and so do we. As I mentioned, the greatest challenge to our position in South America is the macroeconomic volatility. As all of you know, currencies have significantly devalued, the industry has contracted and inflation is significant across all the key markets. So we\u2019ve restructured, taking our breakeven point down by 40%. And by working with all of our stakeholders, we\u2019ve gained significant contributions, helping us define a path to a viable and sustainable business model across South America.","We\u2019re also working to streamline and integrate our South America product portfolio, optimizing our manufacturing footprint with a focus on capacity utilization and increased localization efforts, which again will significantly reduce our FX exposure. Now as I said, we do expect gradual improvement in the macroeconomics, which combined with our new product launches and restructuring efforts will help us reach our target of profit improvement of over $1 billion in this region. Let me move on to Korea. Korea is another market where we\u2019ll continue to optimize and grow.","Early in 2018, we focused on optimizing our manufacturing footprint to match the demand for that region and our global demand. This led demand. This led to the closure of our Gunsan facility in 2018 and the subsequent sale of that facility in 2019. This was a bold and difficult, yet needed step in structural cost reductions. Korea is a key production sourcing and engineering hub for General Motors, both for the Korean domestic market as well as for global vehicle and component export and global engineering support. In fact, Korea is the home to one of our very important engineering base. We have over 3,000 engineers located in Korea who have historically taken the lead in developing some of our small vehicles.","We\u2019ll continue to fully leverage those very capable resources for our global product development. It\u2019s critical that we retain very strong alignment between our management and the workforce, which has historically been difficult in Korea. With the strong support of the Korean government and our Korean supply base, which is also outstanding, we will keep the Korean operations competitive and sustainable. As a result of our restructuring efforts, we\u2019ve eliminated $0.5 billion in structural costs, supporting our objective to secure a competitive footprint and achieve enterprise profitability from this year onward in Korea.","Now, let me talk for a little bit about product and really the engine of our growth and our return to profitability across GMI. And that\u2019s, as I mentioned earlier, this global family of vehicles. Here\u2019s a couple of them here, the notchback and the hatchback. This family of vehicles really simplifies our global architecture. We\u2019re leveraging global designs and sharing components across the entire globe. This architecture also enhances our profitability by bringing significant scale to our sourcing and improving manufacturing efficiency. So the initial launches are now complete in key markets, such as South America and China, and we\u2019re in the process of launching in Mexico as we speak.","Let me talk a little more specifically about our first vehicle from this family in South America shown here, which is the Onix that launched last September. The Onix brand has been a volume leader for us in South America. In fact, it has been the number one vehicle in Brazil for several years. Based on this outstanding design, the rich interior, the high safety and connectivity content shown here, the market reaction has been incredible. Slightly likes Cadillacs, the Brazilians love the Onix. This is a great vehicle. And it now accounts for 40% of our sales in Brazil and Argentina. And it\u2019s picked up 10% segment share since its launch last September. And all of this at a higher profit level than the vehicle it replaced.","So this is the first of four vehicles that we\u2019ll launch on this platform. And let me assure you, the best is yet to come. Our team in South America will be launching a small SUV, shadow shown here, next month in March. And then two more vehicles will be launched by 2022. This global family of vehicles will eventually represent 75% of our sales in South America, and we will have sold more than 2 million units across GMI by the end of 2023. In short, the global family of vehicles is important for GM in these key growth markets, especially South America, where it is contributing $0.5 billion of profit improvement, helping us meet our financial objectives and replacing the previous product.","Let me just conclude with a couple of thoughts about the future of GMI. Over the past several years, we\u2019ve had significant focus on streamlining our operations and strengthening our partnerships to deliver a winning portfolio. We will continue to focus on profitability in these regions. We\u2019ve made great progress with our market leadership in South America, great progress in streamlining the operations, specifically in Korea and throughout the GMIO regions. And with this new group of global vehicles, I am confident that we will be set up for profitability in the years to come. As all of you know, this is a very dynamic, fast-moving environment with a variety of challenges and opportunities. Our GM International team will continue to act fast, focus on profitability in every market that we serve and deliver on our commitments. So with that, I\u2019d like to introduce Dan Ammann, who\u2019s going to talk to us about the future of Cruise, and I thank you for the time.","Dan Ammann","Okay. Hi everyone. At Cruise, we have a point of view that the cost of transportation today is too high. It costs us too many lives, it costs too much time, it costs us too much money and it costs us too much impact to the planet. And we have equal conviction that self-driving technology deployed at large scale in an all-electric and shared mode is the single most powerful thing that we can do to reduce that cost of transportation that we have today. And so it\u2019s our mission at Cruise to make that technology as safe as possible and get it deployed as rapidly as possible so that we can have the impact of saving millions of lives that are lost on the road every year, make the impact of reshaping our cities and making them more livable for humans instead of setting aside a lot of space for cars and make the impact of giving people back billions of hours of their time that they spend stuck behind the wheel of the car every year and make the impact of making transportation more accessible and more affordable for everybody.","The scope of the mission that we\u2019re on, however, is very, very significant, and it is not for the faint of heart. Just getting to the minimum viable product, that initial vehicle that can drive more safely than a human is probably the engineering challenge of our generation and it takes a major commitment of resources to get us just to that point in time. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve configured Cruise the way we have over the last few years. We\u2019re assembling a team of thousands of the world\u2019s very best engineers. We\u2019ve put together several billion dollars of capital to support us on the journey. We have very deep integration between Cruise and General Motors and then more recently with Honda as well, and that gives us an ability to not just solve the core technology but to bring a vehicle to the equation that can help in fulfilling the mission. And we have built a number of other strong partnerships to help us on our journey.","However, several billion dollars and a few thousand engineers is pretty significant on the one hand, but it\u2019s actually very small scale relative to the magnitude of the commercial opportunity that lays in front of us. It\u2019s not every day that you have an opportunity to bring a truly transformational technology to a multitrillion-dollar market opportunity. And the benefit of approaching a market like transportation is, we know how big this market is. We know that we\u2019re dealing with a multitrillion-dollar opportunity. We know what the existing product in the market is. And we know what we need to build to be better than that existing product. So as we think about the market opportunity, we think about it in four major buckets.","The first is moving people. Unsurprisingly, this is the biggest part of the opportunity. And we think on a global basis, the total addressable market that we\u2019re talking about here is a $5 trillion market opportunity. And the approach that we plan to take to that market is to come to market on a fully vertically integrated basis, from the core technology, to the vehicle, to the consumer-facing service. We also see opportunities for selected technology partnerships with other participants in the space. After the opportunity around moving people is the opportunity around moving things, delivery, logistics and so on. I think all of our lives are becoming much more centered around things coming to us rather than us going to them. Delivery, online, e-commerce, all of that is growing at a pretty rapid rate.","We think this today is a $2 trillion market opportunity. And the mindset that we have in approaching this market is that we will partner with existing logistics platforms and existing delivery providers and provide them with an AV network and an AV technology stack that will allow them to fulfill their businesses on a much more efficient basis. Beyond the businesses of moving people and moving things, we see significant opportunities around the data insights that we gather from operating our technology. We see significant opportunities around offering consumers experience, user experience when they\u2019re spending time in our vehicles.","So any way that you want to slice this, we\u2019re approaching and taking on what is a multi, multitrillion-dollar market opportunity, the business of transportation on the roads of the world. So the question then becomes, quite obviously, how do you take on and make progress against a multitrillion-dollar market opportunity? And so the approach and the mindset that we bring to this is actually incredibly simple. Our goal in the simplest possible terms is to build a superior product. It\u2019s to build a product that is better than what people have as transportation alternatives today.","And we think about that on four main dimensions. The first and the most important for us right now is to reach a superhuman level of safety performance, to build a vehicle that can drive more safely than the average human driver in a given operating domain. This is the first big technical threshold to clear, and that\u2019s what a majority of our energy is focused on right now. The second dimension is to build a better user experience, so better for you, right? So safer is great, but if it\u2019s not a better user experience, people aren\u2019t going to use it. So we need to build something that delivers an awesome and consistent and predictable experience rather than the roll of the dice that you have with a lot of transportation alternatives today.","The third dimension and the one, I think, that\u2019s had the least focus in the dialogue around self-driving so far is to make this ultra affordable, right? This is perhaps the single biggest lever that we see for unlocking addressable market opportunity is to take the cost of transportation way down relative to what people pay today either to have someone drive for them or to drive themselves. And we think this is the biggest single lever to unlock very large-scale commercial opportunity.","And then finally, we need to build something that\u2019s better for the planet, right? We talked about the fundamental problems with transportation today. You heard Mary talk about zero emissions and zero congestion and zero accidents. And this is the technology that can actually unlock and actually deliver to those objectives. So what we\u2019re going to do for the balance of this discussion is go through each of these four product dimensions and discuss how we\u2019re attacking each one of these to build a product that is superior to the transportation alternatives that are on the road for us today.","And we have high conviction that we need to be working on all of these things at the same time. Just building technology that can drive more safer than a human doesn\u2019t help you solve this problem at the scale and at the magnitude that we wanted. You need to build the core technology to make it safer. You need to offer a better and more compelling experience. You need to offer that at a really, really attractive price point and do that in a way that you\u2019re actually advancing humankind and making the planet a better place to be.","So let\u2019s dive into the core technology dimension of this and the progress that we\u2019re making on building technology that can drive more safely than a human driver, what we like to call superhuman performance, and that\u2019s everything that we\u2019re aiming for. In the core of the AV technology stack, we think about a few different dimensions. We think about the core AV software and the core purpose-built AV hardware. And that\u2019s really the core technology stack, the software and hardware stack. And then we have a second dimension that we think about, which is all of the infrastructure and testing and security that needs to be built around that to enable that core technology stack to improve at the fastest possible rate.","And one of the things you\u2019re going to hear repeatedly in the balance of this discussion is our maniacal focus on rate of change and rate of improvement and rate of progress because we\u2019re working on a problem that is measured and dealt with and thinking about exponential issues, not incremental issues.","And so as we go forward, I\u2019d like you to sort of suspend the mindset of 5% improvement in sales or two basis point improvements in margins and start to think about rate of change on exponential basis, multiple basis, very big percentage changes because that\u2019s the rate at which everything is moving in the world that we\u2019re operating in here.","And at Cruise, we actually think about two major products that we\u2019re working on inside the company from a technology point of view. The first product is, of course, the core AV software and hardware stack. And we have a huge amount of resources committed against that. But the second and equally important and much less obvious product that we\u2019re working on is all of the infrastructure and testing and tools that allows us to make incredibly rapid progress on product number one.","And what\u2019s little understood is we actually have many more people, more engineers working on product number two than we do have working on product number one. And all the engineers working on product number two are building infrastructure and tools and testing and security and so on that allow the engineers working on product number one to make incredibly rapid progress. And that\u2019s, I think, a really important point I\u2019d like to emphasize.","So we\u2019re also doing the majority of our testing, as most of you know, in downtown San Francisco. You see behind us just sort of some of the day-to-day things that we\u2019re dealing with as we make progress there. And we think testing in these super complex environments is incredibly important because it gives us a really rich experience set. I think these guys, their van broke down. Gives us incredibly rich experience set of things that we encounter every day. So the total distance that you see us drive here in this, I think it\u2019s a 60-second video clip, I think we drive about a quarter of a mile in this video clip.","And we drive several thousand miles a day in San Francisco. So you can imagine, take this, multiply it by 10,000, and that\u2019s the kind of experience that we have every single day and the things that we\u2019re seeing, the edge cases that we\u2019re uncovering. And it gives us just an incredibly rich set of information and allows us to make progress in an extremely rapid rate. But it also sort of happens that the dense urban environments not only offer the most technically interesting environment to make rapid progress, but it\u2019s also, obviously, I think, fairly obviously, where the biggest initial commercial opportunity comes.","So we\u2019re testing and learning and training in the places that offer the biggest initial commercial opportunity, and we think that\u2019s also incredibly important. So I talked about big changes and big rates of change. We\u2019ve grown Cruise exponentially from the time that General Motors and Cruise came together nearly four years ago, early in 2016. Last year, we grew the organization by about 60%. We now are nearly 1,800 people today inside of Cruise. And north of 75% of everybody at Cruise is an engineer and working on the core engineering problem.","So over this time, we\u2019re bringing just an incredibly powerful engineering fire hose, as we call it, of talent and know-how to the problem. And just the resources that we\u2019re bringing to bear every year are growing really dramatically. So 60% growth on that in 2019. This is a company photo from actually April of last year. So it turns out that the number of people in this picture also approximates the number of people that we brought into the organization last year. But it\u2019s not just a numbers game of bringing in amazing talent, but it\u2019s going into \u2013 we\u2019re reaching deep into the biggest technology companies and pulling out the very, very best minds to come and join this mission and to work with us. And we\u2019re incredibly excited about our ability to recruit and retain the very, very best talent and minds to put against this challenge.","So what have all those people achieved over the last period of time? And to give you a sense for this idea of rate of progress and rate of change and rate of improvement. So just as one example, we have reduced the time between our major AV software releases by 98% over the course of one year, so a 98% reduction. So that means that we\u2019re releasing about \u2013 it\u2019s about 45x more frequently now than we were about a year ago. So you think about the impact that, that has on our ability to take all of that information that we\u2019re getting from driving in this crazy environment to understand it, learn from it, implement change, put that change in simulation, put that change on the car, see and make sure that we\u2019re continuing to advance at an incredibly rapid rate.","So this is just an example of a huge acceleration factor. Another is the testing and simulation frameworks that we\u2019ve built. What you see on one side here is real-life. And what you see on the other side is a simulation of a similar scene. So we take interesting scenes and interesting things we learn about. We drop them into our simulation world that we call The Matrix. And we build really interesting, not just replay of what happened, but it gives us the ability to fork reality at points in time and create alternative scenarios around that, that allow us to learn and not just understand what happened but what else could have happened as we play with time as a dimension, backwards and forwards. So these are incredibly powerful tools that we\u2019ve built, all built entirely in-house. And it\u2019s the intersection and integration of the testing and simulation and the testing and accumulation of learning on the road and having those two things tie together in a really tight way that drives a really powerful rate of progress.","Another dimension on the machine learning side, where I think we\u2019re still very much at the relatively early days of the impact that machine learning is going to have on self-driving. It\u2019s a huge part of, obviously, the core of our technology and what we\u2019re doing. But to make this as powerful as possible, we want to improve our models as quickly as we can. And so we\u2019ve had a lot of people working on that product number two side, of the page I showed you earlier, building a machine learning platform that allows us to serve up data and train models at a much, much faster rate than we were doing a year ago.","So over the course of one year, we reduced the time that it takes us to train our ML models by more than 80%. And so you can figure out what that does to our overall rate of progress has a really significant impact. So those are just a handful of examples of things that we\u2019re doing to drive a faster and faster rate of development and faster and faster rate of progress as we get out onto the longer sort of longer tail of this challenge of building a vehicle that can drive with superhuman performance. And so you may be sitting there saying, well, that\u2019s kind of interesting, but tell me kind of where you are on this journey, how far along are you? And how far do you have left to go to get to that initial superhuman performance threshold?","So taking all of those things that we\u2019ve put together, increased engineering resources, all of the tools, infrastructure, testing, rate of change and so on, we\u2019ve been able to sustain for about four years now about a 10x improvement every year in our performance against our core safety metric. And again, this is the metric that we\u2019re most focused on because that\u2019s the thing that we need to clear to deliver the superhuman level of performance.","So, think about a 10x rate of change, think about doing that year in and year out for four years now, that adds up fairly quickly. Multiply that out, that\u2019s a 10,000x improvement in performance over four years. So I asked you to suspend percentage thinking and to think about order of magnitude thinking, 10,000x improvement, four orders of magnitude performance improvement over the last number of years.","And while we\u2019re not going to share with you today our internal metrics on this, you can look at some of the external metrics that are out there, particularly the California DMV Very difficult to do comparisons across companies with this data, but it can be a useful signal for rate of change of what companies are doing. And if you look at that data for Cruise over the last four years, it also suggests about a 10,000x rate of improvement and also suggests roughly 10x a year in terms of how that rate of change is coming on.","Again, this is not the data that we actually rely on, but it\u2019s an external indicator that\u2019s out there that can give you a clue as to the overall rate of progress. So really, really significant progress in a very \u2013 we\u2019re getting into a very steep exponential ramp at this point in time. And interestingly, we\u2019ve done that while dramatically increasing the complexity of the operating domain that we\u2019re working in. You go back to the beginning of 2016, we were driving a handful of fixed routes around SoMa in San Francisco. We\u2019re now driving every day the entire 7x7 of San Francisco, every street, every block and covering incredibly complex terrain.","So while we\u2019ve expanded the operating domain and significantly increased the complexity of what we\u2019re doing, we\u2019ve also made really dramatic progress on our core safety metrics here proxied by this external data.","So putting all that together, you can think about this as kind of two exponential forces working against each other. On the one hand, we\u2019re getting out on the very long tail of this problem, and we\u2019ve been expanding the operating domain and increasing the complexity. And so we have an exponentially more difficult thing that we\u2019re trying to solve each instance of time, each period of time.","On the other hand, we\u2019re bringing exponentially more powerful tools and resources to that equation. And so you\u2019ve got these two very powerful forces working \u2013 taking the forces to try and solve this increasingly complex challenge. And so we\u2019ve made every year an order of magnitude or a 10x, an order of magnitude improvement every year over the last four years. We have less than one order of magnitude of improvement to go to get to superhuman performance in this environment. And so we\u2019re getting in the zone. We\u2019re getting relatively close to approaching that level of performance.","So the next obvious question you might ask was, well, tell us exactly when that\u2019s going to happen, which I can\u2019t do. And the reason I can\u2019t do that is because the nature of these forces working against each other, exponentially more challenging, exponentially more powerful tools, it\u2019s very hard to predict exactly how those are going to intersect and how long this is going to take. The progress that we\u2019ve made has been dramatic and over a longer period of time, pretty consistent.","Inside of that, there\u2019s obviously noise, right? We\u2019re working on something that has never been done before so it\u2019s inherently impossible to predict exactly how that\u2019s going to unfold. But we are getting right in the zone and we\u2019re making really dramatic progress and we\u2019re bringing really, really powerful tools to the last long tail piece of this equation so we feel very good about where we are relative to that superhuman overall threshold.","So that gives you a sense for where we are on the core technology, progress towards the superhuman threshold. But as I said, that\u2019s really just one part of the overall equation. We also need to build an experience that is better, better for you as a user, something that\u2019s consistent and something that\u2019s predictable. So to that end, while we\u2019ve been working on core technology, in parallel, we\u2019ve got a huge team of Cruise, General Motors engineers, Honda engineers working on the Cruise Origin, which is the vehicle that we unveiled a couple of weeks ago in San Francisco.","And what the Cruise Origin brings to the table is this massive enabler of a really great user experience and doing that in an ultra low cost, and I\u2019ll come back to the cost in a minute. But the point is, we want to be able to deliver people a very predictable, very consistent, really awesome experience. And one of the things we really want to unlock with the Cruise Origin is to make shared rides not suck, right? Shared rides today aren\u2019t great. Anyone who\u2019s taken shared rides knows that it\u2019s not a tremendous experience. We believe that to improve congestion in our cities and to reduce space taken up by cars in our cities, we need to make shared rides a compelling experience. And so that\u2019s been a huge sort of central theme as we\u2019ve been designing the Origin.","And so the interior experience in here, we\u2019ve unlocked a ridiculous amount of space in this vehicle by taking out all of the stuff that you don\u2019t need in a regular car by taking out the driver controls and the internal combustion engine and the gas tank and all of these other things that a normal car has taking up space. We pulled all of that out.","And so in the space of a pretty limited vehicle footprint, we\u2019ve built an incredibly spacious interior, a really great user experience. And when you sit in this \u2013 and all of you will have this opportunity \u2013 you\u2019ll get a sense for, I\u2019d be happy to share a ride in here because I got tons of space between me, the person next to me, I\u2019m nowhere near close to the person across from me. And if we can do all that with a great experience at a super low cost will really increase the amount of shared transportation which we think is incredibly important to reach the societal goals that we have.","But in addition to working on the core technology and on the vehicle, we\u2019re also developing the totality of the product experience for the user. We\u2019re doing this today with an internal rideshare program at Cruise. All of our employees have the Cruise app on their phone. And they\u2019re using our vehicles every day to get around, to get to and from work or elsewhere. And what that\u2019s giving us is real-world experience and learning on some things that sound basic but are actually really difficult to learn and optimize. Ride quality, it\u2019s not just can I drive more safely than a human, it\u2019s can I drive like a human or in a human-like way and in a way that\u2019s not surprising or hard to predict for people.","How do you dispatch these vehicles? How do you estimate ETAs for them to get where they go? What does the routing look like? Does it look similar or different to the routing of a human-driven vehicle? How does the trip time compare? How do they pick up and drop off? How is that going to work? How does customer assistance engage? How are we going to engage with someone who wants help or wants to talk with somebody when they\u2019re in their car? So there\u2019s all of these other product areas that are getting worked on in parallel, in parallel with the vehicle and in parallel with the core technology.","Similarly, on the business of moving things, away from moving people, we\u2019re in a pilot partnership with DoorDash at the moment. We have other pilots that are under discussion and development. And what this is teaching us about is, how do we partner with another company on a B2B basis? What does that integration look like? How does that work? What are we learning about vehicle configuration and user behavior and technology integration and so on? So while, again, we\u2019re working on all of these mainstream things, we\u2019re doing these other learnings and other pilot programs along the side in parallel.","So we\u2019ve talked about core technology that\u2019s superhuman from a safety point of view. We talked about building a better experience and the Cruise Origin is a huge unlock of that. Let\u2019s talk about affordability because this is probably, like I said, the biggest single lever to get us where we want to get to. This is the economics of the rideshare business as it exists today. You can all look at the public filings of these companies. And what we know is that the customer pays money and the vast majority of that money does not go to the transportation company, it goes to the driver for them to cover their cost of their time, vehicle, everything else.","Then there\u2019s the cost of running the business, the incentives for drivers and passengers, cost of operations, R&D, customer support, all of those things. And the economics of that business, even at the scale that it\u2019s grown to today, result in a loss on a unit economic basis. We believe that the economics of the business that we\u2019re building, of the product that we\u2019re building will be fundamentally different. And they\u2019ll be fundamentally different in the beginning. But more importantly, they will change at a really rapid rate over time.","So it\u2019s not hard to imagine that we should be able to offer a product at a lower price to the user than rideshare today but take all of that for us as revenue because we\u2019re not sharing it with someone who has to run their vehicle and so on. We take that money and obviously cover the costs of the fleet and the depreciation and the operations and the infrastructure and the engineering and all of the things that are required to support that.","But all of our modeling tells us today that even in the early days, even in the early days of this, we should be able to demonstrate positive unit economics. But more importantly than demonstrating that initially is we have very high conviction that we can demonstrate an extraordinarily rapid rate of change in the unit economics over time. And that we know what the drivers are on the cost curve to take us down to a place where this gets really, really interesting as I\u2019ll expand on here.","So again, back to this mindset of significant change reshaping and rethinking the way things are done today and big reductions in cost. So let\u2019s talk about the first one which is the Cruise Origin. Not only do we need to be better than the current transportation alternatives that are on the road today, we also need to be much more cost competitive than whatever other AV offerings could potentially be out there at that time. And so everything that we\u2019ve done around the Origin has been built around two things: one, an awesome experience; and two, the ability to deliver this at an ultra low cost.","And so a handful of the key attributes of the Origin that allow that are a useful life of over 1 million miles, which is more than 6 times more than your average car. And that\u2019s enabled by the fact that we\u2019ve built the vehicle to be extraordinarily modular so we can upgrade and rev hardware and technology incredibly quickly and easily. We can replace parts that are worn and upgrade interiors and so on incredibly quickly. And so you should think about this as much more of an aircraft MRO kind of operating model than running a traditional vehicle on the road. So really a long useful life, really high degree of modularity, all-electric, huge and obvious enabler for cost, right? Like the idea that you\u2019re going to build the future of transportation and have it not be all-electric is just preposterous. So clearly, that\u2019s a huge advantage.","And then finally, on the BoM cost side, and this is the thing that I think surprised a lot of people when we revealed the Origin a couple of weeks ago, is that we are able to build this vehicle at an incredibly low total cost, not just the base vehicle, but everything that goes into it from a technology point of view as well and able to rev that significantly over time. So huge, huge cost advantage for us in the Cruise Origin. Away from the base vehicle itself and then we start to talk about the compute and the sensors and so on.","Unsurprisingly, probably, there\u2019s just massive change in costs going on. On this dimension, the chart here shows our compute cost reduction plan. We are developing multiple generations of compute architecture in parallel. We have a generation that\u2019s on the car today. We\u2019re building now the early builds of our next generation that\u2019s going to go into the vehicles this year. We have under very active development the generation that will be the first gen that goes into the Cruise Origin when it starts production. And the cost reduction between what\u2019s in the cars today and what will go into the Cruise Origin on Day 1 is an 85% reduction in compute cost. So this, again, it\u2019s not a 5% or a 10% tweak. It\u2019s a huge, basically, an order of magnitude change in cost reduction as we move forward there.","Very similar story on the sensor side, sensor suite, it\u2019s the same kind of level of activity and change going on in innovation and optimization of sensors, really exciting on that front as well. On the operational side, so we\u2019re running a fleet today. We run a fleet, obviously, for mileage accumulation to learn the kinds of things you saw in the little video there. We run the fleet for the rideshare service that we offer to our employees.","And so we\u2019re learning a lot about even at sort of 100 scale like running \u2013 what it means to run a fleet and how you drive utilization. Between last summer and now, we\u2019ve had a pretty significant increase in utilization. We\u2019ll have another step change in that this year. And between last summer and the end of this year, we\u2019ll have a 2.5x increase in our utilization rate. So again, these are things that are moving incredibly rapidly and having a huge impact on our rate of progress.","Infrastructure, we get a lot of questions on, well, how much charging infrastructure do you need? What\u2019s that going to cost? That feels like an expensive thing. We already operate, by far, the largest charging infrastructure setup in the Bay Area in totality. We have very significant learnings going on, on this side. And our infrastructure team, working with our vendors on the charger side have been able to realize already between 2017 and the chargers that we\u2019re installing in our new charging location right now, an 85% reduction in cost per kilowatt of charging capacity.","So again, these are huge percentage reductions just moving these numbers really, really dramatically. And the reason all of that matters and the reason all of that is important is back to this point, that to unlock the market opportunity, we need to figure out how to drive costs down, not just initially, that\u2019s important, but how we drive costs down at a really significant way, at a very high rate of change over a very long period of time.","So let\u2019s talk about what commercialization can look like in the early days and how it could unfold over time. If you take the City of San Francisco and you take just the existing rideshare business that goes on in that city today. From a customer pay point of view, we think that\u2019s about a $3 billion market today in terms of what customers are handing over to take rides in cars today. And that\u2019s happening at about $3.75, somewhere between $3 and $4 a mile average cost in terms of what customers are paying.","And so you got a $3 billion market happening at $3 to $4 a mile. And if we show up with a product that is safer and a better experience and lower cost, we believe we will take a meaningful chunk of that market. So it\u2019s not hard to imagine that just based on one city and one earlier version of product, you could build a $1 billion business out of that. That\u2019s step number one.","Then let\u2019s say that we expanded that to the top five rideshare markets. That\u2019s about a $15 billion business today in terms of what customers are paying to take rideshare rides in those markets today. So now let\u2019s say we take a meaningful share of that business because we\u2019ve got a product that\u2019s safer and better and cheaper for people to use. So now you\u2019ve built a several billion-dollar business based on five markets. And to do that, you\u2019re talking about tens of thousands of cars. You\u2019re not talking about hundreds of thousands of cars; you\u2019re talking about tens of thousands of Cruise Origins deployed in those markets.","Then if we expand to the rideshare business as we know it today in the United States, that\u2019s roughly just under a $50 billion customer pay business today. Once you get outside of the most dense urban environments, the price point comes down today. So it\u2019s about a \u2013 more of a $2 a mile business on average, we think. By the time that we\u2019re scaling into this market opportunity, we will have made dramatically more progress on the cost curves that I showed you earlier, extending that rate of improvement and rate of change that we\u2019ve had there. Then get it down to $1 a mile starts to get really interesting.","So, what happens at that point in time is you now, you\u2019ve left rideshare and you\u2019re now approaching the cost of owning and operating your own car. So if you own and operate your own car and you drive 8,000 miles a year or less, cost you $1 a mile to do that. So now we get to the point where we can deliver an awesome experience, safer than a human, and we can deliver that at a cost that\u2019s competitive with the cost of driving your own car and we give you back the time for free.","So the time you spent behind the wheel, you get back. This is a $500 billion market. And then you can go further and say, what if we get it down to $0.60, which is the average cost of car ownership in the United States, turns out that\u2019s a $1 trillion market. So apply whatever market share you think you might get from that and now you\u2019ve built a really big business. And then if you go back to the market opportunity I showed you at the beginning and you take it global and you add in delivery and logistics and in-car experience and data monetization, you grow the market opportunity again.","So the point here is, we\u2019re bringing an extremely disruptive transformational technology to a multitrillion-dollar market opportunity, and we can begin that in the places where the economics make the most compelling sense. And we can scale that. And even out of the gates, we\u2019re building an interesting size business, but the opportunity beyond that is really, really significant.","So safer, better, more affordable but there\u2019s also this dimension of having a positive impact on the planet. If you go back to where I began talking about the cost of transportation being too high in terms of lives lost and money spent and time wasted and the impact on the environment, we\u2019re not going to \u2013 the center of that is the fact that in the United States today, more than 75% of us still drive to work in a gasoline-powered car by ourselves. And until we change that equation and until we move people to all-electric and until we move people to shared transportation and until we take the human out of the loop on the driving task, we\u2019re not going to solve those fundamental issues around transportation.","So a few fun facts to think about on framing that. In the United States today, the car parc, there\u2019s about 270 million cars in the United States today. There\u2019s somewhere between, no one knows precisely, there\u2019s somewhere between 1 billion and 2 billion parking spots in the United States. So every car has somewhere between 4 or 6 or 4 and 8 parking spaces attached to it. And you all as financial types can think about it this way. That\u2019s a $4 trillion investment in vehicles that are used about 5% of the time and it\u2019s a $4 trillion investment in real estate to park those vehicles on for the other 95% of the time that we\u2019re not using them. So think about the inefficiency and inherent cost that comes with that from a financial point of view, but also just the amount of space that it takes up in our cities, the cost of all of that.","We think this self-driving technology deployed in this mode is probably the most powerful lever we have to radically increase the share of miles traveled that are electrified. Obviously, bringing EVs to market and scaling that will be important, but driving it on a very, very high utilization framework is really important as well. And then it\u2019s giving people back the time that we all spend stuck behind the wheel in traffic. And then there\u2019s the human cost. Over the last decade \u2013 we don\u2019t have 2019 numbers yet \u2013 so from 2010 to 2018, so nine years, more than 300,000 lives lost on the roads of the United States. So think about the human cost of all of that.","Our aspiration, initial aspiration, is to get to a superhuman level of performance to be measurably better than a human driver so we can deploy this technology and make the roads slightly better by doing that. But that\u2019s just the beginning. Our goal of 10x improvement every year is going to continue long after that point in time. And our aspiration is get to the point where the number is as close to zero as possible. And that may sound far-fetched and far away but I\u2019d point you to another mode of transportation that we all use all the time that\u2019s pretty close to that. Commercial airlines in the United States in the last nine years, one fatality. And there\u2019s no reason that we shouldn\u2019t be aiming for that kind of aspiration on the roads in the vehicles that we\u2019re using every single day. And so that is our safety aspiration.","So let me leave you with a few thoughts. It\u2019s my view that the societal forces at work that make transportation today so costly for us make it inevitable this technology will be deployed at very large scale. It\u2019s in my view, completely inevitable that that\u2019s going to happen. Next point, the barriers to entry to what we\u2019re doing are extraordinarily high. There are very few companies that have assembled the talent and the financial resources and the partnerships and the integration with OEMs that is necessary to have a chance of making this work and making it work with large-scale. So the field is thinning out really quickly in terms of companies that are on a track to actually make this happen a big scale.","The next thing I\u2019d leave you with is that the core technology, MVP is entirely a win not if, discussion. And I talked about the timing of the interplay of these exponential forces and how that\u2019s going to \u2013 how those are going to offset and why that makes very specific timing difficult to predict but I think I gave you a pretty clear sense of how close we are and what\u2019s likely involved in this last step to get to that initial superhuman level of performance.","The market opportunity is measurable and known and is measured in trillions of dollars, right? We know how big the market is. We know what the existing products in the market are, we can measure them on experience and cost and safety. And so we know what the thresholds are to build a product that\u2019s better than those things, and all of our energy is going to do that. So this isn\u2019t a \u2013 let\u2019s build it and \u2013 let thing. We know what the existing product is and we know what we need to do to build something that\u2019s better than that.","I\u2019ll tell you that the regulatory backdrop is fairly constructive. NHTSA and DOT are being fairly clear in communicating their desire to see this happen. And so we feel fairly good from a regulatory point of view. The investment required in dollar versus the upside potential. We talked about \u2013 this is a multibillion-dollar activity, and that in and of itself is a barrier to entry, but it\u2019s a multibillion-dollar investment to unlock a multitrillion dollar market opportunity. And so from an ROI or potential upside relative to investment, it\u2019s a hugely powerful division.","And so the final thing I\u2019d leave you with is that we have extremely high conviction in the impact that this technology is going to have and we have extremely high conviction in the impact that this technology is going to have and we have extremely high conviction on the rate of progress therefore making, and we are very much in execution mode. Thank you.","Rocky Gupta","Okay. So I have a feeling that this is the kind of crowd that likes to see numbers after lunch. So the finance guy and an engineer that warms my heart, so let\u2019s get seated back again. What we\u2019ll do is we\u2019ll have a short video and followed by that, we\u2019ll have Dhivya Suryadevara.","Dhivya Suryadevara","Good afternoon, and thanks, everyone, for being here today. So in my section, I\u2019d like to talk about two main topics. Firstly, I want to talk about our calendar year 2019 performance and our outlook for 2020; I want to give you more color on that. And importantly, I want to pull together what you heard today and give you a framework on how to think about our business in my second part of the presentation.","So let\u2019s get started. 2019 was an eventful year. We had a share of challenges, but I also think we had a number of opportunities that we capitalized on that allowed us to deliver the results that we did. So let\u2019s take a quick look at what worked and what some of the challenges were.","You heard a lot about trucks today and crossovers and the performance of our new launches. That was an important tailwind as we think about our performance in 2019. The cost savings we announced in November of 2018 remain on track. In fact, in the calendar year 2019, we were ahead of track and we remain on track for the rest of the calendar year 2020 to deliver what we committed to.","GM Financial was a bright spot from a performance standpoint. The business continues to grow and generate record levels of profitability. And finally, from a cultural standpoint, I\u2019ve been talking to you about cash and cash conversion for about a year now. And I think the results we have demonstrated and what we predict for 2020, I think really demonstrate the commitment of the entire team on this very important metric. And I\u2019ll talk more about that later in the presentation.","Let\u2019s talk about the challenges. The strike had a meaningful impact on 2019 results. The China business you heard Matt talk about today and what we\u2019re doing there to get that business back on track. South America was volatile \u2013 more volatile than what we predicted at the beginning of the year. And you heard Steve talk about the steps we\u2019re taking there as well.","I think the takeaway is, relative to what I talked to you about a year ago, there were a number of puts and takes. But the underlying business remains exceptionally strong and that\u2019s what takes us into 2020 with a strong outlook.","Let\u2019s look at the actual results, the numbers. EPS, we delivered $4.82 against an outlook of $4.50 to $4.80. And from a cash flow standpoint, we generated $1.1 billion against our guidance of zero to $1 billion.","Now, I think it\u2019s important to also look at these results on a strike adjusted basis because it will help frame our 2020 performance and it will allow you to look at apples-to-apples comparisons. From an EPS standpoint, we generated $6.71 on a strike adjusted basis. You may remember our original guidance last year, $6.50 to $7, so in line with our original guidance one year ago. Free cash flow, we generated $6.5 billion of cash, excluding the impact of the strike. And when you compare that against our original guidance of $4.5 billion to $6 billion, it was clearly a strong performance that demonstrates our focus in this important area.","I would like to quickly touch on regional performance before we move to 2020. North America had a strong performance, up $1 billion year-over-year. And that\u2019s primarily due to our launches, the strong performance of trucks, crossovers and cost savings. That helped offset international weakness around the globe. You see GMI on this page. That was primarily China down $800 million year-over-year, offset by international operations, excluding China, up $200 million year-over-year.","GM Financial, as I talked about, grew earnings and stood at $2.1 billion for calendar year 2019. Cruise and Corp sectors performed in line with expectations.","So the takeaway from this slide, excluding the impact of the strike, strong performance, especially in North America and GM Financial Operations.","So let\u2019s get into 2020. Before I get into the numbers, I want to frame for you the macro picture around the globe. We are predicting continued volatility in all of our key operating areas. In the U.S., we\u2019re expecting a mid-16 million light vehicle industry which is down about 0.5 million units compared to 2019. In China, as Matt talked about, we do expect a decline in industry, about 1 million units, prior to the impact of coronavirus.","Clearly, as Mary talked about, how the virus impact evolves would have an impact on 2020 performance, not just from a demand perspective, but potentially the global supply chain as well. And the whole team is working diligently to have contingency plans in place should this become a more serious situation.","In South America, we\u2019re expecting FX pressures to continue into 2020. You all see where the Brazilian real is and you see where the Argentine peso is. Those are the two main currencies that impact our operations in South America. And we\u2019re expecting in 2020 that those challenges will continue and we\u2019re managing our operations despite the volatility that we expect so that we are on a path to profitability irrespective of the FX environment.","Commodities have been up and down, and you\u2019ve seen steel and aluminum have backed off somewhat. But importantly, palladium and rhodium have been up significantly since December. Especially rhodium was up close to 100%; palladium and other 40%, and that\u2019s causing a significant headwind as well from a macro standpoint.","Next, I want to talk about key drivers before I get into numbers. I just covered macro and regulatory, which will be the biggest headwind that we\u2019re seeing in 2020. Way against that our specific performance, the factors that are specific to GM, whether it\u2019s launches or a full year of heavy-duty and light-duty and the cost savings that we have coming up \u2013 remaining from our $4 billion to $4.5 billion target that we\u2019ve set out for ourselves, they contribute favorably to 2020 performance.","I also want to talk for a minute about strike and strike recovery. In a normal environment, excluding the impact of the strike, when you see the industry go down, we will have had to take inventory down. Because of the strike, we have effectively overcorrected for the situation and we\u2019re building back dealer inventory, subject to the capacity constraints that we have on our vehicle lines. Mary and I talked about this last quarter that we\u2019re constrained from a capacity standpoints on some of our key vehicle lines. And the team is working together to get every unit we can across all of these, and you can see some of the results from a tailwind standpoint, offsetting the macro impact that we\u2019re expecting in 2020.","Now, obviously the industry level and the strike recovery is a toggle. If you see a higher industry, our ability to recover strike will be lower and vice versa. So we\u2019ll keep you updated on that as we go through the rest of the calendar year.","So the takeaways from this page, the first negative is offset fully by GM specific performance as well as lean inventory balancing out to about zero. So let\u2019s get into the numbers.","Our EPS diluted adjusted range this year is in the range of $5.75 to $6.25. To put it in context, we\u2019re expecting an impact from non-operating items of about $0.55 per share. What are these non-operating items? We\u2019ve talked about tax rate normalizing to a more sustainable level. 2019 was abnormally low. We\u2019ve talked about interest income being lower because of our cash balance. And as in every year, we are not expecting any tailwind or headwind from our investments in Lyft and PSA, so that it neutralizes the impact of that and it allows you to look at our operating performance and focus on the core performance here.","From a free cash flow standpoint, we\u2019re expecting $6 billion to $7.5 billion, despite the impact of the challenges that I talked about from a macro standpoint, and I will be walking for you both the EPS and the free cash flow in the next couple of pages. Before I do that, let me give you a run around the world from a regional outlook standpoint.","With all the actions we\u2019ve talked about the new launches and cost savings, we expect North America to be up year-over-year on a strike adjusted basis. So if you exclude the impact of strike, North American performance was strong in 2019. We expect it to be better in 2020.","In China, we expect continued industry and regulatory headwinds, as Matt talked about earlier. Clearly, with the virus situation, we expect a meaningfully lower equity income in China in the first quarter of 2020. And once the situation resolves, we\u2019re expecting an equity income in the range of about $200 million on a quarterly basis \u2013 on a run rate basis after the situation gets to be more stable one.","GM International, up slightly as a result of the number of actions that Steve talked about and the new launches that are happening in the region. GM Financial continues to grow their earning assets, but we expect residual values to normalize in 2020 and as a result their earnings to be flat to slightly down, but that would depend a lot on what\u2019s happening with residual values on a year-over-year basis.","I want to talk about cadence as well for a minute. As in the last several years, H2 we expect to be meaningfully stronger than H1, and, as I mentioned in China, the early part of the year to be weaker than the latter half of the year. So from a total company standpoint, the outlook for EBIT is flat despite the macro headwinds that I talked about. So let\u2019s get into this in a little bit more detail.","I\u2019d like to walk for you the impact of all of these three factors that I talked about, starting from EPS diluted adjusted for calendar year 2019 at $6.71 that I talked about. You first layer on macro headwinds, US-China, commodities and GMF. So that\u2019s the biggest headwind that we are expecting in 2020. But against that, the net impact of GM specific factors, as I talked about in the prior page, is a positive. There are some puts and takes within that column.","The biggest tailwind that we see in 2020 from a GM specific performance is the full-size SUV transition. And we\u2019ve talked about this before, how we expect to take downtime, and the ramp-up on our full-size SUVs with the level of change in the vehicles as well as the brand new architecture and three brands coming out of one architecture in one plant, we have major changeover related downtime. And we expect to see that to be the headwind that is on a GM specific basis that\u2019s most meaningful.","I talk to you about depreciation every year. This is secularly going up as catching up to the levels of CapEx that we\u2019ve had historically. On the positive side, launches and HDs continue to be strong, cost savings that I mentioned. And given the interest rate environment we\u2019re in, a small tailwind as well from pension standpoint.","I talked about strike recovery. A simple way to think about it, we expect to build about 80,000 units from a dealer inventory standpoint between year-end 2019 and year-end 2020. So you put all this together, EPS \u2013 EBIT roughly flat from the impact of operating items. And the new layer on top of that, the non-operating items, and that gets you to our EPS diluted adjusted outlook for the year.","Let\u2019s talk about cash flow. We generated $6.5 billion on a strike adjusted basis in 2019. The biggest headwind we see on cash flow is predictable, it\u2019s the impact of China dividend and the earnings \u2013 the year-over-year decline between 2018 and 2019 because China dividends are paid on a one-year lag basis. So that\u2019s $800 million coming out of China dividends declining from 2018 to 2019. But that headwind is more than offset by some of the tailwinds that we see. I talked about CapEx and CapEx normalization. We anticipate about $7 billion approximately in CapEx and in 2019 we achieved $7.5 billion. So there is a $500 million tailwind coming from CapEx.","GMF dividends are expected to roughly double in calendar year 2020. They paid $400 million, approximately, in 2019, and you see that roughly doubling \u2013 we see that roughly doubling in 2020. Put all this together, we see growth in free cash flow, and it gets you to the range of $6 billion to $7.5 billion that we talked about.","I also want to touch on the cash flow trajectory as well as cash conversion and give you a sense beyond 2020 of what to expect. When we first talked to you about cash conversion at the end of 2018, we were generating about $4 billion cash flow level, and that was approximately 44% conversion from a net income to cash flow basis. With the results in 2019, strike adjusted at $6.5 billion, it takes our conversion up to about 62%. And with the outlook we\u2019ve talked about in calendar year 2020 that takes our conversion to 65% to 70%. And you might wonder, when does that get to a close to 100%, and you\u2019ve been talking about 100%.","And if you think about the tailwinds and headwinds we\u2019ve had from a cash flow standpoint, the biggest tailwind we expect beyond 2020 has been GM Financial dividends, the rest of their earnings to the parent. And I\u2019ll talk about that in a few slides on what that potential could be.","And from an earnings standpoint, I\u2019ve also talked about depreciation and pension income and those will be earnings headwinds, but we expect to \u2013 we\u2019ll continue to work to offset that with true cash earnings as well, which will bring our conversion to an 80% to 90% level in the 2023 to 2025 time frame. Why not 100% yet? The pension does have a long tail and the payments follow the benefit payments \u2013 the schedule that retirees have set out. So that\u2019s the story here, and I think this is an important slide because this showcases for you why this is an important priority and how we\u2019re working to get that to the levels that we\u2019ve talked about before.","Okay. I want to touch briefly on operating efficiencies. We\u2019re on target to hit the CapEx levels that I talked about before, $7 billion in 2020, approximately. And from a cost savings standpoint, through calendar year 2019 we have achieved $3.3 billion of efficiencies. So, we have about $1 billion left to go in 2020. So, we remain on track and wanted to give you a quick update on that.","Let\u2019s talk about capital allocation. So, you have all that cash and what are we going to do with it? So from a free cash flow standpoint, you can see on this page, I talked about the $6 billion to $7.5 billion, which is really the net of operating cash flow and the CapEx that you see on this page. So, we have free cash flow of $6 billion to $7.5 billion. We also have potential source from selling non-operating assets like our investment in Lyft, which we\u2019ve been opportunistically selling and we expect to continue to do that.","In terms of uses of cash, you see that on the top right of the page. The strike has depleted our cash balance, and as you know, we have talked about that in the last earnings call, and we\u2019re now working on replenishing that cash balance back to our target of $18 billion on an average basis. So, we expect to use about $2 billion to $3 billion of our free cash flow towards our investment grade balance sheet, which brings us to return on capital to shareholders. We expect to keep dividends at the same level of about $2 billion, which leaves $2 billion to $3 billion for share buybacks and other potential uses.","Now, Steve talked about how we\u2019re continuing to work on getting GMI to profitability. To that end, if we see compelling restructuring opportunities in GMI with an appropriate payback period, we will likely use a portion of this cash for that purpose, with the rest of the remaining cash going towards share buybacks, and we will keep you posted on that as we go through the calendar year.","To summarize 2020, improvement in operating performance will likely offset macro headwinds. And again, this is a differentiator in our view. This demonstrates our commitment that macro headwinds might come and things might happen from time to time, but this team remains focused on executing our plan. Improvement in cash flow and cash conversion, and expect to return cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.","Before I go to the second section, I want to talk for a moment about execution. What you see on this page is proof points of different things from a financial metric perspective that we\u2019ve committed to, and I want to really use that as a foundation to frame our 2020 performance. Yes, we will likely see different headwinds or tailwinds that we have not predicted at the beginning of this calendar year. But this team, as we\u2019ve done in the past, we\u2019re committed to delivering on our objectives in 2020 and beyond.","With that, let me take you to the second section where I\u2019d like to pull together what you heard from all the other speakers and give you a framework on how to think about our various collection of businesses.","Firstly, we have a collection of highly profitable cash generative businesses where we have a leadership position, and you see all of those listed on this page. I\u2019m going to talk about each of them in the following pages. We do have a few turnaround opportunities, especially on the international side. And finally, you\u2019ve heard a lot about AV and EV today, and we consider those businesses accretive from our core, given our unique positioning. So, let\u2019s quickly talk about each of these.","Trucks. Mary talked about how this is an important business for us and how we\u2019re growing this and we are proud of our product and our performance in this area. So, let me frame this up for you in terms of how important is this for the company. Over half the revenues in North America come from trucks, $65 billion of revenue. And from a margin standpoint, we expect this to be in the mid to high teens. And hopefully, that gives you an additional insight on the attractiveness of this business. And I\u2019ve talked previously about how we think this business is different from the rest of the light vehicle market. And a quick recap of the points that we made on that topic.","We believe there is pent-up demand in this sector, which is likely to continue as a tailwind from a demand standpoint for the next several years. A proof point for you is the growth we have seen in the last few years. In the past five years alone, this segment has grown about 6% on an annualized basis. Compare that with the rest of the industry where we\u2019ve seen a decline of about 50 basis points. So again, this is a segment where because of the age of the fleet, the installed base and the growth that we\u2019ve seen here, we do expect a healthy level of demand to continue in the foreseeable future.","I talked about how the margins are attractive and Barry talked about how we\u2019re the only OEM with two brands and we\u2019re positioned really well with both the Chevrolet and the GMC brand. I want to remind you of the competitive moats that exist in this sector as well. Historically, over 90% of the sales in this sector has been through the top three OEMs. Compare that with the rest of the light vehicle industry where that\u2019s less than 40%.","We do \u2013 you might ask, well, aren\u2019t there new disruptors coming in. And that\u2019s where the next point comes in, which is really important where we believe the battery electric trucks that we will build will leverage the success that we\u2019ve had in the ICE business. This is a business that we\u2019ve done for over 100 years. We know the customers well, and we have an outstanding distribution channel, and we do not intend to cede our leadership position in this very important segment.","Next, I\u2019d like to talk about GM Financial, which is another cash generative business that earns an appropriate return on its capital. Before we talk about GM Financial\u2019s financial contribution, I\u2019d like to talk about what it brings to the auto industry and the auto side of the business. We had in calendar year 2019 alone over two million leads to our dealers generated through GMF, so clearly very important. From a loyalty standpoint, as a data point, over 78% leased loyalty. So what that basically means, over 78% of the customers come back to GMF to buy a GM vehicle. And as you know, conquests are much more expensive than retaining a customer. So this allows us to strengthen the vehicle sales and help with demand there as well.","Financing through the cycle is critical. We recognize we\u2019re in a cyclical industry, and GMF provides hard to finance customers with financing as the industry does turn. So put it altogether, this business generates return on equity in the range of low-to-mid teens, an appropriate level of return for this kind of a business. And let\u2019s talk about how it\u2019s been growing over the last several years.","From 2015, when we made the decision to grow this to be a full captive FinCo to 2019, we\u2019ve seen a significant growth and we sit just shy of $100 billion from an earning assets perspective, quite significant. And in the next several years, as we improve penetration and it continues to grow, we expect the level to be around \u2013 the assets to tail off around $125 billion. And from an earnings standpoint, we expect a corresponding growth in our earnings as well with EBT in the range of about $2.5 billion in the next several years. And as I talked about from a cash conversion standpoint, we do expect that the net income coming out of this business will be dividend-ed back to the parent in the 2023 to 2025 timeframe, again, very important business for us.","Let\u2019s quickly touch on after sales, which is another important business and cash generative business for GM. This has been a consistent profit contributor, and we expect it to be a consistent profit contributor going forward. This business is less cyclical than the rest of the business. And this is a growth opportunity as the car park continues to age and it sits at about 11.7 years today. The service business for trucks is particularly attractive and it\u2019s over 2x that of passenger cars. So, when you take the strong truck business, it translates into a strong after-sales business as well. The margins are very strong in this business as well and it keeps the customer in our ecosystem, which is very important. Translates into a high ROIC business overall.","I want to talk finally about connectivity, which is an important piece of a franchise, which is profitable and cash generative. This includes OnStar with the safety and security features. It includes remote access and other subscription businesses that we have. Up until 2016, this business was losing customers and subscribers, and we had made a conscious decision in 2016 to turn this around and have this be a growth area. And you can see the results of that. And in 2020, we expect to have about 12 million paying subscribers in this business. And in the future, we expect that this would grow, and the drivers of growth, obviously we get growth with GM customers, we get growth through our fleet business as well where fleet intel is an important aspect for that category of customers.","From a partnership standpoint, there is many examples of things that we\u2019ve already rolled out, whether it\u2019s Amazon and package delivery or marketplace. But we\u2019re just scratching the surface in terms of how much more subscription-based businesses we can have which are high margin and just have a different kind of a revenue profile than the rest of our business. And I\u2019m going to talk about subscriptions later in the presentation as well. So that summarizes the cash generative portion of the franchises that we\u2019re proud of, and they fuel the growth in a lot of the growth areas that we\u2019ve talked about today.","Let\u2019s turn to the turnaround opportunities. Steve Kiefer talked about GM International. So, I\u2019m not going to repeat all of that. But that does represent a $2 billion improvement when you get the margin levels from where they were in 2018 to an appropriate level of margins, which in this business we think is mid-single digit, so a tailwind coming from restructuring of this operation.","And finally, from a luxury standpoint, Mark talked a lot about this today. This is a business that\u2019s historically struggled in the United States and performed really well in China. And with all the exciting plans that we shared earlier today, with a refreshed product portfolio and improved segment coverage, we expect that this business will grow not only in China, but in the United States as well. And we\u2019ve talked about how this is our leading brand from an EV standpoint. And so this will attract a new generation of customers that the Cadillac brand currently doesn\u2019t have to the brand.","So we talked about cash generative businesses and turnaround opportunities. I want to talk a bit more about how we think the EV, AV and other business revenue streams are accretive to our overall business. So, let\u2019s take a quick look at where our strength lies today.","Our strength is in Middle America with trucks. That\u2019s where we sell our most vehicles, that\u2019s where we make most of our money. And if you look at the AV and EV opportunity that you heard about today, we expect that those businesses will first have a meaningful manifestation in areas where GM has an opportunity from a market share standpoint. So, we think it\u2019s very much complementary to our core business and particularly to our truck business.","I talked about subscriptions previously, and I want to frame that up a little bit more in our core and our Cruise businesses, the automotive model today as you sell the vehicle and you see the customer x number of years from now. And, as we think about and we\u2019re working on future revenue opportunities, you heard Dan talk about the business model that Cruise is working towards and on the automotive side, whether it\u2019s licensing or subscriptions or customer inside coming from the data we have responsibly monetized, we think those are additional revenue streams, which we\u2019re currently not capitalizing on, which present a huge opportunity and they\u2019re complementary to our one-time transaction nature and they\u2019re high margins as well and highly cash generative.","So in closing, I would like to leave you with this slide. Why are we uniquely positioned relative to our competition? We have valuable franchises that are cash generative, and we have accretive growth opportunities on AV, EV and other areas that we\u2019re laser focused on capitalizing on. And from a cyclical standpoint, we\u2019ve taken a number of proactive steps to strengthen the business and position us well for the cyclicality that typically comes with this business. And we believe that this positions us well with a very strong foundation to create shareholder value.","With that, I thank you, all, and I bring Rocky up to start our Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","A - Rocky Gupta","Thank you. Dhivya. I\u2019m going to request all the speakers from today to come onto the stage for the Q&A. If you have a question, please raise your hand and we\u2019ll get a mic to you. Just wanted to remind everyone again that the Investor Relations team is available to address any additional questions you may have, especially any detailed questions on the numbers. And what I\u2019d suggest is that to use our time most efficiently today, we focus on some of the more strategic questions for the people on the stage today. And Matt will be joining us on phone also. So, we\u2019ll get him dialed in.","Let\u2019s get started. First question, Rod. Rod Lache.","Rod Lache","Thanks. Rod Lache from Wolfe Research. Three questions. First, maybe just a quick housekeeping, Dhivya, if you can just clarify. In your guidance, how much working capital you\u2019ve anticipated in your free cash flow and the buybacks, whether those are incorporated into the guidance.","Dhivya Suryadevara","From a working capital standpoint, while we would expect some rewind of sales allowances from a strike recovery perspective, we expect that will be offset, Rod, by other working capital items, including industry impact and timing. So, we\u2019ve had no tailwind assumed in our free cash flow guidance from that. And your second question was...","Rod Lache","And the buybacks...","Dhivya Suryadevara","Well, the buybacks is a use of the free cash flow. So, we expect that out of the $6 billion to $7.5 billion we generate. We would replenish our cash balance to the tune of $2 billion to $3 billion, and the remaining towards buyback and other uses.","Rod Lache","So that\u2019s built into your EPS guidance.","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yes.","Rod Lache","Okay. And then just focusing on the international businesses. I was hoping that maybe you could be a little bit clearer on the GMI turnaround. How much of this you\u2019re going from about $1.3 billion loss to a profit is actually exiting products \u2013 or, exiting markets, how much of it is product, and then, if Matt is on the line, maybe talk a little bit about the China business and why we should believe that that business is kind of stabilizing and improving. It\u2019s been losing some market share. It\u2019s down to about $200 million a quarter of profitability, mapped, and the recorded remarks mentioned a number of headwinds and spending. Is it just underperformance related to powertrain that\u2019s been corrected? Or is there something else here that we can look at and say that now it should start to perform in line with the rest of the industry?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Steve, do you want to take the GMI question?","Steve Kiefer","Yes, sure. I would say that there is sort of a \u2013 we\u2019ve talked about $2 billion. There is about $0.5 billion in this improved product that we\u2019ve talked about that was in my slides, the new vehicles. And then I would say the remainder is a combination of cost cutting and restructuring that\u2019s been in the plan.","Mary Barra","Matt, are you on the line?","Matt Tsien","Yes, I am. So thanks, Rod, for your question. Can you hear me?","Rocky Gupta","Yes. We can hear you, Matt.","Matt Tsien","Great. Okay. Let me sort of start with 2019 and just sort of put it in context. So, in 2019, our performance was certainly impacted by industry factors in terms of the industry downturn and the China V to China VI transition, which put a lot of pricing pressure on the industry. But there were also a number of unique, I would say, company factors that you alluded to, Rod. I mean, at SGM, I would say the most significant company level factor is the challenges with customer acceptance on 3-cylinder engines with some of our customers. So the launches did not deliver the results we expected.","And, as I mentioned in my remarks, we\u2019re reacting quickly, and a number of the products will begin to have 4-cylinders as options as early as second quarter of this year. At SGMW, the key issue was the transition of the Baojun to a higher brand position. This is absolutely the right thing to do for the long-term. But as the plan pivots there are transition issues that impacted SGMW\u2019s performance.","Looking into 2020, we expect that the industry downturn will continue. There will be increased fuel economy pressures and NEV pressures that will impact the industry as a whole and our performance as well. And then there is the additional fairly heavy investment cycle that we\u2019re into to deliver any of these for the future. So, we expect that our performance will continue to be challenged in 2020 and probably for the next couple of years. As we get through this investment cycle and with the industry recovery, we do expect that our equity income will pick up once again.","Rod Lache","Thank you.","Rocky Gupta","Great. Next, Joe Spak. I think you had a question?","Joe Spak","Maybe, just to follow on quickly from Rod\u2019s question on South America or on GMI. The $2 billion improvement, $1 billion was from South America that other $1 billion, does that consider some of those additional restructuring actions you talked about from that use of cash? Or would that be \u2013 is that further restructuring or exits in GMI?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yes. It would be \u2013 to the extent, there\u2019s restructurings, it would be a use of cash, like we\u2019ve talked about previously. The $2 billion is \u2013 think about it as a run rate on how we would make 5% margin on that business on an ongoing basis as opposed to the $1.2 billion or $1.3 billion we\u2019ve lost in 2018.","Joe Spak","Okay. And then Mark, on the BEV3 platform, I think versus that graphic that you showed prior, you\u2019ve added the pickup truck versus prior years \u2013 did something change there that allowed you to add to pickups to that platform versus your prior thinking that maybe, you need a stand-alone platform? And maybe, just at a very high level, you could tell us why you think you can sort of do this all more modular, because I think some of your competitors are building more specific platforms for different sizes and types of vehicles.","Mark Reuss","Yes. We started a while ago, looking at the fundamental cell content pouch versus prismatic, versus the height of the floors of different models. So, what you saw in that animation indicated that we had everything from a low floor entry with different wheel bases to a mid-floor entry. I\u2019m talking about height-wise to a high-floor entry, which we would have for the BET.","And so as we\u2019ve been architecting that, we\u2019ve been looking and trying to match the market desires to the architecture, and the cell \u2013 the basic cells are pretty much all the same. The only difference it will have is if you\u2019re in China, we would do one type of cell structure and we\u2019ll get into this on the EV day, but we do it in North America, it\u2019s a different type of cell structure. But the partners are all in place. The chemistries have been developed and vertically integrated, and that drives a different I think definition of what architecture was and what it is.","And so our architecture is really around the cell and the orientation of the cell in the pack as you saw, the electric motors, we\u2019ve got at least three different electric motors that will be vertically integrated in the power structure for that. And then the power electronics and the global B part of it and the backbone will all be common. So, those are the big cost drivers and what is a new architecture for electric vehicles versus stampings, floor pans, rockers, chassis, pickup points, control arms. Those are all things that used to define an architecture, because they are the high-cost internal capital spends on a volume basis for a plant.","And so it\u2019s very different. As we were architecting the first BEV, which looked like a crossover, we really started looking at what else can we do and how can we do it. And you\u2019ve only seen sort of the first models of BET architecture. There is another version of our BEV3 architecture that you\u2019ll see on EV Day, and I\u2019ll leave that as a surprise. So, if that helps frame it up a little bit. Very different.","Rocky Gupta","Great. Next, move on Emmanuel Rosner.","Emmanuel Rosner","Thank you. Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank. First question for Dan Ammann. Very refreshing to see you so bullish, optimistic about the opportunity. A lot of the other players that I have spoken recently were generally more cautious, maybe, the timeline getting pushed out and a lot of \u2013 the asset valuations coming down quite meaningfully. For us sitting on the outside, we don\u2019t have the benefit of being able to examine or test your technology. I guess what should we look for to know that this is real? What do you have that the others don\u2019t? And what kind of milestone can we track going forward?","Dan Ammann","Well, I think the fundamental goal that most of our energy is behind now is this objective of reaching a superhuman level of safety performance, and that\u2019s as I went through in my talk, that\u2019s where most of the energy is and it\u2019s where we\u2019re making incredibly rapid progress. As I said, we\u2019re pretty far along in reaching that level of performance. We can see where we need to get to and we think we have the tools in place to close out that last step.","As I mentioned, it\u2019s difficult to predict exactly what the timeline is, because we\u2019re out on the very long tail of a sort of an exponential problem and we have incredibly powerful tools that we\u2019re bringing to those long tail issue. And so precise timing predictions are tricky. But we feel that that is something we can see from here. And again, that\u2019s just the starting point. What happens once you reach that point is where things get more and more interesting.","In terms of what are we doing that\u2019s different from some others, I think one of the things that\u2019s really helped us all the way along is testing in a very complex operating domain. We also do some testing in a simpler environment and we know how much this helps us relative to this. So that\u2019s been really powerful.","And then I\u2019d say secondly, this whole idea that the Company has been built around rate of improvement as a core product of what we do and building the infrastructure to allow us to move incredibly quickly and iterate more rapidly \u2013 and I showed you lots of examples of how we\u2019re doing that. And so I don\u2019t know exactly how others are thinking about that or doing it, but we have the core product of the technology stack we\u2019re building, and then we have another equally important product of building the infrastructure that allows us to get really rapidly.","Emmanuel Rosner","And then just the housekeeping for Dhivya if I may. So, the earnings walks are extremely helpful. If I wanted to zoom in on GMNA specifically, so you\u2019re guiding for earnings up even versus ex-strike last year. So, call it more than $11.8 billion this year, very strong performance. Could you maybe, talk a little bit about the puts and takes? I mean, I assume the rebuild of inventory will not be part of that walk, because last year was \u2013 the starting point is ex-strike. So, what are the puts and takes and how should we think about that?","Dhivya Suryadevara","So, the way to think about it, I\u2019d say, is what you saw in that slide on the GM specific factors, the puts and takes on that primarily impact North America. So, you can take those as North American specific items. Tailwinds, the new launches and full year of heavy duties and full year of light duties and cost saves, which predominantly impact North America positively. On the headwind side, full-size SUV downtime is what impacts North America the most. And I mentioned about 30,000 units roughly on a strike adjusted basis and depreciation \u2013 that\u2019s a non-cash item, but that\u2019s \u2013 put all that together, North America positive.","Rocky Gupta","Great. Thanks, Dhivya. Itay? Joe, can you get the mic to Itay?","Itay Michaeli","Great. Thank you. Itay Michaeli from Citi. Two questions on Cruise for Dan. The first is in the slide referring to moving people, Dan, you mentioned possibly for tech partnerships. I was hoping you could elaborate on that. Would that potentially exclude some partnerships with rideshare companies? Or is that not in the plan? And then secondly, you mentioned that the competitive field is now thinning out. I was hoping you could talk about how many, without maybe naming names \u2013 or feel free to, how many competitors do you see that are viably competing with Cruise?","Dan Ammann","So, on the first one, on the tech partnerships thing, I think that it\u2019s sort of \u2013 it\u2019s something we\u2019re just kind of reserving as we look at global markets and that have different existing market configurations. There could be places where partnership makes more sense than the sort of the core plan that we have of going vertically integrated.","And then in terms of the field thinning out, I think this has happened over the last \u2013 I don\u2019t know, 18 months to 24 months, and I think as people have realized that this is not something you can do with 10 or 20 or 50 people and $10 million of venture capital, it\u2019s just a much bigger challenge than that and a much bigger scope of problem to work on. And so I think in California there were at one point more than 60 licenses that have been issued for self-driving testing, and I don\u2019t think when the dust settles here, there\u2019ll be 60 companies that have really delivered mission critical safety system and that drives with superhuman level of performance at a cost point that makes it work and an experience that makes it work from a customer point of view.","Itay Michaeli","Just a follow-up, maybe housekeeping for Dhivya. Back to the large SUVs, if you can \u2013 the mention of the headwind this year and also the potential \u2013 and how you think about the opportunity in 2021, particularly some of the new trims like AT4 that Barry talked about in his presentation. Kind of how should we think about the variable profit opportunity on this platform after the launch?","Dhivya Suryadevara","So your first question about 30,000 units on a strike adjusted basis. So, if we didn\u2019t have SUV down during because of the strike, the delta between what you\u2019re going to see in 2020 versus 2019 would be 30,000 down. So hopefully that helps. And, Itay, IHS has it roughly at the right level. So if that helps us another data point, that\u2019s another way to look at it. And in terms of profitable trims beyond 2020, AT4 and others, I\u2019d say better profits than average, and I will leave it at that.","Rocky Gupta","Great. John Murphy, I think \u2013 yeah go ahead.","John Murphy","Thanks very much. If we look back at 2019, I mean I appreciate the attempt to pro forma the numbers for your earnings. But the reality is what happened in 2019 happened, and if you look at the volume, it\u2019s probably more indicative of something that would have produced in a low 15 million unit environment. So you essentially just put up almost $5 in earnings in a low 15 million unit environment. You\u2019re talking about another $1 billion of cost saves in your $4 billion to $4.5 billion plan. Plus, you\u2019re talking about some potential improvement in GMI of $2 billion.","So, just curious when you roll all that stuff together, it adds a lot of credence to the idea that you just talked about a breaking even at 10 million to 11 million units and actually maybe even then some. So I\u2019m just curious if you kind of update us where you sit on your thoughts on sort of break-even in \u2013 it seems like you are going to do couple of bucks, at least to the next downturn. I was trying to understand how you\u2019re thinking about that.","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yeah, John, I think that\u2019s a really good way to think about it because if you look at the strike impacted results of $4.82 which we put up in 2019, that was after taking into account the impact of about 320,000 units down because of strike. When you market share adjust it, it translates to industry being down about 2 million units. And so the thinking about it as a curve from our earnings at 17 million units to our 25% downturn scenario, this matches quite nicely with what you would expect in an industry down. So to your point, it does validate the downturn thesis.","With the actions we\u2019ve taken, we\u2019ve maintained the 10 million to 11 million breakeven point for North America. I would say we were probably hovering in the higher end of that range, and with the cost savings we\u2019ve come closer to the lower end of the range. And as we continue to strengthen the business and the rest of the operations around the globe, our downturn scenario looks better because you have fewer cash burning operations around the globe. So I\u2019d say, yes, it grants some credence to the downturn thesis and you will see us address some of the other problematic areas which should be better for downturn protection as well.","John Murphy","Okay. And then just a second question around the subscriptions. I know it\u2019s sort of a TBD when Dan will deliver Cruise \u2013 we\u2019re waiting for that and we want it now, and that\u2019s a big part of \u2013 that\u2019s sort of an incremental subscription opportunity for you. But you have incremental opportunities that appears on some of the more near-term things like OnStar and OTA updates as you get to sort of this digital platform that, Mark, you were talking about.","So, just curious if you can give us sort of where OnStar sits right now, where that could potentially go, and as you get this digital platform in place, could we see a lot more subscription opportunity sort of in the near term. And then Dan, what do you think the potential that you could bring to the table over time to the subscriptions? And is this recurring revenue outside of just the simple rideshare model from Cruise that you guys are kind of alluding to?","Mark Reuss","Yes, let me take the OnStar question and the idea of paid on-hand, it\u2019s new opportunities, new businesses that may not exist today. We\u2019ve been really excited about our OnStar business and the growth that we\u2019ve seen there. Today, we\u2019ve got about 20 million vehicles that are on the road, and only about a quarter of those are connected and paying subscription. We also have a very limited portfolio of products that we sell. Essentially, there are three. And so \u2013 and even with all those constraints that I\u2019ve just described, this is a business that has been growing really nicely for us. And so, if we think about over the course of time, the vehicle part will continue to grow. The 25% subscription could be something significantly higher than that. And the portfolio can be quite a bit larger.","And so, we\u2019re engaged right now with customers and with the product development organization and trying to figure out what are those products and services that are most interesting to the customers and how do you bundle those up and how do you put them onto the vehicle, how do you sell them, how do you go to market. And we see a very nice opportunity there with a fundamentally different margin profile than today\u2019s hardware business. And so, I think as we go forward over the course of time, it is an area that we do want to talk to you about.","Dan Ammann","And on the Cruise side, I\u2019d say the \u2013 we\u2019ve all grown accustomed to the sort of pay-per-ride demand pricing environment around rideshare. I think that\u2019s one way to do this. I think there are lots of other interesting models in terms of how you engage customers now you have them sign up and pay. It\u2019s obviously very early days, but I think there is a \u2013 it\u2019s a pretty wide open field of opportunity there.","John Murphy","And then just one quick one. I mean, on the luxury SUV market in China is gangbusters. And you said it\u2019s great. You have the best luxury SUV in the world in the Escalade. Are we ever going to see the Escalade in China? It seems like a huge incremental opportunity for you. I mean, obviously it\u2019s larger than most stuff that\u2019s over there, but the Mercedes S-Class sells at similar price points, which just seems like a natural chance to take and try and develop that business in China?","Mary Barra","Does Matt want to take that or I can take it?","Rocky Gupta","Yes. Matt, did you hear the question? It was about the potential for Escalade in China.","Matt Tsien","Yes, I\u2019d be happy to address that. First of all, Cadillac has done extremely well over the last several years and we expect that to continue to perform very well. I think the other trend that\u2019s happening China is the movement toward larger SUVs. A couple of years ago, the largest SUVs in the market were probably what we would call C segment SUVs. And now C segment SUVs are gaining acceptance. So there is a movement toward larger vehicles. Certainly we\u2019ll not rule out the potential for something like Escalade.","Rocky Gupta","Great. Thanks, Matt. Adam? Adam Jonas?","Adam Jonas","Thank you. So, I have a question for Mark and I have a question for Mary, but first a comment. I noticed that you were videotaping today\u2019s Investor Day. It\u2019d be great if someone could send that tape to Ford in Dearborn. I\u2019m serious. I\u2019ll hand deliver it myself to them if you don\u2019t send it to them. Your team is really airtight. I think you should be very proud of this presentation you gave. It\u2019s a kick-ass management team up here in front of us. You are executing. You\u2019re clearly not getting the credit. I know you deserve it. And I think many investors in the room deserve. But over time you keep doing this and you execute on even two-thirds of what you\u2019re talking about and it\u2019s going to happen. So I just had to get that out there.","Mark, first question for you. Can you confirm are EVs a tailwind? And specifically, I remember a year ago when you talked about getting out a hybrids and people thought you were crazy.","Mark Reuss","You didn\u2019t.","Adam Jonas","I didn\u2019t. It\u2019s not looking so crazy. I mean, can you describe maybe in financial terms or just order of magnitude how much easier \u2013 how much better life is when you don\u2019t have to architecture those complications into the business?","Mark Reuss","Yes, I think it\u2019s a great question. The hybrid piece of this \u2013 when we look at this \u2013 and we look at what it takes to bring a plug-in hybrid, a traditional hybrid, any of those to market where you\u2019re carrying an internal combustion engine and an electrification propulsion system and you have to make them work together and you have to certify \u2013 you still have to certify, you still have to crash, you still have to pay money to carry two propulsion systems on board, I just, from a physics and engineering standpoint, can\u2019t get my head around making money doing that in the long-haul even as a stop gap. Even as \u2013 I mean, I\u2019m bragging of Volt, okay. I can tell you I love the Volt. By the way, I was one of the early buyers of the Volt.","So that was great too, and I get a lot of emails from Volt buyers and I get it. But at the end of the day, if we can get the battery chemistry vertically integrated correct and cost effective and our control systems have taken everything we\u2019ve learned from Volt and Bolt on how to use the battery to get more range and more cost-effective. At the end of the day, the customer is going to be much, much happier doing a pure EV than a stop gap that you still have to plug it in sometimes and then hard to understand. I mean, honestly they\u2019re hard to understand. And so we know that because we\u2019ve done it and we\u2019ve done it reasonably successfully over a pretty long period of time.","So, all that customer data plus the cost basis plus the engineering basis \u2013 and I told you last year, if I had another dollar of R&D from our company, I would spend it on getting the anode and cathode and the chemistry of our batteries better.","Mary Barra","I\u2019ll give you a dollar.","Mark Reuss","Oh yes. No, Mary. Thank you. And then everybody, thank you very much. We have really done a great job. So, anyway, that is a very impassioned speech about a very long answer to your question, but that\u2019s the way I feel, the way I do.","Adam Jonas","Okay. And my final question for our CEO and Chairman, Mary. At the beginning of this presentation, I was really struck by the comments about the opportunity that GM has \u2013 I stress opportunity \u2013 to really help decarbonize the fleet, decarbonize your operations and show a rate of change that is clearly resonating with everybody at the margin, investors, your customers, regulators, governments, everybody. Would you consider, given your role as Chairman, would you consider tying a portion of management compensation, if not a significant portion, to GM\u2019s ability to show that progress of CO2 reduction? Because I kind of have this sneaking suspicion that you can show a lot of progress quite within your wheelhouse and then it would be outstanding for your business.","Mary Barra","So the way our compensation system is set up, in our short-term incentive plan, 25% of it is individual performance. And I can tell you that achieving the metrics we\u2019ve put for ourselves are incorporated not into just mine or the appropriate people who sit next to me but even deeper in the organization. So as we look at that that is definitely something we regularly report to the Board. And we\u2019re stepping back and we\u2019re looking and say, if you look at Scope 1 and Scope 2, very well under way. Dane Parker who runs our sustainable workplaces organization that just became our Chief Sustainability Officer, we\u2019ve been on this journey for a while. And so we sit in very good shape.","But we have to look at Scope 3 because right now we build ICE vehicles and we\u2019ve looked at what are the different routes, and clearly the best fastest way to have the least impact on the environment is to EVs. And that\u2019s another reason in addition to the technical and the fact that customers don\u2019t understand and it\u2019s more costly, is getting to EVs and doing it in a way that customers want to buy them as opposed to being regulated to sell them and then find the buyer. That\u2019s our mission and that\u2019s what we\u2019re on. But I would tell you that it\u2019s already incorporated \u2013 along with several other goals, but it\u2019s already incorporated into the metrics the Board holds me accountable for and the organization.","Rocky Gupta","Great. Let\u2019s move to Ryan, Ryan Brinkman.","Ryan Brinkman","Great. Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan. Thanks for taking my question, and thank you for the disclosure that your trucks business generates roughly $65 billion of revenue at a mid to high teens adjusted EBIT margin. I think that helps to underscore for investors the attractiveness of your trucks business. And I\u2019m not sure if that math is so simple, but it also underscores the fact that you\u2019re generating something like $11.5 billion of EBIT there assuming 17.5% of margin which essentially approximates all of your profit in North America, a region which has another $40 billion of revenue.","So, can you talk about your plans to increase the margins and returns for your non-trucks business? And do you think there may be scope for additional rationalization of the passenger car lineup beyond that which was communicated in the November 2018 restructuring announcement?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Yes. So just to frame up the North American operations and the various different vehicle lines, I\u2019d say from a passenger car standpoint, Ryan, the step we took in November of 2018 takes us quite a bit far in terms of taking us away from the segments that we\u2019re not generating an appropriate level of return. If you look at passenger cars, with the exception of Cadillac, where we have a couple of vehicles, as well as Corvette which does make money \u2013 and a couple of those vehicles \u2013 it\u2019s basically that. There\u2019s no more passenger cars really in the lineup in North America. In its other markets, as Steve talked about, we\u2019re working on getting those to profitability.","And within crossovers, it\u2019s multiple different stories, depending on which segment do you look at. Our mid crossovers earn a very healthy level of return. Compact and small crossovers are more challenged with the pricing pressures we\u2019ve seen. And what Mark talked about earlier from a complexity standpoint, if you think about the parts we\u2019ve eliminated, how we\u2019re getting it all into fewer architectures and how we\u2019re getting material costs down and some of the brand work that Barry is doing from a \u2013 getting the ATPs of Chevrolet and GMC and Cadillac up, I think those are on a path as well. We clearly have more work to do, but we will continue doing that work.","And internationally, you\u2019ve seen all the other cash burning businesses which are also on a path to profitability. So it is our goal to diversify the profitability overall and get that to \u2013 not all of them will get to truck level margins, obviously, but they will get to their appropriate level of margin.","Mark Reuss","I think it\u2019s important to note on that too, as Dhivya mentioned, in addition to what we talked about earlier is we\u2019re now entering into a second term of these architectures, where we already spent the money to get the mass out the first turn. And so everything that comes online here has a much higher reuse of the core architecture level on an ICE platform. And then we move \u2013 these are positioned for two plus, okay, on a turn basis here. So we will get as many turns out of those as we can. But we\u2019re not going to do new ones of that, if that makes sense, okay. So it\u2019s a good place to be.","Rocky Gupta","Right. Brian? Brian Johnson?","Brian Johnson","Brian Johnson, Barclays. I\u2019ve lots of questions for EV days, but I\u2019ll keep those. I guess the big question is, look, the stock price is, as you know, roughly kind of where the IPO was. It seems to many of us say you\u2019re doing everything right in terms of GMNA, the investment in Cruise. But I mean, how do you think about the stock price, a, and, b, to what extent are you open to strategic options? I\u2019ll throw three out that I\u2019ve heard around the room as well as talking to investors.","One would be consolidation of some sort. Certainly that\u2019s going on in Europe as we speak and up the highway from you. Second, the idea \u2013 should you just become a pure play North American truck company and everything else go somewhere else? Or thirdly Cruise sort of the next-gen businesses, OnStar, arguably creating tracking vehicles for those.","Mary Barra","So, we are always exploring opportunities that are going to create long-term shareholder value. We\u2019re not interested in doing something that\u2019s just a short-term path, but \u2013 and we consider all lines as, I mean, I think we are in an era right now, where a lot of people are talking to a lot of people. I think people don\u2019t understand how significant the work that we\u2019re doing with Honda is when you think about fuel cells, when you think about AV and when you think about the fact with EV cells.","For those of you who had a chance to see or look online for the Cruise Origin, the three teams worked together rather seamlessly. And in order for groups to work together, there has got to be \u2013 it\u2019s got to be at the engineering level and we\u2019re demonstrating that and we have been. But again, we\u2019ll consider all those opportunities. I mean, I think to get to your core question; we do feel General Motors is a compelling investment opportunity. We feel across many of our strong franchises, you mentioned trucks, we\u2019ve talked about OnStar, we\u2019ve talked about mid-crossovers. We do believe China is going to be very important in the future. It\u2019s still is a market that has tremendous growth potential. The scale that we get allows us to compete in a way from an electrification perspective across a full range of products and across the full range of \u2013 from value brands to luxury brands.","So, I will tell you there is nothing that\u2019s off the table that we don\u2019t think is going to create long-term value. And we\u2019re going to aggressively go at what we are working on of improving the business as we just talked about with some \u2013 especially the small and the compact crossover segments. The global family of vehicles has been very important around the globe for doing that. Steve referenced that a bit.","So there is the work we\u2019re doing on the car we feel very good about, and we feel we\u2019re getting to the final chapters in that. But then also our conviction around EV, our conviction around AV. We think it sets up General Motors to be uniquely positioned to participate strongly in the future of mobility.","Rocky Gupta","Great. Thanks. Dan Levy, go ahead.","Dan Levy","Thank you. First, just a question for Dhivya or Matt on China. Fully recognizing that coronavirus presents a whole new set of risks here. Can you maybe help us provide some parameters on what \u2013 you\u2019ve said down earnings but what might be a floor? Why this might not be as bad, whether it\u2019s because you\u2019ve already had downtime factored in, this gives you an opportunity to destock? And also on China, if we look back historically, the $2 billion a year that you\u2019re generating in equity income, the 9% margins, given everything that\u2019s happened in cycle at this point, is that just not at all a relevant comp for considering the forward results in China?","Dhivya Suryadevara","Does Matt want to take that?","Rocky Gupta","Yes, Matt, do you want to start with that?","Matt Tsien","Yes. Let me just start and then maybe Dhivya you can add to that. Obviously, the coronavirus situation right now is very concerning. It\u2019s a very fluid situation, with updates that we\u2019re getting on a daily basis. As Mary had said at the beginning, our focus, first and foremost, is on the health and safety of our employees, and we certainly are very concerned about the situation on an overall basis.","In terms of the impact on sales, there will be I believe a near-term impact on the overall industry. Fundamentally, dealerships have been closed for the Lunar New Year. In some regions, they\u2019re slowly ramping back up. In many other regions, they still remain closed. So we expect that there will be an impact on volume in the near term. Generally speaking as the crisis passes there will be some pent-up demand. So there will be probably some bounce on the other side of it. But in terms of predicting what the overall impact of it would be to our equity income, I think it\u2019s a little bit too early to sort of make that call. We obviously do the very best we can to get our operations started up when they could be started up and to manage our costs and expenses, to maximize our outcome.","Dhivya Suryadevara","I would just add that. What you\u2019re basically witnessing is a level of equity income is almost like a downturn scenario in China. And from a level of margin standpoint as we go forward, cycling through some of the specific issues that Matt has talked about, whether it\u2019s four cylinder engine complementing our three cylinder offering or EVs rolling out at a better margin level, that, Dan, is by what I would say catalysts for getting the equity income back to a more normalized level. But we anticipate that happening over a couple of years as opposed to a few quarters.","Rocky Gupta","I think we\u2019ve got \u2013 sorry, Matt, go ahead. Were you saying something? I think we\u2019ve got time for one more question. John, go ahead. Did I interrupt you? Were you saying something? Cool.","John Murphy","Thanks. When I think about the extremely high truck returns that you mentioned, I harken back to the beginning of the presentation and the Hummer truck. From a consumer perspective, you\u2019re going to be judged on and compared with Tesla\u2019s Cybertruck, and that means certain requirements around battery size, powertrain efficiency \u2013 they\u2019re going to be difficult to compete with. And then internally you\u2019re competing with very high margin \u2013 the truck segment. So how do you balance those two? Do you have to sacrifice one for the other? Or do you think that you can have your cake and eat it too?","Mary Barra","Well, first of all, I think we can have our cake and eat it too, because I think understanding the truck buyer and understanding those will be initially attracted to the GMC Hummer EV, and we think it\u2019s accretive to what Dhivya talked about and I\u2019ll let Mark talk about the proof points.","Mark Reuss","I can\u2019t answer everything on how that truck \u2013 our competitions are going to actually come to market with that and when. So a little bit hard to tell from what \u2013 I read the same things you do, so I don\u2019t have any inside information on that. But what I do know is that what we\u2019re going to deliver hasn\u2019t been really shown in its entirety yet. And I think we\u2019re here to win. We\u2019re not here to compete. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything inside GM that\u2019s going to compete with that either. It sort of will be a very different application. Time is up, Rocky, I know. But I don\u2019t think \u2013 I think we are here to win. So that\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say, and I feel really good about it and you haven\u2019t seen the interior, you haven\u2019t seen the exterior. I think on May 20, and you\u2019ll see that. Hopefully, you will feel as good as I feel. I think you will.","Rocky Gupta","Great. Thanks. I\u2019d like to thank all the speakers on the stage. And Mary, would you like to wrap up with any words? Thanks, Matt.","Mary Barra","Sure. If I could have you for just one second, if you give me one minute to close? Thank you, all. Sorry. So I do want to thank you all for being here today. I know we\u2019ve covered a lot and we have more to cover. I appreciate your questions. I know there is a bit more. We\u2019ll be able to answer those questions as we go forward.","But today, our goal, as I said, when we started was to leave you with the confidence in our vision and the strategy that we\u2019re executing and that you believe that General Motors is well positioned to lead in the future of mobility and in the industry. We have strong franchises, as we\u2019ve talked about, with our trucks, with our full-size SUVs, with our mid-sized SUVs, and I believe we have the strongest product portfolio in our history.","We also are investing and have business leadership positions in growth areas like EV and AV and we\u2019ll tell you a lot more about EV when we get to March 4th. Our strong underlying business performance is driven in part because of the difficult decisions we\u2019ve made over the last few years and our commitment that we are going to be disciplined with our capital and really work to make sure every dollar we invest is going to earn its appropriate rate of return for you, our investors, our owners.","Also, we are working hard to make sure our employees understand. When you go through this much transition and this much transformation in a short period of time, you need to make sure your employees understand how they fit in so they\u2019re with you. We\u2019re spending a lot of time to make sure our employees are part of this mission, and I can tell you, as I said, they get excited when we talk to them.","So just to close, I hope we see you all on March 4th, and we can hopefully continue to earn your confidence in the program that we\u2019re executing. We\u2019re moving fast, the world is moving fast and our competitors and moving fast, but we\u2019re going to continue to execute.","So thank you, all, very much. Appreciate all your time today."]}}
