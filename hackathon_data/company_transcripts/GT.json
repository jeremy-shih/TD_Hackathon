My name is Keith, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you.","I would now like to hand the program over to Christina Zamarro, Goodyear's Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Christina Zamarro","Thank you, Keith, and thank you everyone for joining us for Goodyear's first quarter 2016 earnings call. Joining me today are Rich Kramer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Laura Thompson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, there are a few items we need to cover. To begin, the supporting slide presentation for today's call can be found on our website at investor.goodyear.com. And a replay of this call will be available later today. Replay instructions were included in our earnings release issued earlier this morning.","If I could now draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statement on Slide two. I would like to remind participants on today's call that our presentation includes some forward-looking statements about Goodyear's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments today. The most significant factors that could affect future results are outlined in Goodyear's filings with the SEC and in our earnings release. The company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.","Our financial results are presented on a GAAP basis and, in some cases, a non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures discussed on our call are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent as part of the Appendix to the slide presentation.","And with that, I will now turn the call over to Rich.","Rich Kramer","Thank you, Christina, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll begin today\u2019s call by providing a summary of our first quarter highlights in each of our three regions. Then with an eye on the next stage in our longer-term plan, I\u2019ll share an update to our strategy roadmap which has been the cornerstone of how we operate our business. Laura will follow with a financial review and our 2016 outlook.","We delivered strong first quarter performance highlighted by record segment operating income of $419 million, that\u2019s an increase of 14% in our core segment operating income which excludes Venezuela from our 2015 base. On that same basis, our volumes grew 3% in the quarter. Demand for our premium branded high-value added products is robust and our product mix continues to grow richer. Our results are not only consistent with our expectations for the quarter but also with our long-term strategy and reflect the continued strong execution of our teams.","As you know, this is our first quarter of results for combined Americas business and I\u2019m extremely pleased with the team\u2019s performance. While we\u2019ll talk in some detail about how the U.S. and certain other countries are performing as part of our quarterly updates, I want to reinforce the long-term benefits we anticipate in managing the business internally as one consolidated unit.","After adjusting for the loss of Venezuela\u2019s income, Americas segment operating income grew 15% in the quarter driven by strong demand for our premium branded HVA products. In the U.S. favorable demand is being created by lower fuel prices, higher miles driven and growing consumer OE needs particularly in SUV and light truck. We are growing our OE profitability by winning shipments on many of the most popular vehicles and responding to the increasing complexity of OEM requirements. Our success in OE gives us a favorable position in the subsequent replacement market.","Our consumer volumes in the U.S. were essentially flat in the first quarter. Customers want more premium Goodyear branded products and increasing our supply is both our biggest challenge and our greatest opportunity.","We\u2019re just about one year away from when we expect our new factory in San Luis Potosi, Mexico to come online and we\u2019re very excited about the opportunity to begin increasing our supply for our most complex tires with this incremental capacity. In the interim, we\u2019re working to maximize our footprint in the Americas to get the tires where they are needed most in the region.","Conditions in Brazil remain challenging during the quarter, the ongoing recession and political uncertainty contributed to the overall economic stress in the country. Although our replacement in OE segments both weakened in Brazil, its profit contribution was positive in the first quarter. We feel very good about our ability to drive growth and mix in HVA segments in Brazil and about how we managed our value proposition in this difficult recessionary environment. In summary, we had a very strong first quarter in the Americas and we\u2019re looking forward to opportunities across our markets in 2016 and in the longer-term as well.","Our Europe, Middle East, and Africa business delivered 10% growth in segment operating income. We had a good overall performance in a relatively solid industry environment with strong demand for our HVA products from many of our OE and replacement customers. Earlier this month, I spent time with several of our customers in Europe. I came back encouraged by their confidence in Goodyear and their preference for our products. At the same time, they made it clear that they want even more of our HVA products particularly in the performance in SUV categories.","The growth in more complex HVA tires is as healthy in Europe as it is here in the U.S. The industry\u2019s evolution to high-value added tires has been accelerated by many European car companies. Their preferences are driving mix up both in OE and replacement across the entire region.","While our EMEA business delivered good results in the first quarter, we are continuing to look at our cost structure and working to strengthen and further differentiate our value proposition to our distribution and service network.","We see opportunities to grow profitably and remain positive on EMEA\u2019s longer-term potential. Our Asia-Pacific business delivered another strong quarter fueled by robust volume growth in China and India and because of the acquisition of Nippon Goodyear in Japan. Segment operating income grew 18% from last year\u2019s first quarter.","I would like to take a minute to touch on our business in China where we had another strong quarter as volume increased more than 20% versus the prior year. Our growth was broad based as OE was up nearly 30% and replacement volume increased nearly 20%.","OE continues to benefit from strong car sales growth while replacement was driven by our team\u2019s strong execution of sell-through programs. We remain confident in the long-term market outlook with continued expansion of the middleclass spring growth in Asia-Pacific. We are well-positioned to benefit from this market growth given our award winning product lines and strong position in OE again creating a replacement market pool.","Overall, I\u2019m very pleased with our strong first quarter performance. Even though we are running our business to create long-term shareholder value, a strong first quarter provides a good foundation for the remainder of the year.","I would like to spend the rest of my time this morning reviewing our updated strategy roadmap. As some of you may recall, we unveiled our original roadmap at the Investor Meeting in March 2011 and since then it has served as our guide to win in a rapidly changing and competitive tire industry. So the original roadmap served us well, we believe that an update was needed to more accurately reflect how we\u2019ll win, how we\u2019ll work, and where we\u2019ll focus in an increasingly complex and competitive market.","As I take you through it, there is one important thing to keep in mind, the updated roadmap does not represent a change in strategy, the roadmap is more specific about our goals and expectations and ties our overall strategy to driving performance for our customers and consumers. Starting right at the top, we begin with a clear and direct expression of our goal to deliver sustainable revenue and profit growth over the long-term while increasing the value of our brand. Our emphasis is on the end; our goal is sustainable revenue and profit growth. Top-line growth and margin expansion remain our objective amidst global economic headwinds. When we do both, we increase the value Goodyear creates for all our stakeholders, associates, customers, consumers, suppliers, and of course investors.","The body of the roadmap comprises three clearly defined and interdependent elements, how we\u2019ll win, how we\u2019ll work, and where we\u2019ll focus. I\u2019ll briefly touch on all three and as I go through them, you\u2019ll see how all the content is integrated no matter where it appears on the roadmap.","First, the how we\u2019ll win section has been distilled to three key elements that you\u2019ve heard us talk about on many of our quarterly calls. Innovation excellence is what we strive for when designing products from the market back. This ensures that we\u2019re creating products and services that respond to the demand of consumers, end users, and our customers.","In sales and marketing excellence, we strive to create demand for our brand and for our innovative products driving consumers and end users to our customers. We help them grow their businesses by leveraging the power of our brand and providing industry leading market and sales tools and training. Our insights and research build a value proposition for our customers that goes beyond products alone. The result is that more consumers will ask for Goodyear Tires and our customers will prefer to sell Goodyear Tires. Sales and marketing excellence is about making it easier to do both.","The final element in this section is operational excellence. This means efficiently making more of the tires to market demand especially in the phase of increasing complexity. As a result, we\u2019ll be a more reliable supplier by having the right tire at the right time to meet customer and consumer demand. Our operational excellence initiatives around the world are delivering both cost savings and improving efficiency. We certainly had success but we know there is still much more work to be done here.","Now it\u2019s important as each of these areas are individually the key concept on this part of the strategy roadmap is winning at the intersection of all three. Our goal is to deliver a value proposition built on innovation, reliability, and quality that wins over price alone by putting our customer at the center of the intersection, and by making this the clear purpose of all our initiatives, we see the opportunity to distinguish ourselves in the rapidly changing tire industry.","Moving to the second section of the strategy roadmap, we identified five competencies that define how we\u2019ll work. As you read through the individual items, think of them as behaviors we expect from our associates in order to be successful at the intersection in the how we will section. For example, collaboration and agility are simple words but key competencies mastered only by top-tier companies to help deliver outsized results for customers and for shareholders.","The final section of the roadmap is where we\u2019ll focus, these are real world priorities where aim our excellence efforts. Some of these are given quality, consumer experience and customer service have always been priorities and will remain so. Putting them in writing reaffirms our commitment to them. Focusing on high-value segments is something else we\u2019ve talked about frequently. The ability to supply high-value added tires of increasing complexity such as larger room diameters and greater performance specifications is where the growth and profitability are and will increasingly be in the tire industry. That\u2019s why they\u2019re important. The specific segments may differ from region to region but the value proposition is the same. We want to win in the parts of the market where we can capture the full value of our brand, our technology, our distribution, and our products and services. We will not chase volume for volume sake, focusing on high-value segments is critical to creating sustainable value and profit growth.","The final priority is mastering complexity. This is a major challenging for every tire company. There is complexity in manufacturing, in OE specs, and supply chain, virtually every step in our end-to-end operations. Complexity in the tire industry is increasing at a pace not seen since the shift to radial tires. It\u2019s being driven by OEMs, by regulators seeking reduced CO2 emission, and by consumers who won\u2019t compromise on performance.","It\u2019s affecting tire development, manufacturing, supply chain, consumer experience, and customer service. The complexity of today\u2019s OE tires let alone tomorrow is significantly greater than it was just five years ago. We will embrace this trend by managing the necessary complexity and by eliminating the unneeded complexity in everything we do.","There is a lot of detail on the updated strategy roadmap and as I said, this does not reflect a new strategy. Our objective with the updated roadmap was to clarify what\u2019s important to us and create a single page document to reinforce alignment among all our associates throughout the organization.","A team that is aligned from top to bottom around a common set of goals as defined in our strategy roadmap is the most important ingredient in our plan for long-term success.","Now in closing, I\u2019ll add a final comment, we\u2019ll review with you how our strategy roadmap ties into long-term trends in our industry which we call the megatrends at our Investor Conference in Boston on September 15. Also we will use the conference to discuss our strategic business units and update our long-term performance targets. Further details on the conference will be forthcoming.","Now I\u2019ll the turn over to Laura.","Laura Thompson","Thank you, Rich, and good morning everyone. Today, I will cover our first quarter results and provide more detail on key income drivers in the quarter. I\u2019ll also provide an update regarding our full-year outlook for 2016 before we open the call up for your questions.","Turning to the income statement on Slide five you will see our results for the first quarter consistent with how we have provided our full-year outlook at our call in February; we have provided callouts that remove the effect of deconsolidating Venezuela in order to provide better transparency to our underlying core business. On that basis, you see we had an outstanding quarter.","Volume was up 3%, segment operating income of $419 million was up 14%, and SOI margin of 11.4% increased 2.1 points.","Looking at the income statement items as reported for the first quarter, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies reduced sales by $141 million year-over-year. The sales comparison to prior year was also negatively impacted by the deconsolidation of Venezuela which had $94 million of net sales in the first quarter of 2015.","Gross margin improved three full points to 26.8%. Our earnings per share on the diluted basis was $0.68. Our results were influenced by certain significant items and after adjusting for these items, our earnings per share was $0.72, an impressive increase of 33% over first quarter 2015. In addition to our stronger overall segment operating income, interest expense and minority interest were lower by a combined $32 million versus last year primarily driven by refinancing transactions we completed in 2015 and the dissolution of our global alliance with SRI late last year.","As you will see on the step chart on Slide six which walks first quarter 2015 segment operating income to first quarter 2016, we have also isolated the effect of deconsolidating Venezuela to provide transparency on the drivers of our core SOI.","The benefit of higher volume in the first quarter and higher production levels in the fourth quarter drove an overall improvement of $47 million. Lower raw material costs of $68 million more than offset reduced price mix of $30 million for a net benefit of $38 million during the quarter.","Cost saving actions of $47 million driven by our operational excellence initiatives more than offset the $33 million negative impact of inflation. Foreign currency exchange with a headwind of $12 million reflecting the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, particularly against the Canadian dollar.","Other, a negative of $34 million, includes increased accruals in incentive compensation, higher advertising spend particularly in Asia-Pacific, and a $6 million impact from the divestiture of our North American motorcycle business in October of 2015.","Turning to the balance sheet on Slide seven cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $1.1 billion. Net debt is up versus year-end which reflects the normal working capital seasonality in our business versus the prior-year period; the increase includes the impact of Venezuela\u2019s deconsolidation.","Free cash flow from operations is shown on Slide eight. For the quarter we used $585 million of cash, which is in line with the typical first quarter seasonality of our business. Over the last 12 months, our free cash flow performance has been strong at nearly $800 million. ","Moving now to the business units on Slide nine, I\u2019ll start with our new Americas business unit. The Americas delivered strong segment operating income of $260 million with year-over-year growth of $12 million. Excluding the $22 million impact related to the deconsolidation of Venezuela, SOI increased 15%. Americas margin expanded more than 200 basis points in the quarter primarily driven by positive price mix performance coupled with raw material benefit. We saw very strong mix in the U.S. especially from growth in our OE business.","The Americas also benefited from improved factory utilization and our operational excellence initiatives. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of lower volume and unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Our volume in the Americas declined 6% year-over-year. When excluding the impact of both, Venezuela, and the sale of GDTNA from our 2015 base, our unit volumes decreased 2%. This decline was primarily driven by lower unit volume in our consumer business in Brazil, where consumer tire sales were down 16% year-over-year in a continuing recessionary environment.","We saw declines in Brazil OE as a result of decreased vehicle production versus last year and a decline in replacement in line with the overall industry. Even so, as Rich mentioned, our HVA product mix is growing and Brazil was profitable in the first quarter despite the very difficult economic environment. This is a testament to the strength of our brand and our team.","As Rich mentioned, demand remains strong in the U.S. However in our consumer business, unit volumes were essentially flat as we remain constrained in our ability to satisfy growing market demand for our premium high-value added tires.","Our capacity has been impacted by increasing complexity in HVA tires including growth in OE with SUV and light truck fitments that have longer cycle times in our plant. As you are aware, we are making strides to improve our supply within our U.S. and global manufacturing footprint to meet this demand.","Separately, I\u2019ll note that first quarter sales in our U.S. commercial business declined almost 15% driven by declines in OE.","Overall, we\u2019re very pleased with the strong profit contribution of the Americas in the first quarter as a consolidated unit. We are focused on increasing our supply of high-value added tires to drive profitable long-term volume growth, while maintaining our focus on operational excellence and delivering strong SOI across the region.","Turning to Slide 10, Europe, Middle East, and Africa delivered segment operating income of $80 million in the quarter, up 10% driven by the benefit of higher production volumes during the fourth quarter. Volume was up almost 2% compared to last year and was primarily driven by an increase of 5% in consumer OE with strong demand from Goodyear products throughout the region. Consumer replacements summer industry volumes were up 3% during the quarter and in winter tires channel inventories are more normalized following the first quarter sellout. Our commercial truck business also continues to deliver consistent results, growing market share based on the strength of our premium branded products and a relatively stable industry environment.","Our EMEA business delivered solid performance in the first quarter of 2016. We are very confident in our team, a product portfolio, and in our ability to grow profitably throughout 2016.","Turning to Slide 11, Asia-Pacific delivered first quarter segment operating income of $79 million representing a $12 million increase versus the same period last year. The main driver in income was higher volume, which was partially offset by increased SAG and investments in advertising both related to our recently acquired replacement business in Japan.","SOI margin in the region increased to 16.2% from 14.9% a year ago. Asia-Pacific sold 7.3 million tires in the first quarter, representing 28% growth versus last year. Excluding the impact of our acquisition of the replacement tire business in Japan, our volume growth was 11% which was driven by two of our largest and fastest growing markets in China and India. The outstanding first quarter performance of our Asia-Pacific business confirms our confidence and our commitment to targeted growth investments in the region.","Turning now to Slide 12, I\u2019ll cover our full-year modeling assumptions for 2016. In summary our full-year outlook remains unchanged from our February call and we continue to target $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion in SOI in 2016. Following increases in underlying raw material costs in February, we now expect raw material cost to be only 2% lower than last year before cost saving actions.","In our year-end earnings call in February, we were expecting a 5% decline during 2016. However, we continue to see our full-year price mix versus raw material benefit at around $75 million unchanged from our February outlook. We expect second quarter raw materials to be down 3% and the remaining price mix, net of raw material benefit, to be spread evenly throughout the last three quarters. Our intent is to offset increases in raw materials with price to mix. We could see some volatility related to RMIs in the quarter but as we look at 2016, we still feel very good about the year and the long-term sustainability of our margins.","In cost savings versus inflation, we continue to expect a benefit of $135 million for the full year. However I\u2019ll note that we do expect about $35 million in incremental cost in the Americas SOI in the second quarter. This temporary increase in our cost is primarily related to labor and engineering expenses that were incurred toward the end of 2015 and early this year, as we prioritize plant optimization activities and made shift in production to enhance our capabilities to supply more HVA tires.","While we do expect some offsets in the quarter across our SBUs, we wanted to highlight this expected increase in the Americas. As a result, we expect our total second quarter cost savings versus inflation to be similar to the first quarter actuals and improving later in the year for full-year savings of $135 million.","Regarding foreign currency translation, we are maintaining our full-year impact to segment operating income of approximately $45 million. While current spot rates would imply a more favorable outcome, it\u2019s very early in the year and currencies remain volatile.","And as a reminder for the Americas, the divested motorcycle business had its strongest comparable in the second quarter, which corresponds to the seasonality of that business. Additional financial assumptions for 2016 are listed on Slide 13. We have revised our full-year expectation for financing fees to $45 million which is a $15 million lower than our prior forecast. This change is a result of our adoption of new guidance regarding the presentation of debt issuance cost on the income statement, while the offsetting amount is now recorded within interest expense; our interest expense guidance for the full-year remains unchanged at $350 million to $375 million as the increase has been offset by lower interest rate than expected.","And finally, we repurchased $50 million in shares during the first quarter; we\u2019ve repurchased $463 million so far under our existing $1.1 billion share repurchase authorization. Consistent with our previous communication, we remain committed to repurchasing additional shares through 2016 and early 2017 with the majority of our plan spend toward the end of the year and aligned with our cash flow generation.","Now I will open the line up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions].","And we\u2019ll go first to Itay Michaeli with Citi. Please go ahead.","Justin Barell","Great, thanks so much. This is actually Justin on for Itay. And so quick question with regards to the $6 million that you took for the motorcycle business this quarter, how should we think about the remaining $24 million throughout the year given the Q2 weighting. Is there a specific cadence that you can help us kind of drilldown for the remainder of the year?","Laura Thompson","Yes, Justin, there is and just it\u2019s actually similar to what we said in February when we gave the guidance and for the full-year, it is $30 million. Yes, we have the $6 million in the first quarter and the second quarter is going to get hit pretty hard as well with really very little than in the third and fourth quarter. I would think of may be close even to $20 million in the second quarter.","Justin Barell","Perfect, excellent. And then I guess can you briefly talk a little bit about pricing trends that you\u2019re noticing in North America and Europe and may be the subsequent migration to HVA as a percent of the unit volume in these regions and how that\u2019s impacting the pricing environment that you\u2019re seeing?","Rich Kramer","Yes, Justin, I\u2019ll jump in for that, I would say the trends that we\u2019re seeing broadly speaking differ from region to region. You almost have to do sort of a tour around the world to really see what\u2019s going on. I will say to your comment on HVA pricing, clearly the part of the market that\u2019s growing where the demand is still outstrips supply as we reviewed many times in the past, I would say a very good demand and supply equation and we are able to certainly capture the value of those products going forward.","So as we\u2019ve always said, our high-value segments those targeted market segments, I would say is still very, very robust environment and we\u2019re very pleased with how that\u2019s moving. I think if you look at pricing around the world, again we don\u2019t really comment on pricing specifically, so I won\u2019t do that. But certainly in EMEA it remains a very competitive market there, we\u2019ve seen that in the past and I think we expect that to continue. The industry clearly showing some signs of strengthening particularly in the OE part of the market as we said, and we have many places we do business in Europe, so we manage that value proposition market by market.","But we see it as still a very good place for us. The biggest impact that we continue to see is that of the sort of Chinese or Asian tires coming into Eastern Europe and putting pricing pressure on there. In Latin America, we could probably use Brazil as a marker again what we\u2019ve seen there is the impact of the devaluation of the currency against higher raw material prices, so a lot of pressure there. We\u2019ve had already a price increase announced in Q4 2015 and our way to do business there has always been to get the value of our products by recovering the cost of raw materials and dealing with the devaluation impacts there.","That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re continuing to do in that very difficult environment. I will tell you our volumes there as we\u2019ve talked on in the past are increasingly mixing up to HVA tires to sort of 17-inch and above rim diameter tires and that is a part of the market that is still very favorable for us there.","And in North America, I would say really pretty stable environment that we\u2019ve seen there not really a whole lot else to talk about there, the higher end of the market is doing very well for us and in Asia-Pacific, what you\u2019re seeing there and continue to see as raw material rises remember that gets through our footprint, our raw material cost quicker because of the cycle time. So again we\u2019ve been very active in the market there recovering those raw material prices as well.","Laura Thompson","And I guess I would add may be another data point especially for the Americas. If you look at revenue per tire in the first quarter and excluding Venezuela right which we deconsolidated at the end of 2015, and excluding I guess as you go, if you look at Americas and granted, it isn\u2019t total for Americas revenue per tire is flat year-over-year really demonstrating that value proposition in the marketplace so.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs.","Rich Kramer","Good morning, David.","David Tamberrino","Good morning yes and thank you for taking our questions here. The North America environment remains pretty robust from a demand perspective and the quarter was pretty good albeit some of that\u2019s going to be from import tires coming in and easy comps year-over-year from some of the shipment disruption, but your consumer replacement OE I think together the business was flat in the U.S. against this pretty strong backdrop, you\u2019ve mentioned that you\u2019re still capacity constraint which is probably why we\u2019re still positive price mix at the top-line in the U.S. despite lower raw materials. I guess our question is as you progress through the year, do you see this easing up at all or even against a pretty nice backdrop for volumes in North America given increasing VMTs and a growing vehicle car park whether your consumer business is going to grow or not?","Rich Kramer","And David to be clear, easing up meaning the supply that\u2019s what you\u2019re referring to?","David Tamberrino","Yes it\u2019s less supply constrained in the back half of this year.","Rich Kramer","No, no, no I just wanted to be sure. But listen you I think you\u2019ve actually capitalized it very well, if you look at the market and you look at our overall volume as a company excluding Venezuela, we grew to 3% which is really pretty much in line with what we said strong volumes in Asia and EMEA, when you come back and you look at the Americas and you adjust again for Venezuela and then the GDTNA\u2019s what you see is Brazil was weak spot in the Americas and then you come down to kind of the U.S. if you like, if you want to call that you hit it on the head were about flat.","And the way I would frame that up again David you kind of laid it out profitably, if you look at consumer replacement just look at our EMEA numbers, it was up about 6% but as you\u2019ve said very distorted by over 30% increase in sort of non-member Asian imports coming in and that is the long tail whips off terrifying. So you have all the industry being impacted by terrifying really in the first half, the second half of 2014 if you think about this, there is a lot of pre-buy which meant Q1 2015 there wasn\u2019t really any buying going on that buying sort of went back to trend line in Q1 \u201816 this past quarter. So you saw that big increase of over 30%. But if you follow it over the period, it\u2019s about on the normal sort of import purchases that the industries always had, so distorted by quarter not really over the long-term.","If you look at members, members are up about 0.6% call it 1% and I think in that environment, what you said we\u2019ve got vehicle miles travels being up about 2%, you\u2019ve got sellout of round about 1% to 2% which for us has always been a good marker of what\u2019s happening in the industry.","So good environment, our EMEA members up 0.6% and to your point Goodyear flat. And as you look at us, I would say what we\u2019ve seen is increased demand from our OEM sort of strategy that we\u2019ve laid out over the years with the strong start with the OEM demands, we\u2019re dedicating more capacity to that. In fact demand is up higher than we expected there as well. As we do that as you know those tires are really high specifications, yields are a little bit lower, so that\u2019s having a little bit of an impact on us as well. I would say I\u2019m pleased with that because essentially it says we\u2019re on strategy, we said we wanted to get on the right fitment to bring those fitments through to our dealers as replacement first and second replacements coming through.","So the strategy is working exactly as intended, the demand tire therefore we\u2019re having trouble keeping up with those tires and you\u2019re seeing some of that in the replacement markets. But to frame it in the quarter sort of use it as proxy just for a moment, our EMEA members up 0.6%, Goodyear up about flat in replacements, so driven by those things.","As we look forward, I think to the question of can we catch up it\u2019s exactly the intent, we\u2019ve got a focused improvement, as Laura mentioned, get more tires out of the factories we have, we have the San Luis Potosi factory coming on in 2016 and we have Imported excuse me 2017 I\u2019m sorry getting ahead of myself. And then we have some of the import tires coming in from some of our factories overseas to try to use that capacity in a period of low demand. So our intent is certainly to get ahead of it. But I would say this notion of being a tire short versus the tire long is helpful to us. I will say we\u2019re executing on plan, we\u2019ve got an excellent environment, we\u2019ve got an excellent demand for our Goodyear Tires, we\u2019re executing on our plan, hey the fact of the matter is it\u2019s what we talk about every day, we need more of the tires that customers want right now and that\u2019s why you hear us talking about it.","And the last thing David, I would just say is we always have to keep in mind the tire industry is cyclical, we won\u2019t always be talking about this, but our focus will always be on getting those HVA tires to our customers because even in weaker markets that eventually will come those tires will still outperform the rest of the market. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of perspective.","David Tamberrino","No that\u2019s helpful, I mean it sounds as if there may be towards the back half of the year, you should be seeing some ease of that but really the release now is going to be San Luis Potosi coming online next year.","Rich Kramer","Well we\u2019re going to keep working from today onwards to get more tires out, so that\u2019s our objective and that\u2019s what we\u2019re working towards.","David Tamberrino","That\u2019s fair and then just lastly from me, the Americas segment margin combined looked pretty good year-over-year, I think it was up 120 basis points, I think you commented that you were positive in I guess it would be Latin America ex-Venezuela but that margin was still pretty strong in the first quarter of last year. When you say profitable, how profitable were you in Latin America just -- what I\u2019m trying to get to is what the trajectory of your margin for that legacy North America business look like because the biggest pushback we get here is that the North America segment is at least relative to the rest of its peers at peak margins given the environment that we\u2019re in and may be just if you could give us some of your thoughts on why there is may be a little bit more expansion in the region going forward?","Laura Thompson","Okay. And let me start, maybe I will start with the earlier part of your question on Brazil, so we were profitable in the first quarter as we\u2019ve said we worked hard on cost, good volumes, good product mix, aligned distributions down there, but year-over-year for the first quarter was still down in Brazil and we\u2019re really not expecting that so better than the fourth quarter and the first quarter but again year-over-year Q1 to Q1 was still down, and we frankly, as we look at Brazil, we will continue to take these actions and set ourselves up well for when things do recover. But we\u2019re really not seeing that that in 2016.","And then, if you think about okay if that\u2019s Brazil within Americas and you think about the U.S. market for example, as you look then at our guidance, the net price mix versus gross, the cost savings versus inflation, volume so on and so forth, all of that tells you that as we look at the Americas and especially our U.S. business, we see continued improvement as we move through the year. We do not believe we are at peak margins.","Rich Kramer","And I\u2019m just going to jump in, I think if I take a step back and give a view on how we think about the future, its part of the reason that we redid internally our strategy roadmap and frankly shared it with you. As we look to the future, the focus on what\u2019s being demanded from us from the tire industry relative to the OEM requirements, relative to consumer requirements, is frankly only getting more and more difficult and more demanding and we\u2019ve always said we welcome that complexity, it\u2019s actually a good thing for us that part of the market that\u2019s growing both in demand is the toughest part of the market. That\u2019s where we\u2019re headed, that\u2019s where our focus is.","And that\u2019s why I think as we look at where our margins will be; we\u2019re not giving a forecast next quarter or three quarters down the road. But as we look down out into the future, I think the opportunities are actually more exciting today than they were let\u2019s say five years ago. And I think that\u2019s true about the auto industry in general in terms of what\u2019s coming and maybe even a simple example you saw some of our domestic OE customers investing in more SUV product.","SUV tires and mixing up to SUV tires is really a good business mix for us and so as we look at where the industry is going, I think the mix opportunities still get us very excited and we\u2019d say that I don\u2019t think we look at it and say we\u2019re at peak margins and we\u2019re never going to go from here. I think the opportunities are actually pretty exciting.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.","Ryan Brinkman","Hi good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First of all --","Rich Kramer","Good morning, Ryan.","Ryan Brinkman","Good morning. I think investors are increasingly trying to gauge the potential impact of any U.S. tariff on Chinese made PVR tires in the broad consensus this would negatively impact Cooper Tire, because many of your tires are made in China but there is more uncertainty out there, what it will mean for Goodyear. So where do you primarily source to PVR tires that you sell in U.S. do you bring them in from China and if you could in the future, could you instead bring them easily from I don\u2019t know Brazil or something, how should we generally think about any possible PVR tires impacting you?","Rich Kramer","So we certainly can\u2019t comment what the impact would be to any competitors. I would say just from a behavior perspective, we see pre-buy ahead when we\u2019ve had the terrorists on passenger tires and you\u2019ve already some have seen some of that pre-buy particularly in the replacement markets for truck tires. So that behavior I think is repeating itself and it\u2019s why you saw the OE side of the OE industry actually have some headwinds in the quarter, where the replacement side was impacted less. That again is some of the pre-buy coming in, in anticipation of what happens.","For us most of our truck tires are made right here in the United States. We do import some tires but essentially the bulk of our products are made right here in the U.S. and remember we have very strong products, very strong linkages to the OEMs, when you saw some of the slowdown in the quarter but long-term our technology is valued by the OEMs and is valued by the fleets not only because of the products but because of our entire solution fleet solution model to them as well.","So again can\u2019t say how it\u2019s ultimately going to play out. But for us we\u2019ve got a very good I would say an envy of the industry truck business model here and we\u2019re going to continue to execute no matter what happens.","Ryan Brinkman","Okay. That\u2019s great to hear. And then just last question regarding the price mix to raw spread, I\u2019m curious what you\u2019re seeing that allows the full-year outlook to remain plus $75 million year-over-year on Slide 12 and despite you say raw math tracking down may be 2% versus 5% prior, is it that price is longer, is mix longer, are those like spot prices in dollars and Euro was rebounded some versus the dollar? I\u2019m not sure just, what is the initial outlook may be conservative at the then prevailing stock prices or what\u2019s the offset that you\u2019re seeing?","Rich Kramer","So you saw our raw material forecast go from 5% down to 2% so the difference in the benefit that we would get. And I would say as we look at that and then we see less of a benefit, our value proposition as we\u2019ve talked about often really is about getting value for our products in the marketplace through going out and getting rewarded, if you will, for innovation, for technology, for our products, for our brands, for our distribution, for our supply chain, and it\u2019s something that we\u2019ve done very well over time, and even periods of let\u2019s say rising raw material cost, we have a very strong track record of being able to recover our cost in the marketplace because of that. So as we see raw material prices going up which we do, I think today natural rubber as a proxy was like $0.71 a pound, that\u2019s up from $0.59 or $0.60 a pound not too long ago.","Our philosophy has always been to recover our costs and get paid for the value proposition in the marketplace, it\u2019s our philosophy, and we execute tactically to go do that and that\u2019s no different when we look at the environment that we\u2019re in right now. And again I would say rather than just saying we\u2019re going to do this, if you look at our track record of offsetting increased raw material cost it is quite substantial we\u2019ve been quite successful at it and we intend to really do it no different at this time. I would tell you though as we\u2019ve spoken in the past in these environments, there can be a lag when we ultimately recover that because of the way the materials flow through our P&Ls goes faster through Asia let\u2019s say than it does in the U.S.","But again philosophically our view is that we will cover the value of the value we bring to our customers in the marketplace and it\u2019s no different here as we look at a change in our cost of raw materials.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.","Rich Kramer","Good morning, Rod.","Pat Nolan","Good morning, it\u2019s actually Pat Nolan on for Rod.","Rich Kramer","Hey Pat.","Pat Nolan","How are you? Just wanted to just one quick clarification on the price mix versus raw discussion, so when we think about the change of going from the 2% benefit from the 5% benefit and you\u2019ve said pretty clearly that you hope to offset that with improving price mix versus raws, price mix benefit from that. Can you -- and you need a sequential improvement in pricing and mix right, it\u2019s not just a matter of there is less geared back on the OEM business; you actually do need to see an upward movement in pricing and mix from current levels, correct?","Rich Kramer","On mix I think Pat it\u2019s going to vary region by region, country by country. As I mentioned places in Brazil, we\u2019ve announced price increases already that are in place, so that would be an increase year-over-year and other markets it could be simply different how we go about achieving, recovering the raw material prices. I don\u2019t think I can give you -- I don\u2019t think I can give you one answer for that, what I can say is just to reiterate what I said before is that we\u2019ve got a very strong track record of managing price mix versus raw material, that\u2019s through a variety of things getting it back in the marketplace for a value proposition, getting efficiencies through us, through our own internal processes as well and as we\u2019ve done it in the past, our intention is to do that again.","Pat Nolan","Thank you. And on the European business, so replacement on the consumer side was up slightly. Is that a matter the end parts versus the industry is that a matter of just being more disciplined on price because it still remains competitive there or would you expect to be performing in line with the industry going forward?","Rich Kramer","Well you know I think it\u2019s a combination of a lot of things. Again I would go back and say that the European market remains a very, very good market. We do have the sort of the industry headwinds of these low cost Chinese tires remember used to come to the U.S. then they went to Latin America, and now they\u2019re going into Eastern Europe that\u2019s having an impact on the industry there. But really when we look at sort of the mix up that\u2019s going on over there, I\u2019m really very optimistic on where the market is right now. And where it\u2019s going and our opportunities in that market, I would tell you as well as we look at Q1 just to frame it, we do have a seasonal business over there and what we also saw in Q1 as an industry is that winter has stuck around longer which meant the summer change over season didn\u2019t happen until later in the quarter which also had an industry impact in terms of how tires slowed and how tires changed over.","So I think as you look at Q1, you got a little bit of seasonal impact in there as well. But long-term in 2016 very good market, our focus is going to remain on driving our mix in both replacement in OE. We are focusing on sort of getting more discipline in our line distribution, improving the alignment between ourselves and the dealers. We continue to introduce industry-leading new products there which will help us.","Our focus is growing in those higher parts of the market and really leveraging our Goodyear and Dunlop brands over there and we\u2019re going to continue to drive that and as we\u2019ve mentioned we\u2019ve taken some cost actions on closing some facilities in the UK and Germany. We announced that a while ago, we\u2019re in process of doing that, we\u2019ll see the benefit of that going forward and we\u2019ll continue to focus on getting our costs in line as Europe by definition is a bit of a high cost region.","Operator","And we will take the next question from Emmanuel Rosner with CLSA.","Rich Kramer","Good morning, Emmanuel.","Emmanuel Rosner","Hi good morning everybody. So first question on the volume outlook, so maintaining that at 3% for the full-year obviously you did that in the first quarter, seems like in the first quarter you essentially did it through Asian volume growth, so I just know Americas was essentially flattish as was Europe. Is that way you see it achieving it for the full-year as well or is there any room in the developed markets to get a little more close. And I guess as far as that question, I know you started to import some of your own tires into the U.S. to sort of address this I guess strong demand, lack of capacity. Are you able to import more we see throughout the year some improvement in the -- in sort of like your, your volume I guess in the Americas?","Rich Kramer","Yes I will say in terms of volume growth for the year, we didn\u2019t break it down by region but I would say clearly had growth in Asia by definition and by plan it is a growth region for us and will continue to be more important to us. But we also had growth in certain mature markets as well, EMEA had growth and by definition that is a mature market where we see opportunity and while we don\u2019t break it down for you I can say that by certain segments of our market within North America we had year-over-year growth as well in terms of those high-value segments of the market that we targeted. So we are seeing growth in the places that are very important to us as well.","In terms of the impact of imports going forward, I would expect that the amount of imports that we get increases over time and it will help elevate some of the supply problem that we have. I mean that\u2019s kind of what we said in the past and I think that will continue to happen.","Laura Thompson","And then to add on just Emmanuel our normal seasonality right, so Q2 and Q3 are going to be stronger than Q4.","Emmanuel Rosner","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just wanted to turn quickly to your comments around taking cost actions or I guess further cost focus in Europe. Clearly when looking at your margins you felt dramatic improvement but there is still like a pretty decent gap I guess versus some of the other parameters that operate in Europe. What sort of actions that you sort of contemplating and more importantly what sort of timing should we expect to see further benefit to the margin profile from these costs and restructuring?","Rich Kramer","Well again I go back to say some things that we\u2019ve done already you may remember that we closed our Wolverhampton UK mixing and retread facility, we had a reduction of about 400 associates there and I think starting in 2017, we will see about an annual benefit of $30 million for that. So I tell you that just as an indication that we continue to look at our footprint, our efficiencies on how we can make sure that we\u2019re getting our cost in line. We are doing the same thing around our SAG cost and I think it\u2019s something that you will see as continuing to do going forward.","We don\u2019t have any other particular announcements to make at this time but Emmanuel what I would say is I agree with you and I think our team agrees with you and one of the focus items of Jean-Claude Kihn who just took over our European business at the beginning of the year is making sure that we have the diligence on cost again on a tactical basis, but then also strategically as we look out to the future to make sure that we\u2019re getting our breakeven point lower and all the things that that would entail both from an operations perspective, from a daily management perspective, and from a structural perspective and that\u2019s what we are going to continue to focus on.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, we are at the top of the hour and this will conclude the conference for today.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Goodyear First Quarter 2012 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Greg Fritz, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Gregory A. Fritz","Thank you, Gina, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Goodyear's first quarter conference call. Joining me today are Rich Kramer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Darren Wells, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, there are few items I would like to cover.","To begin, the webcast of this morning's discussion and the supporting slide presentation can be found on our website at investor.goodyear.com. Additionally, a replay of this call will be available later today. Replay instructions were included in our earnings release issued earlier this morning.","If I can now direct your attention to the Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2.

On today's call, Rich will provide a business overview, including perspective on our first quarter results and our progress and Goodyear's key strategic objectives. After Rich's remarks, Darren will discuss the financial results and outlook before opening the call to your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Rich.","Richard J. Kramer","Great. Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. For more than a year, we've discussed Goodyear's strategy roadmap and our destination of creating sustainable value. But during that time, we've seen significant changes and continued volatility in both the business environment and the economic outlook. But despite these changes, we've remained focused on our strategies that we laid out, building towards our destination. We believe that by executing our strategies, we will be competitively advantaged in an industry that is being shaped by the 7 MegaTrends that we've discussed with you previously. Our strategy roadmap journey aligns not only with where the global tire industry is now but more importantly, where it's headed. ","We continued on that journey in the first quarter of 2012. Our results confirm that we are continuing to make progress on the path to our 2013 target of $1.6 billion in segment operating income. Over the first 3 months of the year, we recorded $292 million in segment operating income and a record $5.5 billion in sales. We achieved these results despite weaker industry volumes and continued high raw material costs. We were once again able to more than offset raw material increases with price mix as our overall revenue per tire increased 16% versus a year ago. And we continue to focus on, and win in, targeted market segments, growing volume and share in many of these profitable segments while selling fewer, low value and private label tires. ","Now to reiterate my comments from our Q4 call, we are not running our business for one good quarter or one good year, but rather with the consistencies and stability over the long-term to withstand the inevitable ups and downs of the tire industry. The progress in our North America business provides us with a great example of how our strategy can change the capability of our business, those that's particularly relevant in North America, as returning that business to consistent profitability is one of our key strategies. In the first quarter, North American tire delivered segment operating income of $80 million, double its total for the first quarter of 2011 and sales increased 8% to $2.5 billion, a first quarter record. This performance was achieved even though total tire unit volume was down 8%. So with 25% higher raw material costs and an 8% lower volume, North America doubled its earnings. This performance was enabled by a consistent execution of the how-to's from our strategy roadmap. ","Now let me elaborate starting with the first one, and that's market-backed innovation. Our Goodyear Assurance family of tires is the foundation of a clear, simplified product portfolio. Assurance TripleTred, ComforTred and Fuel Max embody market-backed innovation and are the most-demanded Goodyear products in North America. We have helped generate, capture and fulfill that consumer demand with our new and growing tire and service network, which is supported by proprietary online tools. Our digital marketing capabilities now acts as a bridge between shoppers and our network dealers. Our innovation leadership applies not only to innovative products, but also to processes and tools that make it easier for consumers to choose Goodyear. At the same time, those processes and tools support profitable growth for our customers and for Goodyear. It's a winning formula and certainly, a competitive advantage for both of us. ","Now next, those innovative products are being sold in profitable target market segments. In the replacement market, our improved mix is a result of Goodyear branded products being sold in those market segments where our innovative products and technology are differentiated from our competitors. We also see this at OE. We are winning profitable OE shipments on high loyalty vehicles, another success in our targeted market segment strategy. This reflects the OE selectivity approach we initiated several years ago and has revived since then. Selectivity, paired with raw material price adjustments included in our OE contracts, has made this a segment worth targeting, consistent with our strategy. And also, keep in mind that part of targeting profitable market segments is deciding not to compete where there is insufficient return even if volume opportunities exist. We have, and will continue to say no to business that is not consistent with our strategy as we are not running our business for volume alone. ","Now this is true in our commercial business as well. We're applying many of the initiatives that have worked successfully in our Consumer business there as well. ","The third how-to is operational excellence. North America Tire has made a commitment to improving operating processes to more efficiently deliver industry-leading service to our customers. We have seen encouraging progress in making and delivering more, the tires our customers want while reducing the amount of inventory we have to carry to meet that demand. We believe operational efficiency is a distinct competitive advantage for Goodyear and one where we see many opportunities for continued improvement. Now in addition to efficiency, operational excellence includes cost reduction programs as well. The most significant of which was the closure of our high-cost Union City factory in 2011. As the shifting of products from Union City to our other facilities in North America nears completion, the associated transition cost will be eliminated in Q2, allowing NAT to realize the full benefit of that closure."," ","Our enabling investments include upgrades to our remaining North America factories to make more of the high value-added tires that consumers want to buy and our dealers want to sell. So not only are our North America plants full, but more importantly, they're making more of the right products, the products to meet the demand in our targeted market segments. And finally, we believe our North America team is the best in the industry. Our associates in the product business units and functions are aligned, connected and performing with dedication to the strategy. Now equally important here is that our customers see it, they appreciate it and benefit from the consistency of both message and purpose. So through execution of the key how-to's, North America Tire achieved a profitability quarter despite an environment in which volumes remained weak and the industry was still well off its historical trends. Clearly, the business is being run with the discipline and consistency needed to reach its targets and ultimately create sustainable value in line with our destination. ","While North America shows the most dramatic improvement in the first quarter, our other regions also made progress in line with our strategy. In Europe, we felt the effects of softer consumer and commercial replacement industries. This condition was attributable in large part to an extraordinarily warm, or as we call the \"green\" winter, and weak economic conditions across much of Europe which have resulted in reduced sellouts and increase dealer inventories. In that environment, however, we continued to execute our strategy by winning in our targeted market segments, offsetting increases in raw material costs with price mix, proactively implementing cost-reduction programs and not chasing non-core volume. We gained share in our targeted market segments or in product recognition and launched more new high value-added tires to continue to differentiate our brands from the competition. For example, the new Goodyear and Dunlop brand winter tires were well-received in Russia, where there actually was snow this year. And the Dunlop Sport Maxx RT and Sport Maxx Race were introduced at a high-performance market, a key market for us there. ","And in Latin America, we have capacity expansions underway in our manufacturing plants in Chile and Brazil to deliver more high-value added consumer and commercial truck tires. The volatile business environment continues to be a challenge in Brazil and other key Latin American markets but we're pleased that the team has demonstrated commitment to the strategy and is aligning in action -- aligning its actions with the key how-to's. Our Asia Pacific business had a solid quarter, delivering segment operating income equal to the first quarter of a year ago. Though growth in China is more moderate than a year ago, the foundation of our business there is strong and we are growing at a consistent put pace in our key targeted market segments. We certainly continue to believe in the long-term growth potential of the China market. And our commitment to the market is supported by our new production facility in China that will nearly double our capacity there. ","Our results in the quarter were achieved even with higher cost given the ramp up of that new factory in China. This ramp up is on track and will enable us to discontinue production at our old factory later this year. And in addition, we will start producing commercial truck tires this year in China and we're excited to see production really accelerate next year and our analysis of the Chinese truck tire market confirms that high-performing fuel-efficient truck tires form a growing key targeted market segment there, as Chinese fleets increasingly see the benefits of our value proposition and our technological advances. So again, in a continued uncertain economic environment, the progress in all of our strategic business units is a clear indication that we're making continual strides on our journey. ","Now stepping back from our business units, I also want to take a moment to talk about the improvement in our capital structure, which is a key enabler of our progress.","Now while Goodyear has had a solid balance sheet for a number of years now, last week, we completed the second of 2 important refinancings during 2012. Our existing $1.5 billion revolving credit facility was increased to $2 billion and its maturity was extended to 2017, and our $1.2 billion term loan was extended to 2019. Now taken together with the 10-year notes we issued in Q1, we are now in a position to not only have a strong cash and available credit, but also have 7 years ahead without any term debt maturities. This will allow us to function with even more focused time spending on executing our strategy. So as we look ahead to the next quarter and the rest of the year, we'll continue to manage our business for the long term. To respond to bleak demand, we have decreased our decreased our production especially in Europe. We see the adjustment as simply a course correction, allowing us to manage cash, control inventories and reduce overhead while continuing to supply the tires that are in the greatest demand. These decisions result in short-term cost, but we're confident they are the right decisions for our long-term choices. They are consistent with our goal of creating sustainable value for the long-term. ","Now we will continue to take the appropriate actions in these uncertain times. While the U.S. economy is showing signs of modest improvement, such as total miles driven being up 3 months in a row, we expect that other economies, such as Europe, will remain volatile. ","Now in that environment, we will continue to plan our business cautiously and do so with discipline, focusing on intense cost control and prioritizing cash and earnings over volume. Now that said, we remain optimistic over the long-term as we believe volumes, particularly in our mature markets, will ultimately rebound as we continue to seek pent-up consumer demand driven by weak economies, high unemployment and general consumer cautiousness. ","Now however, anticipating volume increases over the long term, we continue to expect an environment of escalating raw material costs. Our strategy is to continue to manage raw material cost with price mix while delivering strong returns with the same focus we're practicing now and certainly, within the context of our strategy roadmap. I'd like to close my comments by revisiting another of the distinguishing traits of our destination. As we drive towards creating sustainable economic value, we will run our business in a way that allows us to be profitable through the economic cycle. We are still on a journey but we view the results of this quarter as evidence that we're becoming more consistent in both our execution and our results. We are pleased with the fundamental strength of our business, which is winning in targeted market segments with innovative products. We are pleased with the progress we have made in building the capabilities necessary to execute the key how-to's of our strategy roadmap. And we are pleased with the decisions we have made to run our business for the long-term to reach our destination of creating sustainable value. ","Our momentum continues to build and we are sustaining a consistent level of performance. We have now reported 8 quarters in a row of positive operating income in our North America business, 6 straight quarters of more than $5 billion in sales, 6 consecutive quarters of double-digit revenue for tire growth and 4 straight quarters in which we have more than offset record increases in raw material costs. These results have been with a consistent focus on progress against our strategy roadmap. We are confident in our teams, our products and the path we're on to hit our long-term targets. So now, I'm going to turn the call over to Darren. Darren?","Darren R. Wells","Thanks, Rich, and good morning, everyone. While our Q1 results were not as strong as last year, given significantly lower industry volumes, our performance was substantially improved from fourth quarter levels. As North America earnings improvement continued and Asia recognized insurance proceeds that more than offset the impact of the Thailand flood in the quarter. We continue to believe the underlying structural improvements in our business, including the end of the inefficiencies related to the plant closing in North America will support solid earnings growth through 2012 and beyond. ","Turning to the income statement on Slide 8, our first quarter revenue increased 2% to $5.5 billion on an 8% reduction in volume. Replacement unit volumes decreased 12% during the quarter, while OE volumes rose 4%. It's important to note that our replacement unit volume comparisons were challenging given the very strong performance we had during the prior year in many of our business. Revenue for tire increased 16% compared with the prior year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We generated gross margin of 16.7% in the quarter, representing a 70 basis point decline compared to the prior year. As has been the case for several quarters now, the decline is more than explained by increases in both COGS and sales as a direct consequence of higher raw material cost. ","Selling, administrative and general expense decreased $6 million to $662 million during the quarter. As a percentage of sales, SAG declined 40 basis points to 12%. Excluding the discrete items, our first quarter tax rate as a percentage of foreign segment operating income was approximately 21%. First quarter after-tax results were impacted by certain significant items. The most notable of these was $86 million in charges related to the successful redemption of 10.5% notes which resulted in an unfavorable impact of $0.35 per share after tax. The summary of significant items can be found in the appendix of today's presentation.","Turning to the segment operating income stature on Slide 9, you can see the progression of operating income compared with the prior year. We reported $525 million of favorable price mix during the quarter, which more than offset $482 million of raw material price increases. With lower volume was the $54 million reduction in income, cost savings of $64 million partially offset general inflation of $75 million. We remain on track to achieve our 3-year, $1 billion cost savings goal. ","As we've discussed on our prior call, our other tire-related businesses went from a negative to a positive, with a $16 million year-over-year improvement, reflecting third-party chemical profits benefiting from rising gizdying [ph] prices and improved earnings from the Off-The-Road tires. In the other category, you see unabsorbed overhead was an unfavorable $6 million due to the production cuts, especially in EMEA, partially offset by the benefit of our Union City closure in North America. As we indicated on the previous call, we have made adjustments to our production schedules given the recent softness in demand. ","Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 10. Our net debt balance increased to $3.5 billion at quarter end. The increase during the quarter is largely attributable to seasonal working capital requirements, along with this year's higher pension contribution. Our liquidity position remains solid with $4.5 billion of cash and available credit before the benefit of increasing the size of our revolving credit lines. Our strong liquidity position, enhanced further with recent refinancing, provides us with good flexibility as we continue to execute our strategy. ","Turning to Slide 11, you can see our debt maturity schedule pro forma for the impact of our recent refinancing actions. As you can see on the chart, we have no term debt maturities until 2019. This provides a clear path for us to address required pension contributions over the next few years. ","Turning to segment results, North America reported a strong improvement earnings during the first quarter. Europe, Middle East and Africa reported lower earnings in what proved to be a challenging macro environment. Latin American earnings were weaker and Asia earnings were essentially flat with the prior year despite higher start-up costs for our new factory in China. ","Looking at the key drivers in each business unit, North America reported segment operating income of $80 million in the first quarter, which compares to operating income of $40 million in the first quarter of 2011. North America unit volumes were down 8%, reflecting generally weak consumer and commercial replacement industries which were down 6% and 13%, respectively. We also face strong year-ago comps for our sales, given the strong sell-in to dealers in Q1 2011. OE industry demand continues to see strong gains with commercial demand increasing 21% and consumer up 8%. Our strategy of focusing on targeted market segments helped deliver significant price\/mix improvement, which more than offset $184 million of additional raw material costs. Revenue for tire increased 21% year-over-year. ","Like we saw on the fourth quarter last year, North American manufacturing cost were still impacted by the disruption from transferring Union City products to other factories. Q1 is the last quarter when this should be a significant factor, with Q2 manufacturing cost expected to reflect the full benefit of the Union City closure with no offset. Our first quarter results are further evidence that North America business continues to make excellent progress toward our $450 million segment operating income target. ","Europe, Middle East and Africa reported segment operating income of $90 million in the quarter, which compares to $153 million in the 2011 period. Our 2012 results reflect sales of $1.9 billion, a decrease of 1% versus the prior year. The decline in sales was driven by a 9% decrease in unit volume. Unfavorable foreign currency translation impacted net sales for the quarter by $94 million. Revenue for tire, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, increased 16% year-over-year. EMEA's increase in revenue per tire was driven by strong price mix performance. Industry unit volume for consumer replacement was down 5%, the consumer replacement industry was impacted by warm winter weather, leaving the high winter tire inventory at our dealers. As a consequence, summer tire sell-in has started slowly. In addition, industry unit volume for consumer OE was down 7%. In commercial truck, replacement industry shipments declined 13% versus last year, with volume reductions exacerbated by dealers reducing their inventories. Truck OE industry volumes, which have been a bright spot in recent quarters, were up only 1% in Q1. EMEA segment operating income of $90 million reflected price mix of $209 million, which more than offset $177 million of raw material cost increases. Lower unit volume negatively impacted income by $28 million compared with a year-ago. To align inventory with lower level of demand, production schedules in Q4 and Q1 were reduced, negatively impacting Q1 segment operating income by $20 million. SAG increase versus prior year reflecting a higher warehousing cost on softer sales, along with investment in marketing to drive branded share. ","In Latin America, sales for the first quarter declined 11% to $521 million, with the sale of farm tire business and foreign exchange account for more than 70% of the year-over-year sale decline. Tire unit sales declined 12% from the prior year. Lower volumes were largely consistent between replacement and OE. Latin America reported operating income in the first quarter of $55 million, compared to $67 million in the prior year. This decline is largely attributable to the lower unit volume particularly in Brazil. Longer-term, we remain confident in the strength of our brand, our products and our distribution and our ability to transition to future needs of the market in Brazil and other Latin American markets. ","Our Asia Pacific business reported segment operating income of $67 million for the quarter, which was flat versus the prior year. We're pleased with these results given the incremental $7 million of start-up expenses associated with the ramp up of our new factory in China. The continued impact of the flood in Thailand and softer consumer replacement demand in many parts of Asia, more than offset the growth in our China business year-over-year. Improved price mix around the region more than offset raw material increases. Revenue for tire excluding foreign exchange increased 9% versus prior year. Our Off-The-Road business continues to perform very well given the growth of the mining sector in the region. We continue to be excited about the opportunities we see in Asia and particularly in China going forward, despite the relative softness that we've experienced over the last couple of quarters. ","With regards to the recovery from the flooding of our Thailand factory, which was closed on October 20, we have now began production of both aviation and consumer tires. We anticipate regaining full production during the second quarter. During the quarter, the net impact of losses in insurance recoveries was a favorable $3 million, with insurance proceeds covering all the Q1 impact and making up for part of the impact from Q4. We expect flood-related cost to impact Asia's result adversely again during the second quarter with additional insurance recovery proceeds to be reflected later in the year as the claim is resolved. ","Turning to Slide 13, you can see our 2012 industry outlook for North America and EMEA. We have adjusted our outlook to reflect the softer first quarter volumes and our current view of the next 3 quarters. In North America, we now expect consumer replacement volumes to decline between 1% and 3% for the full year, slightly below our previous outlook of flat to down 2%. Consumer OE is now expected to increase between 2% and 7%. For North America commercial replacement, we now see volumes at plus or minus 2%, which is below our prior forecast of an increase of 2% to 6%. Our commercial OE outlook remains unchanged. ","Turning to EMEA, we have reduced our consumer replacement volume outlook to 3% to 5% -- to down 3% to 5%. Our consumer OE and commercial replacement outlooks remains unchanged. We have improved our commercial OE outlook to down only 10% to 15% compared with the prior outlook of down 20% to 25%. ","On Slide 14, we provide some modeling assumptions for 2012. As you can see on the slide, some of the assumptions remain unchanged while others have been slightly revised. We have lowered our overall volume outlook to down 2% from flat previously. This revision largely reflects the softness in the first quarter as we expect volumes would be essentially flat for the balance of the year. As a result of the lower volume outlook, we now expect to see no overhead absorption improvement during the year, given the production cuts that we've implemented. The net impact of unabsorbed overhead is likely to be about flat, with $80 million Union City savings being offset by the impact of production cuts. During the first quarter, the number of units cut from production was similar to the fourth quarter reductions and will impact our second quarter results similarly. Assuming spot prices remain at current levels, we anticipate our raw material cost will increase by approximately 9% for the full year, slightly higher than our prior outlook as we've seen some increases in oil-based materials in recent months. For the second quarter, raw material costs are expected to increase by approximately 12% or $250 million from the prior year. Based on our raw material outlook and previously announced pricing actions, we expect the impact of price mix, net of raw material cost over the remainder of the year, to reflect trends that we've seen over the last couple of quarters. Assuming current spot rates, we expect the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange to be approximately $40 million for the year, after essentially no impact in Q1. ","Finally, our expectations for cost savings, general inflation and China facility start-up costs remain unchanged from our prior outlook. ","Turning to Slide 15. Our other key assumptions for 2012 are also unchanged. I would note, however, that our pension portfolio returns through March 31 were 8.4%, compared with our annual return assumption of 8.5%. Stepping back and looking at the quarter, we delivered solid profitability in a tough environment. We feel that this performance shows increased consistency in our results and strong alignment with our strategy roadmap. ","With that, we'll open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Itay Michaeli, Citigroup.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just 2 questions. One, Darren, can you just clarify what you just said about pricing and mix? I think may have missed it. I think previously, you were looking for price mix versus raw to be neutral in Q2. I was hoping you can update us a bit more on the comment on price mix.","Darren R. Wells","Yes. So Itay, what I said was that the -- our performance of price mix versus raw materials over the balance of the year ought to be similar to what we saw the last couple of quarters. So when you look at the back of the last couple of quarters, the takeaway is, it was, on average, $50 million or $60 million positive between the 2 of them.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then just a bigger picture question. You've expressed confidence this morning around the 2013 targets. Just maybe if you could talk a little bit more about what gives you that level of confidence. And maybe perhaps, list some of the headwinds that you faced in the last quarter or 2 that might be somewhat nonrecurring in nature, not saying that they'll definitely non-recur, but things that may be sort of non repeat going to 2013, Thailand for example, the farm tire business. Just if you could talk a little bit more about that, how that plays into perhaps your confidence around 2013?","Richard J. Kramer","Itay, no, it's a good question. And I think, the best way to start the answer to the question is just looking at the first quarter performance. With 8% volumes down, we had segment operating income $292 million and I think it's reflective of a lot of the benefit to the actions that we've taken in our business overtime around structural costs and capacity, as well as building in some of the benefits of the business model that we're building. And ultimately, that's what give us the confidence that we'll be able to hit the targets that we have. If we look at it, things like the Union City savings, we mentioned in the call, we're going to get that $80 million as we go ahead. We look at our business model around the combination of innovating, bringing new products to market, putting those products in the right targeted market segments again, being very choiceful about where we're going to play in our business to drive the price mix as we move ahead and then, driving continual operational efficiencies in our business to be able to make more of the right tires that we have and that we need to deliver to our customers, that's what's driving the price mix as we move ahead. And you see that probably best in our North American business, where we've had, what I would say, a very good quarter in terms of doubling our earnings there. In terms of headwinds, as you look at it, I think if we go back to what we said when we met in New York about a year ago, 2 of the key elements that we said we had -- we really were looking to help us get to that target was about a 3% of 5% volume growth. Last year, we were about flat. This year, we just say about minus 2%, you've heard us say. So that's a bit of a headwind. And also, we saw a benefit from pension coming in when we laid this out about a year ago. Clearly, now we have a little bit more headwinds from pension. But as we look at that, those are things that we're going to have to work through. And again, I would say Q1 is evidence that our business model now is one that allows us to have confidence that we could hit those targets. And frankly, our goal is certainly to deliver on those targets but build this business beyond that and drive ourselves to our destination of creating sustainable value for this business over time and being profitable throughout the cycles.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank.","Patrick Nolan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It's actually Pat Nolan on for Rod. A couple of questions. First on the free cash flow, 1.1 burn in the quarter, I know that includes the pension contribution. How should we think about the working capital for the balance of the year and are there going to be other call backs on what's been used over the past, I guess, it's been a 1.25 years now?","Darren R. Wells","Yes. Pat, I think it is a good question. And I think, ultimately, we're going to come back to the fact that we see working capital as neither a source nor a use for us the full year. So in the first quarter, we saw a seasonal build similar to what we saw a year ago. In addition, we had the pension contributions that we made that were higher than last year. So what we've got there was largely what we would have expected to get. I will make a comment about inventory though, because if there's one area that we're focused on, it is inventory. We did see an uptick in the first quarter inventory. We saw an uptick in Q4 as well and both of those, given the soft volume environment declines in the -- and ultimately, declines in the industry unit demand. So we've taken actions in Q4 and Q1 to cut production. And so we're taking steps to proactively manage inventory, deal with our cost position. We'll take additional actions during the second quarter and the remainder of the year as we need to but we come back and say, given the first quarter volume was soft, and what we see for the balance of the year is essentially unchanged from what we have previously expected, volume-wise, we'll get some improvement in demand for the first quarter levels. And those, along with the production actions we've taken are going to get our inventories in line for year end and bring us back to working capital being neither a source nor a use for 2012.","Patrick Nolan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just another couple of quick ones. Just on the Union City run rate, are we at the full $80 million annual run rate in the first quarter or does that improve going forward?","Richard J. Kramer","What we saw in the first quarter, we get the savings of essentially $20 million a quarter for the Union City closure. But we continue to have that offset by the inefficiencies that are created by moving those Union City products to other North American factories. So we get those transitory cost that we saw in Q4, we also see Q1. Q1 is the last quarter where we're going to see those. So in Q2, you still get the $20 million of savings but you're not going to have those offsets with the product transfer inefficiencies. So that said, that there is continuing improvement for North America in Q2 and the remainder of the year versus Q1.","Patrick Nolan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just one last one. On the commercial vehicle business, is there a material difference as far as a percent of your volume that the commercial vehicle industry represents in Europe and North America. I know it's higher in Latin America but when you look at North America versus Europe, is one of those regions more significant?","Darren R. Wells","No, no. They're about the same.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Murphy, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Elizabeth Lane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is actually Elizabeth Lane on for John. You may just have answered this on Pat's question but I just wanted to confirm. So your reduced full year outlook for tire volumes, is that really just a result of the first quarter being weaker than expected or does it seem like Q2 and onward might be a little worse than previously expected as well?","Darren R. Wells","Now listen, I think, you understood it correctly.","Elizabeth Lane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And you mentioned that you expect solid earnings growth in 2012 and beyond, should we be thinking about that as -- that earnings growth as net income basis or on an operating income basis? And besides the cost savings coming through better in the rest of the year, in such a sluggish volume environment, do you think -- what do you think are the biggest drivers of that solid earnings growth?","Darren R. Wells","Yes, so I think the -- as we look at -- I mean, first of all, the measurement that we use for our segment operating income that doesn't show our target when we make those comments generally, that's what's we're referencing. I think Itay asked a question about some of things that our headwinds force now that won't be there going forward. And I think we talked about, one, which is the transition cost around moving products from Union City to other factories in North America. Clearly, that's going to be an improvement. This is the -- first quarter was the last quarter where we'll take the impact of having sold the farm business in Latin America. So that's behind us now. The recovery and the full recovery in the Thailand factory, that's something that is going to be behind us. And those are of a one-time nature. If we look beyond that, we're looking to get volume growth back, so we're expecting and planning for volume growth in 2013, after having flat volumes last year and volumes slightly declining this year, particularly in the first quarter. I think balance of the year, we expect them to be essentially flat. In addition to that, we should see some continued improvement in unabsorbed overhead. We have expected some improve this year. What you'll see now is that we expect it to be essentially flat to last year but that still leaves us with a significant amount of factory utilization benefit that we can get going forward. And we take all that, you can also add to that the fact that our pension expense, given the contributions that we're making this year, our pension expense will be down next year in the range of $50 million. So we have a number of things there that are going to help us that are discrete in nature in addition to just expecting better industry environment. So, Rich?","Richard J. Kramer","I would add 2 things. I think Darren has given you a very good, almost a walk of how you could go through that. I'd emphasize one and add another and that's the benefits, just remind you, the benefit of volume. Darren mentioned unabsorbed overhead. Remember, we were flat last year. Year-over-year, down 2%. This year, as we look at it, the thing I'd remind everyone is ultimately the volume that we seek today will get better. Now the exact timing of that, obviously, is a little bit hard to predict. But as we look at where we were, say prerecession, there was sort of a sentiment that volume was going to go up and it wasn't going to decrease anymore. Now, we're in a situation where certainly volume is moderated because of the great recession. But I would tell you, we will get back to the higher levels than we are today. And that volume going through our plants given that the business model that we're structuring will be very valuable to us. And the second thing is as we look at our plans in 2012 and beyond, we're continually making a higher mix of products that's driving what we're selling in the marketplace, supporting the price\/mix and supporting our ability to win in those targeted market segments. We've made more of those in 2012, we'll make more of them in 2013. And as we get the benefits of the capital investments we're making in all of our factories around the world, that's going to continue to improve as well.","Elizabeth Lane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, right. Yes, that makes sense for getting to your 2013, that's how I targeted. So I just wanted to confirm that you're expecting SOI high-growth in 2012 versus 2011.","Richard J. Kramer","Yes. We're not giving specific guidance on that. I think we're giving you an indication that what we see is some things that's clearly going to help us grow earnings going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ravi Shanker, Morgan Stanley.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","The start-up costs in China and the Thailand impact and even the European plant impact, were not nearly as high in 1Q as you were expecting? Is there something lumpy going on there because even your guidance remains unchanged and it did much better than what's your guidance?","Richard J. Kramer","The question's about the Thailand -- the impact of the Thailand flood, we experienced volume losses and extra expenses related to the flood, both in Q4 and Q1. The difference is that in Q1, we recognized insurance proceeds. And effectively, what we got was -- and insurance proceeds are recognized as a claim gets processed. So it's a little bit lumpy. And what we saw is that on the fourth quarter, we got hit with over $20 million of impact from the Thailand flood. First quarter had significant impact as well, but we actually got enough insurance proceeds recognized in Q1, that we -- not only did we offset all of the Q1 impact, but we actually got a little bit of money back from what we lost in Q4. So what you see in -- and you see this in Asia Pacific most notably, is you see a slight positive impact of the Thailand flood in Q1 because we got the insurance.","Darren R. Wells","And Ravi, that's consistent with how we laid it out back to Q4 as well.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And what about the China plant? I mean, is that fairly consistent for the year as well?","Richard J. Kramer","Yes, so the China start-up is really no change to our outlook there. Maybe a little bit of timing, we're a couple of million dollars lower run rate in Q1 but the outlook for the full year hasn't changed.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Also your Latin America margin stepped up nicely sequentially versus the last 3 quarters. How are the -- how will you characterize the competitive and pricing environment there now?","Richard J. Kramer","Ravi, I would say it's really a continuation of what we saw sort of through the back half of last year. Latin America, for us has been and we believe will continue to be an excellent markets for us where our brand has tremendous value. What we're seeing there, and I've mentioned this in the past is that you see instability from time to time in Latin America, is sort of the one thing that you can count on and we're seeing a bit of that right now. But clearly, from a competitive standpoint, with the exchange rates in Brazil, certainly impacting domestic manufacturers in a variety of industries, certainly, we're in that group, where we see imports coming in at a lower cost given the exchange there. So that's been a headwind for us. But something that we're working our way through. And frankly, the way we're working our way through is really applying the same strategies that we have. We're investing in our Americana factory to make more of the HVA tires that helped distinguish our brand and our products from lower-end competitors. The same things go forward in places like Venezuela and now even a bit more in Argentina, where we see a lot of the political instability that I think all of you are certainly familiar with. So those present both opportunities and headwinds, and again, I think those are things that are temporal, we'll work our through them. We've worked through them in the past and I'm very confident we'll do it again. Our product lineup there is very good, our brand is excellent, our distribution is excellent, our commercial truck tires are probably better than they've ever been. So competitively, I think, we're very well-positioned and we're confident we'll work through the situation there.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And then just a follow-up on the previous question on the insurance proceeds. That is split out as a special item, right? So that's not actually in adjusted SOI?","Darren R. Wells","The benefit of that will be reflected in SOI in Asia Pacific, there is a small impact that's in corporate as well. But there is -- but most of that is reflected in Asia Pacific.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Saul Ludwig, Northcoast Research.","Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research","A couple of quickies here. The interest expense that you look at for the rest of the year is a much lower rate than what you incurred in the first quarter. What is giving rise to this more favorable trend in interest expense?","Darren R. Wells","Yes. It's a good question because there is an adjustment that is -- it's a $13 million adjustment reflected in the interest expense line this quarter related to prior-period capitalized interest. So we've adjusted -- it was effectively was $2 million to $3 million a year over several years that we needed to put back into interest expense this year. So that's a one-time effect in the first quarter. Even with that, we have not changed our full year guidance. So you can see that as a one-time blip in the first quarter.","Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research","So the $360 million, the $385 million excludes the $13 million?","Darren R. Wells","No, it includes the $13 million. So you can think, we got the $13 million which was essentially an unexpected increase. We actually -- we did the bond refinancing in the first quarter, the interest rate on that was actually a bit better than we expected. So the 2 are essentially netting against each other.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got you. So the run rate going forward is going to be $75 million, $80 million a quarter, it sounds like.","Richard J. Kramer","Yes, so if you think about the interest expense without that one-time adjustment, it was about $88 million for the quarter.","Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research","Could you discuss the update on the whole issues in France, in Amiens and the Union and it's been lingering for a long, long time. I'm sure it's certainly frustrating to you guys. Any progress there? Any light at the end of the tunnel?","Darren R. Wells","Saul, I think Amiens is one that we've been working through what is a very difficult labor environment in France. I would tell you that we continue to move ahead and we have progress being made. But frankly, to put a time line on that is difficult at this point. We'll continue to explore all the different alternatives that we have. We have confidence that ultimately, we'll get to a conclusion there. But again, it's very difficult to put a time period on it at this point.","Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research","And then my final question. In your 2013 goals, which was the $1.6 billion in segment operating income. Now you've highlighted, Rich, that a couple of items aren't moving as you expected, volume and pensions toward that. But when you put the $1.6 billion goal together, does that include other sort of specials, like continued start-up costs and truck tire manufacturing in China, maybe some repositioning of France, other issues that would be a negative, are they baked into the $1.6 billion SOI?","Richard J. Kramer","Yes, I mean. Saul, those 2 items in particular that you're mentioning are in our thinking and in our path to that $1.6 billion. So we can't speak to all the things that may have come along the way but certainly, those things we're aware of are baked into our thinking. And again, I've kind of gone through some of the ways we have confidence, we can get there. I think Darren articulated a few other things. So we're putting it all together and despite those headwinds, we're still on path to get to that number.","Operator","The final question comes from Anthony Deem, KeyBanc Capital Market.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","This is actually Brett Hoselton. A couple of thoughts here. First of all, sequentially, it sounds to me -- I mean, you've given us an outlook for price mix, raws, volumes and so forth. It sounds like as you move into the second quarter, we're going to get an incremental benefit from Union City of about $20 million. It sounds like the Thailand situation is kind of maybe a push going into the second quarter. Are there any other significant variables, as we move from the first quarter to the second quarter, unusual items or anything like that, that affected maybe the first quarter or will affect the second quarter?","Darren R. Wells","Brett, I think you raised the Thailand question, we got the insurance proceeds in the first quarter. We actually don't expect to have those in the second quarter. So the impact from Thailand, you might actually see as bad news in Q2 versus Q1. That's our expectation. And then later in the year, as we settle the claim, we expect we may get to recognize more insurance proceeds. But that's kind of a lumpy process. So Q1 is probably better than Q2 for the Thailand effect. Other than that, and the fact that we get past the transitory cost for Union City, I don't think that there's a lot else that we would point to there. Obviously, we're expecting that volumes will be flat in Q2 after being relatively flat Q2 or through the rest of the year, I should say. Certainly, the year-over-year volume picture, we'd expect to be better than it was in Q1, but other than that, Rich...","Richard J. Kramer","I think it's fairly straightforward at this point.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And as we think about the third quarter, last year, you benefited from a very good winter tire season and obviously, benefiting your price mix. You've already given us some commentary on price mix for the remainder of the year, and I'm wondering, as we think about the third quarter, that seems like a really difficult comp but it sounds like you're suggesting that we can possibly see a $50 million to $60 million price mix over raws benefit as we move to the second, third and the fourth quarter. Am I hearing you correctly?","Darren R. Wells","Yes. So I think, we're not saying that it's going to happen the same way every quarter. We're just giving an indication I guess, of generally, how we see it. So we see the trends from the last couple of quarters being a good way to think about the remainder of the year. But it's not meant to be a particular point for each and every quarter.","Richard J. Kramer","Okay. Thanks, everyone. We appreciate you listening today and we'll speak with you next quarter. Thank you very much.","Darren R. Wells","Thanks.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect."],"10223":["Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.

My name is Tony, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Goodyear's First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","I would now hand the program over to Christina Zamarro, Goodyear's Vice President of Investor Relations.","Christina Zamarro - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Thank you, Tony, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for Goodyear's first quarter 2018 earnings call. Joining me today, are Rich Kramer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Laura Thompson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","The supporting slide presentation for today's call can be found on our website at investor.goodyear.com, and a replay of this call will be available later today. Replay instructions were included in our earnings release issued earlier this morning.","If I could now draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statement on slide 2, I would like to remind participants on today's call that our presentation includes some forward-looking statements about Goodyear's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments today. The most significant factors that could affect future results are outlined in Goodyear's filings with the SEC and in our earnings release. The company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","Our financial results are presented on a GAAP basis, and in some cases, on non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures discussed on the call are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent as part of the appendix to the slides.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rich.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Thank you, Christina, and good morning, everyone. This morning I will provide an overview of our first quarter results and discuss the recent announcement of TireHub, our planned distribution joint venture in the U.S. I'll also address current industry conditions and our outlook for the remainder of the year. Laura will follow with the financial review of the quarter and walk through the detail of our outlook.","In the first quarter segment operating income was $281 million, and SOI margin was 7% in a challenging overall industry environment, particularly in our consumer business. These results were highlighted by our performance in the 17-inch-and-larger segment in consumer replacement, which delivered more than double the industry growth in the U.S. and Europe. As we said in February, we expected relatively flat volume in the first quarter, which was driven by our planned exit of some of the smaller rim size tires in EMEA OE and expectations for reduced OE demand in the U.S. driven by lower auto production.","As you saw over the course of the quarter, industry sell-in in both the U.S. and EMEA consumer replacement markets was weak and worse than we expected as we saw some destocking in our own channels during the quarter. On the other hand, our sell out demand strengthened in the quarter, particularly in the U.S. which I'll discuss more in a moment. That improvement gives us confidence as we look ahead to the remainder of the year.","Now, what we're most excited about going forward is our recent announcement of TireHub, our planned distribution joint venture with Bridgestone Americas in the U.S. This strategic transaction will strengthen our ability to promote our premium brands, our industry leading e-commerce solution and our strategy of targeting the industry's most profitable large rim sized segments. TireHub will deliver best-in-class service for our retail and fleet customers and will be the cornerstone of our aligned distribution network. At its core, TireHub will allow us to get closer to both our dealers and consumers. With enhanced insight into channel inventories and sell-out, TireHub's dedicated sales force will be an advocate for the Goodyear brand and all that comes with it. In short, TireHub positions us to better capture the value of our technology, our brand and our suite of related services.","We see several specific benefits associated with this joint venture that will further enhance the value of this transaction. First and foremost, our improved national presence when combined with our aligned regional distributors will support our growth through increasing our geographic reach and providing retailers access to a deeper and broader range of our products. TireHub will have same day access to the vast majority of the country and cover 97% of passenger vehicles on the roads.","Second, we'll help our customers better manage growing complexity driven by SKU proliferation through improved fill rates and delivery speed. Third, as we intend to reposition a portion of our existing third-party wholesale volume in conjunction with this transaction, we expect to benefit from higher margin as we redistribute volume to TireHub. With that, we anticipate lower volatility and better demand planning driven by overall less exposure to the wholesale channel. And finally, we expect the benefit of synergies as we combine with Bridgestone Americas, lowering the overall cost to serve our customers.","As we think about our distribution strategy more broadly, we are focused on not just what it takes to win in the market today, but also over the long-term. An aligned distribution network is the backbone to enable the changes we see coming in how tires are sold and how service will increase in value. As we've discussed in the past, consumer buying behavior is changing. More and more consumers are researching and buying tires online. We expect that trend to continue. A tire purchase is no longer simply a transaction. We want a consumer's experience with the Goodyear brand from shopping to purchase to service to be as seamless as possible.","Our goal is to make Goodyear easy to buy, easy to own and easy to recommend from initial research to purchase to installation. We innovate to meet the changing demands of consumers not only in terms of product performance, but also in the total experience they expect from our brand. We will continue to take additional steps to not only leverage technology seamlessly into the tire buying process, but also to shape that process along the way.","Looking even further ahead, we also expect to see a shift in our customer base with the rise of AV and EV fleet to the future. Those changes require that we put in place the strategies, investments and capabilities to thrive in that emerging new mobility ecosystem and aligned distribution network is the foundation and when paired with supporting infrastructure and vehicle connectivity enables us to proactively prepare for an eventual shift from personal car ownership to mobility.","TireHub is a natural next step in our aligned distribution strategy which as you know, is a critical part of our connected business model. This is where Goodyear can add value with our technology, our brand, our aligned retail and distribution network and all the capabilities that we bring to bear for the market. The combination of these elements drives value for our customers and consumers and is where Goodyear will continue to demonstrate its competitive advantage starting today and preparing to shape tomorrow.","Turning to slide 6. I'll cover the U.S. industry environment during the quarter. Overall industry sell-in demand was down 2% in the quarter, while USTMA members were significantly weaker. Our U.S. replacement volume outperformed industry members by 200 basis points. We saw industry growth in the 17-inch-and-larger segment at 4%, and we grew share in this segment significantly outperforming the market during the quarter.","More importantly sell-out of Goodyear products was robust in the quarter driven by the strength of our brand and our products. Our performance in the large rim size segment was driven by outsized growth in our retail channel, which includes our large third-party retail network and our company-owned retail stores. Even when including smaller rim size tires, this channel grew 20% during the quarter.","As we've discussed in prior conference calls, the retail channel including our company-owned stores has been performing very well delivering above market growth over the past several quarters. That's the power the Goodyear brand and our connected business model working together to create value for our business.","Turning to slide 7, I'd like to build on that thought and walk you through the relative performance of our sell-in channels in the U.S. over the past few years, as these differences have had a very significant impact on our replacement volumes and help support how we are thinking about our distribution going forward with TireHub.","First a brief explanation of the graphs on the page. The green line in each chart shows Goodyear's growth in our U.S. customer facing channels, which includes both third-party and company-owned retail stores as well as our big box customers, and it shows it on a trailing 12-month basis. The blue line shows the performance of our third-party wholesale channel on the same basis. Both lines are measured relative to March 2015.","On the left-hand side of the chart, in the 17-inch-and-larger segment, our customer facing channels have grown at a 13% compounded annual growth rate since 2015. The outstanding performance of these channels reflects the strength of our products, market share and the pull of the Goodyear brand in today's market. This consistent performance demonstrates the value of interacting directly with or being closer to our customers and consumers together with our aligned partners. These results reinforce our industry leading value proposition driven by the power of the Goodyear brand and our customer service.","This performance, however, is in stark contrast to our volume in the wholesale channel in the larger rim size segment over the same period. In addition, we've experienced significantly more volatility in the channel. As you know, the wholesaler model can be executed with the buy low, sell high trading component that creates volatility in the industry driven by speculation about where pricing may be headed.","On the right side of the page, we have a similar dynamic playing out in the smaller rim sizes albeit in a declining segment of the market. Even still our customer-facing channels outperform the wholesale channel by an average of 17% per year.","On slide 8, we've taken one step further to include the performance of the overall industry. Our customer-facing channels are clearly outperforming the industry in both the larger and smaller rim size segments. This is what our strategy was designed to deliver. Demand pull from the market back favorable mix-up and above-market growth for our business consistently over time.","On the other hand, our third-party wholesale channel has grossly underperformed the industry. The buy low, sell high model also can influence what brands wholesalers put out into the retail market. I'll note that this behavior is not representative of all our wholesale customers and we're showing our aggregate experience to simply demonstrate the point.","As we think about TireHub in context of this data, be assured that we are taking the right strategic action to strengthen our distribution network for the future. The adjustments we are making in our wholesale business in conjunction with the announcement of TireHub will provide us with significant opportunity to further leverage our brand with growth and mix up in the more profitable large rim size tires. We are sharpening our focus on winning with customers and consumers, who value our brand, our products and our service in the marketplace.","Turning now to slide 9, our EMEA business delivered solid results against the strong comparable in the first quarter of 2018. The European industry was down 2% in total and ETRMA Members were down more than double that amount. In comparison, our consumer replacement volume was down 1%. EMEA's volume performance in the large rim size segment of the market significantly outpaced the industry. We are executing on our plan to mix up our product portfolio in EMEA. We saw incremental industry weakness during the quarter as well as the winter season lingered. In that environment, dealers continued to sell through winter inventories, but did not restock. And given the cold temperatures throughout the quarter, we also experienced a slower start to the summer sell-in than we expected.","The first quarter marks the official launch also of our next-generation tires for the luxury segment, the Goodyear Eagle F1 and the Dunlop Sport Maxx Race 2. The successor to the Sport Maxx Race has been developed together with Porsche to meet the demanding requirements for its new Porsche 911 GT3. With the first generation Sport Maxx Race tires fitted on the previous models of the Porsche 911 GT3, Dunlop continues its commitment to provide specialty tires for Porsche vehicles.","As we look ahead, we expect to continue to see robust growth in EMEA consumer replacement in the coming quarters, particularly in the second and third quarters. We also see our OE volume improving significantly over the remainder of the year. We are continuing to work to strengthen and further differentiate our value proposition in EMEA. We see opportunities to grow richer mix and with it our profitability in the region.","Asia-Pacific delivered another strong quarter in segment operating income driven by growth in consumer volume with outsized performance in the large rim size segment. Asia-Pacific saw first quarter record in volume performance during the quarter driven by its consumer business and winning fitments at OE. We also saw volume growth in consumer replacement in the region, in spite of a headwind due to the impact of pre-buy in the first quarter of 2017.","China had another successful quarter with consumer OE volume increasing 14% as we've seen the market continue to stabilize. OE continues to benefit from strong car sales, while growth in replacement was driven by our team's strong execution of sell-through programs, and on our retail store expansion into Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities.","We also have continued to see robust consumer growth in India and Japan. As we look ahead to the remainder of the year, we expect increasing momentum with double-digit volume growth driven by our key markets in the region.","Looking back at our global businesses in the first quarter, I'm very encouraged by continuing strong demand in the large rim size segment of the market across our regions. We continue to expect 2018 segment operating income to range between $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion, excluding the impact of the TireHub transition. Our investment in the joint venture this year gives us increasing confidence as we think about our 2020 segment operating income target of $2 billion to $2.4 billion.","The Goodyear brand and our value proposition continues to be a competitive advantage in the marketplace. A large part of that is in developing industry leading premium products and making the overall tire buying process easier. I'd also like to take a moment to recognize our business teams for their contributions in executing on our strategy. Last week, Goodyear was recognized as GM's 2017 Tire Supplier of the Year. This global award is a testament to the passion of our employees who work tirelessly to innovate, industrialize and deliver truly best-in-class products and services to our OEMs.","Similarly, Goodyear was recently also included in Forbes, America's most reputable companies for 2018 and held the highest spot among tire manufacturers. Our teams have made the commitment to winning with consumers and helping our customers to build their businesses every day. They have done so while also taking the long view of creating sustainable value and embracing the changes that will reshape our industry.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Laura.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Thank you, Rich, and good morning everyone. Turning to the income statement on slide 10, our unit volume was down 2.5% year-over-year, driven by declines in consumer OE in EMEA and the U.S. Our first quarter sales were $3.8 billion, up 4% from a year ago. Excluding currency, revenue per tire increased 2%. Our first quarter sales also reflect the favorable impact of foreign currency translation. These benefits more than offset the impact of lower tire volume.","Segment operating income was $281 million for the quarter. Our first quarter earnings per share on a diluted basis was $0.31. Our results were influenced by certain significant items and after adjusting for these items, our earnings per share was $0.50.","The step chart on slide 11 walks first quarter 2017 segment operating income to first quarter 2018. The negative impact of lower volume was $20 million and unabsorbed overhead was $3 million in the quarter. The combined headwind from increased raw materials and lower price mix was $109 million for the quarter. Raw material costs were up 9%, in line with expectations and accounted for nearly all of the headwind.","Cost saving actions of $75 million were driven by our operational excellence initiatives, efficiencies in SAG and savings from the closure of our Philippsburg plant. These savings more than offset the $37 million negative impact of inflation, delivering a net benefit of $38 million in the quarter. Foreign currency exchange was a benefit of $11 million and other was a headwind of $26 million.","Turning to the balance sheet on slide 12, cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $837 million. Total debt and net debt increased from year-end, primarily reflecting the seasonal increase in accounts receivable.","Free cash flow is shown on slide 13. For the quarter, we used $637 million in free cash flow driven by an increase in working capital of $449 million, which is consistent with the seasonality of the business. Additionally, cash flow from operating activities was a use of $389 million in cash. Rationalization payments of $106 million primarily reflect outflows made relating to the closure of our plant in Philippsburg, Germany last year.","Turning to slide 14, the Americas reported segment operating income of $127 million, or 7% to sales. The Americas was impacted by higher raw material costs, lower price mix and a negative impact of lower volume. Price mix declined driven by reduced mix as a result of lower consumer OE and commercial sales volume.","Unit sales in the first quarter were 16.7 million tires, down 3% versus 2017. Our consumer replacement sell-in volume was down 3% while sell-out was robust. OE consumer volume continued to be impacted by lower OEM production in the U.S. and was down 4%. Our commercial OE volume was up 12% in the quarter, marking the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Commercial replacement industry demand continues to show strength in the U.S.","Following our robust fourth quarter commercial replacement volume was down 5%. We saw improvement as the quarter progressed and expect to see growth again in the coming quarters. Brazil's consumer OE volume was up 30%. We expect Brazil to continue to grow in volume and earnings throughout the year. The Americas underlying business remains sound. Our team is focused on transitioning its supply chain as we look ahead. We continue to expect volume growth despite transition headwinds in the second quarter and for the remainder of the year in the region.","Turning to slide 15, Europe, Middle East and Africa generated segment operating income of $78 million in the quarter, down $23 million compared to the prior year. The decrease in SOI was driven by higher raw material costs net of price mix improvements and lower consumer OE volume. These headwinds were partially offset by lower SAG and conversion costs driven by the closure of our manufacturing facility in Philippsburg and our continued focus on structural cost savings.","Unit sales were $14.7 million in the first quarter, down about 5% from prior year. The volume decline mainly relates to the consumer OE business with unit volume down 16% driven by decreases in less than 17-inch size fitments as we continue to reduce our exposure to the smaller rim sizes.","Replacement unit volume was down 2% mainly in our consumer business driven by lower industry demand. EMEA's 17-inch-and-larger rim size tires outperformed the market in all seasonal segments, winter, summer and all season showing the broad based strength of our product portfolio. With the difficult comparable from last year's robust growth, commercial truck replacement volume declined, which more than offset volume growth at OE. Our commercial volume is expected to improve beginning in the second quarter. Our fleet services model Goodyear Proactive Solutions enables our teams to take advantage of favorable industry trends.","EMEA generated solid performance in a weak sell-in environment in the first quarter of 2018. EMEA is expecting significant growth in the coming quarters driven by volume, mix improvement and continued focus on cost.","Turning to slide 16, Asia-Pacific delivered segment operating income of $76 million. This increase in SOI was driven by the benefits related to higher volume and improved price mix. These increases were partially offset by higher raw material costs. Asia-Pacific's volume was 7.6 million units in the first quarter, up 4.5% from prior year. The growth was attributable to our consumer OE business where unit volume increased 7% driven by robust growth in China. Our consumer replacement business was up 1% despite strong 8% growth in the prior year driven by pre-buy. With the solid performance of Asia-Pacific in the first quarter, we remain excited and confident about the region's future. Our success in winning new OE fitments and expanding our retail network is expected to drive double-digit volume growth over the remainder of the year.","Before, I review our outlook, I wanted to cover a few items related to our planned investment in TireHub. First, we thought it might be useful to share some color on how to think about the way the temporary reduction in volume will flow through the SOI walk in the coming quarters. The bulk of this headwind will show up in volume. The best way to think about this is to apply our normal $22 per tire sales margin to the 1.5 million units in volume. In terms of cadence, we expect the majority of the volume headwind to occur in the second quarter, as we reposition units across the supply chain.","Overhead absorption is the second part of the equation. A good rule of thumb is to work with a per unit metric of $12 to $15, half of this headwind will fall in 2019, due to the timing of the production cuts.","Goodyear will record its portion of the fair market value of the joint venture as an equity investment on its consolidated balance sheet. The company's share is expected to be valued at approximately $300 million. The carrying value of the underlying net assets is de-minimus. So we expect to record a sizable one-time non-cash gain in the second quarter as a result of this transaction. The easiest way to think about this impact is the tax effect or share of the (27:26) estimated fair market value of the joint venture.","In addition to the growth opportunities offered by TireHub, we are excited about the ancillary benefits of the transaction. Most notably, the new entity should improve our visibility into the market and allow for closer ties between manufacturing and the wholesale channel. This will improve our demand planning capabilities and reduce volatility in the business.","On slide 17, we have shown our updated full year 2018 SOI drivers inclusive of the projected impact of the TireHub transaction. We have lowered our volume outlook to 2% growth to reflect the impact of TireHub. For the second quarter, we see volume up above 4% driven by gains in consumer and commercial replacement volumes across all regions as well as increases in global OE commercial volume.","We continue to anticipate a positive impact on overhead absorption. However, we lowered our estimate to $55 million primarily to account for the impact of TireHub. We expect the second quarter to be about flat. We continue to expect year-over-year pricing headwinds in 2018, in light of the adjustments we made late last year. Our highest price mix last year occurred during the second and third quarters, and as a result, our strongest pricing comparables occur over the next two quarters. The strong momentum in 17-inch and greater rim sizes and an improving outlook for our consumer OE business gives us confidence in our expectations for mix in 2018.","However, we have lowered our outlook for net price mix versus raw materials to negative $25 million and the adjustment reflects the move in spot prices of petroleum sensitive inputs, particularly butadiene.","For the second quarter, we see a net headwind of $65 million, split almost evenly between raw materials and price mix. We continue to expect our cost saving actions to exceed inflation by about $130 million in 2018. We estimate foreign currency translation to be about $40 million positive impact, which is a $25 million improvement from our previous forecast.","The other line represents a combined headwind from increased advertising, R&D, depreciation and incentive compensation. The updated outlook for these items combined is about $65 million which is about $25 million better than our last forecast. However, we expect a $25 million headwind in the second quarter.","On slide 18, we have listed other financial assumptions for 2018 which remain unchanged. In total, we continue to target $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion in SOI in 2018 excluding approximately $40 million related to the TireHub transition. In the second quarter, we expect SOI to be down slightly given that the majority of the transition is expected to occur over the next few months. Excluding this impact, our expectation would be an improvement in SOI for the second quarter. We anticipate substantial improvements in SOI in the second-half as our volume run rates improve, unabsorbed overhead begins to be a benefit, raw material cost become a tailwind and our pricing headwinds subside.","Now, we'll open the line-up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Great. Thank you. We'll take our first question from Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Good morning, Rod.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everybody.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Good morning.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I had a couple of questions, one, just very high level, in North America we're seeing a pretty wide divergence between the volumes being reported by the RMA which were down versus the non-RMA members which were up, and similarly in Europe, the bigger European players were down and the non-ETRMA were up. Can you just very quickly give us the gist of what's happening there?","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah. Sure, Rod. I mean, I'd start by just saying, our performance in that market was something that we were pretty pleased with in terms of overall and in terms of our 17-inch and above. So even in that backdrop, we feel like we're on strategy. If you bifurcate the two, I think you're just seeing some of the continuation of the trends that we saw. I mean, you saw some of the rollback on some of the tariffs on Chinese tires in the U.S. So you see some of that volume coming back in. As you know that's a market that's sort of ebbed and flowed with tariffs, but when you cut through and we've done this in past quarters, sort of the quarter-over-quarter movements of restocking of low cost import tires, that market can distort those RMA or USTMA numbers. But in the long run, it's sort of that, that set of imports is in this market, it's been in this market, it's at the low end, and it's not a market that we play-in.","So it's sort of just the machinations of what's happening with tariffs coming in. And in Europe, same thing, I mean, what happened, as you remember, when tariffs came on, we saw first tires that came to the U.S. go to Latin America. When Latin America currencies change, got weaker, we saw those tires start coming into Eastern Europe where we were seeing low-end tires come into places like Poland for \u20ac22 a tire. That too is a trend that continues to take place. Those tires come in there. But, again, that's really not the market that we play-in and the market that we play-in is where the profitability is, is where ultimately we're going to create value and in those places, we did very well in the quarter.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah. It's really just that quarter-to-quarter volatility you see in those numbers. Yes, exactly. Yeah.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Well, thanks for that. And I wanted to dive into TireHub a little bit with you. How are you or how should we be thinking about the risks that are associated with some of these distribution actions that you're taking? And I guess, I would imagine that you'd agree that some of these large independent wholesalers have pretty good relationships, distribution technology. They've got access to other brands. So do you anticipate that some of the 5 million units that you're shifting ultimately gets cannibalized. Do you believe that you have the same relationships with independents that they do? Is Bridgestone basically doing the same thing, which would make TireHub indispensable? How are you sort of thinking about like the potential risks versus the upside?","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah. I mean, Rod, I would tell you, our view straightaway is that this is a positive and it puts us in a better position to not only recapture, if you will, the repositioning of volume, the disruption we're going to receive now, but it really puts us in a better position to grow going forward. And TireHub has the expertise in terms of the management of the entity itself as well as advocates of the Goodyear brand in there to go out and get that volume back as we move ahead. And I would say, hey, look there's risk in everything. There's risk in standing still. There's risk in not doing anything. Our view is we're playing this business for the long-term. What we want is an advocate of the Goodyear brand as part of our connected business model and as part of our strategy of allowing distribution.","That's not new at all. This is really \u2013 just think about this as a continuation or an evolution of that strategy going forward. And on balance, listen, I'm very positive and bullish and feel this is absolutely the right decision for us to go out and again not only recapture that volume but set us on a path to grow going forward in the near term. But as we've talked in the past, as we think about our business model going forward, consumers want tires, they want it now, they want it where they want them, they want them when they want them, and having an aligned distribution network is vital to that. And this really, really enables us to deliver on that going forward. And, Rod, on the...","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah...","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Go ahead. No, go ahead.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Just obviously there's other tire companies that are going to be looking to fill the void with those national distributors. So I mean do you think that that is something that represents a valid risk for Goodyear? Do you think that this maybe makes the pricing dynamics somewhat more challenging through this transition? Or do you anticipate that ultimately TireHub is so indispensable that all those accounts will shift over to you?","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah. I think, Rod, to put it in the context of the value of the Goodyear brand, right, number one share and the number one visited brand online and the number one demand brand when you're going to into a retail store. So those entities value the Goodyear brand going in there, and that again favors to what we're doing in TireHub. And I would say the dynamics of what you're talking about aren't something that's going to start being created with TireHub. Those dynamics exist already. This is actually a way to address those more proactively. So this is not something new.","And remember, when you go into a retail store, you've got a demand brand that brings consumers into the store. Number one share, number one brand awareness is the Goodyear brand. That's what retailers need. Obviously those consumers come in and dealers also look at call it a mid-tier or profit brand that they want to sell. That's part of the switching process that goes on and that's why we want to be closer to the customer, right? And this gets us closer to the dealer and the customer going forward.","And then the third brand is that opening price point brand and that goes back to your first question. Look, everyone has an opening price point brand because there's an opening price point customer. That's really not our market, but TireHub also will be able to service that going forward. So when you put all that together, what you're really saying is, what's the consumer going to do when they go into that store and having a main brand is what a dealer wants, and that's exactly what TireHub is going to deliver to them.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And just lastly, just wanted to clarify the price\/mix assumptions here, you did negative $16 million in the quarter and I presume that that included some positive mix, but more negative price, and that's the net. If I'm looking at your numbers correctly in your guidance, are you assuming basically that we have price kind of flattening out in the back half of the year, the positive is that you're anticipating in price\/mix is essentially all mix?","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah, you know Rod, I would tell you as we look at the price\/mix in Q1, mix was the bigger impact driving that and that essentially was driven by two things; one, when you look at the Americas, we saw a little bit a calculation of that mix, as you know, has a lot of moving parts. It's got product, it has country, it has consumer mix in it, and despite having really strong 17-inch and above growth that mix calculation was a little bit offset by two things; one, it was weaker OE, and remember our OE business index is about 80% to 17-inch and above; and as OE was weaker than consumer replacement in the Americas that drove a little bit negative business mix, if you like. And we had a real strong Q4 in commercial tires. That was a little bit less volume coming in in Q1 of 2018. So you had a little of that business mix in there as well. So that's really what drove mix. And then in Europe you had a tougher comp, Q1 2017, we sold in a lot of winter tires. We sold in a little bit less as that focus was more on sell out this year. So that's what really had impacted our mix in the quarter. From a pricing standpoint, what we actually saw was certainly pricing stability in the U.S. and that's a real positive for us...","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","It is.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","...going forward. We saw some incremental headwinds on pricing in summer in Europe. But particularly in small rim that's a really competitive market. So overall, we felt pretty good about pricing. And then as you look out to Q2, Q3, remember those were particularly Q2, when we had some of our highest prices last year in view of that...","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","...that 20%, nearly a $1 billion of high raw material cost that we saw that we put our price\/mix or price out in the marketplace to go address.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","So overall think about price in the market's been relatively stable and mix was a little bit of headwind, but we think that that mix is going to improve in the second half, particularly on 17-inch and above sell-out that we're seeing is really strong. We mentioned those numbers on the call, 20% retail growth and outperformed the industry in Europe and North America. And, Rod, remember we got pretty easy comps if you look at Q2...","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Q3.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Excuse me, in Q3 of last year. So that's kind of how we're looking at it.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah. And just to be clear, Rich, because \u2013 exactly, but the first thing that Rod said, just the price\/mix negative in the first quarter of about $16 million is driven by mix...","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Right.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","...as negative for the reasons you said, just to reiterate.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah, yeah. No, exactly.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Thanks, Rod.","Operator","Thank you. Next we'll move to Ashik Kurian with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Good morning, Ashik. How are you?","Ashik Kurian - Jefferies International Ltd.","I'm good. So, I mean I just wanted to follow-up from the question that Rod asked. Just in terms of the recent change in distribution, is this something that you expect other players in the industry to follow because I think what surprised us, intriguing a lot of people is, the likes of Michelin and Bridgestone seemingly are quite keen to go ahead with the big national distributors. So the concern is, of course, as to what are the risks to your volumes, and over the last couple of days we've had one announcement. But I mean what's generally been the response from both the retailers and wholesalers? And also do you expect more of the big players to follow suit?","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","So, Ashik, we obviously won't speak to what our competitors are doing. I would just have you look to the announcements that they've made, the one \u2013 that's the obvious one is TireHub is actually a joint venture with Bridgestone Americas. So that's a pretty apparent one as I say that. And secondly, one of our other competitors in the market announced their own distribution retail joint venture or entity a couple months back or whatever it was. So that's something for you to ask them more than you ask us. But I'd point to those two things for you.","And in terms of response, I think the key to response from our dealers, I mean this is obviously new news and we're communicating with them, and I suspect you've read those, but the essence of this is really getting closer to the consumer and helping those dealers service those consumers as part of an aligned distribution network that we've been talking about fairly consistently in our connected business model. And the key to that is creating the dynamics and the pull to bring consumers into tire dealer stores not only the traditional way through walking in the front door, but also through e-commerce and digital and other ways that consumers ultimately are going to shop and experience the installation of tires. That's what's ultimately driving how we're going to interact with the consumer out there. And I would say the dealers certainly understand that and the Goodyear brand is what is the key to making this work.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Right. Exactly. And just to add, Rich, as you said it, right, day-one the Bridgestone-Goodyear joint venture is the contribution of both of our legacy locations and the business that goes with that, okay? And we do, subject to regulatory approvals, expect that to close or be complete in June likely.","Ashik Kurian - Jefferies International Ltd.","Can I just ask a follow up on the interesting charts you've shown in slide 7 and slide 8 regarding the sales through different channels? Now, it's very clear that your sales through the wholesale channel has been weaker, but how should we think about this being a pure reflection of what the consumer demand is because again \u2013 or how much has the wholesale channel in the end ended up impacting the retail demand, do you think your eventual goal would be with this switchover being able to control your wholesale channel that you effectively see a change in the end market or retail demand. So how should we think about this having an impact on the retail demand?","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Ashik, it's a good question, and really it's the essence of the chart that we're showing. Remember that green line, we name the customer-facing channel. And just to refresh your memory, everyone's memory is customer-facing is think about that is our company-owned stores, the big retailers we sell to in the big box, or those that are actually close to the consumer. And that's where we have a direct feel on working with them and certainly influencing them at the counter and how they shop.","And remember, last year when we had our volume decrease, that primarily came in the wholesale channel. Our consumer-facing channels were actually pretty good. They actually were at market and in some cases above. So when you see that divergence of the blue and the green, I think you rightly point out that in that wholesale channel, it's evidence of not being as close to the consumer and it's evidence of the switching that goes on as you look at how the tire ultimately gets to the consumer. So if you think about TireHub and you think about our strategy of aligned distribution and aligned retail, it's about getting closer to the customer, which is about moving closer, moving the blue line, if you will, up closer to the green line. Does that make sense?","Ashik Kurian - Jefferies International Ltd.","Yes. And just an accounting question. When will the revenues be recognized when you sell a tire to TireHub? Does it get recognized when you sell it to TireHub or when TireHub sells it to the retailer?","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah. When Goodyear parent company sells the tire to TireHub that's when we recognize the revenue, right. And then at the end of the day, 50% of the net income of the joint venture then is recorded in the Americas segment.","Ashik Kurian - Jefferies International Ltd.","Understood. Perfect. Thank you.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Thank you, Ashik.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Anthony Deem with Longbow Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Hi, Anthony.","Anthony Deem - Longbow Research LLC","Hi. Good morning, Rich, Laura, Christina.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Good morning.","Anthony Deem - Longbow Research LLC","So I just wanted to ask a couple of questions here. On TireHub, it's my understanding, incentives and programs aren't changing with your customers. And I'm wondering, do you view this shift to more captive distribution as helping your cause just longer term when it comes to pricing leverage in the channel or really just asked another way longer term, is this a material price\/mix dynamic as you gain greater control over the inventory and maybe as the shift to more of the company-owned distribution continues.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah. I mean, listen the whole essence of this is driving growth and as our strategy roadmap says, driving sustainable revenue and profit growth, and that's exactly what this does. And as we get closer to the consumer, our ability to drive volume and our ability to drive a positive price\/mix is exactly...","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","...the essence of what we're trying to do as we think about the business going forward. So no doubt that that's one of the things that is inherent in moving toward TireHub.","Anthony Deem - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And if I may ask, how much volume do you currently sell through ATD's network and did that the 1.5 million unit volume impact from the transition include the discontinuation of that national wholesaler?","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yes. Yes, it does.","Anthony Deem - Longbow Research LLC","All right.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","So if you think about us, maybe think about the 1.5 million units coming in two parts, right, the timing gap between when we start this repositioning, we said we're repositioning 10 million tires, right. That includes our wholesalers, right, as we go. And then there is carrying the inventory drawdown, I guess I'd describe, as manufacturers can carry less inventory than a wholesaler would because of our connections back to the factory. So that is considered in the 1.5 million units. It is primarily an impact in terms of sales margin on the second quarter as we move through that transition.","Anthony Deem - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Then just a last question for me. Second quarter price\/mix versus raw material outlook, a negative $65 million, it was mentioned partially related to a difficult price compare. And you're expecting around a $100 million headwind on price\/mix in the second quarter when I'm backing into. Third quarter is a difficult comp, too, as you mentioned, Laura, but fourth quarter is actually pretty tough, too. So I'm just wondering cadence wise is the price\/mix growth in the second half it's mostly fourth quarter weighted based on your current guidance? And thanks for taking my questions.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Sure. So maybe to think about the price\/mix, right, and as you said price\/mix versus raw is guide of a negative $65 million or so in the second quarter. That is a lot \u2013 about half driven by raw materials, right. We still have a decent size headwind in the second quarter which then becomes more of a tailwind as we move for raws into the second half of the year.","Now the mix really is a move from the second to the third quarter and it's pretty even over the two quarters as we go. And again, think about the comps year-over-year and what was going on in the environment last year, okay. So fourth quarter isn't I guess I'd say to answer your question a big hockey stick, okay.","Anthony Deem - Longbow Research LLC","Yeah. Thank you.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And next we'll take our question from Armintas Sinkevicius. Please go ahead. Your line is open and Armintas is with Morgan Stanley.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Good morning.","Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thank you for...","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Morning.","Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","...taking the question. When we think about the tires, the reason we're quite constructive on the industry is we're quite bullish on miles driven and the growth that's coming from there. And ultimately, we just think there's going to be stronger demand for tires. But when we look at the results herein and so that's the long-term thesis, but as we look at the short-term and what's going on today, there's been some challenges. And I think it's more than just sort of Goodyear specific, things like the industry has been a bit soft, and as you pointed out, you've outperformed the industry. But can you talk about sort of bridging between the short-term challenges that we're seeing on the tires, what's going on there and how we end up bridging to sort of the long-term view.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah. So, I'll start out. Laura can certainly jump in here. But I think if we go back, we've got to look back into 2017 a bit. And one of the things that we saw was a weaker-than-expected OE, and I always go back to that third quarter where we saw one of our major U.S. customers cut production, U.S. production by about 25%. And the SAAR was good but production was way down. And remember that put a lot of OE tires back into the replacement market. So there's some of that cyclicality that we had to work our way through.","Now having said that, we look at VMT, the trends are still good. I think it was down a bit in February, but the trends are still good. If we look at the consumers' balance sheet, as we look at wages, we look at all that, what we still see is a very robust environment going forward. And I would tell you the sign that makes a lot of sense to us, even though we saw again a weaker industry in Q1, what we did see was very strong sell out in our channels for sure, in our business, and we saw some destocking going on both in some big boxes and by some wholesalers. Maybe that was rumors of TireHub and people taking decisions, I don't know, but a strong sell out and a weak sell in means that restocking has to take place.","So I can't give you the particular time of it, but again there's nothing fundamentally that we would see in the industry that would say that that trend won't ultimately bring that volume back into the market. In fact we should be ready for it in the U.S. And that's I think what I would tell you. Maybe if I'd add one more thing that weak OE, remember that also at the same time we had the height of our raw material cost coming in as well. So that sort of I think had an impact on the business that maybe tells you that there is a little bit more difficulty in the industry at the moment. But well look, that will work its way through.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah. And if you look at the VMT really for I think January and February is out now and look at it by region, certainly I hate to keep saying it, but weather was an impact, especially in the Midwest, where that really drove the VMT being so kind of lethargic in the first quarter. So exactly, and that sell out that Rich talked about and we saw in the first quarter of the product is great. That means better sell in as we go, and even today through April that still feels really good on the sell-out front.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah. Volumes are good in April. We have solid volumes in April. So that's a positive sign, obviously.","Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And just one other one. Share buyback seemed a bit light this quarter, particularly when we think about where the stock price has been in the recent months since the last quarter. Just can you talk to us about how you're thinking about share buybacks and how we can think about that going forward?","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Sure. So definitely in the second quarter you'll see an increase from what we did in the first quarter. Kind of consistent with what we've done in the last couple of years, our cash flow is very back-half loaded, and we historically purchased more of our shares in the back-half. But again, we always are opportunistic. As I said, I expect the second quarter to be higher than the first quarter. We still have almost $800 million remaining on our authorization at this point. So again, we're very committed to our direct returns to shareholders both through the dividend and the share repurchases.","Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you for taking the questions.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next we'll move to Itay Michaeli with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Hi, Itay.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Hi, Itay.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you. Good morning. Maybe just to continue on that thought. Laura, on free cash flow for the full year, can you give us any updated thoughts? I think in the last quarter when we spoke, you thought maybe you could maybe double I think this year versus the last year. I know Q1 was still a bit worse year-over-year by about $80 million. Any puts and takes, updates to the thinking on free cash flow?","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah. Our thoughts are really no different than they were before. Like you said, the first quarter really has some timing issues in it. Higher rationalization payments, that's really related to the Philippsburg, Germany closure last year and the timing of when those cash payments are hit. And then second another timing issue on interest payments versus expense. But again, that's all included in how we see it. All the other drivers are listed in the presentation that we gave. So no real change to how we feel about free cash flow in 2018.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Sure. And then on the SOI guidance, I think if I heard correctly, Laura, you mentioned about $40 million impact from TireHubs. So is it fair to say that maybe you were tracking or are tracking towards a lower end of that $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion? So maybe just walk through the puts and takes of what can go right, what can go wrong in terms of the guidance, particularly now in the second half of the year?","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Okay. So, again, we see about $40 million from TireHub. We had the range of a $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. I think as we look at all the drivers we've taken into consideration, the 1.5 million units as we think about our volume outlook for the year, and again, we're working to hope that doesn't all happen, but that is already taken into consideration in the volume guide.","And then again, as Rich talked about, there's just \u2013 if you think back to what occurred last year in the volume as we work through price and mix and especially the second and third quarters, there's fairly easy comps, right, both on the volume side and on the unabsorbed overhead side that again, as Rich said, we've stabilized. We understand where the price\/mix is in the market. The U.S. is very stable in that environment. You saw us in the first quarter, especially in greater than 17-inch grow volumes. We feel good about that in Europe as well. So those feel very tight for us, right, as we go into the second half of the year.","Cost savings versus inflation running well, $38 million in the first quarter. So we feel confident in that, some benefit from FX. And then just things like in other, right. We've been able to continue to want to see our other tire businesses, less SLP (59:42) start-up costs as we get to the second half of the year. So I feel confident in the outlook that we provided and reasons to believe in all the moving parts as we go.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah. And, Itay, I'd add one thing to Laura's comment. I mean I think we demonstrated last year our commitment, as we have over time, our commitment to offsetting raw materials with price and mix. That is what we're committed to and then like I said, I think we've been consistent in that. But as we look at this, we look at the choppy demands that we've seen in Europe and the U.S. over the last four to five quarters, and we look at the heightened volatility that we've seen in the commodity markets over the past say 15 months. As we look at this, we've taken a conservative view that we're not going to have the opportunity to immediately recover a significant portion of those added cost pressures in pricing, and I think that's the conservative thing to do, that's how we talked to you last quarter, that's how we're thinking about it this quarter with respect to an incremental $50 million in raw material headwinds.","Now I'm going to tell you that that's how we're thinking about this. I can also tell you and again I apologize if I'm a broken record, but this team fundamentally believes that we can and will offset the impacts of raw material with price mix over time, that's our track record, and I'll state that that's the commitment that we have to it now as we look ahead.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","That's very helpful. If I could sneak in one last, maybe as long-term strategic question, Rich, I know you talked about you're preparing for a future of autonomous vehicles and fleets, but if we think about a market where, let's say, you do have a number of large robo-taxi, AV fleets in major cities, is that not at some level potentially take away from the aftermarkets, let's say, if cars on the road in that city go down and move it more to an OEM channel as a fleet purchase and would that not potentially be a mix headwind in the context of autonomous vehicles?","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","So I think the one thing, Itay, that we'd all agree. And I think, the question is absolutely the right one. I think, the one thing we agree on that it's a bit of a TBD in terms of how it develops. This is all playing its way out going forward and it's why we're taking these and you'll see other strategic moves that allow us to be able to take advantage of that market as we go forward as it evolves. Now, as we look at it, I made the comment on my script, we're going to see a shift, it's undeniable, of personal car ownership decreasing in favor of shared mobility. And you can look at even things like number of licenses being issued for 16-year to 18-year olds over the past 20 years, and you'll see a \u2013 you probably know, you'll see a significant decrease.","So the trend is coming, the question is how we play for it, and I think it's evolving, I mean, robo-taxies is probably the entry point to it, to get you to point A to point B, and that market is going to be a bit like the taxi cab market that we have today, that's probably not going to be the value generating market for all of us, it could be really interesting \u2013 I think, it will an interesting learning bed for us to understand how that works.","But the model of servicing fleets and mobility down the road is something that we're spending a lot of time thinking about and with some of those companies doing that on really not just figuring out how to participate, but also helping them shape it as we go forward. That's how we're thinking about it. And I personally think, it will be a very profitable market going forward. But it's going to be very different.","And again, as you know, that's not tomorrow, that's a way down the road, but it's things that we need to start preparing for right now. And you know, if I can shift back to TireHub, that's really part of thinking how we can get the tires to where they need to be, when they need to be given the size and type proliferation for what's going to be an evolving consumer that we have today, who like all of us, want things, when they want them, where they want them, not necessarily the way they bought them 30 years ago. And it's going to be thinking about how we service the fleet down the road, and being able to make sure we got the infrastructure to support them.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. That's all very, very helpful. Thanks so much.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Emmanuel Rosner with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Good morning, Emmanuel. How are you?","Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Good, thanks. So first question on TireHub again. So I understand from your point of view the benefits you expect from this transaction and structure. I'm just curious about the timing, I guess why now, what has changed, it seems like some of those headwinds on the wholesale channel have been going on for years as you show in your slide. So I guess why now?","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah. I think, Emmanuel, it's a fair question, but as you can imagine, we've been working on this transaction with Bridgestone for over a year. It's not a transaction that just happened very shortly, we have to reposition, as Laura said, about 10 million units and that's a lot, right? That creates a lot of complexity as we move ahead. And to your point, as we think about relationships, relationships change over time. I mean, we had our aligned distribution network that worked very well for many years and over time that relationship changes and those charts that we referred to on page seven and eight give you an indication, right?","I mean, I talk a lot about aligned retail and aligned distribution and that means that opportunistic wholesale, buy low, sell high, and then influencing what goes into the marketplace based on purchase price and putting that out on the shelves is not a situation where ultimately it's aligned with what we want to do. Alignment meant we both win together and that's something that's really important to us as we move ahead. So, relationships change, priorities change and that's why we're doing this. But certainly, it wasn't a move that is something that just happens overnight.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah. Exactly.","Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. And that's good color. And then sir, one question on volume, please. Your first quarter volume clearly played out weaker than you had expected and you explained why. But I noticed you maintained the volume growth assumption for the full year, excluding the impact from TireHub.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah.","Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities LLC","So what gives you sort of confidence, the volume will be so strong on an underlying basis over the next nine months?","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah. I think a couple things in there. If I go back and maybe give a bit of context, we talked about what happened in Q1, but contextually, I would say and I said this before the Q1 sell-in isn't really reflective. We don't believe it's reflective of the underlying demand in the marketplace. Again we saw that significant sell-out happening and some destocking going on, which points toward more volume coming back in the later part of the year.","And then, secondly, we haven't talked about it much, but we had a bit of an odd dynamic in Europe, right. We had sort of two things moving in different directions. One is winter went on forever and people delayed putting summer tires on and dealer sold more winter tires. The positive of that is winter stocks went down and that should mean for a more robust sell-in, as we look in the back half of the year. Having said that, summer inventories are high right now and I think you're starting to see that changing over summer to winter in Europe and hopefully that's going to make its way through.","But if we look at it think about what gives us confidence, the destocking, the weaker comps that we have in Q2 and Q3 in particularly of last year, we see that strong sell-out going on and we have that good mix in there, and we also see improved OE volumes in Europe. I mean, most of our volume miss year-over-year in Europe this year was in the OE channel and that's going to improve as we move ahead. Remember, part of that was getting out of the Philippsburg in the smaller rim diameter tire. So, you'll see that improve over time.","So that gets us to what we guided toward a 2% growth and, you know, actually (68:00) 2% growth off the what \u2013 159 million.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","159 million. Yeah.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah, I'm sorry, excuse me, Emmanuel. What we \u2013 2% growth on the 159 million units we sold last year is very doable for us.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah.","Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. And then very finally housekeeping question. So below the line, below the SOI line, there were bunch of expenses that were quite a bit lower than your full-year guidance would suggest (68:26) that included like corporate other, I think, it was just $17 million; interest expense, which was less than a quarter of what you're guiding for the full-year; other expense, which was also much less. Like were there any sort of like timing benefits in the quarter? Anything that sort of like would reverse in the next few quarters?","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah, so no doubt, the first quarter, the \u2013 really I would answer your question with how you did right, it is timing. The one is on the lower \u2013 in the first quarter it's lower incentive comp, which reflects the accruals for those long-term plans, right, like our three year plans and so on.","Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Understood. Thank you.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Great. Thank you, Emmanuel. I apologies for that by the way.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our final question from David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Good morning, David.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Good morning, Dave.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. I think, you guys outlined last week, you're expecting $80 million to $100 million in benefits from the TireHub transaction, can you just kind of walk me through, does that mean for the 10 million tires or you're just expecting another $8 to $10 per tire or are there some other benefits that are being rolled up into that total?","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah. I think, David, broadly speaking we're talking about breaking into a few pieces, and Laura can jump in, but we're talking about really versus 2018, getting back to the 1.5 million units that we're adjusting for which we're going to work to minimize, but getting that back. And then on top of that what you're looking at to get to that $80 million to $100 million is incremental synergies that we have and some whitespace or some growth in there \u2013 organic growth that you're going to see in that market as well. So that's really versus 2018.","Again I would tell you that that's very doable. But what it doesn't bake in is the future beyond that; hey, what are the growth opportunities that we're building in here, what are the mix opportunities that we're building in. That's still upside for us. What we're saying as we look out over the course of 2019 and 2020 is what's the impact of getting this thing up and running, and that's going to be getting the volume, getting the synergies and a little bit of growth. But the upside is really on business model structure and how we're positioned to grow for the future.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. But there's an incremental margin that you should be capturing that's not going through the wholesale channel anymore, I'm trying to figure out how much that it is, $5 or higher?","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah. Part of that's the cost synergies and again part of that's going to be in better mix \u2013 better price mix as we move ahead.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah. That's what gets you from the $40 million up to the $80 million to $100 million. The $40 million being the 1.5 million (1:10:59) recap and then, up to the $80 million to $100 million.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. I'll follow up with Christina on that, and then post the shift to TireHub, what percentage of the company's distribution is going to be \"aligned\"? And what percentage are you targeting longer-term? Like, are you \u2013 after you transition all this volume, are you exactly where you want to be or is there more to go?","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah. I would say, look, as we look at this, we talked about an aligned distribution network and as we said we always wanted a national distribution network supported by aligned regional networks and that's essentially what we have right now. The volume we have is going to be repositioned to TireHub and the volume is going to go to our aligned regional distributors, and I think that's a model that works well for us. If you look at our overall business, and put TireHub in, the customer facing channels directly will now represent about call it 75% of our business and the remaining aligned regional wholesalers will represent round about 25% of the business going forward.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. So to that point, it sounds as if you're probably 100% of where you want to be, is that...","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah. David, I mean, our aligned regional distributors are integral. They always have been, they always will be to our strategy. They can serve.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","As you look at a map, and obviously we're not going to get into that. But, as you look at a map, they cover certain area \u2013 they have covered certain areas. They have done so strategically and in many cases they can do that better than anyone else because of their customer relationships and because of their alignment with the Goodyear model.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","So yeah, I'd say we feel we're in a pretty good position or we will be as we move ahead.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you very much for the time.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Thanks, David.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Okay. I think that wraps us up. And again, just want to reconfirm or just to say again, we're very positive on moving forward with TireHub for many of the reasons that I went through. And again we continue to target our $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion segment operating income for 2018. Again excluding the impact of the $40 million from TireHub, our expectation would be that we're going to see improvements in SOI for the second quarter. We anticipate that the substantial improvements that we're going to see in SOI in the second half as our volume run rates improve, as our unabsorbed overhead begins to benefit that, and as raw material costs become a tailwind rather than the headwind they've been, and certainly pricing headwinds subside. So we remain committed to that $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion excluding the impact of TireHub.","So thank you everyone for joining us today, as usual we appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect, and have a great day."],"9912":["Goodyear Tire & Rubber (NASDAQ:GT) Q3 2012 Earnings Call October 26, 2012  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Gregory A.

My name is Christy and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company Third Quarter Earning Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the program over to Greg Fritz, Goodyear's Vice President of Investor Relations.","Gregory A. Fritz","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Goodyear's third quarter conference call. Joining me today are Rich Kramer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Darren Wells, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, there are a few items I would like to cover. To begin, the webcast of this morning's discussion and supporting slide presentation can be found on our website at investor.goodyear.com. Additionally, a replay of this call will be available later today. Replay instructions were included in our earnings release issued earlier this morning.","If I can now direct your attention to the Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Our discussion this morning may contain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties, which can cause our actual results to differ materially, are outlined in Goodyear's filings with the SEC and in our earnings release. The company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","Turning now to the agenda. On today's call, Rich will provide a business overview, including perspective on our third quarter results and our progress towards Goodyear's key strategic objectives, as well as our view of the industry environment. After Rich's remarks, Darren will discuss the financial results and outlook before opening the call to your questions.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Rich.","Richard J. Kramer","Great, thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. During the third quarter, we continued to make significant progress in line with our strategic plan, highlighted by our outstanding results in our North American Tire business. That said, we also continue to experience the underlying uncertainty in the global economy, most evident in Europe, which remained a very difficult environment and where our business results were significantly lower versus the prior year. Today, I'll elaborate on the drivers of our third quarter results, put those results in the context of our strategy roadmap and finally, share with you an outlook of both our near-term targets and a view of the tire industry.","Now as I've often said, we're not running our business for 1 good quarter or 1 good year, but to create sustainable profitability, with consistent earnings and cash generation throughout the volatile demand cycle that characterizes the tire industry. I'm pleased with the choices we have made to better withstand this demand volatility, while delivering solid segment operating income compared to our past results during periods of similar industry volume levels.","Now looking at the positives in the quarter. Our success in North America is at the top of the list. The North America team delivered another outstanding quarter. The $130 million of segment operating income in Q3 brings North America's year-to-date earnings to nearly $400 million. On our second quarter call, we discussed the combination of operational improvements, product wins and many tough business choices that have led us to these consistent results in NAT. This progress enables us to achieve and exceed our 2013 goal of $450 million of segment operating income, a year early. Now these results are being earned at much lower volume levels and significantly less improvement in pension expense than we originally expected. This is a real win for the team. Most importantly, however, is that we continue to support our customers' profitable growth with products and services that help distinguish them in the marketplace.","Now during the third quarter, we continue to see the destocking we highlighted in the second quarter, with sell-in to the channels down more than sell-outs to consumers. The North American replacement industry remains at historic low levels. Our view continues to be that it is not a question of if, but when, industry volumes return to more normal levels. Now with channel inventories remaining low and U.S. miles driven being up in 7 of the past 9 reported months, we continue to see significant upside in our business as volume returns. Now as a side note, there's been a lot written recently about the expiration of the tariffs in the United States on Chinese-made consumer tires. While the tariff expiration seems to have created some erratic order patterns in September, the impact on our North America business was limited, as we've largely exited the segment served by these imports. Now driven by North America's performance, our overall level of segment operating income is in line with our expectations. We delivered nearly $350 million of segment operating income despite highly recessionary volumes. This reflects the structural changes and fixed cost reductions that we've implemented. Our price\/mix execution remains strong, and has helped us run our business profitably even amidst the volatile economy. Our focus on price\/mix relative to the value of our products and services, as well as raw material costs, remains a point of emphasis for our teams, as we believe that raw material costs will continue to increase over the long term. While certainly facing challenges in Europe and parts of Latin America, we are pleased that we've been able to deliver consistent segment operating income. Our success in price\/mix is reflected in our global revenue per tire, which increased 5% from the same quarter a year ago. In line with our focus on innovation, we continue to mix up to a richer portfolio of innovative products that are winning with consumers.","Now in China, Goodyear's newly launched Efficient Grip SUV tire was named the 2012 SUV tire of the year, marking the third consecutive year that Goodyear China has won a prestigious \"Tire of the Year\" Award from Motor Trend magazine. In addition, our strong lineup of winter tires continues to be well reviewed in The European Magazine tire test. Five products were test winners, while the entire range of offerings earned high recommendations. And in North America, the Eagle F1 Asymmetric All Season is getting spectacular reviews for its performance, especially in the wet fall weather, heading into winter. Now another positive in the quarter was our execution against our cost-reduction targets, as we're on track to exceed our 3-year, $1 billion cost savings plan. We implemented workforce reductions in all regions and took action to substitute alternate materials and reduce tire weight. As you would expect, we will remain focused on our cost efficiency in 2013 and beyond. Now in addition, the highlight of our quarter was our Asia Pacific business, which continue to grow earnings despite recessionary conditions in Australia and New Zealand. This was driven by success in growing our business in China. Now as you recall, one of our key strategies is winning in this critical market.","Our business in China had 3 key milestones in the quarter.  First, the formal opening of our new factory in Pulandian, our most modern factory and one that almost doubled our capacity in China. Second, the early closure of our original factory in nearby Dalian, completing the relocation of our production to the new Pulandian site. And third, just last week, the launch of our first locally produced commercial truck tire product in China, also produced at our new facility in Pulandian. Our business in Asia will benefit over the next several years, as the Pulandian facility ramps up to full capacity and our team there continues to develop our China sales and distribution capability to help us win in targeted profitable market segments.","Relative to our OTR business, our 63-inch tire production is in full force at our Topeka plant, and we recently began the expansion of our OTR facility in Japan. Both of these are high-return projects that allow us to take advantage of the strong global demand for such products.","And finally, another positive for the third quarter was cash generation. In the quarter, our free cash flow from operations was more than $100 million, a real accomplishment in a quarter that sees a seasonal use of cash for working capital growth. And over the past 12 months, we've generated more than $1 billion of free cash flow from operations.","Now while I've enumerated positives in the quarter aligned with our strategy, a challenge was in volume, particularly in our European business. The year-over-year volume decline in EMEA was more than 4 million units, representing most of the volume decline we experienced globally. Certainly, the situation was a result of higher channel inventory due to the lingering impact of last year's green winter and reduced demand because of Europe's weak and uncertain economy. And to be clear, all regions, including Europe, reflected strategic choices to focus on targeted profitable market segments versus a simple volume orientation. This is reflective of our disciplined choice-making, but there were instances in Europe when we were not as flexible as we needed to be to address more aggressive actions by our competitors, and provide higher levels of service to our customers. Now to address this, we've taken steps to enhance our capabilities around people, process and systems and are seeing favorable outcomes. I'm confident in our ability to make significant progress here, just as we have in North America, where our supply chain is a clear competitive advantage.","Now overall, the European tire industry is weak and we do not anticipate significant improvement in the near term. In that environment, we have focused on cost and cash, and have reduced headcount, SAG and other expenses consistent with the environment that we're seeing. For the quarter, our segment operating income in EMEA was below the prior year for the reasons I mentioned, but also recall that last year's third quarter volumes were at record levels, as dealers restocked, coming out of the prior year's white winter, anticipating another strong season. Our business in Europe continues to have industry-leading winter products and is preparing to launch new products as the impact of tire labeling begins in earnest in early 2013. While we expect that strong label scores will certainly differentiate our products in the marketplace, we will continue to highlight many other performance attributes beyond those on the label. There will be no compromise in the market-back innovation that increases the value of our brands and our products for consumers. I'm confident in the steps that we've taken as we head into a prolonged slow-growth environment with uncertainty around the Eurozone remaining a relevant factor. While being mindful of the impacts of economic volatility pervasive in today's global economy, I look at our third quarter in the context of our strategy roadmap. The actions we choose to take in response to such uncertainty are largely within our control and are guided by our strategy roadmap. We believe that by any measure, we are successfully executing our plan. We are leading in market-back innovation. We are winning in many of our targeted segments and improving our product mix to increase our profitability in attractive markets. We have been aggressive on cost reduction and have improved our cash flow picture considerably. While we acknowledge work to be done in EMEA and Latin America, North America has not only returned to profitability, but is on track to exceed the targets established in March of 2011, 1 year early. And we're growing our business in China and increasing segment operating income in the region.","As you recall, one of the components of our destination is keeping Goodyear profitable through the economic cycle. Of course, given the challenges of the global economy, we remain in a slow-growth portion of that cycle. In our view, this is where commitment to our strategy has its greatest benefit. Through continued execution of our key how-tos, including market-back innovation excellence, targeting profitable market segments and enabling investments, we have not only delivered solid results, but have made structural changes that position us to deliver sustainable value, regardless of external conditions. Our strategy is also helping drive more consistent earnings despite the tough environment. For the first 9 months of the year, our segment operating income as a percent of sales is more than 6%. This is despite volumes at essentially 2009 levels. In 2009, our segment operating margin was a full 5 percentage points lower at these volumes. This demonstrates the consistent focus we have maintained on structural improvements to our business and our processes. These improvements are helping us in 2012 and setting us up for success in 2013 and beyond.","Now there's a common theme to many of the positives we see for the quarter in North America results, in Asia results, in cost savings and in cash flow performance. That thread is our focus on another of the key how-tos, operational excellence, the improvement in our planning, supply chain, production and procurement processes that help deliver better results and better service to our customers. Now where these programs are working best, we see the best results. And where we see challenges, we are intensifying our efforts to further leverage these programs. Progress means operational excellence programs, as well as other elements of our strategy roadmap, is critical to our current progress and to our long-term success. The challenges of the current economic environment make it more important than ever that we stick to our strategy. It's the plan that we believe will enable us to deliver results, and help us define the capabilities needed to reach our destination.","Now regarding the tire industry, I'd like to offer a few points for perspective. First is to reinforce that the 7 MegaTrends we introduced more than a year ago remain very relevant. Even in this environment, we continue to see the trends of emerging market growth, high-value tires in the mid-tier, green trends and labeling, to name just a few. The technological advances of the tire industry remain strong and play to our strength. Second, industry volumes clearly have slowed versus the projections of many experts. We are responding to this near-term slowdown, but remain steadfast in our belief that the long-term growth projections remain intact. That's what keeps us excited about our business. While we are delivering strong results in today's low-volume environment, volume growth means higher capacity utilization and earnings power. That's what we are prepared to deliver, but for now, we remain focused on our near-term performance.","As you saw in our press release, we continue to target $1.6 billion of segment operating income, along with positive cash flow in 2013. Clearly, with volumes as low as they are, this requires a different approach than we originally envisioned when these goals were established at the beginning of 2011. For example, our plan will rely more heavily on North America and less on international operations than we previously thought. In addition, we will have to rely less on volume and more on the value proposition of our products and on improved cost efficiency. Darren will review our volume forecast with you shortly. You will see that we are forecasting volume growth as part of a slow-moving economy. We will continue to closely monitor the economic climate, region by region, and we will revisit our view if conditions change. We've also taken significant restructuring actions this year, both in our manufacturing operations and on our salary workforce, to bring our cost back in line with today's market environment. We continue to focus on additional actions, particularly in Europe and Latin America, to further improve results. To drive cash flow, we have managed our inventory position, while also managing other elements of working capital. We have also taken a hard look at capital expenditures, reducing this year's spending to less than $1.1 billion and scrutinizing forward spending plans. Be assured, we remain very focused on making the right adjustments to deal with tougher market conditions as we continue to move toward our destination as a company.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Darren.","Darren R. Wells","Good morning. Thanks, Rich. As Rich said, our results for the quarter reflected strategies we've been pursuing, focusing on driving earnings and cash flow over volume or share. We continue to generate consistent earnings in a challenging market, and continue to build our business to deliver in 2013 and beyond. While segment operating income is down, this is a reflection of a decline in EMEA earnings, after a 2011 third quarter that was a record by over $80 million. This year, EMEA earnings were down, but still well above 2010 levels, despite the dramatic drop in winter tire volume. Outside EMEA, overall results were stable and very strong in North America. We delivered these results, while reducing production and lowering our inventories, bringing working capital back in line. While this results in higher, unabsorbed overhead near-term, it positions us to better manage cash flow and to benefit from reduced unabsorbed overhead, as volumes recover in 2013 and beyond. Overall, we feel well-positioned, both to manage weaker markets now and to grow earnings and cash flow going forward.","Turning to the income statement on Slide 7. Our third quarter revenue decreased 13% from last year's record level, to $5.3 billion. The decline was primarily related to a 12% reduction in unit volume and a 4% reduction due to currency translation. Replacement unit volumes decreased 16% during the quarter, while OE volumes declined 1%. EMEA volumes accounted for approximately 3\/4 of the overall unit decline. Our volumes were impacted by choices we make consistent with our long-term strategy to pursue only profitable volume. Revenue per tire increased 5% compared with the prior year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This reflected continued progress in price and product mix. We generated gross margin of 18% in the quarter, essentially equal to the prior year, despite lower volumes. Selling, administrative and general expense decreased $25 million to $652 million during the quarter. Foreign currency translation more than accounted for the decline in SAG. In a few moments, I'll highlight some of the cost savings actions we have taken that will have a favorable impact on our SAG cost going forward. Excluding discrete items, our third quarter tax rate, as a percent of foreign segment operating income, was about 25%. For the full year, we continue to expect income tax expense as a percent of foreign segment operating income of between 25% and 30%. Third quarter after-tax results were impacted by certain significant items. The summary of significant items can be found in the appendix of today's presentation.","Turning to the segment operating income step chart on Slide 8, you can see the progression of operating income compared with the prior year. We reported $159 million of favorable price\/mix during the quarter, which more than offset $47 million of raw material price increases. Lower volume reduced income by $114 million, while production cuts resulted in $89 million of additional unabsorbed fixed cost during the quarter, even after Union City closure savings. Cost savings of $102 million more than offset general inflation of $71 million. With the third quarter result, we have now essentially achieved our 3-year, $1 billion cost savings goal. Going forward, we'll continue our efforts to improve cost efficiency, and have implemented additional actions to further our progress in this area, and now expect to exceed our original $1 billion goal. The other category includes higher pension expense and unfavorable foreign currency translation, consistent with the modeling assumptions we provided previously. In addition, we did see a $27 million reduction in other tire-related income, largely due to the impact of lower butadiene prices on our third-party chemical business.","Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 9. Our net debt totaled $3.7 billion. Compared with a year ago, our net debt declined $233 million, despite significant pension contributions over the last 12 months. I'd like to highlight our quarter end inventory at $3.6 billion. As indicated previously, we've aggressively reduced our production schedules to balance our supply of tires with a challenging demand environment. We've made strong progress, not only in reducing inventory on the balance sheet, but also in reducing unit inventory levels, which are down over 10% from June 30 and are now below 2011 year end levels.","Slide 10 shows free cash flow from operations. As a reminder, free cash flow from operations is cash generated after both maintenance and growth CapEx, however, it's calculated before any debt repayments or incremental borrowing, before contributions to our unfunded pension obligation and before our cash restructuring actions.","During the third quarter, we generated $105 million of free cash flow from operations. Over the last 12 months, our free cash flow from operations was just under $1.1 billion, after $1 billion of CapEx, about 1\/3 of which was for growth projects. This free cash flow from operations was used for contributions toward our unfunded pension obligation and to pay for restructuring actions, primarily the shutdown of our Union City factory. In addition, we also reduced our net debt position over this time period. So if you look at our key balance sheet priorities, we have made good progress in both funding our pension plans and reducing our net debt levels.","Moving to individual business units, I'll start with North America. North American Tire reported segment operating income of $130 million in the third quarter, an increase of 67% from the third quarter of 2011. In North America, unit volumes were down 6%, reflecting generally weak tire industry demand. The consumer replacement industry was down 5%, as dealers and distributors continued to de-stock during the quarter. Consumer OE industry demand increased 7%, as manufacturers increased production in response to strong new vehicle demand. The commercial replacement and OE industries were both down 6%. Revenue per tire increased 4% year-over-year. Our strategy in focusing on targeted market segments, mixing up in products and pricing for value of our tires helped deliver significant price\/mix improvements of $87 million versus 2011. Consistent with the second quarter, North American Tire's third quarter costs reflected approximately $20 million in savings from the closure of our Union City factory in July 2011. However, higher unabsorbed overhead negatively impacted results by $44 million, as we've lowered our production levels in response to the softer volume environment. Lower butadiene prices in our chemical business have negatively impacted third-party sales and reduced income by $20 million during the quarter. North America's third quarter results continue to give us confidence that we will not only meet, but exceed our $450 million segment operating income target, a full year ahead of plan. This is a significant milestone for Goodyear, and is validation of our strategy in what remains a challenging macroeconomic environment.","Europe, Middle East and Africa reported segment operating income of $105 million in the third quarter, which compares to a record $260 million in the 2011 period. Our 2012 results reflect sales of $1.7 billion, a decrease of 21% versus the prior year. The decline was driven by a 22% decrease in unit volume. Unfavorable foreign currency translation also impacted net sales for the quarter by $171 million. Revenue per tire, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, increased 9% year-over-year. EMEA's increase in revenue per tire was driven by solid price\/mix performance. The consumer tire business was unfavorably impacted by weakening consumer confidence, weaker sale of winter tires after last year's green winter and dealers in some European countries having more difficulty obtaining bank credit. As winter tires' sell-in has been lower than the prior year, we have aggressively reduced our production volumes in both the third quarter and for the balance of the year. The impact of reduced production volumes negatively impacted EMEA's third quarter results by $57 million. Industry unit volume for consumer OE was down approximately 7%, and vehicle registration weakened further during the third quarter.","Commercial truck industry volumes declined for both OE and replacement, as manufacturing output and industrial confidence indicators weakened. Lower sales volumes negatively impacted income by $92 million compared with a year ago. Unfavorable volume was partially offset by cost reduction activities in selling and administrative expenses, which were $7 million below the prior year level and positive price\/mix of $31 million, which more than offset the raw material cost increases. Note that EMEA results were also impacted by a $12 million reserve for volume-related penalties under a contract for supply of tires by a third-party. We continue to focus on sales, costs and productivity efforts as we manage through the challenging environment we face in EMEA.","For Latin America, net sales in the third quarter were $520 million, decreasing 20% from the prior year. Unfavorable foreign currency translation accounts for approximately 9 percentage points of the revenue decline. Tire unit sales were 7% lower. The decline in unit volume was mainly attributable to reduced volume in our consumer replacement business and exiting the","[Audio Gap]","[Technical Difficulty]","Darren R. Wells","Reduced our production volumes in both the third quarter and for the balance of the year. The impact of reduced productions volumes negatively impacted EMEA's third quarter results by $57 million. Industry unit volume for consumer OE was down...","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, I do apologize for the technical delay. I will hand the program over to Darren.","Darren R. Wells","Yes, sorry about that. I'm not sure where you lost me, but I'm going to keep going here. I was in the middle of some comments on Europe. I think in Europe, lower sales volume negatively impacted income by $92 million compared with a year ago. The unfavorable volume was partially offset by cost reduction activities in SAG, which was $7 million. SAG was $7 million below prior year levels, and a positive price\/mix of $31 million, which more than offset raw material cost increases. Note that EMEA results were also impacted by a $12 million reserve for volume-related penalties under our contract for supply of tires by a third-party. So we continue to focus on sales, cost and productivity efforts as we manage through the challenging environment we face in EMEA.","For Latin America, net sales in the third quarter were $520 million, decreasing 20% from the prior year. Unfavorable foreign currency translation account for about 9 percentage points of the revenue decline in Latin America. Tire unit sales were 7% lower. The decline in unit volume was mainly attributable to reduced volume in our consumer replacement business and exiting the bias truck business in certain countries. These reductions were partially offset by improved price and product mix. Operating income was $49 million during the quarter, $13 million below the prior year level, despite $39 million of favorable price\/mix. Operating income decreased due to a mix of factors, including lower volume and associated unabsorbed fixed cost, cost inflation and unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Our Asia Pacific business reported segment operating income of $64 million for the quarter, a year-over-year increase despite $4 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation and $3 million of incremental start-up expenses associated with the ramp-up of our new factory in Pulandian, China. Units were 1.9% lower versus prior year, as the strong demand in China was not able to fully mitigate the ongoing economic weakness in Australia and strong economic conditions in India. Overall, we continue to be pleased with performance and opportunities we see in Asia, and particularly in China, going forward.","Turning to Slide 12. You can see our 2012 industry outlook for North America and EMEA. For the most part, our outlook for the industry falls within the previously provided guidance range. There are a few exceptions I'd like to highlight. In North America, our consumer replacement volume outlook is now down approximately 2% to 3%, the low end of our previous outlook. This change largely reflects the softer year-to-date industry volume, as we expect fourth quarter volume to improve slightly from year-to-date performance. We now expect commercial OE volume to increase 6% to 8% for the full year. Volumes weakened during the third quarter, and fourth quarter production schedules indicate further softness during Q4.","Turning to EMEA. We've maintained our guidance for the consumer replacement industry and reduced our volume outlook to the lower end of the range for commercial replacement industry demand. On Slide 13, we've updated our modeling assumptions for 2012. We are projecting a fourth quarter volume decline of 3% to 5%. This largely reflects continued weakness in EMEA. As a result of the lower volume outlook and our focus on inventory management, we now expect to see approximately $240 million of additional unabsorbed fixed cost during 2012 compared to 2011, even after the benefit of Union City cost savings.","During the third quarter, we cut over 6 million units of production, which will impact our fourth quarter results accordingly. We continue to anticipate our full year raw material cost will increase by approximately 7%, although we expect to generate a benefit of approximately 10% during the fourth quarter. On a dollar basis, we expect a full year increase of just under $600 million. We expect a modest increase in price\/mix during Q4, despite the negative impact of raw material index agreements in certain OE and fleet contracts. Assuming recent spot rates, we expect the unfavorable impact in foreign exchange to be about $50 million for the year. As I mentioned earlier, we expect to have cost savings of about $325 million for the year. Finally, our expectations for Pulandian start-up costs are now below the previous range, as we've made progress in completing the transition from our old facility at a faster pace. Given we are now beginning production of commercial truck tires in Pulandian, however, we do anticipate an uptick in the fourth quarter cost.","Turning to Slide 14, you see other key assumptions for 2012. We've refined our assumptions for several items, but they largely fall within the previous outlook range we provided in July. The one exception relates to our capital expenditures forecast. As you can see from the slide, we've reduced our anticipated capital spending for 2012 to below $1.1 billion. In addition, as we move to 2013, we're reviewing possible reductions in response to lower industry demand and our focus on spending efficiency.","Before we go to Q&A, I'll again say, we continue to target $1.6 billion in segment operating income, despite 2013 volumes now well below what we expected them to be back in March of 2011. As Rich referenced in his opening remarks, meeting our target will require a different approach, and still assumes volume growth in the range of 5% from this year's levels. That said, we've demonstrated significant progress in the areas of cost reduction and producing innovative products that consumers value, while effectively managing raw material cost increases. We view our target is achievable, given the fundamental improvements that we've made to our business model and the opportunity for volume from pent-up demand. In addition, as volumes do return, we have the capacity to continue to grow our earnings beyond 2013.","With that, we'll open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A couple of things. One is just to clarify, I missed this, but did you say that there was a $12 million penalty in the SOI for Europe in the quarter?","Darren R. Wells","Yes, Rod, the comment there was that we had a reserve for a $12 million penalty under a third-party tire supply agreement. So we're taking lower volumes from that third party, and we've had to reserve for the contractual penalty.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, so that's sort of a one-time item, I would imagine.","Richard J. Kramer","Yes.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Can you talk about the -- your trend in terms of replacement volumes in a few markets looks like it's a bit weaker than the overall industry, the 10% drop in North America, I think you said 20% for Europe. How should we be thinking about that just relative to industry performance right here and then going forward?","Richard J. Kramer","Yes, Rod, I think if we look at it, we have -- actually have to look at it. I think you make a good point. Sort of region by region, I think that the dynamics are different. So if we look at it sort of in the current quarter, what we see as we think about our share and our volumes, we look at it, we kind of think about 3 different things. One is, relative to us, or relative to everyone, we saw a lower industry because of the general economic weakness. So that certainly impacted our volumes. Second to that, we're impacted by geographic mix, which I think you appreciated, we have higher penetration, by and large, of the mature markets, which were more impacted by the economic situation we're in than were some of the emerging markets, and that certainly compounded the impact of a weak economy. And the third thing is really the choices that we're making in line with our strategy, really focusing on the target profitable segments that are in our sight and exiting volume in the lower -- sort of the lower segments of the markets that are unprofitable for us. So we're following our strategy, making decisions in line with that, and certainly are comfortable with it. As we look at volume, as we look at volume going out, again, I think, in North America, certainly, we see a really, a pretty good environment. As I said on the call, our channel inventories are really are on very good shape. They're at very low levels, and we continue to see a lot of pent-up demand there. And I know you guys follow them as well. We see miles driven now up, 7 out of the last 9 months, almost up 1% year-to-date. So that pent-up demand is there. It's just a question of when it comes back. EMEA, clearly, clearly tougher than we expected. The volumes there from an industry perspective are really approaching, are at really, the 2009 recessionary levels, sort of again, unprecedented levels. And there, we're making changes to increase some flexibility in our supply chain, and I'm happy with the decisions we're making to sort of get back to where we want to be, more so in Europe. And overall, I think we look at it, we see where the industry's headed. We're making our best call and we're comfortable with it, and we'll continue to monitor it as we go forward.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So just to kind of -- on that last point about the selectivity that you're commenting on, I guess, should we just be thinking that, going forward, volumes may not move or probably won't move in line with the industry, maybe a little bit lower, but your pricing will typically be quite a bit higher? And related to that, how should we be thinking about pricing here as we get into this period here from Q3 to Q4 on a year-over-year basis, when you start to see a bit of a drop in raw materials? Should we be assuming that some portion of that in the near term is being passed back into the market?","Richard J. Kramer","Yes, Rod, on the first point, I think, we're going to stick to the strategy that we have, and that's really not pursuing volume just to fill the factories. Certainly, we're cognizant of our factories and the fact that we need to manage our cost structure, and you see us doing that, but we'll remain focused on those market segments where we can add value to ourselves and our customers. And again, to your point, you see that in the results in revenue per tire. You see it in segment operating income. Even in Europe, that's certainly below last quarter, but if we look at where Europe was at the volumes at these levels back in '09, I think we lost $15 million. We made $105 million here. So our strategy is one we're comfortable with. We're making those choices, but we're comfortable with the choices that we're ultimately making. And I guess, looking ahead, we continue to see lots of opportunities for us to continue to mix up the business. And in terms of how we look at pricing, going forward, I think you're right to connect that in part to raw material cost. And Darren, you can talk a little bit about, certainly, the RMIs we have with the OEs that impact Rod's question as well.","Darren R. Wells","I guess, that's the -- that may be the point to make, that the first consideration here is raw materials have gone down and stayed down for a while. We see the impact of the raw material indexing agreements or adjustment agreements that we have with OEs, with fleets and with certain OTR customers, clearly becoming a factor. Those are decisions we've made. We're happy with those decisions. Those are going to -- those contract provisions help us as raw materials increase, obviously protect us from raw material cost increases, but it doesn't mean that there's price reductions that are automatic in the contracts as raw material costs come down. Aside from that, we're always focused on having the right value proposition for our products and making sure we're competitive on that basis. And while price is a factor there, we take our own targeted actions. Our value proposition goes well beyond price, includes our technology, our service levels, our brands. Every segment's going to be unique in that respect, but clearly, we're looking to, on an ongoing basis, get the value proposition right for our products and deal with raw material cost as they move, both on the way up and on the way down.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just to clarify, have you made any adjustments on the replacement market in terms of pricing thus far?","Darren R. Wells","Yes, I mean, Rod, if you look, going backwards, I think what you've seen in the industry is, certainly, you've seen some select discounting and promotional activities and we have done that as well.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Any way to quantify that?","Darren R. Wells","I think, Rod, what we've been able to do is we've essentially anniversaried all our price increases. You're still seeing a revenue per tire growth for us, which says we're continuing to get the benefit of price and product mix. The -- anything that we've done from a discounting or promotional activity perspective is inherent in that 5%, and I guess that you -- I probably have to leave it there. I mean, the revenue per tire growth is not as high as it was as raw materials were increasing. Clearly, that's -- our revenue per tire growth was -- has been double digits, it's 5% in this quarter. You asked a question about going forward, I think, you look at history, our track record is that even as we've seen raw materials decline, we've tended to still, for the most part, have some positive price\/mix effect, and that's what we're looking for in the fourth quarter as well, even with some significant benefit from raw material cost and the impact of the raw material indexing agreements for the OEs and fleets.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great, that's exactly what I was asking.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a first question on the volume outlook for the fourth quarter of down 3% to 5%, how much visibility do you have on that right now? What are you assuming industry-wide and perhaps, inventory levels in the channel behind that 3% to 5%? I just want to understand kind of how much visibility we have on that target.","Richard J. Kramer","Well, Itay, I think it's almost the end of October right now, so we certainly have a view of how our business is going forward. I think, really, what we're giving you is the best estimate of what we see from our basis on where the industry is headed right now. Our OE business in North America continues to stay robust. In North America, I think we see volume decreasing, as you see on the slides that we have there, but for us, our mix and our price and mix continues to be very strong for us. Europe, obviously, continues to be a problem as we look at where that market's heading, given the whole economic conditions there.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And then just a modeling question, the corporate other walk from SOI to EBIT seemed a little bit higher in the quarter. How should we think about that for the fourth quarter? Should it be similar as what we saw in the third? And then are you still comfortable with the sort of 150 placeholder for 2013?","Darren R. Wells","Yes, so Itay, asking about the walk, I think that there are a couple of items there. I don't think we see anything significant in the run rate. I will say that the stock price movement does affect incentive compensation accruals and in fact, the stock price was up in the quarter, it had an impact, so and we -- when we did our -- I think in the last call, when we did our look at 2013, we had adjusted that corporate other outlook to $150 million for next year.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right, okay. And then as we start to think about 2013, it sounds like you're still pretty confident on the $1.6 billion of SOI. Can we talk maybe big picture around what some of the drivers there are, just price\/mix, perhaps, China, I know you mentioned 5% industry or your volume growth assumption, perhaps some restructuring that might be coming like EMEA and France? Just want to kind of maybe do a broad walk or how we should think about the walk between 2012 and 2013.","Richard J. Kramer","So Itay, it's a good question, and I think there's a couple of things of how we think about where we are and where we're going. Number one is really to start with where the business is today, and we're very pleased with the progress that we've made. In fact, we would tell you, we're actually, in our North America business, much further ahead than we thought we'd be. We reached our -- and we're planning to exceed our 2013 target a year early. So as we bridge that, we're actually pretty confident in terms of where the North American business is. As we look to bridge it further, we're assuming, as Darren said in his remarks, a volume increase next year, and that's certainly a key element, both in terms of volume increase from a sales standpoint, but also the throughput we'll get through the factories to recover some of that unabsorbed overhead that we're incurring now from the production cuts that we've taken. And then, in addition to that, as we look where raw material prices are today, you're going to see some of that flow-through come into at least the first half of 2013. That should help us toward our target as well. And then to your point, you can obviously count on us to increase the cost and productivity and the efficiencies in our business, particularly given where the global economy is at. So as we look at that, I think from a structural standpoint, we're really ahead of our business. We've made good progress and sticking to the target of the $1.3 billion, certainly, it's tougher than it was, but -- or $1.6 billion, excuse me -- tougher than it was when we started it, but I think evidence of the structural changes we've made in our business is in the fact that we're sticking to it in the case where we're about 20 million units less than we said we were going to be when we put that target out in 2011, and we're not getting, really, a pension tailwind in terms of hitting that.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's very helpful. And just lastly, Darren, any thoughts on working capital on a full year basis? I think you're at a use of $900 million year-to-date. Just want to get a better sense of that, and maybe just talk about fourth quarter free cash flow on that.","Darren R. Wells","Yes, I think that our business model continues to be working capital is neither a source nor a use. So we look to continue to grow our business without using cash for working capital. We've got a good track record doing that. So obviously, we've had a long history now of driving down working capital as a percent of sales, which then allows us to grow our sales without using cash and working capital. Fourth quarter tends to be a working capital reduction quarter, and I think we still expect that this year. Although I would say that we've done a better job keeping working capital more consistent, not using as much cash and working capital in the middle of the year this year, and so I think we feel good about that, but we're still going to see some seasonal inflow in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Healy with Northcoast Research.","John M. Healy - Northcoast Research","[indiscernible] about the Latin America business...","Richard J. Kramer","Sorry, John, we lost you on the first one. We couldn't hear you.","John M. Healy - Northcoast Research","I wanted to ask a little bit about the Latin America business. It seems like that market continues to be competitive, and I know there were some things that were talked about in the press about...","[Technical Difficulty]","Richard J. Kramer","John, we've lost you again. Operator? Yes, John, we're still here, but we -- you started with Latin America and we lost you.","John M. Healy - Northcoast Research","Okay. Sorry about that. I wanted to ask about some of the things going on in that country there. There were some news reports about some tariffs maybe taking place in Brazil. Is the momentum there continued, is that an opportunity for you guys to maybe kind of firm up your position in that market? I'd appreciate any commentary there.","Richard J. Kramer","John, Latin America for us has been a tremendous market for us, and it's fundamentally still a good market. I think what we saw over the past, maybe past 18 months is, with the strengthening of the currency, we saw a lot more imports coming into the market that certainly changed the dynamics of the market, really, for the first time in its history. Latin America, broadly speaking, not just Brazil, has had a history of having volatility to it. We understand that and that's okay. We know how to manage through that. We see the market as continuing to grow, and we see the market as continuing to mix up into larger rim diameter tires. In line with that, that expectation or that trend, really, one of the MegaTrends that we've talked about, we've announced the expansion and upgrading of our factory in Americana to make those HVA tires just as we have in other parts of the world. So we're very excited about the opportunities we see on the consumer side. And relative to the truck side, I would tell you, our truck products in Latin America and Brazil are really industry-leading. We have excellent products there. That's what we hear from our dealers. That's what we hear from our customers. So between the 2 of those, we remain very well-positioned to continue the success we've had in Latin America under, as you say, certainly, a different set of competitors than has been there historically.","John M. Healy - Northcoast Research","Great. And I wanted to ask about the price\/mix that you've been benefiting from the last few quarters, or number of quarters. When you look at the price\/mix benefit in the U.S. and then you look at it outside of the U.S., is there any different relationship between the 2? Is one market more of a beneficiary of price and then the other of mix? Trying to understand on what's happening kind of by segment and maybe how the consumers may be beginning to pay more for the value of the Goodyear brand.","Richard J. Kramer","I think I wouldn't distinguish, region by region, a fundamental difference in terms of price\/mix in terms of our value propositions or how our customers view it. I think it's pretty consistent. Our view, as Darren made the comment earlier, that we talk about the value of our products, the value of our services, the value creation in terms of the product attributes to the customers, those are the things we focus on. Our value proposition may differ from region to region. For example, winter tires in Europe are a much bigger part of the market than they are, say, in North America. So we do have differing value propositions. But at the end of the day, that focus on price\/mix and value creation is in line with our strategies around innovation and around targeting profitable market segments.","Darren R. Wells","John, the only point that I would add to that, because I think that pretty well covers it. I will say that when we run into instances where there is, very high levels of inflation, we've got some examples in Latin America right now, you do see some additional pricing that we've done historically to deal with that inflation, and so I might call that a bit unique in a couple of the economies in Latin America, but otherwise, I think Rich hit the points.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adi Oberoi with Goldman Sachs.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is Pat, in for Adi, just for old times sake here. So yes, I was hoping to just get your comments on the impact of the ITC tariff expiration, which happened in September, is that -- I know that you had sort of downplayed in the past the likelihood that, that was going to have a big impact, just because you don't really play at the lower end so much, but how is that changing things just from what you've been hearing from dealers with the October data?","Richard J. Kramer","I think that -- and we said this in our remarks, we saw some unique and maybe even erratic ordering patterns in the market as this -- as the tariffs came off, and everyone was trying to understand what the implications were, but -- and I think it impacted the September industry numbers if you look at it. But at the end of the day, as we've consistently said, that's not the part of the market where we spend a lot of time. In our North America business, as you know, we've exited a lot of private label, parts of that -- a lot of private label volume. So as we look at our business, not a significant impact for us as the tariffs came off.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then one last question, if I may. Mix continues to be one of the important tailwinds for you guys. Can you just remind us about what the core drivers of that are going forward? I mean, I think you've cited rim diameters, continuing to get bigger, so there's a vehicle stock driver. I guess, you mentioned Latin America kind of trading up, but collectively, kind of what are the biggest things that you expect to continue to push that forward as a tailwind?","Richard J. Kramer","So Pat, what I'd you refer you back to are the 7 MegaTrends that we highlighted back in 2011. I think, if you look at that, those really are the things that are pushing the industry to an upgraded place, if you will. As we said, we have larger, more complicated, higher performing tires moving into the mid-tier, not just playing at the high-end of the market. You see a lot of, even economy vehicles, with 18-inch rim diameter tires. You see fuel economy-driven tires like our Fuel Max tires more so with OE, and consumers being more focused on it, as they think about their budgets. So that more complex tire moving to the mid-tier is clearly a trend that's going to drive it. The tire labeling trend that we talked about really fills those tires with just a tremendous amount of technology to be able to simultaneously get the attributes of increased fuel mileage or rolling resistance, while not giving up, in fact, increasing, traction, and not giving up and increasing tread wear as well. Those are trends that are going to continue to drive this industry going forward. So again, if I had you refer back to those 7 MegaTrends, that's really what it's going to be and those are not limited to mature markets. Those are happening at even faster paces in emerging markets as well. So it's our focus. If you look at our key how-tos, we talk about innovative products to drive mix and to drive our products, we talk about winning in targeted profitable market segments, really focusing very particularly on the channels where those product attributes, those 7 MegaTrends, are taking root. Those are in the core of our strategy to drive our price\/mix. And if I could say, you've seen that again in our North America results. You've seen it in strong price\/mix for the company. You've seen us more than offsetting raw materials now as a trend, because we're focusing on those parts of the market.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Darren, in your opening comments, I think you made a comment regarding fourth quarter price\/mix performance versus raw. I didn't quite catch that. I was hoping you could just repeat your expectations there.","Darren R. Wells","Yes, no, Brett, I think the indication, what -- the view that we've got in the fourth quarter price\/mix is that even though we're going to see a big -- a fairly significant decline in raw material cost in the fourth quarter, we're still expecting price\/mix to be a positive, although it may be less of a positive than we saw in Q3, and -- but a positive, and it's partly being impacted by the fact that we've got these raw material index agreements in our OE and fleet contracts. So we've got some price downs that come automatically in those contracts, but we're still looking for it to be a modest positive for us in Q4.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","As we think about the index in contracts, what's kind of the lag between when raw materials start to decline relative to the index itself, is it a 1-month, 1-quarter, 6-month lag?","Darren R. Wells","Yes, Brett, the contracts, as much as we can, they're set up so that the pricing adjustment tracks with our cost of goods sold. So there's a quarter lag or so, at least, in the -- as we look at raw material change and when the contracts kick in. So we do have -- we have contracts that have different timeframes, but for a lot of them, we do have quarterly adjustments now.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then as we think about the 2013 target, the $1.6 billion in segment operating income, if I'm not mistaken, over the past couple of quarters, the 2 things that you cited as incremental challenges were going to be pension and volume, am I correct in that? Are those the 2 primary challenges?","Richard J. Kramer","Yes, I think, Brett, I'd have you focus probably more so on volume as being the challenge. As we said originally, we needed 3% to 5% growth each year to hit that, and that's something that, obviously, if we look backwards, we haven't gotten. Now as we look ahead, we see an opportunity for volume to increase as we look at where the various regions are. In Europe, we're bouncing around the 2009 level, so '12 would help -- would indicate to us that we're sort of at a floor or a bottom of that market, and that should help us as we get into 2013. In North America, we've been at low levels, where we see opportunity for a tailwind, given that the consumer replacement industry has been at around, sort of 240 million, 241 million units. That market's been as high as 257 million as we look at, so there is an opportunity for a tailwind there. And if you pair that up with sort of the destocking that we referred to that's going on, particularly in North America, I think it's reasonable to assume that, that stops at some point in time, given where channel inventories are. Again, as we look to 2013, we're certainly still seeing some emerging market growth. So as we look ahead, volume will be a challenge. We see, from a planning standpoint, as we look at the industry, that there's an increase that we're forecasting. Of course, that's going to be subject to the global economy and any shocks or severe things that may happen region by region, but as we look at it, we think our outlook is reasonable when we look at sort of the fundamentals of the industry.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And as we think about the $1.6 billion target, if we were to assume that volumes were flat in 2013, where would that $1.6 billion fall roughly?","Darren R. Wells","Yes, so Brett, clearly, for us to get to the $1.6 billion, we got to have some volume. I think that we look at and say, realistically, we've got to have some volume growth. So I think that it gets very tough. But to the extent we've encountered different volume environments, we've consistently been able to take actions to adjust for those. If we run into a volume environment that's tougher, we're obviously going to lean more heavily on what we can do from a product perspective, from a mix perspective and from a cost perspective. And I think that we have shown some flexibility to adjust to changing environments. So I think if we look at it, I don't know that it's determinable now. If we run into a different environment, we're going to make adjustments and we're going to do everything we can to stay focused on that target.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then, finally, in your opening comments or at least your -- the press release, you talked about some potential for additional cost reduction actions, and it sounds like that's something that's important to achieve in the $1.6 billion. I guess, my question is, am I correct in my interpretation of that? And secondly, are you in the planning stages at this point in time? Do you expect to unveil some additional targets at some point in time in the future?","Darren R. Wells","Yes, so Brett, cost savings and cost efficiency are an ongoing matter for us. I think the scenarios that we look at playing out next year, obviously, there are different scenarios and those different scenarios are going to require different level of cost focus. Clearly, I think we're looking at what actions we're going to need to take to the extent we continue to see a soft volume environment, and what actions we would have to take if the volume environment is even weaker than we expect. So I think that we're sort of in a perpetual planning stage on this, and yes, I think the -- it's not lost on us, but we've got the significant headwind from unabsorbed overhead. So I think the challenge to us is to continue to look at what kind of structural cost we want to have for manufacturing, and I think particularly in Europe, given the environment there.","Richard J.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","I would now like to hand the program over to Christina Zamarro, Goodyear's Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Christina Zamarro - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Thank you, everyone, for joining us for Goodyear's fourth quarter 2016 earnings call. Joining me today are Rich Kramer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Laura Thompson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, there are a few items we need to cover. To begin, the supporting slide presentation for today's call can be found on our website at investor.goodyear.com, and a replay of this call will be available later today. Replay instructions were included in our earnings release issued earlier this morning.","If I could now draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statement on slide 2, I would like to remind participants on today's call that our presentation includes some forward-looking statements about Goodyear's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments today. The most significant factors that could affect future results are outlined in Goodyear's filings with the SEC and in our earnings release. The company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","Our financial results are presented on a GAAP basis and in some cases, on non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures discussed on our call are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent as part of the appendix to the slide presentation.","And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rich.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Thank you, Christina, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll review our 2016 highlights and then ask Laura to walk us through the fourth quarter results, then I'll come back to discuss each of our business units and layout our 2017 plan in the context of our longer-term targets. Laura will finish with a detailed review of our 2017 segment operating income outlook before opening the call for your questions.","Our fourth quarter and full-year results were highlighted by growth in core segment operating income. On a full-year basis, the Americas generated SOI of $1.2 billion and operating margin of 14.1%. Consumer tire margin in the Americas increased about 200 basis points in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Europe, Middle East, and Africa delivered $461 million of SOI for the year, and margin expanded to 9.4%. Asia Pacific generated SOI of $373 million, its highest ever, and margin increased to 17.7%. In total, our full-year core segment operating income grew to a record $2 billion, in line with our third quarter guidance.","Slide 4 summarizes the progress we have made executing our strategy, resulting in steady segment operating income growth and positioning us well for that growth to continue. Our team has consistently delivered year-over-year growth while building our capabilities for the long term. This marks our fourth consecutive year and sixth of the past seven of delivering record core segment operating income.","Since 2013, our SOI has grown 25%. This improvement each year is rooted in our strategy and reflects our industry-leading value proposition, which combines our innovation and technology leadership, our award-winning products, and the global strength of the Goodyear brand in an aligned and connected business model. Our earnings growth, combined with the actions we've taken to address our pension obligations and to reduce our interest expense, have translated to more than 40% annual compounded growth in our operating EPS. I'm pleased and proud of the Goodyear team for delivering this performance.","As we discussed at our Investor Day last September, our strategy is designed to take advantage of the long-term trends shaping our industry. Global demand for high value-added large-rim diameter tires is increasing. In 2016, the percent of growth in the larger-than-17-inch tires was greater than that of the overall global growth in consumer tires. This trend will continue into the future and works in our favor as our portfolio of these products and our connected business model position us on a path to sustained growth and competitive advantage.","Our performance to-date has enabled us to deliver on our 2014 to 2016 capital allocation plan, further validating our strategy. And with an eye on our 2020 plan, this morning, we announced the $1 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization.","As we look at 2016, I'm very pleased with our fourth quarter and full-year results. Achieving these outcomes is perhaps the best indication of the strength of our strategy and the changes we have made to Goodyear's business over the past several years.","Now, with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Laura to walk through the fourth quarter results.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Thank you, Rich, and good morning, everyone. Turning to the income statement on slide 5 and as in prior quarters, we have provided callouts that highlight the impact of deconsolidating Venezuela. Our unit volume was down 2% year-over-year as growth in Asia Pacific was offset by declines in Americas and EMEA.","Our fourth quarter sales were $3.7 billion, down from $4.1 billion a year ago with the decrease driven by the deconsolidation of Venezuela. Our gross margin increased nearly 3 full points to 27.2%, and segment operating margin increased 1 full point to 12.8%. Segment operating income of $479 million was up 5% excluding the impact of Venezuela from our 2015 results. Our fourth quarter earnings per share on a diluted basis was $2.14. Our results were influenced by certain significant items. Adjusting for these items, our earnings per share was $0.95.","The step chart on slide 6 walks fourth quarter 2015 segment operating income to fourth quarter 2016. The negative impact of lower volume was $19 million. Lower production, driven in part by our U.S. commercial truck business was $27 million in the quarter. Lower price\/mix of $66 million more than offset reduced raw material costs of $18 million for a net $48 million negative impact. The year-over-year decline is reflective of the declining raw material environment over the past one year and weakness in our U.S. commercial truck business.","Sequentially, price\/mix was stable. The sequential decline in net price\/mix versus raw materials was driven by the lower raw material benefit versus the third quarter. Our third quarter guidance for full-year net price\/mix versus raw materials included an expectation of potential price increases during the fourth quarter. With volatility around raw material cost increasing dramatically throughout the fourth quarter, we elected to implement pricing actions at the start of the year, impacting the price\/mix versus raw material outcome.","Cost-saving actions of $120 million driven by our operational excellence initiatives and SAG actions more than offset the $37 million negative impact of inflation, delivering a net benefit of $83 million. On a full-year basis, our net cost savings was $190 million. Foreign currency exchange was a slight headwind of $3 million, and other was a net benefit of $35 million driven primarily by lower incentive compensation.","Turning to the balance sheet on slide 7, cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were about $1.1 billion. Net debt was down more than $700 million from the third quarter. Our global pension unfunded liability at the end of the year was $669 million, up slightly from the prior year.","Free cash flow from operations is shown on slide 8. For the quarter, we generated $1 billion in free cash flow from operations driven by an $833 million working capital benefit. Additionally, cash flow from operating activities was $1.3 billion in the quarter and $1.5 billion for the full-year 2016. The strong cash generation during the quarter supported the repurchase of $300 million of our common stock during the fourth quarter or about 10 million shares.","For the full year, we repurchased $500 million in common stock or 16.7 million shares. In addition, we repaid $200 million on our U.S. second lien term loan in December, taking the remaining balance to $400 million.","Turning to slide 9, Americas generated record segment operating income of $295 million in the fourth quarter or 14.3% to sales. Excluding Venezuela, operating income grew by $33 million or 13%. The increase in income was driven by strong performance in our consumer tire business, which was partially offset by continuing weakness in commercial truck, which was down $32 million year-over-year.","Unit sales in the fourth quarter were 18.7 million, down 5% versus 2015. The negative impact of Venezuela accounts for about 300,000 units with a much weaker U.S. commercial truck OE industry and consumer OE business driving much of the remaining difference. OE volume was impacted by the timing of new model changeovers and lower overall production at OE in the quarter. Excluding Venezuela, replacement sales were about flat for the region. For the full year, Americas delivered segment operating income of $1.15 billion or 14.1% to sales. When excluding the impacts related to Venezuela and the sale of GDTNA, SOI continues to show solid growth.","Turning to slide 10, Europe, Middle East and Africa generated segment operating income of $81 million in the quarter. The year-over-year decline in SOI was due to negative net price\/mix versus raw material costs, which was primarily driven by timing associated with raw material index agreements in our OE contracts.","Overall, EMEA's fourth quarter unit volumes declined 1% year-over-year. EMEA's OE unit volume was down 5%, primarily driven by choices we've made in our consumer business as we continue to focus on the more profitable 17-inch and larger-rim size fitments.","Replacement tire shipments were up almost 1%, driven by growth in the 17-inch-and-above segment of the consumer market where our Europool volume increased 19% year-over-year. We continue to see declining industry demand and increased competition at the lower end of the consumer replacement business, particularly in the summer segment. For the full year, EMEA delivered $461 million in SOI and 6% growth for the year with margin expanding to 9.4%.","Turning to slide 11, Asia Pacific delivered record fourth quarter segment operating income of $103 million, a $7 million improvement versus last year. The main drivers continue to be the benefits of volume growth and the positive impact from our operational excellence programs driving lower conversion cost. Our segment operating margin in the region increased to 18.8% from 17.2% a year ago. Asia Pacific's volume was 8.4 million tire units, representing about a 1% growth versus last year, primarily attributable to our key consumer markets in China and India.","Given its proximity to natural rubber production and relatively lower levels of inventory, Asia Pacific began to feel the impact of higher raw material costs in the fourth quarter. While we anticipate higher raw material costs and currency headwinds for the region in the short-term, we continue to view China and the rest of the region as a key long-term growth opportunity. We're investing in our teams, our products, and our capabilities to drive that growth.","On a full-year basis, Asia Pacific delivered record SOI of $373 million with margin increasing to 17.7%.","I'll now turn the call back over to Rich.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Great. Thank you, Laura. We feel very positive about the progress in our business in 2016, and we remain confident in our ability to continue delivering on our long-term plan. Our strategy is clear and unwavering and, despite significant headwinds, including raw material costs, we believe we are positioned to generate significant increases in SOI and cash flow over the long term.","While 2016 was strong for both Goodyear and the industry, we know there are trends that have your attention. They have ours as well. So, I'd like to continue my remarks by offering some perspective on two key topics affecting the global tire industry going forward. The first area relates to industry growth, which continues to be a great story in the premium segment. The industry saw robust growth in large-rim diameter tire sizes in 2016. In the U.S. market, the full-year growth in the 17-inch-and-larger segment was 9%, and in EMEA, it was 10%. As we discussed at our Investor Day, the 17-inch-and-above rim diameter tires are a good proxy for where the industry profit pool is going. With the increasing demand for these premium tires, we expect supply to remain tight.","The segment is growing in multiples of the total industry. Our strategy and our strength focuses on the increasing profit pool in that part of the market that is simultaneously growing and mixing up. We're focused on the part of the market where Goodyear can add value with our technology, with our brand, with our distribution, and with all the capabilities that we bring to bear for the market.","The trend towards larger, more complex tires has been driven by the auto manufacturers. In 2017, we will continue to implement our OE strategy where we target profitable fitments that have high loyalty rates and pull-through in the replacement market.","While we continue to demonstrate a leading presence on successful vehicle fitments that were launched in previous years, we also have won a number of new fitments that will be rolled out over the coming year. As you would expect, these platforms depend on the performance characteristics of Goodyear's premium large-rim diameter tires. These are the type of platforms that we target with our OE strategy. They deliver strong return to the OE and lead to profitable growth in replacement.","The second area of focus is raw material costs. Turning to slide 13, you'll see significant volatility in our key commodity costs, including natural rubber prices. Since our last earnings call, there's been a swing from a low of $0.67 per pound to a peak of $1.04 per pound as recently as last week, an increase of an astounding 55%. And the raw material cost story is about more than just natural rubber, with challenges coming in a broad cross-section of commodities. For example, prices of key commodities such as butadiene and carbon black have risen to 52-week highs in recent weeks. We expect raw material costs to remain at heightened levels in 2017.","I'm pleased with how our team has been aggressively responding in this environment. We are confident that we will continue to offset raw material cost increases as we continue to focus on price\/mix as a key component of our business.","As shown on slide 14, over the past seven years, changes in raw materials have been largely offset by changes in price. This includes during 2011 when our commodity headwind was $2 billion and natural rubber reached a peak of around $2.60 per pound.","With that as a backdrop, I'd like to turn the discussion to address the year ahead in each of our business units, starting with the Americas on slide 15. As I mentioned earlier, the U.S. market grew 9% in the larger rim sizes during 2016, outpacing growth in the overall market by more than four times. Our growth in these segments was on par with the market, which is a significant achievement given the supply constraints we've been managing through over the past several quarters.","The investments we've made within the U.S., including growth CapEx to increase our supply of larger, more profitable tires, enabled us to sell 1.7 million more of the large rim size tires in the replacement market in 2016. In 2017, we're launching a number of new exciting products including the Goodyear Assurance WeatherReady in the commuter touring segment. The introduction of the WeatherReady at our recent Americas Customer Conference received an overwhelmingly positive response as did the new Endurance tire for trailers and RVs, and the Endurance LHD commercial tire for long haul applications.","At the conference, we also reinforced the value of the Goodyear brand and emphasized that our customers' alignment to our strategy has both fueled their growth and positioned them to win in the future. Every year, our customers and associates leave this event energized and optimistic about Goodyear, and this year was certainly no exception.","The investments we've made in our existing U.S. footprint and the start of production in our Americas plant later this year will drive our volume growth in the premium 17-inch-and-above segment. We continue to be focused on increasing our capability and managing our production costs to increase our supply of the right tires for this demand in 2017. This remains our top priority.","The U.S. commercial truck industry continues to be affected by weak OE volumes and the impact of anticipated tariffs on Chinese imports in the replacement market. The current industry environment in heavy truck, especially new truck production, continues to be challenging. On the other hand, we began to see improvement in the replacement market in the fourth quarter where our volume was up 5% year-over-year. We will continue to drive value in our commercial business through our exclusive end-to-end total solutions business model for fleets, while leveraging our Goodyear and Kelly-branded products in the mid-tier.","While we expect the first half of 2017 for our commercial business will be weaker year-over-year driven by OE, we are building on that positive replacement market momentum and expect that the business will grow again in the second half.","Outside the U.S., we expect both the consumer OE and replacement industry in Latin America to grow in the low-single-digits in 2017, where we have successfully mixed up in a very, very tough environment. As an example, our team in Brazil has focused on expanding its aligned dealer and distribution network and building capabilities to drive value with these important customers. I am extremely pleased with our progress particularly in this very difficult environment.","Our products are at the core of this improvement. Over the past four years, 100% of the consumer replacement product portfolio in Brazil has been refreshed and revitalized. The consistent strength of our Americas business is the result of our unwavering commitment to a strategy built on the alignment and integration of our industry-leading products developed from the market back, our aligned distribution network, and the power of the Goodyear brand.","Turning now to slide 16, our EMEA business saw strong fourth quarter growth in the greater-than-17-inch rim size segment of 19%, which nearly doubles the industry growth rate. This performance is attributable to our award-winning winter tire value proposition where we gained share in both the larger and the smaller rim size segments. In the summer replacement sector, however, we continue to see increased competition, including from low-cost imports, which led to year-over-year volume declines in the less-than-17-inch segment of the market.","Last quarter, I outlined our plan to take the necessary steps to shift our resources and reduce our exposure to declining less profitable market segments in EMEA. This includes the previously announced footprint action in Philippsburg, Germany. In the current environment, we expect our volume declines in the less-than-17-inch summer segment to continue throughout the course of 2017.","In addition, we're in the process of realigning our go-to market model across the region similar to the approach that we've successfully implemented in the U.S. Over the long term, this recalibration will strengthen and further differentiate our value proposition to our distribution and service network. These actions, when coupled with foreign currency headwinds, will make for a very challenging year for our EMEA business. We believe these actions, while difficult, are necessary to position the business for sustainable long-term growth. We'll continue to seek opportunities to accelerate our mix-up in the region. We're confident that our line-up of high value-added, large rim diameter tires will enable us to meet the increasing demand in the industry's most profitable, high growth segment.","Turning to Asia Pacific, we're very pleased with our full-year results and are consistently building on our foundation to enable continued long-term growth in the region. In 2017, we see consumer replacement industry growth across the region in the mid single-digit range driven by our key markets in China and India. We also see growth in the OE industry in the low single-digits. We expect our momentum in 2016 will continue and lead the strong growth in China again in 2017.","Our confidence is strengthened by multiple new OE platforms wins in 17-inch-and-above rim sizes and continued expansion opportunities for consumer replacement in Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities. As an example, we expect double-digit volume growth in large rim size SUV tires in our consumer business and continued strong demand across our product mix.","In November, we broke ground on the latest expansion of our existing facility in Pulandian, China. This will enable us to produce an additional 3 million passenger and light truck tires annually, supporting our growth in the profitable segments of the market over the intermediate term. The ramp-up of this incremental capacity will be completed in 2019.","We're very optimistic about the long-term value proposition of our business in Asia Pacific. Our new product introductions, OE pull-through and buildout of our distribution network will be supported by increased premium tire capacity and gives us confidence that we will continue to be successful in this growing region.","Turning to slide 17, our next stage plan, as we discussed at our Investor Day, includes a target of $3 billion in SOI by 2020 and cumulative free cash flow of up to $5 billion over the next four years. The cadence of our earnings will certainly be affected by raw material input costs this year. With the recent increases in raw material costs, we are now expecting SOI in 2017 to be about flat compared to 2016. While we expected raw material costs to increase over the period, the rise we are currently experiencing has been both faster and steeper than we anticipated. However, we have both the confidence and the demonstrated capability to recover our input costs over time. We remain committed to our 2020 targets and our plan to deliver 20 million more premium tires over the next four years.","We see 2017 as a foundational year leading to 2018 when we expect our earnings trajectory to accelerate. We believe there are four specific drivers of that growth. First, assuming raw material costs stabilize, we would expect a year-over-year tailwind from net price versus raw materials resulting from the approximate six-month timing lag related to our OE and fleet contracts.","Second, we will realize cost savings in EMEA including the impact of the Philippsburg plant closure. Third, as I mentioned earlier, we expect our U.S. commercial truck business to be stronger. And finally, increased production in our new Americas plant in 2018 will help offset ongoing plant startup costs. Combination of these factors should accelerate earnings growth in 2018 as we continue to mix up and implement cost savings initiatives.","As you think about our results over the next two years, it makes sense to think about 2017 and 2018 together. We remain focused on executing our strategy, and we are confident that we will continue to deliver strong earnings and economic value. I'm pleased with the state of the business as we look ahead. as I told our customers at our recent conference, the mix-up opportunity in our industry is as good as it has ever been. And for those who can also manage its complexity, this mix shift will be a tremendous opportunity.","As I frequently say, we're not running our business for one quarter or one year but for the long term. We know that because a variety of factors, such as the unexpected steep increases in raw material costs, the tire business rarely grows in a straight line. That's okay. That's the tire business. That's why we have a 2020 plan and not a one-year plan. The Goodyear team has the experience and knows how to manage through it, and I have confidence we will.","I'll now turn the call back over to Laura to finish up with our 2017 outlook.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Thank you, Rich. Turning to slide 18, with unabsorbed overhead and the impact of the timing lag related to our raw material indexed agreement occurring in the first several months of the year, the profile of our first half will be very different from our second half. We expect a softer first half with accelerating growth in the second half of 2017. So net-net, our full-year SOI is expected to be about flat based on our current planning assumption. As the current raw material environment remains extremely volatile, we will update you again as part of our first quarter earnings call.","Turning to slide 19, we have updated our full-year 2017 SOI drivers. Overall, we expect volume growth of about 1% for the year and an unabsorbed overhead headwind of about $70 million, driven by lower production carryover and lower first quarter production. We expect raw material costs to be up 27% based on current spot prices and that equates to a $1.1 billion increase versus last year.","Looking at the net of these raw material cost increases and positive price\/mix performance, the outlook is about flat for 2017. The rapid increase in raw material costs will create a timing imbalance with our raw material indexed agreement that cover about 35% of our business. Strong mix over the course of the year will offset this temporary price versus raws imbalance.","As a final note to the price\/mix expectations for the year, we see global OTR industry demand in 2017 to be largely similar to 2016. As a result, we are expecting essentially a neutral impact to mix from our OTR business. We expect our cost savings actions to exceed inflation by about $140 million in 2017 as our operational excellence initiatives continue to deliver strong results.","Looking at the impact of foreign currency translation at current spot rate, we estimate about a $50 million negative impact. The other line represents a combined headwind from plant startup costs, increased R&D, and higher depreciation in 2017, partially offset by the adjustment during the second quarter of 2016. The outlook for these combined is a $50 million headwind. The outlook in total for 2017 is for full-year SOI to be about $2.0 billion.","On slide 20, we have listed the other financial assumptions for 2017. As part of those assumptions, we see working capital as a use of $200 million, as raw material cost increases along with startup inventory at our new plant drive an increase for the year.","I'd like to cover the $1 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization briefly before we open the line for your questions. We remain committed to our capital allocation plan where our free cash flow is allocated both to debt repayment and returning capital to shareholders. In either case, we will execute on our capital allocation plan over time and as we generate the cash.","Now, we'll open the line up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we can take our first question from David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Good morning, David.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning, Rich. Good morning, Laura. Couple questions on my end. First on really price\/mix cadence as we're thinking about this. It sounds as if first half of the year clearly going to be down and maybe having that made up in the second half of the year. Can you help us think about the magnitude of the first quarter? Are we talking down triple digits for price\/mix less raws in the first quarter in aggregate? Maybe (34:09) I'll stop right there before the next one.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Okay. So you're exactly right, David. We do expect for the first half of the year, our price\/mix versus raws to be negative and turning positive in the second half of the year. Our raws, specifically, in the first quarter, we're thinking it's going to be down and just more like 7% \u2013 7% to 9% or so with that increasing more as we get into the second quarter. So more heavy weighted to the second quarter as you think about the first half. No, I don't see it as triple digits, I think, as you mentioned it in your question.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then from a pricing perspective, you've announced up to 8% in the U.S. You've seen a lot of fast followers, you've seen the other global Big Three follow you there with Michelin and Bridgestone announcing similar price increases. Are you expecting that amount to stick in its entirety? Do you think maybe that gets cut in half is realistic? And really, what have you been seeing so far? Because we're, what, eight days into your price increase.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","So David, I think it's a lot to cover there and if I could, I'm just going to maybe take one step back again, because I think it's really important to look back at what we're trying to do in the marketplace, even in view of the significant raw material headwinds we have. And I just want to go back and say, as you think about our business and what we built over the last, call it, 10-plus years and the like, the essence of our strategy has really been around trying to create value for our consumers, for our customers and for ourselves.","And if I could, because it's so meaningful to us, even go back to our strategy road map where we say our goal to deliver sustainable revenue and profit growth while increasing the value of our brands. And that's what we're ultimately trying to do. I told our customers recently, there's lots of alternatives to go out there and buy a tire \u2013 just to go buy a tire from. You can find a lot of companies to do that, but we try to deliver more than that. And that's what we built our business on as we've move ahead.","Our customers are getting, right, our entire value proposition, getting technology, they're getting product innovation. They're getting our brand, our brand promotions. They're getting service. They're getting supply. They're getting quality that we bring, and they're getting the partnership of our people. And that's the competitive advantage we're doing. And why it's so important is as we think about a headwind like we have on our raw material costs right now, it's not simply just about looking at one input cost then trying to manage that. It's ultimately about selling and getting compensated for that value proposition. So, that's what we're ultimately doing.","Now back to your question, in terms of what we have, we've gone out in the U.S. and we've done that at 8%. We've done that in other regions of the world as well, including Europe, where we've done up to 8% for consumer and commercial to be effective as of the 1st of March. So, we've put -and we've done this in other regions or other countries as well. So, our intention on that value proposition is to go capture that value, not simply as a function of only our input costs but as a function of the value that we're bringing to the table.","Now, if I could, maybe one more thing, and I think Laura touched on it, remember, we have two things that are going on that are worth commenting on. One is simply the lag of which these raw materials ultimately hit our P&L. And for those that may be familiar, those who may not, there can be a six-month lag to when we actually purchase, let's say, natural rubber in Southeast Asia when it's on a ship, when it ultimately gets to a dock, when it comes into our inventory, when it gets produced into a tire, to finally when it hits cost of sale. So we have this lag of the cost that comes into our P&L. Europe and North America being the longest, Asia it hits a lot quicker. So that goes into how we think about this.","And the second element is the raw material indexation agreements we have that essentially reset every six months or so, on average. And remember, we really liked that when that came in, when we dealt with big raw material headwinds in the past where we were able to be compensated or essentially acknowledge the raw material increases we have. As they go up, we get a lag and the price goes up. As those raw materials go down, there's a lag and the prices come down. So as we see this inflection point where raw material goes up, it'll take longer to recover those raw material indexation customers around OEMs and fleets as well. So those are some of the things that will come into play as we think about how the raw materials hit us.","Our intent, to be very clear, is to offset those raw materials over time. And if you look back, our track record, I think, speaks for itself in our ability to do that, and we approach this with the same confidence at this point. So, David, hopefully, that adds a little color to the question as well.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I think it does. Just \u2013 is there anything in the near term that you've been seeing that would lead you to believe that those price increases that you've passed on would not stick, or you're seeing a volume response as a result?","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","I think, David, I'll go back and say, with the value proposition we have forward, this is just another element of it, and we feel confident that that value proposition is worth it in the marketplace and that we can pass that on.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah. And if you look back, we have different time periods in our recent history where we've been able to do that. This is a lot of the same management team that's been able to accomplish that. It is, over time, just like slide 14 shows you, and that's all reflective in our outlook for the year.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","And, David, just maybe to go back and just build on Laura's point, if you go back in time, we had increases of in 2006, $800 million of increased raw material; in 2008, we had $700 million; in 2010, we had $700 million; in 2011, we had $2 billion; and this year, we're looking at about $1 billion. And if you look back over time, we were able to offset that with price and mix. And I think that's the best way to answer that question.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then lastly, on the overhead absorption, you're looking for $70 million for the full year. It seems like the majority of that's the first half, you get a benefit from the San Luis Potos\u00ed plant ramping up in the second half of the year. How much of that is really driven by commercial vehicle? How much of it is something else that maybe I haven't considered because that was a very large variance, at least, what we are thinking about for the full year?","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","No, I think it's \u2013 I think you hit it on the head. As we carry over, that's what we're bringing into the first half essentially, is the bulk of that is \u2013 we had certainly some consumer production cuts in that number as well, but commercial, particularly on a dollar basis, is a driver of that number.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yes.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","You got it, right?","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah. And the cadence is, just like you said, it's primarily all going to hit (41:40) in the first half.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Thanks, David.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Okay, thanks.","Operator","We'll take the next question from Itay Michaeli with Citi. Please go ahead.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Morning, Itay.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Morning.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Just on page 17, I appreciate the color on some of the potential 2018 drivers, wondering if there are any other buckets we should be thinking about at this point for 2018, particularly in some of the other elements like R&D and depreciation, just kind of want to understand if you think these are the main buckets for SOI growth, if there's any other factors \u2013 potentially offsetting factors to think about as well for 2018.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Well, Itay, I'll start and Laura can jump in as well. I mean I think as we look at this, we have managed through a lot of headwinds, differing headwinds over time, and I think one of the elements on here is that the cost bucket. I mean you see a line on there for costs, but at the end of the day, we will continue to manage our investments and our \u2013 not on this page. Obviously, this is an SOI page \u2013 but we'll be prudent allocators of our capital.","We will certainly look at all our costs and expenses whether it's advertising, it's R&D, and manage those in the context of \u2013 prioritize those in the context of the environment that we're dealing with. So, this isn't an all-inclusive bucket, but these are some of the things, as we think about 2017, 2018 sort of together as we look at what we need to offset over time here, these are the things to say, they're going to be benefiting us as we look out into the future, particularly into 2018.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","And I think if you look at our SOI walk chart for our 2020 target, some of your questions on some of the investments, so we did provide for investments as part of that target. To Rich's point, we also have the net cost savings, right, of $500 million over that time period as well and continued mix-up, and again these 20 million tires as they come into play. But investments as we think about 2018, again as Rich said, we'll time those as we need them. Certainly things like depreciation will increase as we go into 2018 as well.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","And, Itay, one of the things that we've not built into the 2020 plan and we've not built it on that page \u2013 and I say this with a little bit of humor \u2013 but it's got to snow again in Europe. And remember, our winter business is really an industry leading business in Europe. And to the extent that we ever get that coming back again, which I hope we do, that's an upside as well. But to be clear, we've not built any of that in because we've been dealing with such warm winters now for sort of like five in a row or four in a row. So that's in there as well.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah. And I think the OTR business falls in the same bucket. We're not assuming a big recovery in there but, at some point, that will come back.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","That's very helpful. And just a follow-up question just on slide 7, I think your leverage ratio of 2.39 times is a little bit higher than I think what you thought you'd come in at 2 to 2.1 times for the end of 2016. Could you just update us on how you're thinking about debt reduction versus buybacks, and that glide path to, I believe, your 1.5 times leverage ratio by 2020?","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Okay, sure. So, I think \u2013 let's go through it maybe this way. As we think about our share repurchase \u2013 maybe I'll hit that one \u2013 certainly, the authorization increase of $1 billion is meant to go beyond 2017, that our share repurchase historically, you've seen us kind of time those with when we generate the cash, which is normally concentrated towards the fourth quarter. So I think \u2013 now, as you think about the 2016 impact that you pointed out, that certainly was impacted by the earnings decline related to the U.S. commercial truck market, frankly. As we think about our capital allocation plan, everything still holds. Nothing we saw in 2016 changes that. Our free cash flow is balanced between debt repayment as well as our shareholder return programs.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. That's very helpful. Thanks so much.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Thank you, Itay.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my question.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Hi, Ryan.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. We've seen you and your competitors announce price increases in the U.S. I've not seen as many price actions being announced in Europe. Is that consistent with what you're seeing, or maybe it's just a case that the increases there are made more stealthily or harder to track from the U.S. Do you think one region or another may have more or less difficulty in passing along price increases in 2017?","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Ryan, as you would imagine, we manage our business market by market, and you rightly pointed out that we had announced price increases in North America of up to 8% in consumer and commercial effective 1 February. And as I mentioned just a bit ago as well, we announced as of 1st of February in Europe, again, up to 8% on consumer and commercial effective 1st of March as well.","And, again, we have, market by market, made announcements, I certainly won't go through them on this call, but we only can speak to our situation. And our situation, again, I would point back to, our goal is to recapture or capture the value for the entire value proposition we put out there. Input costs are one of them, and obviously very significant at this moment as it has been in the past. But our philosophy around the world is to put a value proposition out there that creates competitive advantage and that's what we're ultimately trying to accomplish.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then, I was just hoping \u2013 and maybe to revisit a topic from last quarter's call on the impact to Goodyear of the China TBR tariff. So, looking at some of the RMA import data, it shows that the imports of commercial truck tires, they've already started to decline maybe even sizably in the back half of 2016. Is it the case that you're seeing this too, but that there's still a volume headwind for you because of the distributors maybe being in a still overstocked position after a pre-buy? And then, at some point I imagine this should turn into a nice volume tailwind for you on market share gain. When do you think that that will occur?","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","So, Ryan, it's a good question. I think to the first question just on the tariff itself, I think the issue that we still see, and we did speak to it last quarter as well, is essentially there's a lot of inventory in the channels reflective of the big pre-buys that came as was the case with consumer as well. So, the channels have a lot of inventories still in them and our view is that it's still going to take the first half to work its way through the channels.","So that something is there. Just like with the consumer side, our view is we sort of have to look at the business, and we do, in a steady state trying to adjust for some of the aberrations of the pre-buys and then the significant stop (48:54) buyings of imported tires because of tariffs and look at it \u2013 look at sell-out over time because that's a more true picture of the market that we have to deal with.","Now having said that, we're looking at about 1% to 2% growth in replacement in the U.S. and still about a 6% decrease in OE, which is sort of a carryover from what we've seen in 2016. So, we expect \u2013 to your point, we expect the volumes even for OE to turn positive later in the year, and we would expect the commercial industry to improve. And from our perspective, look, we've got great products, we've got the best end-to-end fleet solutions in the business, we got a great brand, we supplement it with some Kelly product in the mid-tier. So, we're confident that we're going to \u2013 that the industry's going to rebound, and that we're going to benefit from that as we look ahead. And that is an upside for us.","But I'll tell you, one of the things I learned early on of our business is truck is probably one of the most cyclical businesses that we have. When it's great, it's really great and it booms; and when it's not, you get, like I said, two years in a row of OE downs and what have you. But that's okay. I mean, we know how to manage it, and that's exactly what we're doing. And to your point, there's no doubt that there's better days ahead in truck.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's a very helpful color. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Hi, Brett.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Good morning, Brett.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Just a couple of quick questions here. First of all, if I take your raw material impact of $1.1 billion divide it by about $15 billion in sales, I get about a 7% increase necessary on the pricing side. Is that kind of how you're thinking about it, which would seem to imply that you don't need another price increase, or is it possible that you might need another price increase given current raw material levels?","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Ryan (sic) [Brett], we can only speak to the situation that we see at hand. So, I...","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Right.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","...I can't comment on what's ahead. What I can say is that we have a demonstrated track record to deal with what's....","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Whatever.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","...thrown in front of us. And that's what you can expect from us going forward. What we're in, what I can say is that clearly the raw material inputs that we've got have been very volatile and I would even say unpredictable. I mean, we saw steep, steep increases in our raw material costs, not only natural rubber which you saw. I'm sure many of you have seen or will look at an article even in The Journal this morning that talks about one of the reasons being speculation in China and the like. We know we've had floods in Thailand relative to natural rubber. On butadiene, we've had some unplanned factory shutdowns and the like. So, there's some causes for this. But our view is raw materials are going to stay at a heightened level, as I said in my script, and we have a philosophy here, play it as it lies, and that's what we're going to go do.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","I mean, Brett, just since \u2013 even since to the Detroit Auto Show, right, we've gone up over $300 million in raw material cost increases just in the last three weeks. So, it is quite volatile, just to reiterate that point.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And then switching gears, how do we think about the pace of share repurchase. If I take a look at your $3.5 billion to $4 billion over a four-year period of time, that seems to suggest that you might be buying back in the range of about 10% per year on a constant basis. But is there some reason to believe that that's going to be substantially lower in 2017 versus, let's say, 2018, 2019 or 2020?","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","So, I think I talked about it earlier and we'll keep you updated as we go throughout the year, Brett. But I think we all \u2013 if you go back in history, as we generate the cash, we spend it, whether it's debt repayment or things like share repurchases. So, I think as we \u2013 we still, I mean, look at the outlook charts that we have. We certainly expect strong free cash flows in 2017, of course. And given that, I think based on our history, we'll time that as we generate the cash, which is really, for us, concentrated in the fourth quarter. Now, just overall as a 2020 comment, the share repurchases are directly correlated to the growth in the earnings through that 2020 plan. Absolutely.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Fair enough. Thank you very much.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Okay. Thank you, Brett.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Thank you, Brett.","Operator","And we'll go next to Paresh Jain with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Paresh B. Jain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Good morning, Paresh.","Paresh B. Jain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Good morning.","Paresh B. Jain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just a couple of questions on the OE exposure actually and slightly longer term. In a situation where the 17-inch supply basically falls short of demand, which is what you're forecasting, I'm guessing it would be fair to assume that your capacity would first address your OE customer demand before meeting replacement. Can you provide any color on how you're splitting that incremental demand between OE and replacement through 2020? And in the event U.S. South continues to grow over the next two years for some reason, should I consider that as a headwind to your 2020 outlook?","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","So, to the first question, Paresh, I would say what we have to do is manage the volatility or the changes in demand between replacement and OE, and we do that being able to toggle that product back and forth between the two markets. Clearly, our strategy, as we've indicated, starts with getting on those high-loyalty fitments that succeed in first and second to maybe even third replacement as they get into the market.","So, OE is something that clearly is a priority for us, and it's really prioritize in the sense of obligations, contractual obligations as well as we work with each of the OEs. But OEs change their production schedules. And as they do, we need to go back and then figure out how to utilize our capacity the best we can. And there's a big demand in the replacement market as well. So, I would say there's no magic formula. It's really a strategic path that we follow. And then we have to manage demand requirements as we go.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","And then I'd just say \u2013 I mean, I think it's maybe what you're getting at, Paresh, is OE is very profitable for us. So it's not a headwind per se, if that's your point, in our 2020 plan if the SAAR goes up.","Paresh B. Jain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I mean, relatively because replacement is expected to be $32 in profits per tire versus OE at $20.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah. That's an industry...","Paresh B. Jain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","The first number is an industry number on that chart.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Paresh, I would say our OE business, we don't look at that as a headwind at all. We actually look at that as the seeds (56:12) to drive our business into the future. And again, if I could take it back, I mean, it really is about managing our OE business with our customers, our OE customers to the point where we're adding value for them and being able then to get the benefit of those tires in the replacement market.","In the past, our focus was too much on just getting fitments and volume for volume's sake. And in that model, I might suggest your thought process may have more relevance. But we're really very focused on making the right decisions for us, and therefore, I think OE growth of large-rim diameter tires is actually a good thing for us.","Paresh B. Jain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. Thanks for the color.","Operator","And we'll take the next question from Emmanuel Rosner with CLSA.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Good morning, Emmanuel.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","So, first, just a quick housekeeping question on the quarter. The fourth quarter SOI, I think, I mean is a little bit below the low end of the guidance you had given in October. But I think the EPS was a bit above expectations. And as far as I could say, it was basically the contribution from other income. Anything specific in that other income bucket and whether that's something that we could expect to be recurring?","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Okay. So, first, maybe just to make sure we have the numbers clear, our outlook for the fourth quarter was to be between $2 billion and $2.025 billion, and we came in for the year at $2.009 billion, okay, so right where we think we should be, okay, overall. Now, on the guide, I think, Christina can walk you through that, those pieces part, if you'd like.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah. And, Emmanuel, I would say there's really \u2013 Christina can walk you through the other items. There is nothing unusual in there to highlight for you. What I would say, though, is we focus our guidance a lot on segment operating income because that's sort of the number that we manage. But I can tell you we put a tremendous amount of effort as well on managing net income and EPS, whether it's tax planning, whether it's...","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Interest expense.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","...managing our financings, and things like these. So, that is obviously, to state the obvious, a priority for us. But as you look at that forecast, again, Christina can take you through all the elements, but I don't think there's anything in there that you're going to \u2013 there's nothing in there that you would highlight to say, oh, that's a surprise we didn't tell you about. It's more of business as usual, normal course.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. And I guess, more fundamentally then, so I was hoping if you could go into a little bit more detail or quantification of the mechanism to recover some of these raw materials especially the contractual part, like if I look at your expectation for $1.1 billion in raw material increase in 2017 at spot prices, how much roughly of that would it just be automatically you will get back based on contracts? And how much would be things where you would have to basically pass on a price increase on the market in order to be able to get it back?","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah. So, Emmanuel, I'll maybe try to answer that from a couple of different ways. We estimate about 35% of our business is covered by RMI agreements and the like. And that again is primarily OEM or new car manufacturers as well as certain commercial fleets and mining fleets out there. By and large, that's what ultimately covers it. And those agreements are in there, so that mechanism normally resets round about every six months or so.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","On average.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","(01:00:06) on average. Some are quicker. Some are a little bit longer. But on average, I think it's a reasonably good proxy. And for us, as I mentioned, and I think for our customers as well, it gives us good transparency and visibility into our costs and their costs as they move ahead. So, I think it's a mutually beneficial type agreement that we put in there. And again, in a period of rising raw material costs, we're going to lag in terms of recovering those raw material costs because of that. And that situation will continue until such time that those raw materials stabilize and we can catch up. Of course, that reverses itself as well as raw material goes down with that lag.","So, right now, as we see raw materials increase as they come into our P&L, I think as David asked earlier, Q2 is going to be really a bigger hit of incremental year-over-year raw material cost increases as well then in (01:01:08) Q3 and Q4 as we look at the forecast here. So, those RMI contracts have to catch up. That's why we have a lag between being able to offset everything in a really sort of finite period of time, if you will, of 12 months calendar year. So, that's how the RMI contracts work. But I think they're very effective. They're a good answer for us, and we believe that that's ultimately will happen over the period of time. The others, those aren't (01:01:38) negotiated agreements with our customers that are out there, so.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","Understood. And then finally, just on your \u2013 some of the tax plans that are being considered for the U.S., obviously, you're currently sitting in an incredibly good position with your manufacturing being done basically in the U.S., but you're also working on that Mexico plant. Any initial thoughts in terms of the parameters of what would affect \u2013 would you change to reflect (01:02:08) the way or the place your future tires will be produced in case some of these border adjustment taxes go through?","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","So, Emmanuel, you're correct to state that it's clear around the world including in the U.S., our strategy generally is that we make the tires where we sell the tires. And certainly, like I said, that's the case for the U.S. So, in that sense, you're correct in your assessment, but, right, and certainly my actually (01:02:40) caveat all of this with there's just a tremendous amount of unknowns and no details around a lot of the statements that are being made. But remember, we do import natural rubber from Asia into the U.S., and you can't get that in the U.S., so it's all imported. So, there would be a tax consequence opposite on that side.","Bottom line is, though, because of that and, like I said, especially if you look at 2016, we import very few tires into the U.S., but we are a net importer, when you think of it, to the tune maybe of a couple hundred million dollars driven by that natural rubber piece of the business. Now, there's a lot of other things going on in these Ryan plans and taxes and so on, so again, hard to figure out, not a lot of details.","So, kind of on the tax front for Goodyear, at this time, we probably have to say somewhat of a neutral, lots of pluses and minuses within there. But the tire industry imports into the U.S. about 170 million tires. And like I said, we're a very small part of that piece there, so could be an impact as the industry looks at it. But, again, from Goodyear, from a tax perspective, hard to say, fairly neutral, though, especially because of that importing of the raw material natural rubber.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","And I'll just add to Laura's comments just to emphasize what she made the point of, there are so many moving parts. I mean, we don't know. Our philosophy is we will \u2013 as I mentioned earlier, we'll do the appropriate tax planning and other planning that we have to do. But we do it every day, right? There's rules around the world. We have to react to the rules and regulations and laws and manage our business accordingly, and that's what we'll do. When and if or when we see whatever comes out here \u2013 it's just too early to tell what the specifics are. So, we'll stay tuned and obviously, let you know as we move ahead. But we're prepared to manage through that, just like we do at other places.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","Great. Thanks for the color.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Ashik Kurian with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ashik Kurian - Jefferies International Ltd.","Hi. Thanks for taking my...","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Hello, Ashik.","Ashik Kurian - Jefferies International Ltd.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just have one left. And how to think about your volume and market share development factored into your 2020 plan. Because if you look back, you have strong track record of driving mix and net neutral price have come during a period of very limited volume growth. Even in 2016, you flagged declining sales in less-than-17-inch segment. And given that it's still around 60% of your portfolio, I've struggled to think of volume growth and continued price\/mix that you have in your 2020 plan as mutually exclusive, so interested to get your thoughts on how we see your volumes developing from here.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Ashik, I think it's actually a very good question and I'll say first time, second time, third time, our focus is on those 20 million HVA 17-inch and larger-rim diameter tires because that's where the profit pool of the industry is. That's where our growth is ultimately going to be. Just as we have in the past, we will also manage those parts of the market where we're not able to get paid for the value we put into those products, whether that's competitive environments, whether it's demand decreasing. Whatever that might be, we will take the decisions accordingly.","But our goal is not \u2013 to simply not focus on, as you said, that part of the market as well. We have a lot of profitable and attractive fitments in that part of the market, let's say, 16-inch-and-below. And remember, while we don't put it in that number, I just came back, as an example, from one of the capital investments we're making in India, and the 16-inch market there is a fantastic market for us. Certain countries in Latin America, it's still a fantastic market for us. In fact, we're growing our volumes in that in certain markets in Latin America. So, I think it is something that we will manage, but we will manage it relative to hitting our profit goals, and we will certainly preference those tires that are being sold where the profit pool is growing. So, it's something we will manage, but I would say we don't really \u2013 there's no difference from what we said in September to that question.","Ashik Kurian - Jefferies International Ltd.","Just to follow up, if I can, is it fair to summarize that in your 2020 bridge, maybe volume is probably the least fixed of the buckets?","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","That's a difficult one to say because there can be volatility in a number of those buckets, raw material being one of them as we're going through here.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","But I understand your question. I think what I can say about that bucket is we will stick to our philosophy of not pursuing volume for volume's sake, but to drive, as I candidly, not to be repetitive \u2013 as our strategy roadmap says, our goal is sustainable revenue and profit growth. That's what we have to do, and that's the context in which we'll make those decisions.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","And as we look at that, we know the market needs the greater-than-17-inch tires especially in the mature markets. A lot of that volume is about us also making those 20 million more tires, a lot in our control in that sense and timing. And our overall philosophy, as Rich always says, is just it's not volume for volume's sake; it is about profitable growth. And that's what we see that greater-than-17-inch market primarily giving us in that bucket for that 2020 walk.","Ashik Kurian - Jefferies International Ltd.","Thank you.","Richard J.

Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Hello, Paul.","Paul Kratz - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Hi. Good morning. I just had a quick question. I think on what you said in the OTR markets that you kind of see the development this year being a bit flattish, maybe a bit in the weak end. And I think it's interesting because this is in contrast with a lot of the competitors who have been pushing I think a relatively bullish view of the market. I mean, could you maybe give us an idea directionally where you see the OTR market and maybe if you could confirm, is this primarily mining that's driving this weakness in the OTR business for you guys or is it something else that maybe I'm not picking up on?","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Right. So, I'll answer your last question first. Mining is driving that weakness, certainly. We would love for the OTR business to rebound. But we do see inventories out there. They're not any higher than they were. They're a little lower, but people are also buying a few tires here and there, just smaller tires. So, I think to your point, if mining picks up, that is about the larger tires, the mix comes back, and so on. Now, for us, we certainly are about $100 million off our peak earnings in that OTR business but again, not building in a big rebound certainly for 2017 in that market at all. Now, again, we do \u2013 likely between now and 2020, there should be a rebound at some point or better than what it's been performing, but it's not the way we see it certainly for 2017.","Paul Kratz - Joh.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] ","Thank you. I would now like to hand the program over to Christina Zamarro, Goodyear's Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Christina Zamarro","Thank you, Keith, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our conference call this morning. Joining me today are Rich Kramer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Laura Thompson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","The supporting slide presentation for today\u2019s call can be found on our website at investor.goodyear.com and a replay of this call will be available later today. Replay instructions were included in our earnings release issued earlier this morning.","If I could now draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2, I would like to remind participants on today's call that our presentation includes some forward-looking statements about Goodyear's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments today. The most significant factors that could affect future results are outlined in Goodyear's filings with the SEC and in our earnings release.

The non-GAAP financial measures discussed on the call are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent as part of the appendix to the slide presentation.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rich.","Richard Kramer","Thank you, Christina, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. This morning, I will review our fourth quarter and full year highlights and then ask Laura to walk us through the fourth quarter results. Then I\u2019ll come back to discuss each of our business units and lay out our 2018 plan and our longer-term targets.","Laura will finish with a detailed review of our financial targets and our capital allocation plan before opening the call for your questions. ","Our fourth-quarter results were highlighted by strong volume recovery in consumer replacement in the U.S. and EMEA. We were particularly pleased with our performance in 17-inch-and-greater rim size segment where we grew almost double the rate of the market. ","These results reflect the power of the Goodyear brand across all our regions. Our fourth quarter segment operating income was $419 million, which was strengthened by this volume performance. In addition, our runrate improved significantly during the fourth quarter with consumer tire margins increasing 250 basis points sequentially from the third quarter. ","Two of our three business units showed year-over-year growth in segment operating income despite continuing significant raw material headwinds. Moreover, our Asia-Pacific business unit saw all-time records in both volume and segment operating income in the quarter driven by our continuing strength in China. ","On a full year basis, we delivered more than $1.5 billion in segment operating income and cash flow from operating activities of $1.2 billion. ","Looking ahead, I continue to be optimistic about the opportunities for growth in our markets. Our strategy is designed to take advantage of the long-term trends shaping our industry, particularly in the larger rim size segments of the market, which we define as greater than or equal to 17-inches.","This segment is growing in multiple to the total industry. Our strategy and our strengths focus on the increasing profit pool in that part of the market that is simultaneously growing and mixing up. This is where Goodyear can add value with our technology, our brand, our align retail and distribution network and all the capabilities that we bring to bear for the market. ","The combination of these elements drives value for our customers and consumers and is where Goodyear continues to demonstrate its competitive advantage. We have executed against that strategy and we have positioned the company in the right way and for the long-term. ","Over time, we have reshaped our business and we have rebuilt momentum in challenging environments. The future will be no different and my confidence remains undeterred. We feel very positive about the progress in our business during the fourth quarter and we remain confident in our ability to build on that momentum in the year ahead. ","Our strategy is clear and unwavering and despite challenges in our markets in 2017 including raw material costs, we believe we are positioned to generate significant increases in segment operating income and cash flow over the long-term. ","Now with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Laura to walk through the fourth quarter results.","Laura Thompson ","Thank you, Rich, and good morning everyone. Turning to the income statement on Slide 4, our fourth quarter unit volume was up 2% year-over-year. Strong growth and consumer replacement driven by the U.S. and EMEA more than offset a 1% decline at OE. Our fourth quarter sales of $4.1 billion were up 9% driven by a 5% improvement in price mix and the benefit of increased volume. Our gross margin was 24% and segment operating margin was 10%. ","Our fourth quarter earnings per share on a diluted basis was a net loss of $0.39. Our results were influenced by certain significant items including a one-time non-cash charge that was driven by the revaluation of our existing U.S. deferred tax assets to the new lower tax rate. After adjustments, our earnings per share was $0.99.","The step chart on Slide 5 walks fourth quarter 2016 segment operating income to fourth quarter 2017. The positive impact of higher volume was $19 million and unfavorable overhead absorption was $33 million. Increased raw material cost of $194 million more than offset improved price mix of $115 million for a net $79 million negative impact. Net cost saving actions were $20 million and foreign currency translation was a tailwind of $13 million. ","Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 6, cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $1 billion. Net debt was nearly $900 million lower than the third quarter. Our global pension unfunded liability at the end of the year was $656 million, down slightly from the prior year. ","Free cash flow is shown on Slide 7. For the quarter, we generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow, driven by a $950 million benefit in working capital. Cash flow from operating activities was $1.3 billion in the quarter and about $1.2 billion for the full year 2017. The strong cash generation during the quarter supported the repurchase of $195 million of our common stock during the fourth quarter or 6.3 million shares. ","Turning to Slide 8, in the fourth quarter, Americas reported segment operating income of $209 million or approximately 10% to sales reflecting an $86 million decrease from 2016. The impact of increased volume and positive price mix was more than offset by higher raw material cost and unabsorbed overhead resulting from third quarter production adjustments. ","Unit sales in the fourth quarter were 19.5 million tires, up 4% versus 2016. Our consumer replacement volume was up 5% driven by improved sell-out and strong performance in the 17-inch-and-greater rim size segment, which was up 17% in the U.S. I\u2019ll note that we saw growth in the U.S. and all major replacement channels including some restocking in the wholesale channel. ","Consumer OE volume continue to be impacted by lower OEM production in the U.S. and was down 7% versus 2016. Our commercial replacement volume was up 5% and commercial OE unit volume was up 24% in the quarter. ","In Brazil, OE volume continued to show strong growth and was up more than 30% while we have not recovered back to the height of the market, Brazil\u2019s healthy volume improvements give us confidence as we look ahead. ","Turning to Slide 9, Europe, Middle East and Africa reported segment operating income of $93 million in the quarter which represents an increase of $12 million versus 2016. EMEA\u2019s increase in SOI was driven by improved price mix in the consumer replacement business, our continued focus on cost savings and a positive impact from foreign currency translations. These increases were partially offset by higher raw material cost and the impact of lower volume. ","Unit sales were $13.7 million in the fourth quarter, down 2% from prior year. The volume decline relates to the consumer OE business with unit volume down 14% driven by decreases in smaller size fitments. Replacement unit volume increased by 2% driven by our consumer business reflecting higher industry demand. ","EMEA\u2019s 17-inch-and-larger rim size tires outperformed the market in both the winter and summer segments resulting in positive mix. EMEA\u2019s commercial business grew volume overall in the quarter with commercial OE increasing volume by 8%. ","Turning to Slide 10, Asia Pacific delivered fourth quarter segment operating income of $117 million, a record quarter for the region. Asia Pacific's segment operating margin was strong at 19%. The year-over-year increase in earnings was driven by improved price mix and higher volume, which were partially offset by higher raw material costs.","Unit sales were $8.8 million in the fourth quarter and a record, up 5% from prior year. The increase was driven by the improvement in our consumer OE business where unit volume increased 11% driven by robust growth in China. Our consumer replacement business was up 1% driven by a strong winter sales season in the northern part of the region.","I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Rich. ","Richard Kramer","Great, thank you, Laura. Turning to Slide 11, we see our next phase of segment operating income growth coming from a balance of growth in unit volume with above market growth in the 17-inch-and-greater segment of the market and in net cost savings. We previously announced our 2018 target for segment operating income of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion reflecting a continuing recovery and a significant improvement over 2017.","By 2020, we expect our segment operating income to range between $2.0 billion and $2.4 billion. That level of earnings will enable us to deliver up to $2 billion in shareholder returns from 2018 through 2020. ","Let me take a moment to offer some context around our segment operating income range. As we see it today, our operating plan is balanced and fits at the midpoint of the $2.0 billion to $2.4 range. We have a very high degree of confidence in achieving the low-end of the range $2 billion in segment operating income given where we see the market trajectory today.","We will work to capitalize on all opportunities to capture upside to our plan. The mid to upper-end of our range reflects supportive external conditions including relatively healthy SAR levels in North America and Europe consistent with current industry forecast, continued market shift to large rim sizes, continued successful execution on key initiatives including utilizing our leading distribution technology innovation and brand capabilities to gain market share in 17-inch-and-larger-rim size tires and sustained cost reductions.","Our plan does not include a recovery from the price versus raw material dislocation that we saw in 2017, which equated to a headwind of about $400 million last year. Should markets improve, we will build these more favorable conditions into our range. Our plan also excludes discrete strategic initiatives such as the further footprint action which is consistent with how we presented our long-term objectives in the past. ","Stepping back and looking at the markets as a whole, industry growth continues to be an attractive story in the premium segment. The consumer replacement industry saw robust growth in larger rim diameter tire sizes in 2017. In the U.S. and EMEA markets, the full year growth in the 17-inch-and-larger segment was 7%. ","The trend towards larger more complex tires has been driven by OE. We will continue to target more profitable fitments that have high loyalty rates and pull through in the replacement market. Our 2018 fitment launches reflect that strategy. And as you would expect, these platforms depend on the performance characteristics of Goodyear\u2019s premium larger rim diameter tires.","With that as a backdrop, I\u2019d like to turn the discussion to address each of our business units, starting with the Americas on Slide 12. We expect moderate industry growth in the U.S. as many of the key economic indicators continued to be positive. ","Consumer confidence is the highest that\u2019s been in nearly two decades. Employment levels, miles driven and relatively low gasoline prices, all remain favorable and provide a productive platform for growth. ","We continue to expect strong demand in our replacement businesses, specifically in the larger rim sizes. While OE expectations in the U.S. market have moderated considerably, our OE selectivity strategy has continued to drive pull-through on first and second replacements. ","The unprecedented strength we have seen in the U.S. SAR over the recent past ensures a healthy first replacement cycle over the coming years. As first replacement cycle is typically around a three to four year mark, - excuse me \u2013 for a new vehicle, we expect several years of strong replacement demand. ","In 2017, our OE mix was about 65% light truck and SUV. Our share in OE over the past several years and share on the right fitments will drive pull-through and mix up opportunities. We are positioned to capitalize on the favorable trends in our industry through new product technology and innovative offerings. ","The recent launch of the Assurance WeatherReady in late 2017 was a tremendous success, in fact, our most successful premium tire launch ever. In 2018, we are launching many new exciting products including the Goodyear Assurance MaxLife and the Kelly Edge HP. The Assurance MaxLife includes technology to deliver more miles of all season traction and will offer one of the best tread wear warranties in the marketplace.","The Kelly Edge HP, a new light truck and SUV offering completes our refreshed Kelly Edge Power Line. Both lines are predominantly made up of 17-inch-or-greater sizes. The power of the Goodyear brand in the marketplace is strong. Our growth and trajectory have not changed and we are energized by the opportunities we see in our markets. ","In U.S. commercial truck, we are building on the positive momentum that began to take shape in the second half of 2017. We expect double-digit growth in our OE business driven by both recovery and organic growth in the Class 8 markets. ","In addition, we\u2019ve won multiple new national fleet accounts that will help support our OE and replacement growth in 2018 and beyond. Outside of the U.S., we expect both the consumer OE and replacement industry in Latin America to grow in the low single-digits in 2018. ","Our team in Brazil continues to focus on expanding its align dealer and distributor network and building capabilities to drive value in these \u2013 with these important customers. I am extremely pleased with our progress and we expect our volume in Latin America to outperform the consumer replacement market as the business has continued to build out its capabilities. ","As we look at our business today and in the future, our competitive advantage lies with our connected business model. This is the integration of multiple facets of our business that when combined, equal more than some of the parts. ","It includes our number one brand, our position and more importantly the right fitments with original equipment manufacturers, our outstanding industry-leading product portfolio, our unmatched align distribution including our company-owned and third-party retail and wholesale distribution and our leading interactive platform.","Together, these elements position us to win with customers and consumers. ","Now turning to Slide 13, our EMEA business has outperformed the market in growth in the larger rim sizes and achieved year-over-year segment operating income growth in the fourth quarter despite significant raw material headwinds. We are seeing margin improvement in growth in replacement volumes driven by our award-winning product offerings across the region.","In 2017, we took strategic actions to shift our resources and reduce our exposure to declining, less profitable market segments in EMEA. This included the closure of our Philippsburg, Germany facility in the third quarter. With this complete, we expect EMEA consumer replacement to drive unit volume growth and mix with above market performance in the larger rim size segments.","EMEA is in the middle innings of realigning its go to market model across the region to strengthen its value proposition. This initiative is about creating a sustainable competitive advantage through executing a connected business model to make the tire buying process easier for customers and consumers. ","Part of these changes included our recent implementation of a PAN European structure for pricing programs and promotions. We are also increasing our focus on sell-out and demand pool within consumers. ","Looking ahead, we will pilot new programs in key markets to drive even higher brand awareness and build out our ecommerce programs to capitalize on this rapidly growing channel. We will also look to invest in our distribution capabilities where appropriate over the coming years. ","In OE, we are increasing our presence on ultra high-performance fitments with our most discriminating OEM customers. Our competitive advantage in this market is our ability to design and manufacture outstanding products that are recognized through tire labeling and magazine test scores. That remains a strong foundation of our business. ","We expect over the long-term, EMEA\u2019s recalibration will strengthen and further differentiate our value proposition through our distribution and service network. We are looking forward to the continued execution of EMEA\u2019s strategic plan with a focus on returning the region to its historical margin performance. ","Turning to Asia Pacific on Slide 14, we continue to build on our capabilities to capitalize on the long-term growth trends in the region. In 2018, we see consumer replacement industry growth across the region in the mid-single-digit range driven by our key markets in China and India with outsized growth in the larger rim size segment. ","Asia Pacific continues to be an exciting growth region for Goodyear driven by an emerging middle-class with aspirations for car ownership and an evolving car parts. Both trends set the stage for significant growth potential in our consumer business in the region. We have continued to focus on expanding our retail network in points of distribution to drive growth, particularly in Tier-3 and Tier-4 cities in China and in India.","In 2018, our growth in retail distribution in these countries is expected to surpass 300 stores and we expect even more beyond that. We are also seeing the growing importance of ecommerce in China\u2019s auto aftermarket. In December, we announced a strategic partnership that makes Goodyear\u2019s products available on JD.com, one of the largest online retailers in China. ","Asia Pacific is also launching two important products this year with its introduction of the Assurance TripleMax 2 and the EMAX Comfort targeted towards the mid and premium segments of the market. These will also fuel our growth. ","Our CapEx in 2018 is weighted towards our growth markets in China and India. In India, we are focusing on increasing our capability to mix up to larger rim sizes and growing in the OE market. In China OE, we are also launching new premium fitments in the fast-growing EV segment where year-over-year sales grew 71% versus 2016. ","We are energized by our growth plans in Asia Pacific. Our plan is supported by investments in assets and capability for 2018 and beyond. We remain focused on our strategy and execution for each of our key markets to build the foundation for continued growth in the region. ","Turning to Slides 15 and 16, and looking beyond what we see over the next few years, we\u2019ve been more excited about the opportunities we see in the new mobility ecosystem. As you know, that environment includes everything from the increased comfort list and preference for ride sharing to the advancing EV and AV landscape and all the effects they are having on today\u2019s vehicles. ","I see these opportunities coming in three primary areas; first and foremost, an increase in miles driven, second, more demanding technical and performance requirements from OEs leading to differentiation and third, opportunities to leverage our existing fleet service business model with shared fleets for the future. ","First, I\u2019ll just underscore the point that more miles traveled means more tread rubber used. That\u2019s a good thing for tire demand and tire sales. Second, we found our sweet spot if you will with demanding but sophisticated customers who value the technology that we can bring to bear in the marketplace. These include the OEMs, major commercial fleets and even the airlines. ","The path to mix up in our business has been driven by these customers who increased performance requirements year-after-year and have their own product specialists and test engineers who understand the value that our products and services bring to their businesses. As the fleet market expands, our ability to deliver products that have a technological edge will, I would argue, allow us to increase our share in the marketplace. ","The third component driving growth with this trend is our commercial fleet solutions business. We are a trusted partner to several major fleets today and we expect to leverage our strength as the consumer fleet market develops. Our business, the tire industry and the entire transportation industry is in the process of being redefined. ","Those changes, while likely several years away, require that we put in place now the strategies, investments and capabilities to strive in that emerging new mobility ecosystem. That certainly won\u2019t be done at the expense of delivering near-term results. Our strategy is balanced to both deliver today and position us for success tomorrow. Mindful of this, we will make our decisions in that context. ","Now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Laura to finish up with the details of our outlook. Laura?","Laura Thompson","Thank you, Rich. On Slide 17, we\u2019ve shown our full year 2018 SOI drivers. Overall, we expect volume growth of about 3% for the year and an unabsorbed overhead tailwind of about $60 million. For the first quarter, we see volume about flat, driven by declines in OE in the U.S. and in EMEA, and a headwind in unabsorbed overhead.","We expect our 2018 raw material cost to be about flat based on current spot prices. Following the adjustments we made late last year, we expect year-over-year pricing headwinds in 2018. In total, we expect our net price mix versus raws to be a benefit of $25 million. ","For the first quarter, we see a net headwind of $105 million due to raw materials. We expect our cost saving actions to exceed inflation by about $130 million in 2018. We estimate foreign currency translation at current spot rates to be about a $15 million positive impact. ","The other line represents a combined headwind from increased advertising, R&D, depreciation, and incentive compensation. The outlook for these combined is about $90 million. In the first quarter, we see other as a headwind of $35 million. ","On Slide 18, we have listed other financial assumptions for 2018 and I\u2019ll comment on three of these items. We see working capital as a use of about $100 million, as start-up inventory at our new plant drives an increase for the year. We see our CapEx at approximately $1 billion and restructuring payments of $200 million in 2018 as a portion of the payments related to the Philippsburg closure rolled into early 2018. ","I\u2019d like to take a moment to comment on capacity and demand on Slide 19, where we have updated our outlook for global industry supply and demand for 17-inch-and-greater tires. Based on our analysis of all Tier-1 and Tier-2 capacity announcements, we see incremental demand exceeding new capacity in the Americas and significantly exceeding new capacity in EMEA through 2020. We continue to remain confident in the underlying supply\/demand dynamics in our regions. ","Turning to Slide 20, we\u2019ve shown the SOI walk from 2017 through 2020. That brings us to our target of $2 billion to $2.4 billion. We see a cumulative improvement from volume of $385 million over the period in gross margin and unabsorbed overhead. Our unit volume will be more weighted in the 17-inch-and-larger rim size tires and includes up to 20 million more of these sizes in our sales plan.","Our total volume includes a more conservative outlook on less than 17-inch units through 2020. The next category is the mix improvements from incremental volume in 17-inch-and-larger rim sizes. Our growth in mix is expected to be $150 million and includes the pricing headwind we expect in 2018. ","Looking ahead, in an environment where raw materials are increasing, our expectation is that we will also offset those headwinds with price. We continue to believe the headwinds we saw in 2017 are the results of a confluence of disruptive factors. We will continue to work on our cost structure through our operational excellence initiatives, and we expect about $375 million of cost savings above inflation.","Research and development, advertising and depreciation will be a combined headwind of about $250 million. Net-net, a balanced plan focused on growth and mix up, as well as net cost savings. ","I am going to turn to the capital allocation plan beginning on Slide 21. This is a slide that we\u2019ve used before to walk to the cash flow that we expect to maintain the business and to be able to allocate as part of our capital allocation plan. ","I won\u2019t walk you through the baskets on the left except to make a couple of points. First on taxes, given the impact of tax reform, we do not expect to pay cash taxes in the U.S. through 2025. For the 2018, through 2020 time period, we see our book tax rate between 20% and 25% and a 15% cash tax rate. ","Next, we\u2019ve set a good guideline for sustaining CapEx is around $750 million a year. Finally, we see a use of $100 million to $200 million in working capital over the next three years. Now that leaves us with $3 billion to $3.5 billion over the next three years that we can use to drive enterprise value. ","Turning to Slide 22, I\u2019ll walk you through the details of our capital allocation plan. Our prioritization continues to be investing in the business, first through growth CapEx and restructuring, maintaining a prudent capital structure that can support the business, and then returning the excess to shareholders.","We see growth CapEx at $700 million to $900 million over the three year period, which puts our annual total CapEx at about $1 billion. This level of spend, together with investments already underway, will support the growth in units needed to support our plan of $20 million more large rim size tires. ","Restructuring is about $400 million over the period. We have a strong track record of executing on our rationalization program to address our cost structure. Over the last five years, we have achieved about a two year payback on these programs. ","Debt repayment and pension are $400 million to $600 million over the period. We remained committed to achieving an investment-grade balance sheet over time. We believe we have significant underlying EBIT leverage in our business that together with this level of debt and pension reduction will drive us towards that goal.","And finally, on shareholder returns, we continue to target a relevant dividend yield of about 2%. Any remaining cash in the shareholder return basket will be allocated through share repurchases. We\u2019ve included our view of major drivers and risk to our plan on Slide 23. Our plan does not contemplate a recession in our key markets, the timing of raw material increases can also impact our plan as pricing tends to lag commodity cost increases. ","As Rich mentioned, the low-end of our framework for 2020 plan at $2 billion in SOI is where we have a high degree of confidence in our ability to deliver at least $500 million in additional income over the next few years. As we see it today, our operating plan is more balanced and fits at the midpoint of the $2 billion to $2.4 billion range and we will work to capitalize on all opportunities to capture upside to our plan. ","Now we will open the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Itay Michaeli with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Richard Kramer","Good morning, Itay.","Itay Michaeli","Good morning. How are you? ","Laura Thompson","Good morning. ","Richard Kramer","Good.","Itay Michaeli","So just a couple questions. Just first want to make sure I have the pricing guidance, right, for 2018. So, in that $25 million price mix over raws, can you just talk a little bit more about the mix versus the pricing assumption, as well as in the U.S. to just kind of what you think the price components and the mix components of that are?","Richard Kramer","Yes, Itay, we don\u2019t normally break out the price mix as such. But I think that, the comments to make are that, as we look at our pricing and we look at the adjustments that we made in Q4, that certainly ended up with positive volume and sort of a reestablishment of our core demand out in the marketplace. Our pricing coming into Q1 of 2018 is essentially back to the levels of Q1 of 2017. ","So, that\u2019s kind of what we see and I think, as Laura mentioned, as we look particularly coming into Q1, we still got $105 million of raw materials coming in, that\u2019s still about a 10% increase. So, we are still dealing with that and as we set for 2018, we are still going to be balancing off our price mix versus raw materials, thus the $25 million for the full year. ","I think we still feel very confident in terms of where the mix is going. As you can tell our confidence around 17-inch and above, and the growth rates that we have are still very good. So, 2018 will still be balancing off that price mix and raw material as we go.","Laura Thompson","Yes, and I guess, I would say, Itay, that, on the mix and as we\u2019ve shown in the fourth quarter and historically and our focus with our CapEx and our plans going forward, mix will be similar to what it\u2019s been running, up somewhat from that actually as we go through the year. ","I think, I mentioned it in my remarks earlier, don\u2019t forget though in the first quarter, we won\u2019t generally see any mix because of that first quarter of 2017 having such strong mix, because that\u2019s when we sold all the winter tires in Europe, right, as opposed to the fourth quarter of the previous year. So, just to help you with your modeling as you go. ","Itay Michaeli","Great. And then just maybe to that, Laura, what \u2013 can you just size up what the historical impact of just the mix components has been, just order of magnitude on SOI?","Laura Thompson","If you want o say, we just don\u2019t break it out. Our actual for last year was \u2013 you\u2019ll see as it comes out 80 some million dollars, right. Now, that\u2019s again driven by a lot of what happened last year in the price dislocation. But again you see us even more focused in our overall volumes on that greater-than-17-inch. So, take it from there.","Itay Michaeli","Perfect. Thanks. And then, just on Slide 8, the up 8% volume in U.S. consumer replacements, can you just talk a little bit more about the channels that drove that in the quarter as well as what were kind of inventory levels are and kind of how sustainable that could be as we get into 2018 obviously, it was a sharp recovery in the fourth quarter?","Richard Kramer","Yes, Itay, I think the 8% up clearly was a bit of a restocking in the distribution channel. So just remember, we said that our channels, our retail channels, our own company stores, our tire and service network retailers that are closer to the customer and their buy-in or their sell-in, it tends to reflect more of sell-out. That was actually in relatively good shape last year. Where we had an impact was in the distribution channel where you have a little bit going on betting on inventory, going long, going short depending where tire prices are. ","So what you saw in the fourth quarter was clearly a restocking of those tires in our distribution and I think reflective of the external demand for those tires from their customers as well, remember they are servicing, retailers aren\u2019t serviced directly by us. So that restocking is what you saw and that really was a restocking versus just the normal runrate. ","Having said that, we would say that, but, inventory levels for our products in those distributors still aren\u2019t and let\u2019s say historical levels. So there is still room to grow in there, but obviously that 8% growth was a restocking impact. ","Itay Michaeli","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful, Rich. Just a last question, back to Laura on free cash flow, I think in 2017, it did come down, at least a few $100 million. I know you are guiding for higher CapEx this year and some cash restructuring. Any other puts and takes to think about free cash flow in 2018 at a high level?","Laura Thompson","Yes, and so maybe \u2013 so, yes, you have the CapEx at about $1 billion. As if I had to directionally give it, there is a lot of good work that continues on working capital, restructuring CapEx \u2013 I am sorry, restructuring cash spend is about $200 million as we look out to 2018 and I guess, I\u2019d just say with all the puts and the take on an apples-to-apples basis, we expect free cash flow to be about double from what the actual is in 2016.","Itay Michaeli","Okay, double, that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks so much.","Richard Kramer","Thanks, Itay.","Operator","And we can take our next question from Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. ","Richard Kramer","Good morning, Rod.","Rod Lache","Good morning everybody. I had a couple questions. One is, if you can elaborate, the low-end of your SOI target of $2 billion, basically you had a big jump from 2017 to 2018 and then moderating growth. But you mentioned that that does not include a downturn. So, can you just elaborate a little bit on what that scenario incorporates?","Richard Kramer","The \u2013 Rod, the 2.0 scenario, you are saying?","Rod Lache","Correct.","Richard Kramer","Yes. So, listen, I think, what we try to do is put a range out of where we thought we could have a balanced plan going forward and I think, as we said, we think our operating plan is balanced at this point in time and as Laura indicated, we are about in the midpoint of the 2.0 to 2.4. ","So, I think, as we think about where we are, we have a lot \u2013 we have a high confidence level in that lower end of the range and, right, the mid to upper part of that, as I said in my remarks, reflects some positives \u2013 positive external, I\u2019d say, things happening in the marketplace right now, a healthy SAR, continuing mix up of the business, the cost reduction efforts that we have in there. ","So those are real \u2013 I would say things that give us confidence to move ahead of the low-end of the range. Having said that, as we think about what\u2019s not in there, which you could construe us to say these are things that we got to be mindful of is a recovery of price mix versus raw materials from what we didn\u2019t recover back in 2017 and we didn\u2019t build in any strategic things that we might do around capacity, which we normally don\u2019t build in there. ","So, again, I would say, we are confident at the low-end of the range and we see upside, but we are mindful again of those external forces, particularly around the price mix dislocation we saw. We can\u2019t predict that going forward and obviously, the SAR, really production last year of the OEMs had an impact on us. So we are mindful of those two things and maybe consider those at the low-end of the market, but obviously, our goal here is to put a more balanced plan forward. ","Laura Thompson","And Rod, maybe just on volume, maybe if it helps, right, so, at the midpoint, we said about a 2% CAGR on volume. If you think of modeling the low, you might make it more like a percent and a half or so. On the high-end you might say, approaching 3%. ","And then, just the mix within there, right, on the low-end and that\u2019s about 1.5%, we\u2019d say this in more pressure on the less-than-17-inch and whether it\u2019s OE volume, a little bit less than the greater-than-17-inch over that time period. Just to kind of give you order of magnitude, but those are the biggest really the drivers of the low to the high. ","Rod Lache","Okay, great. And on the capacity side, it looks like you are expecting a 9 million unit decline in the less-than-17-inch market, because you said, 11 million overall, but 20 million for the HVA portion of that. So, does the $400 million restructuring cash that you are budgeting basically, does that accommodate that decline in volume or would you need additional restructuring cash to accommodate that?","Laura Thompson","So, I think, - so first of all, there is a little \u2013 there is some excess in that bucket for things like that absolutely and if you kind of think of the timing of when you would actually make any cash payment, provided you made announcements even quickly, we just look at it as within our big strategic initiatives as Rich mentioned, aren\u2019t in there as we normally model. However, there is a little bit of room in that bucket and that might suffice, it depends on the timing of any proposed footprint action. ","Rod Lache","So, if you, just to be clear, you\u2019re targeting, sort of, $500 million to maybe $670 million per year of free cash flow, but, and that includes some additional for restructuring and maybe some additional needed, but you would see that as a source of upside?","Laura Thompson","Yes, yes, absolutely, yes. ","Rod Lache","Okay. And how \u2013 just broadly speaking, just given that, obviously you guys have very strong exposure to the 17-inch-and-greater market, but there obviously half the company is filled with is tied to the less-than-17-inch. ","How are you seeing the \u2013 just more broadly, the capacity being managed on the less-than-17-inch, do you think that that\u2019s going to be similarly balanced in terms of the supply and demand? Or is that just going to be a challenging market going forward?","Richard Kramer","Rod, I think, by definition and what we saw last year, it\u2019s going to be a challenging market going forward and particularly on, as we said, 16-inch rim size is our still very profitable in certain markets, particularly if you go down to 15, 14,13, very, very competitive as we look ahead and I think I\u2019d put it in the context of your earlier comment about the $11 million growth and what happens to the 17-inch or the below 17-inch, we are still committed and we have in our plan growing the 20 million $17-inch-and-above with share gain involved in that. ","As we look ahead, we\u2019ve reduced the outlook for the lower rim diameter tires and partly to your point, because, the profit pool for those tires given the price mix of raw material dislocation last year is nearly not as positive as it is, and as you know, our goal is really to have a plan where we are mixing up a plan that delivers shareholder value, a plan to sell tires where customers appreciate and pay for the innovation and technology that we bring, that\u2019s the larger rim diameter market and to your point, those lower tires are continually, be it capacity, be it price mix, raw situation is continuing \u2013 continually going to be a less profitable market and that\u2019s why we don\u2019t believe that\u2019s where the game is going to be played. ","Rod Lache","Okay, great. And just lastly, really quick, you said raw materials are flat, you have net price mix versus raws at $25 million. Can you just clarify, I missed, just in response to Itay\u2019s question, are you saying that the pricing in that assumption is kind of flat and this is just mix? ","Laura Thompson","Well, there is a headwind coming, right, into 2018 or here, in 2018 related to the adjustments we made in the fourth quarter, right. But net-net, right, we see ourselves at that $25 million net price mix versus raws, more just a first quarter of zero mix essentially, based on a really good first quarter of 2017 mix and winter tire sales. ","But again, we still expect strong mix as we move through the year especially and again, not expecting to recover any \u2013 and not build into the forecast recurring any of that price of raws dislocation from last year. ","Rod Lache","Right, so price down in the fourth quarter, you got the benefit from volume. You are expecting positive mix as an offset in 2018 and this essentially \u2013 it\u2019s mix then it\u2019s coming in.","Laura Thompson","Yes and the volume has not only a good impact in itself, but on overhead absorption with the guide of about $60 million positive for the year. ","Rod Lache","Okay, thank you. ","Laura Thompson","You are welcome. ","Richard Kramer","Thanks, Rod. ","Operator","And we can take our next question from David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ","David Tamberrino ","Great, thank you. ","Richard Kramer","Good morning, David.","Laura Thompson","Good morning.","David Tamberrino ","Good morning. So, on the SOI guide and walk for Slide 20, just want to make sure I understand where this is being allocated? I think in Detroit, you spoke to another $50 million to $75 million of pension benefits annually going into your SOI, up from below the line. What bucket are you putting that in?","Laura Thompson","It seems like following it here. So, okay, so, let\u2019s see, price \u2013 we are going \u2013 so, price mix versus raws of $150 million. So I\u2019ll just make a jump following your question. ","David Tamberrino ","Yes, I mean, so for 2018 guidance, I believe there is a favorable $50 million to $75 million of pension benefit coming out moving below the line. I am trying to understand where that goes into the buckets from 2017 to 2020 SOIs?","Laura Thompson","Okay and I am sorry, I am not following, that was in cost, net cost save.","David Tamberrino ","I am asking you, there was $50 million to $75 million of pension that was taken out of SOI for your 2018 guide at the Detroit Auto Show.","Laura Thompson","Yes. ","David Tamberrino ","And I am just wondering if that\u2019s going to happen annually over the three year period to get to 2020 and which bucket?","Laura Thompson","Right, so that\u2019s the bucket that it\u2019s in on Slide 20, is in the net cost savings number of plus $375 million.","David Tamberrino ","Okay. And then, it\u2019s only, one-time, it doesn\u2019t happen for all three years?","Laura Thompson","Yes, exactly, once we move it into there, forever it\u2019s not in SOI. No adjustments going forward.","David Tamberrino ","Okay. And then, just secondly, in the appendix, you\u2019ve done a great job of showing as kind of your mix regionally for HVA tires both in replacement and OE, but looking at last year\u2019s deck and looking at this year\u2019s deck, it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s actually changed. So, I am wondering how concerned should we be that the mix upward isn\u2019t necessarily occurring within your volumes?","Laura Thompson","Really, it\u2019s just a \u2013 again, look at the fourth quarter, right, if you look back to the second and third quarter, that\u2019s really where the impact came and it wasn\u2019t driven by anything going on in the OE mix up in greater-than-17-inch or anything in the industry. ","It was just really driven by that dislocation as we work to get that up to $1 billion of raw materials forecasted in there. Okay? Now in the replacement column there, it is up 5% versus 2016, which is strong, right. And we see that continuing as we move, as you saw kind of in the capacity charge as well.","David Tamberrino ","Okay, but the overall didn\u2019t really change from 40%. Got it. And just lastly, Slide 19, really helpful putting this out there. What\u2019s the assumption in terms of competitiveness from these new plans? Do you assume that they are going to, call it, play nice within the market and not really underprice in order to gain share or are you expecting this all just going to be import substitution that\u2019s going in line with this growth \u2013 this nice HVA tire demand growth?","Richard Kramer","Yes, I think, excuse me, David. Sorry. I can\u2019t get rid of this cough. Look, I think that, as we add these new plants coming in, our view is that the \u2013 you\u2019ve heard me say before, just coming in and building a plant doesn\u2019t ultimately going to end up as having an impact to meet the needs of the demands that are out there. ","So the capacity is coming in, yes, it\u2019s more competitive, but at the high end of the market, what the OEMs need and then the ultimate ability to get those tires where they need to be through aligned distribution network and to be able to get the value to the consumers out there, it takes a lot more than just the capacity coming in. ","So, I see it \u2013 I see the plants coming in. I look at the level of imports that came in before it. I think that there is headwinds around that. Candidly, there is always been headwinds around that. They are closer to home right now, but at the end of the day, we got to win in the marketplace and what you are seeing is our technology, the 17-inch-and-above tires, you saw the demand come through in the fourth quarter. ","Yes, that was an adjustment to price, but what it also was pent-up demand in the marketplace for our tires in the replacement market as well as, our dealers out there wanting to stock those tires. So, it will come in. It will have an impact, particularly as the OE market flows down, but I don\u2019t think it deters us in terms of where we think we can \u2013 what we think we can do in the 2020 plan. It\u2019s not the primary concern; it\u2019s another element that we have to manage. ","David Tamberrino ","Understood. And just following up on the slide, is there any ability for you to kind of elaborate on what Tier-1 and Tier-2 manufacturers are that are included within your analysis?","Richard Kramer","I think, David, I\u2019d suggest, you maybe can go through with Christina, if you wanted to take a walk through, but I think the way you should think about is the way I think about it is, as if new capacity is coming online, the new capacity is going to have the capability to build large rim diameter tires. ","The question is then, what are those assets being used for and a lot of time those assets are being used for less-than -7-inch or for other reasons to keep the factories full. So, this question is, one that I\u2019d say, you can go through by manufacturer, but you have to assume the capabilities there, the question then is, how does that capability turn up in the marketplace. I think that\u2019s another nuance to the chart in my mind. ","David Tamberrino ","Understood. Totally fair. We\u2019ve done our analysis to a more compare and contrast research. Thank you for the time. ","Richard Kramer","Great, thanks, David.","Laura Thompson","Thanks, David. ","Operator","And we can go next to Ashik Kurian with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. ","Richard Kramer","Good morning, Ashik.","Ashik Kurian ","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just one on the balance sheet enhancement or capital allocation. So, I am guessing, you\u2019ve given any plans to delever from where you are. Just I want to know in what areas is this targeted. ","Is this maybe more aiming to increase your presence on the distribution side, I mean, I think part of the troubles that you had in 2017 probably had a lot to do with the fact that you are maybe at odds with part of the distribution to, is there any increased effort from your side to maybe increase your presence on the distribution side and is that where this $400 million to $600 million could be targeted at?","Laura Thompson","Okay, so maybe I\u2019ll start, Rich and then, you can jump in distribution if you\u2019d like. So, the balance sheet enhancements on the capital allocation plan on Slide 22, is a combination, it\u2019s not about necessarily investments like distribution, but it is primarily related to debt payment as well as pensions, okay. And we\u2019ve got a 0.4 to 0.6 there. ","One of the appendix slides would walk you through the pension over this time period is, maybe $100 million or so each year, but \u2013 I am sorry, for the three years, okay, about $100 million for the three years. And therefore, it leaves money for debt repayment and really the way we look at debt repayment because it still is very important to us to get to where we need to, to run the business. ","In terms of our balance sheet, we took steps to derisk the pension in the past. Feel good about where we stand and we \u2013 as you see in the 2020 plan, the underlying earnings leverage in the business is still there and it\u2019s significant and we are very confident in those earnings, and we think that paired with the debt repayment and pension funding that we\u2019ve got in this bucket, again will drive the improvement to our leverage over the next few years. That\u2019s how we think about that. ","Richard Kramer","Yes, and Ashik, relative to distribution, I would tell you, we\u2019ve been on a journey to form an aligned distribution network for a number of years, even going to back when I was in our North American business. We sort of rationalized distribution to make sure those parties out there are aligned with us and we\u2019ll continue to work on that as we go forward. But our distribution network have served us very well. ","We would tell you particularly in the U.S., it\u2019s the best distribution network in the industry and we are pleased with it. We did work through as we\u2019ve referenced and as you know, a dislocation of that peak raw material and how we reacted to that versus how the industry reacted, that\u2019s something that will work our way through. ","But, distribution is a key element of our strategy. It\u2019s been what\u2019s allowed us to drive the earnings that we\u2019ve had and we\u2019ve done that by focusing on making sure it as efficient as we can, particularly around servicing our interactive platform and our ecommerce sales and we\u2019ll continue to make sure that that happens. So, it\u2019s a journey, but, I wouldn\u2019t say there is any big announcement there at this point. ","Ashik Kurian ","And just one more question. You talked about the price adjustments you made at the end of the year and I presume, your price guidance for 2018 is a lot more conservative than, maybe what it is for, some of the peers. Just wondering, from your point of view, is there any reason now, based on where your pricing fits versus peers, as to why you should grow less than the market in \u2013 especially in the U.S.? Any reason why your market share could decline further in 2018?","Richard Kramer","No, Ashik, I wouldn\u2019t think so and I would say, going back, and I guess, roof is in the pudding for last year, my fundamental belief and our belief is it\u2019s our job to capture the value of everything we\u2019ve put into our brand in the marketplace through price and mix to offset raw materials. So, that premise has not left us. To say the obvious, we had a headwind and we saw that dislocation last year. ","But I still firmly believe that we will offset price and mix \u2013 we will offset raw materials with price and mix over time. So there is no less than when it be clear, no less sort of commitment on our part to do that going forward. And from a share perspective, I think, we have \u2013 we see more stability out there for us right now. ","You saw that in the fourth quarter and in our view, we see that we are very competitive and our plan particularly as we go out to 2020 is to grow share in the larger rim diameter tires as we move ahead. So, I would say \u2013 I would say, Ashik, that there is no reason that that ultimately should happen. We are focused on winning in those parts of the market where we think we can drive value for our customers and make the returns for our shareholders.","Ashik Kurian ","Just, last on the, I mean, how \u2013 have you done any analysis on finding out what you need to do on the pricing side to regain the large share that you had in 2017? I mean, your guidance is probably based on more in line with the market growth, but there must be an aspiration to regain some of the lost market share and what is that you think you need to do, both in terms of pricing and other actions to maybe get to that point?","Richard Kramer","So, Ashik, I would say, we think about the lost share is big volume loss. Remember, it\u2019s primarily in less-than-17-inch and it\u2019s primarily below those even 16-inch tires. So, in terms of the value of that, particularly given the price mix versus raw environment last year, I think the profit pool for that part of the market has diminished. ","So, as I look at that and as we think about our 2020 plan, I think we remain sort of steadfast and focusing on the part of the market where we can drive value which is in that 17-inch and above. I\u2019ve been through the notion of going after low-end unprofitable, or marginally profitable or variable cost profitable volume on the low-end and look, it feels good at the moment, the factory is a little bit more full. ","But it doesn\u2019t generates the returns on the investments that we are making. So, we will absolutely make the right trade-offs from managing our factories and managing our volume, but ultimately our plan is going to be focused on growing in those areas that have the growth and have the profit pools in them and that\u2019s what you see in our 2020 plan. It\u2019s a mix up plan. ","We are still on selling 20 million more of 17-inch-and-above. That gives us a share gain in that part to the market and as I said, that\u2019s where the profit pool is. That\u2019s where the customers value what we do. That\u2019s where Goodyear has competitive advantage and that\u2019s where we can create shareholder value and I think our ability to grow in that part of the market is demonstrated again in Q4 where you saw both in Europe and North America. ","I\u2019ll take a little bit of liberty, but we grew almost twice the market in 17-inch-and-above. So, that low-end of the market is something that we will manage, but it\u2019s not where the game is going to be played. ","Ashik Kurian ","Thank you.","Richard Kramer","Thanks, Ashik. Appreciated","Laura Thompson","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take today\u2019s final question from Emmanuel Rosner with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. ","Richard Kramer","Good morning, Immanuel","Emmanuel Rosner ","Good morning, everybody.","Laura Thompson","Good morning.","Emmanuel Rosner ","Good morning. So just three quick questions for me. The first one is, as I am looking into 2018, volume guidance about 3%, I am little bit surprised about the indication of flat in the first quarter, in light of the momentum you seem to have in the fourth quarter of 2017 and exiting the year. ","So, can you just go over again what sort of like drive this volume outlook in Q1? And how it sort of accelerates from there to get to 3% for the full year?","Richard Kramer","No, I think, Immanuel, good question and thanks for asking. I think if you look at it, if I just go through Q1, but if you look at our volume, you\u2019ll see that, we are not expecting a lot of volume in Q1, particularly because of continued weak OE. That\u2019s a little bit continuation coming out of Q4 and out of 2017 on a production basis and that will ramp up as we go throughout the year. ","And I think you\u2019ll find that\u2019s fairly consistent as you look at production schedules, particularly around light trucks and other new fitments coming out. If you were to adjust for that, we\u2019d see positive volume around our consumer replacement business as we go. ","So, I think that\u2019s how we think about volume in Q1. And I\u2019ll just very quickly, Laura and I touched on a couple of these, again, our price and the price mix if you will in Q1, essentially our pricing is back to Q1 2017 levels. ","And remember, we have our highest raw material quarter in Q1 as well. So our pricing sort of back, but our raw material is still high in Q1, that will level off over the balance of the year, where it becomes neutral for the full part of the year. And then mix, as Laura mentioned in Q1is a tough comp, because we had a stronger winter not in Q4 of 2016, but really in Q1 of 2017. ","So we saw really good mix in EMEA in Q1 of 2017. Think about that sort of repeating very good mix, just not getting better on a year-over-year basis. And then, as you look out to the full year, we do see our volume going up on that 3%, again, OE getting better, as well as our volumes in 17-inch-and above, we\u2019ll get the overhead recovery benefit of that throughout the balance of the year. ","Raw material headwind will dissipate. It will go down. Everything being equal at this point over the back of the year, and we\u2019ll sort of reverse the headwind as we look to the balance of the three quarters. And then on price mix, I think Laura talked to, driven by our 17-inch-and-above, but also we haven\u2019t recovered that price mix versus that raw material on a full year basis. So, that\u2019s how we kind of see Q1 rolling into the full year. ","Laura Thompson","Yes, and you know, Immanuel, just as you look back to 2017, and see the volume impact, right, it would lead you to say that second quarter and third quarter of 2018 in terms of percentage increases year-over-year are the strongest quarters that equal us out to that about 3% a year. ","Emmanuel Rosner ","Got it. Yes, and that\u2019s a good call. Thank you. And then, just trying to get a better grasp on the mix impact in 2018, I know, you\u2019ve spoken about it a lot during this call, it seems like that\u2019s basically the main driver of the positive net price mix versus raw in 2018. I know in your fourth quarter walk for the SOI, you show a pretty decent positive contribution from price mix. ","But at the same time, when I sort of like calculate the average selling price for your Americas tires, it seems to have been sort of down maybe $5 or so on a year-over-year basis. So, can you maybe just sort of talk about how to reconcile that? So I guess, from a modeling point of view, positive mix should that translate into higher average selling price?","Richard Kramer","Yes, I am \u2013 Immanuel, and maybe this is something we can do offline, but our revenue per tire was up, total company 5% and North America was up a similar level in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis. So, maybe that\u2019s something that we can reconcile. ","And I will tell you, we don\u2019t break out price mix. I\u2019ll just reiterate that our mix continues to be strong and will continue to be healthy as we go forward and as long as I\u2019ve been doing this, our plan has been around mixing up and we\u2019ve done a very good job and then I think we shared with you a chart, a number of \u2013 sort of detailing our mix impact, since, I think it was 2012. ","Laura, you can correct me if I am wrong. So mix is something that we\u2019ve done. It\u2019s been sort of a predicate of what we are doing and that will be consistent as we move forward. So I am not going to break out price and mix particularly as we go through this environment, but clearly mix is what our focus is. ","Emmanuel Rosner ","Got it. And then, very finally, on your 2020 updated targets, if I am not mistaking, it looks like compared to, I guess, the initial expectation, so pulling back, maybe on some of the gross investments, first of all, is that the case and second of all, does that have any impact on sort of your expected growth over the next few years and even beyond 2020?","Richard Kramer","Immanuel, Laura can jump in, but I will tell you, none of the investments \u2013 we haven\u2019t taken back any of the investments around our mix up strategy or 17-inch-and-above. So rest assured that\u2019s in there. What we have done, as I said is the lower-end profit pool is diminished, as you would expect and as we have a track record of doing, we\u2019ve gone back and revisited the investments that we were going to make and we\u2019ve taken decisions that we think are appropriate in terms of delivering the results and delivering the returns for shareholders.

Kramer - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President","Analysts","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Operator","Good morning, my name is Tony, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I'd now like to hand the program over to Tom Kaczynski, Goodyear's Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations.","Thomas Kaczynski","Thank you, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Goodyear's fourth quarter 2013 conference call. Joining me today are Rich Kramer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Laura Thompson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","On today's call, Rich and Laura will discuss our fourth quarter results, along with the outlook for 2014. However, before we get started, there are a few items I need to cover. To begin, the supporting slide presentation for today's call can be found on our website at investor.goodyear.com, and a replay of this call will be available later today. Replay instructions were included in our earnings release issued earlier this morning.","If I could now draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation includes some forward-looking statements about Goodyear's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments today. The most significant factors that could affect future results are outlined in Goodyear's filings with the SEC and in our earnings release.","The company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The financial results presented are on a GAAP basis and in some cases, a non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures discussed on the call are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent as part of the appendix to the slide presentation.","And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rich.","Richard J. Kramer","Great. Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Before we get started, I'd like to take a moment to welcome Laura Thompson to her first conference call as CFO. A few of you may know her from her role as Investor Relations Director about 12 years ago, and I'm sure some of you have had a chance to meet or talk with her over the past 2 months. Laura's made a seamless transition into the CFO role, and I have complete confidence in her ability to help us execute our strategic plan and keep us on our current path. So officially, welcome, Laura.","Now this morning, I'll provide a few highlights of the quarter and discuss some key actions we've taken already in 2014. Then I'll touch on highlights from our 4 businesses before turning the call over to Laura to review the financials in detail and review our outlook.","As you saw in our news release this morning, the fourth quarter was an outstanding conclusion to our record-setting year. Our segment operating income in the quarter was $419 million, up 54% from last year. For the full year, segment operating income was up 27% to $1.6 billion, exceeding our October guidance and the highest ever achieved in Goodyear's 115 years of existence.","It's also the third consecutive year we've delivered more than $1.2 billion in segment operating income, another first in our history. This outstanding performance contributed to free cash flow from operations that reached $1 billion for 2013.","Now as pleased as I am to report these results, I believe it's more important to view this as evidence of the soundness of our strategy, our ability to execute against that strategy and outstanding performance by our teams across the globe.","Slide 4 summarizes the progress we've made executing our strategy, resulting in steady segment operating income growth and positioning us well for that growth to continue. Our team has consistently met our goals, doing what we say we're going to do. Needless to say, I'm pleased and proud of the men and women of Goodyear for delivering this level of performance. And as I said many times, we're not measuring success by the quarter or the year, but by continued progress toward our destination of creating sustainable economic value. That theme has not and will not change.","If you look at our strategy roadmap on Slide 5, you'll see we've highlighted our pension challenges. In my 14 years at Goodyear, our legacy obligations has been a constant source of underlying volatility to the business. In 2008, we addressed our retiree medical obligation through the innovative VEBA structure. Now I'm very happy to report that within the past 3 weeks, we have fully funded our largest U.S. hourly pension plans. By doing so, we've paid off our biggest remaining pension obligation and successfully executed a plan that we previously discussed.","Today, the strength of our business is validated by how we met this responsibility. Rather than having the access to debt markets to fulfill our pension obligation, we funded the plans with cash. Our strong cash flow performance in 2013 and our ample liquidity enabled us to fully fund our U.S. hourly pension using 100% cash generated from operations.","In addition, this action drives long-term shareholder value and is consistent with the balanced capital allocation plan we unveiled in September. This is a major milestone in Goodyear's 115-year history. For more than a decade, we've been dealing with the volatility associated with legacy obligations. Even so, we've always maintained our commitment to meet these obligations. Now we're pleased to have fulfilled that responsibility.","This action marks the successful conclusion of a critical stage in our company's evolution over the past 10 years. Our turnaround efforts that spanned 2004 to 2007, we navigated the global economic downturn in 2008 and 2009 and we introduced and began implementing our strategy roadmap in 2010.","With our legacy obligations essentially behind us, we can devote 100% of our efforts to creating competitive advantage. This year, we're taking our next step toward creating sustainable value, achieving 10% to 15% annual segment operating income growth over each of the next 3 years, while generating significant free cash flow to execute our balanced capital allocation plan.","It was noted in our news release we're affirming the 2014 to 2016 financial targets we spelled out at our Investor Day in September, and Laura will have more to say on that in a few minutes.","During the fourth quarter, we saw industry volumes recover, but that recovery is mixed and not balanced globally. Our volumes grew 2%, in line with our guidance, and we saw volume growth in 3 of our 4 businesses. Latin America was negatively affected by a couple of unique situations. We faced some headwinds in Venezuela related to labor negotiations, as well as lower volumes in Brazil, as OEMs reduced production there.","Growth continues to be strong in our targeted market segments, and we are confident that our brands and our value proposition will allow us to capture this demand in all regions. Remember, we're not pursuing volume for volume's sake. Our team remains disciplined in our approach as we pursue profitable volume growth.","While we see signs indicating general economic recovery around the globe, we also remain vigilant with respect to the emerging markets and the related macroeconomic and currency concerns associated with these regions. As a global enterprise, we've successfully operated in these markets for generations. Our management teams have experienced and seasoned leaders. We are fully aware of how quickly these markets can grow and contract. And while we may face some near-term headwinds in these regions, we have always taken a long-term view.","We continue to hold our conviction that the emerging markets, particularly in Asia and Latin America, will lead global growth in the tire industry. Bumps along the way are to be expected but will not deter us nor change our view.","Overall, as a total company, we're confident in our ability to grow our volume profitably and expect about a 2% to 3% increase in volumes in 2014.","Now before commenting on our business units, I'll address what has been an ongoing matter, and that's the closure of our Amiens North factory in France. In January, we ended tire production at the factory, which will close during the first quarter, on terms largely in line with our expectations. As we stated previously, this closure and the subsequent exit from the EMEA Farm Tire business is expected to result in about $75 million in annualized savings. Again, Laura will provide more details on the timing of these savings in a few moments.","But getting back to our business units, there was evidence of continued business improvement in the fourth quarter, even though there was market and economic volatility. Our North America business continues to deliver excellent results and has built strong momentum as we move into 2014. North America's 2013 segment operating income was a $1 billion improvement over 2009's full year loss of $300 million. It's a remarkable accomplishment and a landmark achievement for Steve McClellan and his North American team.","We expect continued moderate economic growth in North America, as many of the key economic indicators are trending positive. Employment levels, miles driven and commercial fleet ton miles, just to name a few, are on the rise, which will provide the platform for OE and replacement industry growth.","I will note that the extreme cold weather in much of the U.S. will undoubtedly affect volumes for the first quarter as many retail locations had to close for several days. However, our dealers don't expect that full year volumes will be affected.","Even with the positive trends, we're not resting on our laurels. With the changes North America has made to its business model, we believe these results are more than sustainable. And as we enter this post-pension era, we are focused on continued earnings improvement on delighting customers and creating competitive advantage.","I'd like to make a few comments about our Annual North America Dealer Conference, which was held 2 weeks ago in Nashville. The event was one of our biggest ever, with the highest customer attendance in 10 years. One of the highlights of the meeting was the enthusiastic response to our newest consumer replacement product, the Assurance All-Season. This tire was introduced for the largest segment of the market, the commuter mid-tier segment, where we believe it will be a winner with both dealers and consumers.","Overall, the business meeting and the reaction we've heard since reflect the high level of confidence and commitment to the strategy for both our associates and our customers in North America.","The alignment between our team, our customers and our strategy was the best I've ever seen. It really exceeded my expectation. And we've always believed that if you want candid feedback about your business, listen to a customer. We heard overwhelmingly positive comments about our strategy and our commitment to helping our dealers build their businesses. We're clearly on the right path, and we expect our positive momentum to continue in 2014.","In EMEA, our business made solid improvements in the fourth quarter, ending on an up note with segment operating income over $100 million. Of course, we have work to do, but our profit improvement plan, adding to the Amiens closure, is beginning to deliver. Our disciplined approach to price, mix and cost drove our fourth quarter segment operating income improvement. Winter volumes in the fourth quarter started strong but lost steam as the weather in our key markets proved to be relatively mild.","Weather has been more severe in some regions of Europe this year, but at this point, it largely affects dealer sellout of existing inventories. Ideally, the late winter weather should bode well for the 2014 sell-in season. Even so, our optimism at this point must be tempered by dealer caution after several mild winters in a row.","We do feel good about our competitive position on our product portfolio heading into the summer selling season and are off to a good start in January. Our new tire lineup includes the Dunlop Street Response 2, adding to our established offerings of industry-best label grades. In addition to that, we expect to have an improved winter product portfolio in advance of the 2014 winter selling season.","EMEA volumes will benefit from the economic recovery in the Eurozone, and we expect to see industry consumer replacement volume growth of up to 5% in 2014. The team continues to make progress on our profit improvement plan in EMEA. This plan, you recall, is focused on increasing share in targeted market segments, on accelerating growth in emerging markets and driving productivity improvements in our operations, and we're seeing good progress in all 3. So with Amiens behind us and continued execution of the profit improvement plan ahead of us, we look to return EMEA to its historical margins by 2016.","In Latin America, we continue to work through challenges of a volatile political and economic environment, especially in Venezuela and Argentina. Currency fluctuations also remain a factor in the region.","In Venezuela, the confluence of severe inflation, currency devaluation risk, price controls and social unrest have increased the complexity of our ongoing labor negotiations. As a result, our production levels have been negatively affected. We're confident in our ability to navigate these challenges as we have in the past, but we expect the headwinds and volatility to continue during the first quarter. Still, and to be clear, the situation does not change our 2014 outlook for total company segment operating income increase of between 10% to 15%.","As we look ahead, our Latin America business continues the process of repositioning its products toward more profitable targeted market segments in replacement versus original equipment. As in other regions, we will continue with our selectivity strategy, and we're confident that any short-term disruption will lead to improved profitability.","And during the fourth quarter, the team launched 3 exciting new consumer replacement products: The Assurance tire, the Eagle Sport tire and the new Wrangler SUV tire, that were all enthusiastically received by our dealers in Brazil. We're competing in the right targeted market segments in this region, and we expect that the sales volumes for these new products will begin to ramp up in the first quarter. In addition to the new products we released, our Americana modernization investment is also on schedule to support our growth in these targeted market segments.","Our Asia-Pacific business continues to perform well and will benefit from solid growth in China and India. We continue to grow in China, where high-quality products from our factory in Pulandian are helping us gain share in targeted consumer market segments and grow our commercial truck tire business.","We're seeing solid returns from our CapEx investments in China, where our products are increasingly recognized as industry-leading. Our Goodyear S200 truck tire line, our EfficientGrip SUV tire and our Assurance TripleMax passenger car tire were each recently awarded Tire of the Year honors by leading magazines in China.","And looking ahead, we see depreciating currencies' continued weakness in the Australian economy and further reduced demand for OTR tires in the region. We're prepared to deal with these headwinds, taking the requisite mitigating actions to deliver on our stated plan.","I'm very pleased with the results of the fourth quarter and believe our 2013 performance should give you confidence in the targets we set for 2014 and beyond. As we look at the past year, we can be proud of what we've accomplished and the changes we've made to make Goodyear a stronger, more competitively advantaged company.","We achieved record segment operating income of $1.6 billion. We generated free cash flow of $1 billion. We fully funded our major U.S. pension plans, addressing this legacy obligation. We ended production at our high-cost facility in Amiens, France, and we initiated a balanced capital allocation plan, including a shareholder return program.","As a result, Goodyear today is a stronger company that continues making significant strides toward the destination of creating sustainable economic value by being first with customers, by being the leader in targeted market segments, by being the industry's innovation leader, and as a result, being a company that will be consistently profitable and cash flow positive throughout the economic cycles.","For many years, we ask you to have faith in our strategy and trust our ability to lead Goodyear to new levels of performance. We believe we've done that. We've built credibility with our customers and our investors by living up to our commitments. Now we're ready to embrace the opportunities ahead with an even greater degree of confidence and commitment.","Now I'll turn the call over to Laura.","Laura K. Thompson","Thank you, Rich, and good morning, everyone. It is a pleasure to be here in my new role, taking over for Darren Wells, who occupied this chair for more than 40 consecutive quarterly conference calls before becoming President of our Europe, Middle East and Africa region last December.","While I have had many roles at Goodyear, I have particularly enjoyed those where I have interacted with the investment community. I'm looking forward to working with all of you more in my new position.","I'm very proud of the many accomplishments we've achieved at Goodyear over the last several years, and I'm looking forward to continuing to execute on our strategy and achieving our target.","Today, I will cover our fourth quarter results, which conclude a record-setting year, and provide some specifics regarding our outlook for 2014. We'll then open the call for your questions.","Let's turn to Slide 11 and review a few key items on the fourth quarter income statement. Volume in the quarter was up 2%, with the North America, EMEA and Asia business units showing increases year-over-year. The growth we achieved was the right volume growth, that is, focused in the right segments and generating good returns. This marks the third consecutive quarter of volume growth for the company and supports our belief that volumes have stabilized and have begun to recover.","For the quarter, revenue was down 5% or $254 million and is more than accounted for by 2 items. First, lower non-tire-related sales of $178 million, which is driven primarily by lower third-party chemical sales, which decline as raw material prices decline. And second, the impact from unfavorable foreign currency exchange of $102 million.","We generated gross margin of 23%, an improvement of 430 basis points versus the prior year. Selling, administrative and general expense increased by $29 million, reflecting an increase in advertising and marketing expense and higher incentive compensation. We achieved $419 million in segment operating income or 8.7% in SOI margin, up from 5.4% in the fourth quarter of 2012.","Our earnings per share on a diluted basis for the quarter was $0.84. Our results were impacted by certain significant items. And after allowing for those items, our adjusted earnings per share was $0.74. A summary of those significant items can be found in the appendix of today's presentation on Slide 24.","The step chart on Slide 12 walks fourth quarter 2012 segment operating income to fourth quarter 2013 segment operating income. Lower raw material cost of $172 million more than offset reduced price mix of $74 million for a net benefit of $98 million. Strong cost savings for the quarter of $114 million more than offset the $77 million negative impact of inflation.","Higher sales volumes improved operating income by $11 million, while the improvement in unabsorbed overhead from producing almost 3 million more units was a benefit of $55 million. Overall, we feel very good about the quality of our earnings in the quarter.","Turning to the balance sheet information on Slide 13. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year were $3 billion, up from $2.3 billion at the end of 2012. However, post year end and not reflected on this slide, we utilized $1.15 billion to fully fund the hourly U.S. pension plans.","Net debt totaled $3.3 billion, an increase of $448 million compared with a year ago. You may recall we fully funded our frozen U.S. salary pension plans in the first quarter of 2013 by issuing $900 million of debt. That debt increase was reduced by more than $400 million of cash generated by the business.","Free cash flow from operations is shown on Slide 14. During 2013, we generated more than $1 billion of free cash flow from operations. This is an improvement of over 40% from the $701 million generated in 2012. In addition to the benefit from higher earnings, working capital was a benefit of $415 million, driven by successfully managing our working capital throughout the year.","Moving now to the business units on Slide 15. I will start with North America. North America reported fourth quarter record segment operating income of $199 million or 9.3% to sales. This is an increase of more than 70% and shows the strong momentum the North American team has built.","North America unit volumes were up 2.6% with growth in both the consumer and commercial businesses. Our overall volume growth was predominantly driven by demand for our industry-leading Goodyear-branded tires. The fourth quarter reflects our highest sales volume in the last 8 quarters.","North America realized a raw material cost benefit of $106 million in the period. While our mix remained positive, price mix taken together was lower by $61 million, partially attributable to raw material pass-through agreements with OE, fleet and OTR customers. Similar to prior quarters, our manufacturing cost benefited from lower USW profit sharing of $13 million and lower pension expense.","North America's full year segment operating income totaled $691 million, the highest ever achieved in North America. The assiduous implementation of our key how-tos, including targeting profitable market segments, mixing up in products through market-back innovation and focusing on lowering our cost, helped delivered these record results. North America's full year 2013 segment operating income at almost 8% of sales results in a return on invested capital that generates significant and sustainable economic value.","Europe, Middle East and Africa delivered segment operating income of $101 million in the fourth quarter, a significant improvement over last year's $38 million. SOI margin increased to 6.2% from 2.4% in the prior year. The fourth quarter was the third consecutive quarter with year-over-year volume and earnings growth.","The European industry continue to show signs of slow but steady recovery with 2% growth for both consumer replacement and commercial replacement compared to the same quarter last year. Overall, market growth versus the prior year was below our expectations due to a mild winter in Europe.","In our consumer business, our sales volume was up year-over-year. Volume growth was driven by continued strength in summer tires where our success is based on industry-leading label grades and share gains in high-performance segments. This growth in summer tires more than offset the soft sales in the winter segment.","EMEA's performance in the fourth quarter also reflects continued success in commercial trucks, where we had volume growth in our fleet business. Based on our strong product and service proposition, we continue growing share in an expanding industry. Factory utilization increased versus a weak fourth quarter last year, leading to unabsorbed overhead improvements.","As a final point on EMEA, we continue to make progress on our profit improvement plan that we announced earlier in 2013 and as Rich just discussed.","Turning to our Latin America. Operating income was $52 million for the quarter, $9 million less than the prior year. Positive price mix and lower raw material cost were offset the negative effects of inflation, unfavorable foreign currency exchange and lower volume. Essentially all of our year-on-year decline in earnings can be explained by our investment in advertising and marketing to support the 3 recently launched consumer products in Brazil.","The lower volume in the quarter was attributable to 2 factors. First, labor negotiations with the union representing our associates in Venezuela occurred during the quarter. These negotiations continued today, and while there has not been a work stoppage, there has been a significant slowdown in productivity. The reduced production impacted product supply and accounted for more than half of our volume decline in Latin America.","These labor-related issues, if they were to continue through the end of the first quarter, could have a negative impact of up to $15 million to $20 million versus the fourth quarter results. In addition, consumer OE volume declined as the OEMs in Brazil reduced production.","Let's take another minute on Venezuela to emphasize a few points. First, while the current issues in Venezuela will certainly not make our task any easier, we do not see them limiting our ability to hit our 10% to 15% SOI growth target.","Second, in the event a devaluation would occur, for every 10% decline in the Venezuelan bolivar, there is a gross negative impact on our earnings of approximately $20 million. However, that is only part of the equation. The other part is that we have demonstrated numerous times and as recently as a year ago, the ability to offset this impact over time. We would work toward and expect a similar outcome if the currency devalued in 2014.","Third, we have an experienced team in Venezuela, and we're confident in their ability to work through these issues. And we remain committed to our business in Venezuela.","Our Asia-Pacific business reported segment operating income of $67 million for the fourth quarter, representing almost an 18% increase over the prior year. Positive price mix net of raw material cost, higher volume and lower startup expenses associated with our facility in China were offset partially by unfavorable foreign exchange and reduced profits in Australia.","The SOI margin in the region increased to 12.5%, up significantly from last year's 9.7%. In Asia-Pacific, our volume of 5.6 million units was 8% higher than a year ago as we continued to have strong growth in China and India.","Turning to Slide 16. I'd like to spend a few minutes covering in more depth the impact of the recent prefunding and freezing of our hourly U.S. pension plans. Our global unfunded pension at the end of 2013 was $1.9 billion. This result reflected an improvement of $1.6 billion over the prior year, given contributions of $1.2 billion and about a $400 million benefit from rising discount rates. When adjusted for our $1.15 billion contribution in 2014, our unfunded obligation currently sits at about $700 million, which is primarily comprised of numerous international plans.","We expect total pension expense savings from prefunding and freezing the hourly U.S. plans of approximately $225 million over the next 3 years. This includes pension expense savings of $50 million in 2014.","Following the prefunding, we have no required cash contributions into our U.S. plans. The prefunding improves our cash flow by $175 million to $250 million in each of the next 3 years.","Our financial targets for 2014 to 2016 are listed on Slide 17, and they remain unchanged from our Investor Day presentation last September. These financial targets are: Annual 10% to 15% segment operating income growth per year through 2016 delivered through a balanced plan of unit volume growth and cost savings, annual positive free cash flow from operations and achieving an adjusted debt-to-EBITDAP ratio of 2.5x by the end of 2016.","The key segment operating income drivers for 2014 are listed on Slide 18. In line with our 2014 to 2016 targets, we see sales volumes growth of 2% to 3% for 2014 as recovery in EMEA and continued growth in North America, offset the impacts of macroeconomic and currency volatility in emerging markets, particularly in Latin America.","As you may recall, our quarterly sales volumes can fluctuate somewhat due to seasonality and macroeconomic conditions. That said, we expect increases in our tire production volumes will generate approximately $75 million to $100 million in benefits from lower unabsorbed overhead for the full year. We expect the first quarter benefit of increased production to be similar to what we delivered in the fourth quarter.","For 2014, we are assuming price mix and raw material cost changes will offset one another. We expect our cost savings initiative to fully offset the combined impact of general inflation, as well as our further investments in advertising, marketing and R&D.","Based on current spot rates, we expect a negative foreign currency exchange impact of approximately $50 million for the year, with most of that occurring in the first half. This $50 million is before any potential fee valuation in Venezuela.","We expect the benefits from decreasing startup expenses at our new state-of-the-art plant in China to be between $15 million to $20 million year-over-year. However, as we continue to make investments in HVA capacity, the increased cost related to the modernization of our plant in Brazil are expected to be $20 million to $25 million. If taken together, the combined impacts essentially offset each other in our 2014 outlook.","As we've mentioned earlier, we will close one of our plants in Amiens, France in the first quarter. This will generate approximately $40 million of savings in 2014. The annualized benefit of this closure and the related exit from the Farm Tire business in EMEA will be approximately $75 million.","Additional financial assumptions for 2014 are listed on Slide 19. For the year, we expect interest expense in the range of $430 million to $455 million. Our income tax outlook is to be at a 25% rate of international SOI, which is similar to the 23% we had for the full year of 2013.","There is one additional item regarding income tax that I would like to mention, and this relates to our valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets. Each quarter, we assess current profitability and whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize the existing deferred tax assets.","Profitable U.S. results and a forecast of continued profitability lead us to believe that we may be in a position to release all or a portion of the valuation allowance during the second half of 2014. If the valuation allowance is released in its entirety in 2014, the expected increase in annual tax expense for 2015 and beyond would be approximately $150 million per year, although we do not anticipate any U.S. cash taxes for at least 5 years and the significantly reduced rate for several years thereafter. The potential reversal of this allowance is further evidence that our business model in North America is sustainable.","Including the positive benefit on earnings of prefunding and freezing the hourly U.S. pension plans, we expect global pension expense of $150 million to $200 million in 2014. We also expect global pension contributions in 2014 to be $1.3 billion, including the recent $1.15 billion that we've put into the hourly U.S. plan. Given this substantial improvement in working capital in 2012 and 2013, we expect our working capital to be neither a significant source, nor a significant use of cash in 2014.","Our capital expenditures and depreciation amortization outlook are consistent with the detail we gave in our September Investor Day presentation. Our 2013 performance confirms that our strategy is working and gives us confidence in achieving our target.","Now we would be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Itay Michaeli calling from Citigroup.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a little bit more color, perhaps on the price mix outlook for 2014. Maybe if -- Laura, if it -- maybe talk about what you're see, both on the raw material side and assumptions for price mix. And then, what kind of selling margins should we be assuming on your global volume outlook for growth of 2% to 3%?","Laura K. Thompson","Okay, sure. So first of all, as we've -- you've seen from our results, we have demonstrated consistently the ability to manage price mix versus raw, whether raw materials are increasing or decreasing. We have a very disciplined strategy on pricing, and we price for the value proposition that we bring. The goal is to get paid for the value of our products, whether it's product performance, service, brand pool or technology. Over time, we still expect raw material prices to increase as global tire volumes increase. In fact, you've seen natural rubber quite low recently. But lately, butadiene has inched up and is up, I think, 10% since the beginning of the year. Nonetheless, at current spot rates, raw materials on an income statement basis for us for the first half of the year would be down by approximately 6%. And that would be -- directly impact parts of the business, and some of which are contractual obligations, that have these raw material indexes, OEs, OTRs and in our fleet business. But we remained focused on our very disciplined strategy on pricing for that value proposition. And certainly, all of this is taken into account as we stick to those 10% to 15% SOI target.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's very helpful. And then just 2 kind of cash flow balance sheet questions. I mean, it looks like with the pension funding being done with cash, that you may even be able to get to your 2.5x leverage target a bit sooner. I also noticed that in the cash slide, you no longer call out $1 billion of kind of minimum cash. Has anything changed there? And maybe talk about kind of as you delever the balance sheet over the next couple of years, what are the other uses of cash potentially as you get to that target?","Richard J. Kramer","Itay, it's a good question. I'm going to hand it over to Tom Kaczynski here to talk about that as well. Tom, why don't you go ahead and respond?","Thomas Kaczynski","Yes, Itay. I think the way to think about that is we still do require about $1 billion on the balance sheet to run the operations day to day. We had about $6 billion of liquidity at the end of the year, and then you obviously have to subtract the $1.1 billion that we put into the pension. So that really gets us back to historic liquidity levels. We've been running about $4.7 billion over the last 5 years. So that's the way to think about, I think, the day-to-day cash required.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Perfect. Just lastly, any guidance on cash restructuring in 2014? I think it was about $72 million last year.","Richard J. Kramer","Go ahead, Laura.","Laura K. Thompson","$200 million, I think, yes, for 2014, primarily related to that Amiens, France facility.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. Is there an actual number that you can guide to or...","Laura K. Thompson","Yes, I'm sorry. About $200 million.","Richard J. Kramer","And Itay, the way to think about it, we've been very pleased to see the progress we've made in Amiens. I can't understate that, I guess. The -- as we wrap that up in the actual cash flow timings, we'll continue to update you as we go. And over the long term, I would bring it back to the capital allocation plan we talked about in September. And we did -- as we think about the future, we also have money in our plan, if you will, set aside for future restructuring as well. I know that's not the particular question. But it's good to keep in mind as we think about other high-cost facilities around the globe, as we look to the future, we'll continue to be very disciplined in our approach to that as well.","Operator","And next, we'll move to Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a few clarifying things. The pension, $50 million savings was not listed on Slide 18. Is that baked into one of those numbers? Or is that something that's separate?","Laura K. Thompson","Actually, I think it's baked into the Slide 19. So see the $150 million to $200 million pension expense in 2014.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And that number, I mean, if your pension expense was $285 million, I mean, it seems like maybe that number might be more than a $50 million decline on a year-over-year basis. Am I missing something there or am I reading it wrong?","Laura K. Thompson","No, that's exactly right. Right now, we're saying $150 million $200 million for 2014 versus the $285 million. About half of it -- half of that reduction, or if you use the range $85 million to $135 million, about $50 million of that is for the pension prefunding of the hourly plan.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, all right. So that was in addition. The $50 million was only part of the savings?","Laura K. Thompson","That's right. The rest is the discount rate.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And I was wondering, just from a high level, volumes in certain markets like North America are running a little bit below what we would see from RMA or some of the broader industry sources. Is that something that is -- maybe some competitors becoming a little bit more aggressive in taking share? Or is that something that's harder for us to see, imports from China and things like that that you guys wouldn't really be affected by?","Richard J. Kramer","Yes. Rod, I think it's the trend that we've been seeing. And maybe I'll just say one thing before I talk to that specifically. As a broad comment, not just in North America but around the globe, we've seen volume increases, but we've seen the volume increases we're trying to get in the right segments with the right brands and generating the right returns. And as you know, you've been following us long enough, it's a C state [ph] change to where we were where sold a lot of tires in the past but at minimal profit and even losses, as you know. So we'll stick. We are sticking to that disciplined approach, and I think thing that's what you're seeing. If you look to North America in particular, what you saw, again, really driven by the third quarter was that that year-over-year change of the tariffs coming off. You saw a lot of low-end Asia tires, Chinese tires coming in. You still saw some of that in the fourth quarter. So as you look at the industry, the low end drove those gross volume numbers. But that said, as we look in the markets where we competed, as you know, that's not where we compete. I can tell you, I'm very, very pleased with the performance of the Goodyear brand, the performance of our new products, the demand for those new products and the profitability of them. So I don't have a general concern in terms of having the market go up in those parts of the -- those segments that really don't impact how we're driving the business. I will add that -- I mentioned in my remarks that we, at our dealer conference, released a new product, the Assurance All-Season, to round out the Assurance family of tires. The All-Season goes in the Commuter Touring mid-tier segment. It's a refresh for us. That's about 1\/3 of the total -- a little under 1\/3 of the total volume as you segment North America. That tire was really accepted extremely well from our dealers. We got great orders out of the box. The price point is great. So in addition to staying at the Assurance family of tires, the TripleTred, the ComforTred, the Eagle family, the high-end Wranglers that were out there, putting the All-Season in that, refreshing the Commuter Touring mid-tier is -- you can think of it as even expanding a little bit back into a part of the market, the high end of that market where we want to play. So I would say I feel pretty good about our volumes in North America. And we're going to grow, as Laura mentioned, the numbers. But I'm feeling pretty good where we are.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just 2 quick data points. Can you just give us what you would expect your global weighted average tax rate to look like if you were to experience that revaluation? And in the quarter, was there a -- you mentioned 3 million unit increase in production and obviously, the shipment increase was less. Was production and shipments more or less in line? Is it more of a comparison issue? Are you building kind of finished goods in advance of stronger demand expected ahead?","Richard J. Kramer","That'll happen more in Q1, Rod. I mean, Q4, there's a bit more balance, I would tell you. But in Q1, as you know, from a seasonality perspective, we build more than we ship there. So we built, year-over-year, about 3 million more units in Q4. That'll bring in the incremental unabsorbed overhead into Q1, the -- about -- run about $50 million of the $75 million to $100 million that Laura talked about. But in Q1, you will see us building more than we're selling. But that's not an anomaly. That's pretty much how the business runs, as you know.","Laura K. Thompson","Right. And then from your income tax rate, Rod, 25% for 2014 of the international SOI.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Right. But once you would go through that revaluation, what would be the global weighted average?","Laura K. Thompson","Yes. You know what, Rod, we have not gone out that far in our analysis. There'll be a lot of moving parts then. And as we get closer and closer to that, we'll let you know.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Would it be reasonable to expect something like 35% on the North America part?","Laura K. Thompson","Yes. Again, nothing related to 2014, and that may be in the ballpark. But again, we'll keep you up to speed as we go.","Operator","And next, we'll move to Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, on Slide 15, you may have said this. It's just that there was a lot of information here. Just on Asia Pacific, so your units were up, but your net sales were -- the revenue was down. Can you just kind of tell us how that works? Maybe it's an accounting thing. And then the other aspect is just a little bit more color on -- despite the fact that net sales were down, obviously, you had a pretty substantial margin improvement there, and I just wanted to get a little bit more detail on that.","Richard J. Kramer","Yes. Pat, on the first point, in Asia, our volume is driven largely by the growth we're seeing in China in general. I would say that drives our volume also. We saw growth in places like India and certain of the ASEAN countries in the quarter as well. Volume, obviously, we still have headwinds in Australia. But when you look at the volume numbers versus the sale numbers, it's basically the foreign exchange impact. I mean, you know the numbers. If you go look at what happened to the Indian currency, some of the ASEAN currencies, I think that basically explains it. There's not a whole lot going on -- not a whole -- excuse me, not a lot else going on other than that. And again, for us, Asia is a growth market. We're growing faster than the market in China. And we see good traction in some of the other countries as well. Australia is the headwind for us in the region. We've taken some restructuring actions there. I'm happy to say our share position is actually very good, but it's a tough market right now. And I think it will be in 2014 as well. And of course, we've seen the devaluation of the Aussie dollar as well.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just on the -- I mean, can you just go and -- go ahead and kind of give us a little bit more on the margin improvement, which was considerable?","Richard J. Kramer","Pat, I think if you look at what we're doing, number one, it's -- if you look at the walk, certainly, we did another disciplined job of managing price mix versus raw materials. But I would also tell you that we're focusing on our cost. We talked about it, the -- at the Investor Meeting in September, and you've heard me talk about it in the past. It's driving our operational excellence initiatives, particularly around things in the procurement area and material substitutions, as well as the initiatives we're taking in, the plans on conversion cost and a more efficient supply chain across the business. So as we're growing volume, we're growing in the targeted marketing segments, but we're also driving efficiencies in our business across the board. And you're seeing some of that come through in the margin as well.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And that commentary was, I mean, probably true everywhere. But the question was Asia specifically, right?","Laura K. Thompson","Sure. And for Asia, to get a little more specific, a lot of the same things Rich talked about, but positive price mix, net of raw material cost, the higher volume and then the lower startup expenses related to our new facility in China.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. One other one for me. I just noticed that your free cash flow language just changed a little bit from the -- what you've provided at the Analyst Day. I think there, you had said free cash flow positive, excluding pension and contributions. And here, you've referred specifically to just operating cash flow being positive. Just on an apples to -- I mean, I understand probably some of that has to do with impact of the refi, which takes pension contributions out of operating. But on an apples-to-apples basis, has sort of anything changed on the margin?","Laura K. Thompson","Yes, not at all, nothing has changed. And really, it is not about operating cash flow. For 2014 to 2016, as we described cash flow back in September at our Investor Day. Really, as we got to this conference call, just wanted to make sure it was clear what cash flow we were talking about. And right, it is and remains free cash flow from operations.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And just -- I'm being silly here. But free cash flow from operations, then as cash flow from operations minus CapEx?","Laura K. Thompson","Yes, pension is excluded from free cash flow. Rationalizations or restructuring charges and any asset sales, which are very small for us is regardless. And if you look at -- I think it's Page 14 in the deck. I think that'll walk you through it.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So it's that exact definition then?","Laura K. Thompson","That's exactly right. That's right.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Yes, that's helpful. The -- and then just my last one is, I know that you've talk about this a little bit, but in terms of capacity plans that you guys have, that your competitors have, now that you kind of have a read on volume of 2% to 3% for this year, how do you see this sort of utilization environment playing out for the industry and for yourselves just given that unit increase you're contemplating?","Richard J. Kramer","So Patrick, I would say, from a global -- from an industry perspective, I think what you're referring to is a lot of the capacity coming online, particularly what we might call HVA capacity. And similar to the view we had in the past, when we look at the growth of HVA tires, which is not a specific debt defined term amongst all the companies, but call it those higher-end bigger rim diameter, higher performance type tires, we continue to see that the growth in demand for those will exceed the capacity coming on in a macro basis. Now you might have points in time or locations where my comments don't fully come true, but by and large, we certainly still see demand being ahead of the supply of those tires. In particular, when we look at our plan, we think 2% to 3% volume growth, sort of that 3 million to 5 million unit growth per year, when we look at that, we're fairly comfortable in terms of meeting that demand, given that the existing HVA capacity we still have in our factories, particularly in Europe. We look at investments we've already made and having those come online, such as the Americana modernization as we look ahead to that coming in. In addition, the -- as I mentioned a bit earlier, the productivity coming from some of the operational excellence initiatives that we put in place. And finally, again, if we go back to the September Investor Day meeting, part of that use of cash we identified was growth capital initiatives that would be ultimately identified as adding capacity in the right places at the right times. So we feel like we're in good shape, certainly, to meet our plan and to grow in the places that we want to.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Emmanuel Rosner with CLSA.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Limited, Research Division","A few -- just a few points of clarification first on the SOI walk on your Slide 18. Just to be completely clear, we spoke about your pension expense going down potentially by $100 million or so at the midpoint, but it's not on the SOI slide. So is that something that would come incremental to your net cost savings that are neutral? Or is that a benefit that helps you get your neutral net cost savings?","Laura K. Thompson","You know what, Emmanuel, if you would go to the next chart, which is Slide 19 -- and we kind of put both the pension expense and the cash piece of that together. So for 2014, we would expect pension expense of between $150 million to $200 million. And again, that's versus the $285 million that we had in 2013.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Limited, Research Division","I appreciate that. But is that incorporated as part of your other bucket on Slide 18 of net cost savings being neutral? Or is that something that you could do net cost savings neutral, and then on top of that, you will get cost savings from the pension expense going down?","Laura K. Thompson","That's right. It is on top of that, on top of the cost savings, so in addition to the cost savings.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Okay, perfect. Now for more -- fundamentally, can you please comment on the environment you're seeing in the U.S. for replacement pricing? Obviously, in terms of your own fundamental operating performance, you're doing a great job at mitigating pricing pressure with raw materials. But just focusing nominally on the price, without the raw materials piece, have you seen some improvement in the pricing of tires the way it was suggested by the December CPI?","Richard J. Kramer","Emmanuel, I'll tell you what. How we look at the environment that we have to play in, number one, clearly, we look at -- I don't want to make it a raw materials discussion, but certainly look at the input cost that we have related to raw material. But for us, as we look at the market, we also really focus on the value proposition that we're bringing to the market, our brand pool [ph], the technology that we're bringing in our products, the product performance, the service levels, which are even more important and marketing support as well to make sure that our dealers are really competitive with the right products that they have in the marketplace. We'll continually and do periodically go back and look at that value proposition and adjust it to make sure that we're going to be competitive in the marketplace, and that's what we're doing. I would also point out that we've had a very disciplined approach to managing price and mix over many, many years now. And I would say, that's what you can expect us as -- from us as we go forward. Raw materials, as Laura mentioned earlier, we see them going a bit down in the near term. It's what you're seeing. We also see those other raw materials or other input costs going up. And I emphasize again that, over the long term, particularly as the industry recovers, our view is that raw materials are going to increase. And I think those are the sort of the data points I would give you in terms of how we think about price in the marketplace. Yes, we take into consideration what's happening, but we also look at the value we're bringing to the market as well in our long-term view. So that -- I think that's that color I'd give you.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Limited, Research Division","I appreciate that. And then just on the volume -- your volume assumptions for 2014, 2% to 3% growth. That's clearly in line with your sort of long-term plan. Now the long-term plan though, from memory, was obviously massively overweight in the emerging markets, and then only 1% in the developed market. When you look at what in the environment is right now, would that -- for 2014, would that be weighted somewhat differently in which maybe some more growth out of the developed markets as we sort of start this -- what seems to be a recovery and then maybe somewhat less from the emerging? So would it be the same overall, but maybe a bit more of it from the developed regions?","Richard J. Kramer","Emmanuel, I think it's actually an excellent question. And if I go back to the guidance we gave, you're exactly right. Over the long term, we see that the emerging markets are going to be the driver of the global tire industry going forward. But we also sort of gave the broad guidance over the periods to take into account what is an industry that has a lot of cyclicality and volatility to it. And I think we're experiencing some of that right now. So I think your point is correct. Long term, more emerging markets. Near term, as we look into 2014, the North America markets and the European markets, particularly the Western European markets, the recovery in Europe in particular are driving some of the growth that we see. We remain optimistic on the emerging markets, but I do think, as we look into '14, we'll see a little bit of an inversion of that. But again, I'll say it, that when we looked and we put our strategy forward and we put the goals out, particularly the 10% to 15% we said through the cycle, we wanted to deliver those right, those results -- excuse me, we will deliver those results in view of the volatility that we're going to see in the industry, and I think 2014 starts out with some of it already.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Limited, Research Division","I appreciate all this color. And then just a final one, really, for me. The -- would you care to comment about these news headlines this morning of Sumitomo saying that you're seeking to dissolve an alliance? I'm not fully familiar with what they're actually talking about, but is that something that we should be looking into?","Laura K. Thompson","Okay, sure. Let me go through that a little bit. And many of you who have followed us for a long time have seen our disclosures related to our relationship with Sumitomo. So we have a global alliance with Sumitomo Rubber Industries or SRI, and we've had that since 1999. Among other agreements, many other agreements, we own 75% and SRI owns 25% of 2 companies: Goodyear Dunlop Tires Europe and Goodyear Dunlop Tires North America. We have learned that SRI has engaged in anticompetitive conduct in violation of applicable antitrust laws. We concluded that warrants the dissolution of this global alliance. And on January 10 of this year, we began arbitration proceedings seeking the dissolution of that global alliance, damages and all the lease that goes along with it. We don't believe the dissolution will have any material adverse impact on our customers, our operations or our liquidity. But as you know, arbitration proceedings are to be kept confidential. So you'll see what I've said in a little more in our 10-K that comes out, but we really can't comment on anything more than that.","Richard J. Kramer","And I think that wraps up the call. As usual, we very much appreciate your attention today. Thank you.","Laura K. Thompson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at any time, and have a great day."],"9774":["Goodyear Tire & Rubber (NASDAQ:GT) Q4 2011 Earnings Call February 14, 2012  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Gregory A.

My name is Tina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Goodyear Fourth Quarter and Full Year Sales and Earnings Results conference call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Greg Fritz, Vice President of Investor Relations for the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company. Please go ahead, sir.","Gregory A. Fritz","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Goodyear's fourth quarter conference call. Joining me today are Rich Kramer, Chairman and CEO; and Darren Wells, Executive Vice President and CFO. Before we get started, there are a few items I would like to cover.","To begin, the webcast of this morning's discussion and the supporting slide presentation can be found on our website at investor.goodyear.com. Additionally, a replay of the call will be accessible later today. Replay instructions were included in our earnings release issued earlier this morning.","If I could now direct your attention to the Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Our discussion this morning may contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties, which can cause our actual results to differ materially, are outlined in Goodyear's filings with the SEC and in the earnings release. The company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","Turning now to the agenda on today's call. Rich will provide a business review, including perspective on our fourth quarter and full year results and how we are progressing toward our key strategic objectives. After Rich's remarks, Darren will discuss the financial results and outlook before opening the call to your questions. With that, I will now turn the call over to Rich.","Richard J. Kramer","Great. Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As we exit 2011 and head into 2012, I'm pleased with our progress, which has been consistent with the strategy we introduced in March of last year. Our progress in 2011, both financially and operationally, is frankly ahead of where we envisioned we would be as we started the year. However, as we look ahead to 2012, we already are experiencing more economic and internal headwinds than initially anticipated. Now that said, we remain on path toward 2013 target of $1.6 billion of segment operating income. ","As I said in our last quarter call, we're not running our company for one good quarter for one good year or for short-term performance. We understand our journey to our destination may not be in a straight line. Our strategy and our goals are based upon delivering results consistently over the long term and building the capabilities to do so. So again, I'm very pleased with our 2011 results, but I'm even more encouraged about the improvements made in executing our strategies, such as leading in innovation, winning in targeted market segments and in striving for operational excellence. I see these benefits in our business every day. More importantly, I see the opportunities relative to what remains to be accomplished. Now clearly, we must execute. But I believe in our team's ability to lead this industry in innovation, in marketing and in operational efficiency. ","In the fourth quarter, despite weak volumes, we saw branded share improvements and the continued trend of strong price\/mix, despite more than 30% raw material cost increases. The price\/mix improvements were offset by the results in our chemical business, the impact of the Thailand flood, startup costs related to our new factory in China and costs related to the transfer of products stemming from the closure of our Union City factory. Darren will elaborate on each of these and review the quarter's results in detail in a few moments. ","I'd like to take a few moments to discuss our full year results in the context of our overall strategy as we drive toward our 2013 targets. I will remind you that our strategy is designed to take advantage of the 7 Mega Trends we introduced in March that are driving the tire industry over the coming years. They're vitally important, as they guide our innovation, our product roadmaps and our CapEx deployment as we drive toward our destination. I'm pleased that we delivered record results in 2011 in both sales and segment operating income. Our $1.4 billion of full year segment operating income is nearly 50% more than 2010, and is more than 10% higher than our previous record. What is most gratifying, however, is that these results were achieved amidst an uncertain global economic climate. We view our performance as continued validation of the strategy roadmap we presented to you almost a year ago. Our market-backed approach, our commitment to innovation and focus on targeted market segments contributed significantly to our 2011 results. For the year, our price\/mix performance drove revenue per tire up 17% from a year ago. Our price\/mix strategy was critical to our ability to offset record high raw material costs, and the success of that strategy continued through the end of the year. 2011 was a step change in our ability to address the expected ongoing trend of raw material cost increases. Each of our 4 global businesses achieved its highest ever fourth quarter and full year sales total despite volume softness. This is evidence of the power the Goodyear brand and the clear value customers see in our products, including our EfficientGrip consumer tire in Europe, honored for its breakthrough fuel savings technology. The Eagle F1 Asymmetric 2 and the Assurance Fuel Max, named best tires of the year by leading auto magazines in China. The Assurance TripleTred All Season and ComforTred Touring, both named Consumer Digest's best buys in North America, and certainly the continued success of the Fuel Max tires in North America, with sales of more than 7 million tires since its introduction just 3 years ago. ","Now these and other great products enabled us to succeed in targeted market segments. In addition, our performance in price\/mix increased operational capability, and growth in branded share clearly position us as a much stronger company coming out of 2011 with momentum in our key strategies. Now one of these key strategies is returning North America tire to sustained profitability. In 2011, the business posted full year operating income of $276 million. It's the best full year performance since 2000. The results were achieved with continued improvement in price\/mix, which increased revenue per tire by almost 20%. ","Now as always, our focus remained on building our branded business with innovative products, and 2011 marked the sixth straight year of branded share growth in consumer tires. We're winning in our targeted market segments, supported by improved operations driving increased fill rates. Simply said, we're getting better at supplying the right tires at the right time at the right places, and our customers have noticed. ","Many have told me that we are the best supplier in the business. Now a few weeks ago, we hosted more than 1,500 Goodyear customers in our annual North America dealer conference. Our customers and business leaders said it was our best meeting ever, as dealers understood and embraced our strategy and our direction. They continue to be very enthusiastic about our product lineup and our services. Among the new innovative products we introduced to our North America dealers were an Assurance TripleTred for SUVs and CUVs, and the Eagle F1 Asymmetric all-season performance tire. Our best product line ever, combined with the significantly advantaged supply chain from the customer all the way back to the factory, is functioning as a competitive advantage in the North American industry. ","Now personally, I have never seen our customers more aligned with our objectives, more passionate about our products or more confident that they can grow their business with Goodyear. It's outside confirmation that our strategy is the right one and that it's working. ","Now another of our key strategies is continuing success in our Europe, Middle East and Africa business. We did that in 2011 as the region delivered segment operating income of $627 million, another record and almost double last year's total. Again, our high-value products continue to win in profitable targeted segments in the region. Despite a mild winter and an overall decrease in volume, EMEA increased its fourth quarter sales by 11% to a quarterly record of $1.9 billion on the strength of improved price\/mix and an increase in OE volume. Now relative to the overall fourth quarter volume decline, keep in mind that we also sold more than our historical volume of winter tires into the channel in the third quarter to restock dealers in anticipation of winter weather. ","And innovation continues to drive our business in EMEA as we are focused on differentiating our Goodyear and Dunlop products from the competition when tire labeling takes effect in Europe in late 2012. And while acknowledging the current economic uncertainty in Europe, our EMEA results are both evidence of progress and a source of optimism for the future. Now you may remember on our strategy roadmap that we list key how-tos which are areas where we must deliver in order to fulfill the strategy. One of them is what we refer to as enabling investments to improve flexibility and to drive profitable growth. Our progress here was illustrated by the changes we made to our global footprints in 2011. As you are aware, we shed high-cost capacity from the closure of our manufacturing facility in Union City, Tennessee, at the same time we are investing in our North American factories and we have invested in both Latin America and Asia to increase capacity in these high-growth regions. In Latin America, we have capacity expansions under way in our manufacturing plant in Chile and Brazil to deliver more high-value added consumer and commercial truck tires. In our new manufacturing plant in Pulandian, China will provide capacity to double the size of our business in this growing region, where our sales continue to substantially outperform the industry. This investment is part of our growth strategy of winning in China. ","These strategic actions were among the drivers of our progress in 2011, as we positioned our global footprint and capabilities to meet the growth and the market-backed demands of the industry going forward. ","Now having highlighted our successes in 2011, I'd like to identify some areas where I see opportunity for improvement. The overall Latin American economy continued to be very volatile with local inflation and currency having the largest impact. As I've said before, this is a normal state of affairs in the region. We've managed through it before and we'll continue to do so. Now even so, our challenge certainly is to return to historical levels of profitability in the market. We expect the uncertain climate to continue, particularly in Brazil, where the strength of the currency and consequent import increases will remain a structural challenge for indigenous manufacturers. Nonetheless, we will plan accordingly in order to execute our strategy. ","Another area of opportunity relates to cost. Some of the issues, product transition and manufacturing startup costs were transitory in nature. But the issue is not simply about onetime cost reduction. In a broader sense, we must deliver higher levels of efficiency and productivity over the long term. Now the good news is that this is really within our control. Going back to our strategy roadmap, another of our key how-tos was achieving operational excellence. This means driving efficient standardized processes across our business, including our supply chain and our manufacturing operations. Our work to standardize and integrate our business in this way has only begun. This is our solution to delivering better efficiency and more predictability, delivering the products our customers want when they want them with no wasted costs or effort. Now we've taken a further step in this journey by hiring Greg Smith as head of our Global Operations. As the operations leader for a complex global company known for its process efficiency, Greg has experience in maximizing productivity and brings first-hand expertise at leading change in this area. Greg's addition, along with the promotion of Steve McClellan as President of our North America business and Dan Smytka to run Goodyear Asia Pacific, round out what we believe is the best leadership team in the industry. The combination of deep tire industry knowledge with outside expertise will provide new perspectives and solutions to today's issues, as well as ways to meet tomorrow's challenges. We have seen glimpses of the results the team can deliver. But even more encouraging is the promise of the capabilities we believe it can build. Now before I conclude my remarks this morning, I'd like to call attention to one event during the fourth quarter that has made all of us proud. In October, devastating floods forced the temporary closure of our manufacturing plant in Thailand, disabling all production, but most critically, putting the supply of global aviation tires at risk. Since November, the response of Goodyear associates, global suppliers, governments, agencies and the commercial airline industry has been nothing short of remarkable. Goodyear associates from all over the world have been working around the clock to bring the plant back online as quickly as possible. Other aviation tire manufacturers have increased their output to ensure product supply. Makers of tire-building equipment have gone to great lengths to help the Thailand factory restore production, and commercial airlines around the world have been extremely cooperative as we worked through the temporary constraints. I would like to express my sincere thanks and gratitude to everyone who has worked together in this time of crisis. We have not yet fully recovered, but we have made tremendous progress and the situation has improved dramatically, thanks to the combined efforts of everyone involved. Again, thank you on behalf of everyone at Goodyear. ","As we head into 2012, we know that there are internal and external challenges ahead and work still to be done. But we have positive momentum and more confidence than ever that we can successfully execute our strategy and reach our destination by being first with customers, providing the best products and the best supply chain to help them grow their businesses by being the leader in our targeted market segments, with the right brands, channels and customers selling premium products in the segments where the potential margins are highest; by being the innovation leader, setting the pace for market-back innovation in our industry; and finally, by being competitively advantaged in everything we do, including our products, our marketing, supply chain and manufacturing. As a result, we will be profitable throughout all economic cycles, cash flow positives and we will return to investment grade. That's our destination. ","In March, we laid out our path to $1.6 billion of segment operating income in 2013. In doing so, we anticipate that the industry's normal ups and downs, and expect them to continue in 2012 and beyond. But we are building our business for the long term. Frankly, our full year results for 2011 were better than we expected. But remember, $1.4 billion of segment operating income in 2011 was not our target. Regardless of the results of one quarter or one year, we are committed to our long-term strategy. We are on a journey, and 2011 was a positive step on that journey, but just one step. 2012 is another step, one that will bring with it the uncertainty of a presidential election in the U.S., ongoing sovereign debt concerns in Europe and slower growth in China. The environment around us will constantly change, but we will not waver from our strategy, our targets or our ultimate destination. We feel very good about our business and are pleased with where we are on our path. So make no mistake. I'm very happy with our performance in 2011. Our results were a significant achievement. And even though I remain focused on areas we need to improve, I have never been more confident in our strategy, our team and our ability to reach our long-term destination. So thank you for your attention. And now, I'll turn the call over to Darren.","Darren R. Wells","Thanks, Rich, and good morning. I'm going to cover the fourth quarter results at a corporate level, give you some perspective on our year-end balance sheet and then spend some time on our business unit results and our outlook for 2012. ","While our results were not as strong as earlier in the year, given weaker industry volumes, our costs were also adversely impacted by previously discussed structural changes that we're making through our manufacturing footprint. These changes will support stronger earnings in 2013 and beyond. ","Turning to the income statement on Slide 7. Our fourth quarter revenue increased 12% to approximately $5.7 billion on a 4.6% reduction in volume. Revenue per tire increased 19% compared with the prior year. Lower replacement industry demand across mature markets was the main driver of our unit volume decline. Our OE demand remains solid across most regions, however, consumer OE demand in Asia was unfavorably impacted by Thailand flooding, which disrupted production during the fourth quarter. We generated gross margin of 15.3% in the quarter, representing a little over a 2-point decline compared to the prior year. Nearly the entire decline is the mathematical effect of increasing both cost of goods sold and sales by the higher raw material costs. Selling, administrative and general expense increased $9 million to $724 million during the quarter. As a percent of sales, SAG declined 140 basis points to 12.7% in the quarter. Excluding discrete items, our fourth quarter tax rate as a percentage of foreign segment operating income was about 26%. Our reported tax rate included a $60 million favorable impact, primarily from the release of a valuation allowance in Canada, which reflected our consistent improvement and profitability there. ","Fourth quarter after-tax results were impacted by certain significant items. A summary of these can be found in the appendix of today's presentation. ","Turning to the segment operating income step chart on Slide 8. You can see the progression of segment operating income compared to the prior year. As you see from the chart, we had several items that are transitory in nature. First, our other tire-related results were impacted by the sharp decline in earnings from our third-party chemical sales. This decline resulted from contractual price reductions to reflect the drop in view of butadiene prices during the quarter. Our third party chemical business more than explained the $19 million year-over-year reduction in other tire-related earnings during the quarter. We expect other tire-related earnings to return to more normalized levels as the butadiene prices have stabilized. The other unique items relate to the flooding in Thailand and the Latin America farm tire sale, which reduced our segment operating income by $12 million and $9 million, respectively. The first quarter of 2012 will mark the final quarter before we have a negative year-over-year impact from the sale of our Latin America farm tire business. These 3 factors combined to reduce our segment operating income by approximately $40 million, which more than accounted for the year-over-year decline in total segment operating income during the quarter. ","Turning to the other items. We continued to see good momentum from our price\/mix actions, which had a favorable impact of $702 million during the quarter and exceeded the $631 million in raw material cost increases. ","As we\u2019ve mentioned previously, the fourth quarter is the peak quarter for raw material cost increases in this cycle. Other positives included the lower unabsorbed fixed costs and lower pension expense. ","Turning to the unfavorable items, there are 2 I would like to highlight. First is the impact of lower sales volume. And second, as we've discussed previously, our cost savings results were reduced by higher profit sharing under our North America labor agreement, as well as cost inefficiencies in our North American factories as we closed our Union City facility and ramped up Union City products across our other factories. Additionally, in Europe, we incurred higher marketing-related expenses to support the sellout of winter tires and continued to experience corporate activity in our facilities in Amiens, France. ","While our cost savings were below where we'd like them to have been during the quarter, we have now generated cost savings of $748 million over the past 2 years, and remain on track to deliver a billion of savings for the 3-year period ending this year. Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 9, we show an overall reduction in our net debt balance of $2.4 billion during 2011. While our year-end working capital continued to decline as a percent of sales, we did see some working capital cash usage during the year as a result of raw material cost increases and a recovery of inventory to improve customer service levels. ","We ended the year with over $5.5 billion of cash and available credit compared with $4.8 billion at the end of 2010. Given this improvement, we feel very comfortable with our liquidity position heading into this year despite higher required pension contributions. ","Turning to Slide 10, you can see our debt maturity schedule. We ended the year with the no funded debt maturities prior to 2014, and no bond maturities until 2016. Our strong liquidity position, coupled with limited near term debt maturities, provides a strong foundation for the execution of our strategy. ","Turning to segment results. We see there are businesses in North America and Europe, Middle East and Africa continue to see improved earnings in Q4, and were the drivers behind 2011 full year results. Latin America and Asia earnings were weaker, each for different reasons after 3 years of providing earnings stability even through the recession. ","North America reported segment operating income of $21 million in the fourth quarter, which compares to operating income of $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. North America industry unit volumes were down, reflecting a generally weak consumer and commercial replacement industry, down 3% and 7%, respectively. However, OE industry continued to see strong sales gains with commercial demand increasing 47% and consumer up 17%. As we continue to focus on mixing up in products and channels and with customers, North America delivered a price\/mix improvement of $289 million, which more than offset $258 million of additional raw material costs. In addition, North American Q4 earnings continued to benefit from reductions in unobserved overhead of $15 million, lower pension expense, and consistent with Q3, North America's results benefited from a reduction in accruals for product and general liability as a result of favorable trends over the last several quarters. ","Cost improvements were offset by higher profit sharing, higher workers compensation expense and the costs related to Union City product transfers and ramp-up costs. To step back and put the Union City impact in perspective, in Q1, Q2 and Q3 last year, overall manufacturing costs in North America were favorable each quarter, about $50 million on average. In Q4, however, given the transition work, manufacturing costs were $40 million unfavorable versus 2010. This primarily reflects the disruption caused by the plant closure and the transfer of products during Q3, with a one quarter lag impact on results. As I mentioned earlier, the recent the drop into the butadiene prices rises created a $20 million unfavorable impact on North America's other tire-related operating income. Despite these impacts, the fourth quarter results in NAT bring our full year segment operating income to $276 million. This is beyond our expectation for 2011 and puts us well on the way toward our 2013 target of $450 million. ","Europe, Middle East and Africa reported segment operating income of $88 million in the quarter, which compares to $60 million in the 2010 period. Industry unit volume for consumer replacement was down 3.5% on mild winter weather which slowed retail demand. Consumer OE volumes were down about 3%, commercial replacement industry shipments declined 20% versus the prior year, impacted by dealers reducing inventory during the quarter. Truck OE volumes, up 17% where the one segment in Europe with improve year-over-year industry volumes. ","Our 2011 results reflect sales of $1.9 billion, an increase of 11% versus the prior year on a 5% decrease in unit volume. Revenue per tire, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, increased 21% year-over-year. EMEA sales growth versus prior year was driven by stronger price\/mix performance from announced pricing actions and stronger channel mix. These favorable factors were partially offset by weaker unit volume. In addition to a weak industry, our volumes were also impacted by an early winter sell-in into the channels in Q3. The weaker euro and other currencies versus a year ago negatively impacted sales for the quarter by $27 million. EMEA segment operating income increased $28 million versus this prior year, reflecting price\/mix of $280 million which more than offset $219 million of raw material cost increases. ","Segment operating income was negatively impacted by lower sales volume compared with a year ago. Higher third quarter capacity utilization in our factories favorably impacted segment operating income in Q4 by $16 million. Q4 results were down from a record Q3, primarily on lower volume after the early sell-in winter of tires in Q3, along with higher SAG to support retail sellout for the winter tires result of dealers in the third quarter. ","Overall, we're very pleased with the results for EMEA, with full year 2011 segment operating income nearly doubling to $627 million and setting a new record for the region. ","Revenues in Latin America increased 2% to $596 million during the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of the divested farm tire business, revenues increased about 6%. Revenue per tire increased 12% year-over-year. Latin America reported segment operating income of $48 million in the quarter compared to $93 million in the prior year. Latin America, and particularly Brazil, faced a dual pressure for increasing cost inflation and import competition in the low end of the market, impacting our volumes and our ability to recover raw material cost increases. During the fourth quarter, our price\/mix benefit was $66 million, compared to raw material cost inflation of $90 million. The sale of the farm tire business reduced income by $9 million. During the fourth quarter, the Brazilian real has weakened somewhat. If this trend were to continue, our cost competitiveness relative to imported products should improve, but it would not necessarily reverse competitive dynamics of now-entrenched import competition. Our team is working to shift our business to targeted market segments, while supporting our dealers and their need for tires across all price points. Goodyear's operations outside Brazil continue to deliver consistent results. We continue to make significant investments in our Latin American business and believe in its long-term potential. As Rich said, it's clear we have work to do to get this business back to its peak earnings levels. More on that as we progress through 2012. ","Our Asia Pacific business reported segment operating income of $39 million for the quarter. The $21 million decline versus prior year reflected mainly the October 20 closure of our Thailand factory, which resulted in $12 million of incremental expenses and lost profits in the quarter, and an incremental $10 million of startup expenses associated with the ramp-up of our new factory in Pulandian, China. In addition, softer market demand in China and the continued macroeconomic weakness in Australia contributed to volume weakness. Helping to mitigate some of these challenges was our OTR business, which continued to perform very well, given the growth of the mining sector in the region. Price\/mix improvements also continue to more than offset raw material cost increases in the quarter. Overall, we continue to be pleased with the opportunities we see in Asia, and particularly in China, going forward. Despite the relative softness we saw in Q4 and the short-term impact related to our Thailand operations. We also see opportunity in our business in Australia and New Zealand, as we focus the business on targeted segments and improve the efficiency of our supply chain in distribution channels. ","Just a couple more points on the outlook for our Thailand operations, we have begun restoration of our factory, and we'll restart production of aviation and consumer tires over the next few weeks, ramping up to full production during Q2. We expect to benefit from insurance proceeds, which would largely address our losses above our deductible. However, due to the lag timing of the insurance proceeds and our ramp-up schedule, we expect Thailand-related costs to impact the Asia's results adversely through the first half of 2012. Some of the insurance proceeds will be reflected later as the claim is resolved.","Turning to Slide 12, you can see our 2012 industry outlook for North America and Europe. For the year, we expect Europe to have lower demand in each major segment, with OE volumes seeing the most significant reduction on a percentage basis. This is largely driven by the macroeconomic outlook across the Eurozone which points to at least a mild recession. For North America, we see growth in each segment with the exception of consumer replacement, where we expect a slight decline in industry volume. ","On Slide 13, we provide some modeling assumptions for 2012. Based on our industry outlook globally, we would expect tire unit shipments to remain essentially flat with 2010 and 2011 levels. Assuming spot prices remain at current levels, we anticipate our raw material costs will increase by approximately 5% for the full year. For the first quarter, raw material costs are expected to increase by 20% to 25%, or $500 million, from the prior year. Based on our raw material outlook, previously announced pricing actions and raw material indexing agreements with certain customers, we expect price\/mix net of raw material costs to be positive in Q1 and about neutral in Q2. Over the long term, we expect raw material costs to increase as global tire demand grows. And if that happens later this year, we will again take actions to address these increases. We expect to see a favorable impact from overhead absorption in the range of $40 million to $60 million for 2012, largely driven by savings from our Union City facility closure. The Union City savings are being offset partially by lower expected production levels as we reduced production in Q4, and will also reduce Q1 to adjust the inventory to reflect lower industry demand costs. Offsetting these positive impacts are several items. First, while we expect to achieve our 3-year plan for $1 billion in cost savings, we are anticipating inflation in the range of about $70 million to $80 million per quarter during 2012. Second, assuming current spot prices for the euro and the Brazilian real, we would also experience an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translations. Finally, given the nature of our Pulandian, China's plant start-up, which entails taking our Dalian facility offline in 2012, while simultaneously ramping up the Pulandian facility, we expect to incur an additional $40 million to $60 million of start-up costs during the year compared to 2011. ","Turning to Slide 14, we highlight some of our other key assumptions for 2012. We expect interest expense in the range of $360 million to $385 million. Our tax rate assumption is unchanged to 25% of international segment operating income. Looking at global pension expense, we expect a range of $275 million to $325 million for the year, with funding in the range of $550 million to $600 million. The higher expense is largely due to the lower assumed discount rate of 4.52% compared with 5.2% previously, and the impact of 2011 asset returns, which were just under 1%. ","Turning to some cash flow items. We are projecting working capital will be neither a source nor a use of cash in 2012. Our capital expenditure outlook remains unchanged at $1.1 million to $1.3 billion. We will continue to invest in key projects and we're devoting a significant share of capital to increasing our HVA capabilities in North America, Latin America and Europe. We continue to see strong return potential from these investments. ","I'll close with Slide 15, which is an update from the same slide we presented to you last March. This slide, first presented almost a year ago, provided the assumptions we were making in setting our goal of $1.6 billion of segment operating income in 2013, along with the risks that could get in the way. A year later, macroeconomic challenges have reduced our previous volume assumptions and unprecedented low interest rates and lower asset returns have increased our projected pension expense. Despite these adversities, we delivered stronger-than-expected 2011 results and we remain on path to our 2013 target of $1.6 billion. We recognize and want to be upfront about the fact that there continue to be risks to the achievement of our 2013 target, but we're focused on managing these risks and delivering the $1.6 billion. ","Now we'll open the call up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Rod Lache, Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess, a couple of things. First, you're guiding to somewhat weak North American replacement volumes going into 2012. A lot of -- some of the incoming macro data has been somewhat more positive and people are looking for, obviously, positive GDP growth. I was hoping you can maybe give us a little bit more color on what you see happening, what's behind it and whether it's -- there are some factors that you're looking at, such as inventory wholesale and that kind of thing?","Richard J. Kramer","Okay, Rod. I thought you were going to ask another question. Relative to North America, I think you're right. I mean, I think as we've look at it, we've guided the way we have because it's, frankly, pretty reflective of what we're seeing. One of the things that we've done pretty well over the past 6 months and now already into January and going out is really get better insight into channel inventories and sellout data. And it really confirms the forecast that we have that we still see sellout okay, not really picking up relative to some of the macro ups that you're referring to. And we still see dealers, I think, certainly being cautious, particularly relative to the raw material environment and the like. So I think what we see is still a cautious environment out there. I would tell you, there is possibility for upside if the economy goes up. The way we think about that is particularly relative to taking Union City out last year. Rod, I have to say we're probably very -- we're as well-positioned since I've been with the company in North America from a footprint perspective to deal with both the outlook that we've put in our forecast as well as to deal with an uptick that might come should those macroeconomic elements really show themselves in the marketplace.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And just relative to your price\/mix versus raw material outlook for this year, you're talking about raw materials being up 5%. I'm just wondering if pricing and mix stays where it is right now, would you agree that it would likely exceed the raw material cost headwind that you're anticipating for this year, or is there some contractual giveback that you're anticipating for later in the year?","Darren R. Wells","Yes. So Rob, what we see right now, I think, from the comments is that with -- as we start into the year, we've got the price increases we've taken and our outlook for mix. And I think even with $500 million of raw material cost increases in Q1, I think we feel comfortable that we're going to be able to more than offset the raw material costs in Q1. I think in Q2, the way it looks right now and including the fact that we do have price downs under raw material indexing agreements with some of our contractual customers, and that works up and down, so we do get some reductions related to those raw material formulas, given that we expect second quarter to be about neutral. And second half of the year, I think that we know what we expect, given raw materials staying where they are today. And that would -- the map would say that effectively means raw materials would be down a bit in the second half. But I think we'll hold out and understand what the environment is going to bring there before we give any further guidance. But what I would say is that at some point here we do expect raw material cost to go back up. Raw materials have started back up here in the first quarter, so we've seen some increase in rubbers, an increase in butadiene as well. And to the extent that trend continues, we know there's actions we're going to have to take to address that going forward.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And just lastly, any comments on when the Union City inefficiencies end? And are you planning on updating the plan for EMEA anytime soon?","Darren R. Wells","Yes. So Rob, I think the Union City impact is primarily a Q4 2011 and Q1 2012 effect. So you should continue to see some impact of Union City transition going into the Q1 results. And then after that, it should get better. We, I guess, purposefully have not given any specifics around the Amiens situation. It is still one that -- we're committed to addressing that situation and eliminating that high-cost consumer production capacity. And we continue to work toward that goal. If we aren't able to get an agreement to shut down the consumer capacity, then we'll have to look at other alternatives, including potentially closing the entire facility. So one way or the other, we'll work through that. It's kind of tough to call the timing with any precision right now, but we're working toward getting it done s quickly as we can.","Operator","Your next question comes from Saul Ludwig, Northcoast Research.","Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research","Hey, one question about Europe. I was just thinking about Europe overall in 2012. You mentioned you that got euro headwind, your outlook for volume is pretty cautious particularly on truck tires. You've got the situation where your snow tire business was fabulous in 2011, but the sellout maybe wasn't so good. And the situation in France, I mean it's going to linger for a while and hopefully you get absolved eventually. But these are all a sort of the big headwinds that you have looking at Europe. Are there any sort of positives or is does it just look like 2012 is going to be a tough year for Europe compared to a great year that you had in 2011?","Richard J. Kramer","Well, Saul, I think you probably summed up Europe as well as we can in terms of the headwinds that we see there and I think most of those are very real. In terms of positives, you have to remember the product portfolio that we have there, the mix of business that we have is really still very, very good. In terms of what we were able to accomplish in price\/mix, in terms of -- in 2011, I should say, and in terms of how we've actually driven our mix strategy in Europe over the past, I would say, at least 5 years is really what you saw 2011 being the beneficiary of. When you look at what particularly the German OEMs are continuing to do, you look at the product lineups that we have, I would tell you that the core business in Europe is still very strong. In addition to that, while certainly there is an economic overhang over in Europe in general, there are still good growth businesses in East Europe that continue to drive our profitability there as well. So clearly headwinds, but a strong foundation and still a lot of growth areas and a lot of opportunities to mix that will be in 2012 and beyond.","Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research","Would you think the net positives are greater than the headwinds? Or I mean just directionally, given Europe, from an EBIT standpoint, looks like a tough comp.","Richard J. Kramer","Yes. I think, Saul, what I'll say is 2012 will be a tougher year than 2011 for the reasons you said. But trying to give you a net position on that is like trying to forecast whether the Greeks will accept the austerity package. It's very hard to make prognostications like that. Very difficult in fluid situation that we have there, so I'm going to refrain from sort of calling that one.","Operator","Your next question comes from Himanshu Patel, JPMorgan.","Himanshu Patel - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Three questions. Just the production cuts that you alluded to in Q1 and Q2, can you talk to a little bit just where are the inventory issues by segment and what sort of magnitude are these issues?","Darren R. Wells","Yes. So, Himanshu, I guess just to be clear, what we've done is we adjusted our production in the fourth quarter and we'll take some production cuts again in the first quarter, just to get our inventories back in alignment with where we've seen sales levels. And I think, as you know, we are very careful about what we do with inventories and protecting our cash position. So we tend to do that when we need to. We've done that, That'll have an impact on our first quarter earnings. The impact of the production cuts in Q4, flowing into Q1 and then from Q1 into Q2. So expect some impact there. I think, overall, where we ended the year, I think certainly we had consumer sales at the end of last year were very soft. And in Europe, the warm winter there wasn\u2019t a lot of retail sellout activity and therefore, not a lot of reordering from dealers. So our consumer inventory in Europe above where we'd originally thought it would be, I think, similar in the U.S. We had soft sales in December and net-net there, our inventory was high at year end. I think a little bit of that in Commercial as well for us. So I think we're taking those adjustments, we're going to do what we need to do there. But overall, I think our inventory position, it's not significantly out of line, it's just some actions that we needed to take there to address, the softness at the end of Q4 and what looks to be a relatively soft start to Q1.","Richard J. Kramer","Himanshu, I might just add. I think what you're also seeing there is sort of actions consistent with what we said around Cash is King and taking decisions to sort of look in to see what we see coming from an industry perspective and adjusting as best we can to not build inventory and to not be in a position to be on the wrong side of that. So that's a consistent behavior that you'll continue to see.","Himanshu Patel - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And just a couple more here. Just the October 1 up to 5% price hike announcement from North America, can you just give a little bit of context or color around what the kind of net realization level was on that? It seems like the whole industry has been pretty geared up to implement price increases. So historically, we've thought about sort of a 50% net realization on kind of the up to announced amount. I'm just trying to understand is are we in an environment where you're actually seeing kind of a better net realization than that?","Darren R. Wells","Himanshu, I think it's hard for me to say anything that can be much stronger than the fact that we've got the kind of increases in revenue for tire that we got in the fourth quarter. So the fact that North America had revenue per tire of 19% gives us a pretty good indication that we're getting the price and mix that we're targeting. And the price\/mix performance there are very strong. And we are starting to anniversary some of the price increases that we've taken over the last year. So you've got to build that into your thinking. But overall, I think the team has done a good job in driving towards the revenue per tire that we've gotten. So I think we\u2019re feeling good about our performance there. And that's something we've had to do in order to address the raw material cost increases.","Himanshu Patel - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then, Darren, on Slide 13, you guys did a nice job of just laying out kind of the incremental headwinds on 2012. I'm wondering if you could just go back and think about -- help us think about 2011 on a full year basis and help us think about the headwinds that you faced in 2011 that you would pretty much say are not repeating in 2012? And I think you touched on some of them. It sounded like there was a $40 million hit on Union City in the fourth quarter. Maybe some of that continues in Q1, but maybe on a full year basis, that's a tailwind year-over-year. It sounds like the chemical business had a $20 million hit in Q4 because of butadiene prices. There's also, I think, a profit sharing hit in the fourth quarter. Does that repeat itself in the fourth quarter of next year? Can you just kind of walk us through those items from 2011 to 2012?","Darren R. Wells","No, I think, it's -- I can absolutely do that. So I think, Himanshu, that first of all, a number of the things that affected Q4 I think are going to continue to affect Q1. And so from one year to the next, you get some of the similar factors, in one year it was in Q4, the next year it's in Q1. And that, I think you would include the Union City transition costs, which were in Q4, they'll be in Q1. The Thailand flood impact, which is going to continue and affect probably a little bit higher in Q1, given it's a full quarter versus a couple of months in Q4. Continue to have China startup expenses, in fact, the increases there. And we'll have some impact of production cuts coming as well. But in terms of the things that we saw in 2011, I think you probably hit a number of them. We've got some of these things in Q4 that bled over. I think the raw materials is the big difference between the 2 periods. I mean, a lot less raw material costs increased this year than last year, provided raw materials stay where they are. I think to the extent we see rising butadiene prices, then that'll help the chemical business, where at the end of last year, the drop in butadiene prices was a headwind for us. So I think you can probably hit on some of the big ones there. Yes, obviously, we expect as we get through 2012 and into 2013, there's some of these things, including, in particular, the footprint actions that will start to have less impact as we get past 2012. Because there are a lot on the -- really a lot going on in the footprint side right now. I mean, you've got the shutdown and the transfer of products for Union City. We've got the construction of the China facility, and the fact that we're going to be going through shutting down the old facility in 2012. So you're going to have a construction and a shutdown going on over there simultaneously, which is why you see the impact that we showed there. You continue to see the ramp up of the factory in Chile, although that was a big challenge for us in '11. We'll start to get some momentum there in 2012. And then we've got, obviously, the situation in Amiens, which is an issue for us in 2011. And until we get that resolved, it will continue to be an issue for us.","Himanshu Patel - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And is the profit sharing every fourth quarter we should think about that?","Richard J. Kramer","Well, I think, the profit sharing, Himanshu, I think, we've said in the past is the agreement with the United Steel Workers was for 12% of EBITDA, effectively with a cap of $175 million over the 4-year length of the contract. And the EBITDA metric has some adjustments, so it's not perfect. But I think what you'd see is that once we go through, we had a lot of profit sharing that hit 2011. I think you'll see that'll continue through 2012, provided we continue to drive earnings in North America. Once you get past 2012 though, we would start to approach the cap and there'd be less of an impact for 2013.","Operator","Your next question comes from Patrick Archambault, Goldman Sachs.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess one question on just the cash flow, I mean, going way back now to sort of your Analyst Day. I think the original plan consistent with the 1.6 SOI target, was that, I think, cash flow including pension contributions should be about breakeven. Now it does seem like there's a few items that have come in a bit worse, pension is one of them. Maybe some of the startup costs and footprint actions have been maybe a little bit more costly in terms of disruption as well. Is that breakeven level still something that we should be thinking about? Or should we -- might there be a little bit more caution in that estimate today?","Darren R. Wells","Yes, so, Pat, I think it's a fair question. And certainly what you've heard us say today, and then you just need to step back to March for a second. In March, we said we get about -- we were targeting $1.6 billion of segment operating income. Clearly, we, even with some of the headwinds, we're still saying $1.6 billion is our target for 2013. In terms of the key cash flow items, you have seen pension contributions which -- or we've got a slide in the appendix of our deck today that gives some revised estimates of pension contributions. We now see instead of $525 million in pension contributions, which is what we had estimated back in March, we see $575 million. So about $50 million delta based on what happened in 2011. But beyond that, the other items, CapEx remains the same, interest and taxes, no big change in outlook there. So I think we're still focused on getting ourselves to that breakeven cash flow for 2013 and our $1.6 billion. I mean, we remain committed to those targets.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And that I think it hinted in one slide that you may do a little bit more restructuring as well. So that could be sort of a risk factor, but where you stand now, you'd be pretty close to that breakeven.","Richard J. Kramer","Yes. No, Patrick, we said those are the targets. That's what we're shooting for. I think Darren highlight the most significant headwind that we've really identified since we met back in March.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. One last one if I may. Can you just go over again, I know you referred to mix as being something that's sort of a structural tailwind here. Clearly, it was in a pretty big way in 2011. How much of that is like Commercial Truck, I suppose, on the OE side more than anything else? And then how much of that is HVA? And can you just remind us of what the main drivers of this rotation upwards to HVA are as well?","Richard J. Kramer","I think, Patrick, when we talked about mix, particularly in 2011, most of that mix was in the Consumer business as we looked ahead. And if you think about mix, what our goal is and what our goal has been is to drive our innovation through new products and branded business where we can differentiate our products going forward. That's something I mentioned, we started initially in Europe in a meaningful way. Certainly, we've made very significant progress in driving our mix in North America, thus the improvement that you saw year-over-year, both in the ability to offset a significant raw material headwind. But, really, in the mix of our business where we shifted the portfolio from a high percentage of private label and a lot of more unprofitable OE business to more Goodyear-branded business in the mid tier and the upper tier of the performance tier in the market. And that's what driving our mix. You see the same trends that we're doing in Asia right now, particularly in China, where our business is directed at the higher ends of the markets with Goodyear-branded product. And certainly, as both Darren and I alluded to in our remarks, we've got some work to do in Latin America, but certainly that's where we're headed there as well.","Darren R. Wells","So Pat, just to hit the other point which is what are the drivers of the mix. I think Rich laid out what the drivers are in terms of our strategy. I think from an industry perspective, you look at the proliferation of sizes and types of tires, particularly over the last few years, you'd look at the push for improved rolling resistance, which tends to require more technology, it tends to push toward more high-end tires. And then ultimately, I guess the MegaTrend of the industry is going to be the trends towards higher labeling, which is just going to demand higher levels of technology and it's going to push more consumers toward tires that we would characterize as high value-added, which are places where we can differentiate with technology.","Operator","Your final question comes from Chris Reenock, Citi.","Christopher Reenock","I'm calling in for Itay, and just had a couple. I apologize if any of this has been said, but I got logged off for a second. Can you just quickly comment on the challenges now of building on 2011 strong price\/mix, and how and where do we go in 2012?","Richard J. Kramer","Well, I think as we look back to 2011, number one, I think what you saw is that we really built our confidence and our ability to address record high raw material costs. I think we had 3 consecutive quarters in a row where we offset anywhere from 28% to 35% of raw material cost increases. So clearly, we made progress, and again, reinforced our belief that the importance to that is around innovation brands and products to do so. I think that Darren mentioned earlier that as we look to 2012, we do have some items that are going to impact us. One, again, is the OE contracts that we have that have raw material price indexes in them, which actually will adjust the downward in this case because of lower raw material costs. And certainly, we have a tougher comp in the third quarter reflective of the strong winter business and the winter mix we had in 2011. So as you think about 2012, those are some of the things to work through. But again, over the long term, our belief is that raw material prices again will increase. We've got a proven track record to be able to address them. And as they go up, we'll certainly be ready to take the actions to go and do that.","Christopher Reenock","Okay, great. And one on China, do you expect the start-up costs to start to taper off in 2013? Or is this something that's going to continue to be a headwind?","Richard J. Kramer","I think as we look at the outlook for China, we had the start-up costs in 2012. Darren made reference to the fact that, just to put in perspective, the China factory is a significant factor in that it both is a consumer factory and a truck factory. As we work through 2012, we're seeing the startup on the consumer side, we would expect that to evade as we get into 2013. But certainly, we'll start up our truck business as we get into 2013 as well. So that's something, I think, we'll certainly give more view into as we get into the future. But really, we've got a lot going on there. Again, it's a good way to frame it for you, starting up a consumer factory closing, our Dalian, our existing factory and then starting up the truck factory in Pulandian as well. So those are the things that are going to be with us a few more years.","Darren R. Wells","So I think '12 and '13, we continue to have some impact there. But I mean, these are projects that ultimately have very strong returns and a market that's going to continue to see a lot of growth, particularly at the high end. So I think we're comfortable with the investments. We've got a couple of years of startup to work through.","Richard J. Kramer","And I think that was the last call. So everyone, we appreciate your attention this morning. Thanks very much.","Operator","This concludes today's Goodyear Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results and Earnings Results Conference Call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I will now hand the program over to Nick Mitchell, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Nick Mitchell","Thank you, Keith, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for Goodyear's third quarter 2019 earnings call. I'm joined here today by Richard Kramer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Darren Wells, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The supporting slide presentation for today's call can be found on our website at investor.goodyear.com. And a replay of this call will be available later today. Replay instructions were included in our earnings release issued earlier this morning.","If I could now draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statement on slide two, I would like to remind participants on today's call that our presentation includes some forward-looking statements about Goodyear's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments today. The most significant factors that could affect future results are outlined in Goodyear's filings with the SEC and in our earnings release.","The company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Our financial results are presented on a GAAP basis, and in some cases, on non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures discussed on the call are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent as part of our appendix to the slide presentation.","And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rich.","Richard Kramer","Great. Thanks, Nick. Good morning, everyone. During today's call, I'll share some highlights of our third quarter operating performance and discuss the key themes behind the results in each of our SBUs. Darren will follow with a review of our financial performance and offer perspective on our expectations for the fourth quarter.","As we anticipated, the operating environment of the global tire industry improved during the quarter. The decreases in consumer OE demand that have weighed on the industry in recent quarters have stabilized albeit at lower levels. Consumer replacement demand was stronger in most major markets. And for the first time in three years our price versus raw materials equation turned positive, representing an inflection point in the industry cycle.","Our teams in the Americas and Asia Pacific were able to capitalize on improving market conditions. We grew our volumes and gained market share in both business units. Segment operating income began stabilizing in these regions reflecting better demand trends, moderating raw material costs and the actions we've taken to capture more value in the market.","However, our EMEA region experienced a more difficult industry environment than we expected as well as challenges with our channel distribution. Despite the challenges in Europe, our margins increased 170 basis points sequentially from the second quarter.","In the Americas, we experienced continued strength in our U.S. consumer replacement business with shipments up 3% on top of double-digit growth in the previous year. This performance was driven by share gains in the high-margin premium segments of the market. Shipments of large rim diameter tires increased 10% significantly outpacing the industry.","We're benefiting from our award-winning products and our best-in-class service offerings. Earlier this month, the Eagle Exhilarate earned the coveted number one rating in the ultrahigh performance all-season tire category from a leading consumer magazine. Outstanding, handling and hydroplaning resistance combined with impressive breaking performance on dry, wet and icy roads allowed the Eagle Exhilarate to outperform 20 other tires.","This is a significant victory for the newest extension of the Eagle line and reflects more than three years of committed research and testing to develop a winning product for this competitive and important segment of the market. And our commitment to excellence extends beyond our products.","Recently Newsweek named Goodyear Auto Service to its list of America's Best Customer Service brands. This is the second time Goodyear Auto Service has been awarded best-in-class status. In February, a leading consumer magazine named Goodyear Auto Service, a top automobile chain, one of five stores to be recognized for standing out in a crowded industry. These achievements reflect our emphasis on such attributes as courtesy, quality and timeliness of repair.","And it's not just the media that notices the difference. Online consumer ratings for Goodyear Auto Service stores are also reflecting our initiatives with scores soaring from 2.5 stars in 2015 to more than four stars today. In a world where ratings and reviews are more important than ever, this recognition is clearly a competitive advantage.","Our U.S. commercial replacement business continued to gain share driven by both our Goodyear- and Kelly-branded offerings. We saw strong demand from our fleet customers throughout the quarter with sellout up approximately 10% in the period. The strong performance reflects the strength of our fleet solutions offerings and value customers see in our products.","In Latin America, we started seeing healthier trends as we were able to deliver volume growth despite a dynamic political and economic environment and volatile industry trends. Shipments increased 3% in Brazil, our largest market driven by 6% growth in the consumer replacement channel. We also saw continued momentum in our commercial OE business, as volume increased by double digits for the third consecutive quarter. More recently, we've seen disruption in Chile, which has limited our production at our factory there over the last several days. We'll continue to monitor the situation. Our top priorities are with our associates as we navigate through this period.","The continued strength in our U.S. consumer replacement business, along with the solid growth in Brazil, gives us positive momentum in these important markets, as we head into the final months of the year. Our businesses in Europe, Middle East and Africa did not perform to their potential. Our overall shipments fell 6%, driven by declines in our consumer businesses. Our OE volume was negatively affected by lower vehicle production and strategic fitment choices.","In consumer replacement, softer-than-anticipated industry conditions and lack of alignment in our distribution channel, both contributed to our performance falling short of expectations. Notwithstanding the challenging backdrop, our EMEA business is capable of delivering much stronger results. The characteristics of the European market played to the strengths of our strategy and our competitive advantages. European consumers value the technology and performance of Goodyear tires.","Our ability to design and manufacture outstanding products that are recognized by sophisticated OE manufacturers and through magazine test scores is a significant advantage. Our product portfolio is stronger than ever, which provides a strong foundation for us to build upon. As evidence of our product strength, the Goodyear UltraGrip Performance+ was named the best overall winter tire by a prestigious German car magazine. The tire outperformed 10 other tires and delivered best-in-class braking distances on snow.","The Goodyear UltraGrip Performance+ also ranked 1st in the coveted Auto Express' winter tire test, a strong endorsement of our engineers' hard works and talents. This is evidence that we have the products to win in the marketplace. We're also improving our capabilities to supply premium high-margin tires. The investments that we're making in premium tire-building capacity in Germany as well as the expansion of our manufacturing facility in Slovenia will further improve our competitive position. This added capacity will support our growing OE pipeline and better position us to meet the rapidly changing needs of our dealers in the replacement market.","The modernization of our plants in Fulda and Hanau, Germany, remains on track as well. We expect to generate significant savings from these projects, which will improve our manufacturing cost structure in the region and further enhance our competitive position. We remain positive about EMEA's future. However, the region faces several challenges, including the lack of alignment in our distribution channels and an influx of Asian imports in recent years. Distribution is an area of our business, where we have a tremendous opportunity to improve our value proposition and address some of these recent challenges.","To take advantage of that opportunity, we expect to accelerate our plans to improve distribution performance. These actions should improve the focus on our brands in the marketplace and ensure that we capture the full benefits of the investments we are making to increase the supply of premium high-margin tires over the next several years. We continue to be positive on EMEA's long-term potential and we believe we will achieve stronger margins as we continue developing industry-leading products and execute on our strategy to improve our cost structure and strengthen our distribution.","In Asia Pacific, our team turned in the region's best relative performance in more than a year. Shipments rose 5% and growth accelerated throughout the quarter. In China, our consumer OE and replacement volumes increased by double digits during the quarter and our commercial truck tire shipments grew as well.","During the quarter, we benefited from the launch of several new OE fitments, reflecting the success we are having diversifying our OE portfolio with local manufacturers and winning fitments on the right platforms. Meanwhile, improved distribution is aiding our replacement businesses in Asia with more than 470 new Goodyear-branded retail stores opened through the first three quarters of the year. The Goodyear brand is highly recognized in China and dealers want to leverage its strength.","Channel inventories in China are lower relative to their previous year and we anticipate the positive momentum to continue in the fourth quarter. Solid execution combined with good traction with our internal initiatives, helped us navigate through what remains a challenging OE environment in China. The tire industry has faced significant macroeconomic headwinds over the past few years, which have greatly affected our profitability. Several of these challenges are abating and we're seeing a positive impact in our results.","Segment operating income is stabilizing in the Americas and Asia Pacific, aided by share gains in both geographies. We expect the improving momentum in our business to continue into the fourth quarter. We have work to do before we're performing at a level that is consistent with our potential, but I'm confident, that our strategy remains relevant in this time of rapid change.","Our brand is strong around the world. We continue to develop best-in-class products and push innovation to new levels. We are leading the way in changing how tires are bought and sold, making it easier for consumers to choose Goodyear. We're investing in new premium tire-building capacity around the globe and improving the competitiveness of our existing manufacturing footprint and we are strengthening our distribution.","I'm convinced this is a winning combination that few, if any tire companies can match. As we look ahead, we'll continue to leverage our strengths where markets are healthy and we'll make the necessary adjustments to be positioned for recovery in weaker markets.","I'm confident that our strategy and operating initiatives along with improving industry conditions will allow us to deliver volume growth, in our targeted segments stronger margins and enhanced shareholder value in coming years.","Now I'll turn the call over to Darren.","Darren Wells","Thanks Rich. While our results for the third quarter could best be characterized as mixed, I have to agree with Rich. We have a lot of strengths to build on and we can largely -- and we've largely achieved what we expected with better volume in Asia Pacific and the Americas and pricing finally ahead of raw materials.","Also as expected, we saw some cost challenges including a negative impact from production cuts to balance out inventory levels. As you see in our presentation materials however, there are a couple of areas that were not aligned with the expeditions we discussed back in July.","First volumes in Europe, particularly winter tire volumes were lower. This hurt our revenue per tire and therefore our mix. While the industry in Europe was weaker than forecast, we can't blame all of this on the industry. Our relative performance was weak as well, both in terms of volume and in terms of our share in premium tires.","While this is only one weak quarter after several quarters of solid market share performance in Europe, we see in these results evidence of issues we know we need to address in our European consumer replacement business.","While objectively, we know our product technology and quality is second to none and the Goodyear brand is a huge asset. We also know sales through our distribution channels remain problematic, making it difficult for us to move our product to market, difficult to get full value for our product and difficult to predict our sales volume.","I'll come back to our action plan in a few minutes, but we're very focused on addressing this issue. The second area that differed from our expectations was our mixed performance. While our pricing remained solid, our revenue per tire remained essentially flat because of continued weakness in mix.","We talked last quarter about the weak mix we experienced in our North American consumer business beginning in last year's fourth quarter, driven not by product mix but driven by sales through lower-margin channels, channels with higher distribution costs.","While equity losses from TireHub which are now excluded from mix improved during the quarter, channel mix did not. We also saw adverse mix in our North America commercial truck and Latin America businesses in the quarter.","So while we weren't happy in these two areas, the quarter was still an important inflection. It was good to see the adverse impact of the macro environment ease to see evidence of volume improvement and recovery of raw materials and to see the better earnings trend in two of our three businesses.","Turning to Slide 8, our third quarter sales were $3.8 billion down 3% from last year reflecting the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation reduced third-party chemical sales and lower volume. These effects were partially offset by improvements in price\/mix.","Unit volume decreased 1% even with a 5% decline in OE shipments. The reduced OE volume reflected the decline in global vehicle production and a continued impact of the strategic actions that we're taking to improve our OE portfolios in the U.S. and Europe.","Replacement shipments increased 1% with strength in the Americas and Asia Pacific more than offsetting weakness in EMEA. Segment operating income for the quarter was $294 million down $68 million from a year ago or $47 million excluding last year's benefit of an indirect tax settlement in Brazil. This year-over-year performance was a significant improvement from our first half results in both percentage and dollars terms.","Our results were influenced by certain significant items and after adjusting for these items, earnings per share on a diluted basis were $0.45. The step chart on Slide nine summarizes the change in segment operating income versus last year. The negative impact from volume was much less this quarter than in Q2, but the benefit was offset by unabsorbed overhead from production cuts in EMEA and Asia.","Raw material cost increased $41 million driven by the unfavorable transactional impact to foreign currency, as well as higher non-feedstock costs. Price\/mix was favorable by $20 million reflecting continued benefit from pricing actions offset by negative mix in the Americas. Inflation of $45 million more than offset cost savings of $40 million.","Remember cost savings were impacted negatively by the nonrecurrence of a $21 million benefit from the indirect tax settlement in Brazil last year. Excluding this impact our net cost savings improved compared to the previews two quarters and more than offset inflation.","The negative effect of foreign currency translation totaled $4 million also better than in recent quarters. The $60 million decline in the other category was driven by weaker results in our other tire-related businesses, including our U.S. chemical operations. Similar to the previous quarter, this category includes the impact of our equity interest in TireHub, which improved by $2 million.","Turning to the balance sheet on slide 10. Net debt totaled $5.8 billion, up from $5.6 billion a year ago, reflecting an increase in working capital, including higher-than-planned inventory, partially due to weak industry demand. We reduced production in the third quarter by approximately 1.7 million units versus the previous year to address inventory levels, primarily in Europe and Asia Pacific. Our liquidity profile remained strong with approximately $3.4 billion in cash available credit at the end of the quarter","Slide 12 summarizes our cash flows. Net cash generated by operating activities was $152 million, up from $60 million last year driven by less cash used for working capital. Capital expenditures were $160 million down $13 million.","Turning to our segment results, beginning on slide 13, Americas volume increased 1% to 17.9 million. Strong growth in replacement shipments and an increase in commercial OE volume were offset by weakness in consumer OE principally in the U.S. This OE weakness reflected the continued rotation out of older fitments and an unexpected drop in production resulting from the strike at a large OE customer in September.","Segment operating income was $175 million down $19 million from last year. The decline was more than explained by the non-recurrence of a favorable indirect tax settlement in Brazil last year. The positive contributions from our pricing actions over the past year more than offset the impact of higher raw material costs and we continue to benefit from improved factory utilization at our new Americas plant. These positives were partly offset by adverse mix discussed earlier.","Turning to slide 14, Europe, Middle East and Africa's unit sales totaled 14.5 million units, down roughly 6% with declines in both our OE and replacement businesses. Segment operating income was $66 million. The decrease versus last year, was driven by lower volume, cost inflation and higher unabsorbed overhead.","Turning to slide 15. Asia Pacific tire units totaled 7.9 million, a 5% increase from prior year. This was a significant change reflecting an inflection in China which has been declining for the last several quarters. Consumer OE volume in Asia rose 3% as double-digit growth in China and the ASEAN countries more than offset continued industry softness in India.","Consumer replacement tire shipments increased 8%, including double-digit growth in China. Segment operating income was $53 million slightly below a year ago. While there were a few pluses and minuses the decline could be more than explained by lower factory utilization primarily reflecting the production cuts we made in the second quarter to align inventory with demand. As I mentioned in my opening comments, we anticipate that we will continue benefiting from improving fundamentals in the fourth quarter.","Slide 16 summarizes the puts and takes we see for the final quarter of the year. The items listed are largely consistent with those we showed on our previous call. The notable exception is that we are no longer as confident in the increase in volume in the EMEA for the fourth quarter.","As I mentioned earlier, the volume situation in Europe has been exacerbated by poor performance in our distribution channels. This reflects a lack of alignment that results from distribution representing too many brands. In some cases, this is a result of actions we have taken that made our brands less profitable for distributors. This is similar to the situation we faced here in North America a decade ago. We were able to address it here and we will be able to address it there as well.","While our plan to focus on fewer distributors in each geography has been in the preparation stages for some time we're now looking at potentially accelerating these changes. While this may create volume disruption next year while we transition we see the benefit we can achieve by addressing this issue being similar to what we saw in North America, while also improving our dealer's margins. We'll provide more detail regarding our plans at year-end, but we see this along with our restructuring actions and OE business growth, as another opportunity to improve our earnings over the next two to three years.","Before we open it up for questions, I'll just mention a couple of small changes to our 2019 financial assumptions. We are now anticipating capital expenditures to be $800 million to $825 million, down $50 million due to actions to push out the timing of certain projects to reflect market conditions. Also note our industry growth assumptions have been revised.","Industry estimates for Europe have been reduced to reflect softer conditions. We have also reduced our forecast for the U.S. commercial replacement industry, reflecting a further decline in low-cost imports, which doesn't really have an impact on our volumes. Expectations for U.S. consumer replacement have been increased slightly and U.S. OE has decreased slightly.","Now, we'll open-up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first question to Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Richard Kramer","Good morning, Ryan.","Ryan Brinkman","Hi. Thanks for taking my \u2013 good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just relative to the helpful chart on slide 17, can you talk about your visibility into price\/mix versus raw turning to higher in coming quarters? How much of the coming inflection is simply a reflection of the known previous trends in commodity prices and already announced price increases versus how much is maybe dependent upon the anticipated ability to realize further price increases? It'd be great if you would talk about sort of the broader macroeconomic environment, tire shipment, volume, backdrop, what competitors are doing and inventory in the channel as may impact your ability to guess if price versus raw spread turn positive here.","Richard Kramer","Yeah. Ryan, I'll start on price and we can jump into mix as well. But I would say, relative to price, particularly in the U.S., probably over the last 60 to 90 days, we've probably seen a healthier pricing environment particularly in our consumer replacement business.","Remember, if we go back to Q -- around about Q3, Q4 last year, when we had some -- announced an effective price increases, we're actually experiencing the benefits of those right now as you would expect as well as some things that we've done over the last six months as well.","So, I'm feeling pretty good about that. And remember we still have a lot of work to do. I mean I know, you know and others know if we go back to raw material increases to 2017, we're up about 1.3 billion. So we still have to overcome that as we move ahead, but positive momentum in that regard. We also announced a price increase of up to 5% beginning in September effective 1st of October as well.","So, I think you'd see that we are still focused on making sure we get the value for our brand, the value for our investments in the marketplace. And again, I would tell you, when I look at things nothing makes me think any differently about this cycle than other cycles in terms of our ability to ultimately recover the costs of our products out in the marketplace. So again, if anything a bit more positive from where we were last year.","Darren Wells","Yeah. So Ryan, maybe I'll jump in and just hit a point on mix here, because well -- I mean slide 17 really only addresses raw materials and price and are -- sort of getting to the point now where a little less headwind on raw materials some more momentum on price, and therefore we've sort of hit the point where price is at least a little ahead of raw materials for the quarter, which is obviously an inflection that we've been expecting and looking for.","At the same time, the -- there are areas of mix that in the first half of the year and even again in the third quarter were adverse for us from a profitability perspective. And those are things that we expect to improve over time including in the fourth quarter.","So, we - and we talked about that in the last call that we\u2019ve had $20 million to $30 million of negative mix in the first two quarters of the year, and we expect that by the fourth quarter that we would get that to a point of being $20 million or $30 million positive. And while it doesn't directly address the chart 17, it's still an important part of what we do to get value for our products in the market.","So when we got a significant price benefit in the quarter, we did have some things working against us on mix. And maybe just to hit those to put them in context, the soft winter market in Europe resulted in less winter tire shipments. Less winter -- we're down 5% or 6% in winter tire shipments. That's an adverse mix factor. Lower shipments of commercial tires in Brazil and a little bit of worse customer mix, in fact, in the commercial business in the U.S. those both worked against us on mix.","And then even the OE strike in the U.S. resulted in us losing some volume on some light truck tires that are pretty high value. And while we can eventually use that shift that production to replacement for the sake of the third quarter that hurt us. It hurt our volume. It hurt our mix.","And then we still have some pressure from some sales through lower-margin channels -- which I mentioned in my prepared remarks -- channels where our distribution cost is higher. So we still have a few things there that were not working for us in the third quarter that we expect will improve for us going forward.","We continue to see strong growth in premium segments in the U.S. So that will continue to work for us. And we expect to get back to a positive mix in the fourth quarter. It may not be as positive as we thought it was going to be. But -- so it may not be as high as the $20 million to $30 million communicated previously, but we still expect for it to be positive. Yes, so I think we'll continue to make progress with regard to mix.","Richard Kramer","Yeah. Excuse me, Ryan, maybe just to close out your last question on channel inventories. Overall, I would say, really they remain pretty healthy in the U.S. We see inventories about the same as they were a year ago and that they were down a year ago from the year prior, if my memory serves. And remember that's in an environment where there continues to be tight supply for certain premium tires out there as well.","Same thing in -- as we look at China, days on hand there are really in good shape against significantly below where they were a year ago. And remember this is an environment where sales are up. So things are in pretty good balance there given the economic situation that we're facing there.","And then finally in Europe, I think we're -- we have seen and are seeing a continuation of a bit of a trend I guess, where our sense is that wholesalers and dealers are really tending to buy a little closer to need now, which results in lower inventory in the channel meaning they're now below -- well below last year, a little bit lower selling as they're relying on -- or waiting I should say until they need the tires to purchase them. This is -- are low in the channel. And again should we have, for instance, a good snow in Europe I think that's going to pull some demand for it. But overall we would say inventories are looking pretty good.","Ryan Brinkman","Okay. That's great color. Thanks. And then just lastly as my follow-up, even though the U.S. commercial on highway OE market, it continues to track strong as measured by build, some who follow that industry closely are forecasting a potentially large decline next year, maybe concentrated in North America Class A truck. It will be great if you can share your own expectations for that market and also just generally remind us of the materiality of commercial truck tires in the context of your overall North America or Americas business and then again the materiality of OE versus replacement within Americas commercial vehicle.","Darren Wells","Yeah. So I guess just to put the business in context, we've got a -- approaching 20% of our top-line is related to the commercial truck business. And if we take the commercial truck business itself then we would have around 20% of that that would be OE related. The OE part of the business has been a little bit higher as we've gone through this year because of the strength of the commercial truck build and that's actually constrained our ability to serve the replacement market in the way that we want.","We do understand the truck orders peaked last summer. The build remains strong right now but the backlog has been -- is being worked down. So we're expecting the OE commercial, OE industry shipments to decline in the fourth quarter and expect -- most projections are for them to be down into next year as well.","Now I mean the first thing will allow us to do is to better serve the replacement business. So we think our replacement business is going to benefit from improved supply as the OE demand normalizes, so it comes off of the recent peak. And I think we've got our ability to ship premium truck tires. We actually think it was going to increase as a result of that.","So we'll get some benefit from that at least initially. And then ultimately it's just going to be a question of where the level of freight goes that will determine that cycle. I mean, we understand it's a cyclical business but I think for right now, we've got some opportunities in replacement that'll help us address any decline in commercial OE build.","Richard Kramer","Yeah. And I'd just add Ryan we've -- Steve McClellan and his team in our Americas business in North America in particular have worked through a lot of the cycles of the tire -- or excuse me the commercial tire industry where you have OE builds go up and down. They're very good at managing through that.","And I might also add that one of the things we're doing to Darren's point on the replacement side, we talked about goodyeartrucktires.com I think one or two calls ago and those are the type of initiatives that help us weather through better the cyclicality of the industry particularly on the replacement side. So we feel good about that.","Ryan Brinkman","Very helpful. Thanks.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Healy with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.","Darren Wells","Hi, John.","John Healy","Thank you. Hi, guys. I thought one of the most encouraging things in the release today was just the performance of Asia. Just kind of want to get your view if the performance of the segment kind of surprised you and the bounce back in volumes was maybe a little bit quicker than you thought?","And then secondly, do you think that we've reached the bottom in that market and that the trend line in the Asia volumes as well as the Asia profits, we could probably start thinking moving higher rather than lower? Is it -- are you ready to make that call, or is it too early to do that?","Darren Wells","Well, I'll start. I will tell you we're very encouraged and very pleased by the performance of the business in the quarter to be sure. Because as we look at it the industry still remains very challenging particularly in China, where as you know the OE business has been down now. I think it's about five quarters straight. It was down approximately 5% in the quarter. Remember that's annualizing the 5% down a year ago as well. So continues to be a tough environment.","And remember I think we talked about it on the last call, our original planning assumption was that we'd see some of that bounce back in the OE business in the second half of the year. We said last quarter we didn't see that happening and it hasn't. And, of course, competition then amongst tire companies supplying those OEMs just gets a bit more intense because of that.","If we look to our OE business and really to your point John, our OE business outperformed the industry by really a considerable margin. That's really a combination of two things, maybe three including the hard work of the team. But really being on a launch of some several new fitments out in the market that goes back to our focus on getting on the right fitments at OE.","And secondly, it's really growing our business with more domestic manufacturers, really reflecting the steps we're taking to diversify our consumer base there. That's working. And we would continue that we would expect that that momentum would continue in Q4 as well.","And on the replacement side again, we outperformed the industry. And we feel really good about that. And I think that's really benefiting from something that we did with a lot of intentionality in the past. And that's really making improvements in our distribution there.","We're seeing the positive impacts of some of the actions we've taken around our aligned distribution initiatives there, where we've taken some hard lines in terms of how we go to market. We're seeing on a relative basis some of the benefits of that.","And also I'd be remiss if I didn't say the -- our brand in China is very strong. It shows up in the new retail stores that we're opening. Dealers like the Goodyear sign on their stores and consumers like to shop for brands. And our brand, metrics brand awareness have been really, I think are at an all-time high right now as well.","So we're seeing a lot of positives out there in terms of how the teams manage the business. In terms of making a call, I think, there is still a lot of variables that are still going out there. I mean the -- what we see in terms of OE forecast are still moving around right now.","So I think that that's something we'll be better prepared to talk about in -- as we get to our year-end call as well. I will tell you, one of the surprises that actually was a drag on the business in the quarter, despite the performance we had was really the slowdown in India.","And particularly in the OE business there is, I suspect you know the OE business was down about 20% I think in September. And that's been on a run rate of decreasing. And that business has been very good for us.","We expect that it will come back. But as India goes through some of their issues right now, that's had a bit of an impact on us as well. Remember, we made a capital investment in India a little while back.","And that's been a really good investment for us to be able to supply the OEs in India with the sort of the HVA tires they look at. So that's one that we have to work through as well, so in terms of outlook more to come on the next call.","John Healy","Great and then just final question for me, the impact of the strike in the third quarter, is there a way to think about kind of what that caused you guys in terms of SOI dollars in the Americas? And is that recoverable in the fourth quarter?","Darren Wells","So yeah John, the -- yeah so we estimate the first 15 days of the strike impacted our OE volume in the Americas by about 4% or about 160,000 units.","And while our rule of thumb is that premium OE tires have sales margin just under $20, a lot of this GM business is large-diameter tires for SUVs and pickup trucks. So the per-unit impact is actually higher than that in the Americas business.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Rod Lache with Wolf Research. Please go ahead.","Rod Lache","Good morning, everybody.","Darren Wells","Hi, Rod.","Rod Lache","I was hoping, you can just elaborate a little bit more on the price\/mix versus raw material expectations for Q4 and beyond. In the past you've provided what your view is on full year raw material impact.","And if we keep raw materials at the spot prices that we see today and incorporating the lag, what kind of a tailwind -- magnitude of tailwind should we be thinking about based on spot for 2020?","Darren Wells","Yes. So Rod the -- as you say, I mean, raw materials are moderating. And we're at a point where -- I mean, they'll still be a slight negative for us in the fourth quarter. So it's something with order of magnitude around 10 million negative. And then at current spot rates, we'd start to see benefit from feedstock costs in 2020.","I guess the real question that we're asking ourselves is whether we see volume continuing to improve, which our volume has and I think we see some recovery in the industry. We're likely to see some commodity price recovery also. And then, that would then start to push raw materials the other way.","And that's one scenario we're looking at for next year. In another scenario volumes could stay soft and we would get the benefit from the lower feedstock costs. But we'd be faced with a weaker demand and a little -- a lower volume would offset part of the benefit that we get.","The other thing that I'll tell you that we're trying to get our minds around, as we look at feedstock costs for next year, is the possibility of higher carbon black prices, due to the International Maritime Organization's stricter sulfur emission standards, which will start on Jan 1, which may drive up the feedstock costs for carbon black suppliers.","I think, that's still a question that's out there. So, I think, we're -- while I agree with your point that at spot prices we would have benefits next year that would be pretty significant. I think, we'd be balancing those against the expectation that if volumes stay stable, raws will come back up. And if raws stay down that probably implies that volumes are a bit weaker next year. So, yes, I think all of that will play into the way we think about 2020 and the way we come back and comment on it on our next call.","Rod Lache","Yes. I understand the -- no one's got a crystal ball on commodity prices and there are a lot of factors that'll play a role. But just to kind of level set where we are right now. If these spot prices were to persist into next year, what is the magnitude of the tailwind based on your mix today?","Darren Wells","Yes. So I think, in today's spot prices it would be around $200 million next year.","Rod Lache","Yes. Okay. That makes sense. And then can you just, maybe, give us a little bit more color here on this EMEA business and when you're expecting this to get better? My memory is not that great for what happened 10 years ago in North America. But is this something that you're thinking, there's sort of a structural challenge for the company that could last a couple of years? Or is this something that can be fixed in relatively short order?","Darren Wells","Yes. Well, so I think, I'd put this in the category of things that we'll be doing that are going to be positives for us as we look at the two to three-year time horizon, because it is something that will take longer than a year and it did for us in the Americas as well.","I mean, we went through and I think you were with us along the way. We went through quite a turnaround in our earnings in the Americas business and the North America business. And part of what went on there, there were a number of different factors there, but certainly there were some real changes in our distribution approach and a significant reduction in the number of distributors that we were closely partnering with.","And as a result of that, it helped us get better predictability and better value for our product in the marketplace. And so I think there are some lessons there that we would look to apply in Europe. And this is -- even in Europe the plan for this is not new, but we are getting ready to start some of these actions.","And I think as we start these actions, we do recognize that any transition of volume from one supplier to another will often result in a reduction in sell-in temporarily, until the inventory gets realigned. So -- but I think that ultimately we need to get to the point where we've got distributors who are more focused on representing our brands at retail and who have a larger part of their business dedicated to Goodyear's brands. And that's ultimately what we're looking to do.","Those transitions do require some changes for those distributors and they require some discussions between us and them in terms of how those transitions will work. So I think, we're certainly feeling strongly that we need to move forward on that. Some of the consolidation in the distribution channels in Europe probably make that even more urgent, yes, so we want to make sure that we've got a route to market using distributors who have objectives that are aligned with our objectives.","So I think that we'll -- I mean, we'll get there. Our brands still play very well there. We've got great product technology there. So we got the building blocks to make that work. So we're confident that we're going to be able to do that.","But clearly it was working against us in the third quarter and it's something that we think we can make some significant improvements on, while at the same time addressing the other big issue that we have in our European business which is our manufacturing cost structure. And we've got it -- and we're -- yes, we're continuing down the road of restructuring the two German factories and that will deliver some cost savings there.","Rod Lache","Yes. That was -- for my last question, can you remind me what you've got kind of in the pipeline vis-\u00e0-vis restructuring savings?","Darren Wells","Yes. Now, so we announced effectively rather than a plant closure, we've actually downsized and upgraded two German factories, which eliminated about 5.5 million of low-value capacity or will as we move through that. So it's a project that takes us a couple of years.","We'll get $60 million to $70 million of savings from that project, in addition to getting some increased capacity for high-value tires. And the discussions with the Works Council in Germany have been successful there. So we've got alignment on those restructuring action. So we're going to be able to move forward on them. And over the next couple of years that's going to make a big difference for us in the EMEA business.","Rod Lache","Okay. But that's over years, that $60 million to $70 million?","Darren Wells","Yes. I think we look at that as something that starts to deliver benefits 2021, 2022.","Richard Kramer","Yes. Exactly.","Rod Lache","Okay. Got you. All right. Thank you.","Darren Wells","Great. Thanks Rod.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to James Picariello with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","James Picariello","Hey, hello. Good morning, guys.","Darren Wells","Good morning.","James Picariello","Just on the restructuring topic, can you provide any color on what your intentions are in the U.S.? We've obviously seen some news headlines on some initial actions related to severance, et cetera. So, yes, just wondering what the update is there.","Darren Wells","Sure. Yes, I mean, we discussed on the second quarter call that we are looking at several options in the Americas that should deliver savings there at least as great as the ones that I just mentioned for the German restructuring and beyond a similar timetable. So as one step, we've offered voluntary buyouts to associates at one of our factories in the U.S.","The eligible associates have until the end of the month or until November one to submit applications for those buyouts. So the amount of savings there is going to be determined by the size of the buyout. And obviously the \u2013 yes, that will be part of what we need to do in the Americas. There are additional actions that we'll have to look at but we've got a strong track record of delivering all that type of cost improvements. So we'll anticipate taking some additional actions, but nothing further to put forward today.","James Picariello","Okay. Got it. And then just on the U.S. channel mix, the lower-margin channel mix, the volumes there were I think maybe a little bit higher than what you were anticipating because I mean it's my understanding exiting last quarter that that dynamic in the U.S. was slated to be like largely behind Goodyear. So just wondering are those volumes now expected to be -- go away in the fourth quarter? What are the actions there?","Darren Wells","Yes. So I do think that we -- I mean we saw some directional improvement in the third quarter and I think we're expecting improvement in the fourth quarter as well. There are a couple of things there that will have to be addressed through commercial discussions. So we're -- I mean, we need to be selling our tires through channels that are efficient in terms of distribution costs. And there have been some cases here where we've got a distribution taking place through some of our larger customers that get highest volume discounts and that which translates effectively to higher distribution cost for us and so a lower net.","We also have a number of customers who have used what we refer to as secondary supply. So they're -- in order to keep their own inventories low, they are taking delivery not directly, but taking it through third parties and we pay those third parties for those deliveries. So I mean these are things that commercially we can work out.","We understand that there are some of our customers who are looking to keep their own working capital in line. And I think there are things we do to help them do that, but we're going to have to figure-out a way to make that work while still getting the revenue per tire that we're targeting. And our team clearly focused on that. I think we see some progress. I think there's more opportunity for us to do that expect the mix to improve in the fourth quarter.","James Picariello","Got it. That's helpful. And maybe I just missed this but can you quantify what the TireHub -- equity loss was in the quarter and what the progress is regarding the distribution build-out within that JV? And more importantly maybe what you're expecting in terms of that level of spend for next year? Is that an incremental tailwind as that spend ramps down?","Darren Wells","Yes. Well I think overall we expect to continue to get benefits from TireHub next year versus this year. So that will be in the category of things that will continue to help improve our performance in the Americas. So I think that -- and there are a couple of elements to that. One is reduced losses at TireHub itself. And obviously we get our 50% share of any losses that take place there. We also expect to continue to get synergies and those synergies come both in terms of volume and in terms of mix so improved channel mix for us. So both of those things, I think, are going to be benefits for us in 2020.","If we look at the third quarter and I think this is the question you're asking, we actually did see reduced losses in TireHub and therefore our equity share of those losses was lower. In fact it was a couple of million better than last year. But maybe more importantly after first and second quarter where we had, sort of, double-digit losses -- equity losses in TireHub equity losses for Q3 were $4 million. So a couple of million down from last year and significantly better than the second quarter.","James Picariello","Got it. That's very helpful. And just last one. In the U.S. replacement market just wondering if you could square up how you would view the September volumes for the industry up over 6%. Would you say that -- would you agree that maybe there was some pre-buying ahead of the latest slate of price increases across a lot of the major suppliers? And I know you touched on channel inventories but just your general assessment of the inventories in this channel right now.","Darren Wells","Yes. Well I think -- and I think, you can probably tell this from the outlook we're giving for the consumer replacement business for the U.S. yes, you could tell after a strong industry in the third quarter we're expecting a little bit of giveback in the fourth quarter. So I think that may be along the lines of what you're suggesting.","James Picariello","Got it. Nice answer.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Itay Michaeli with Citi. Please go ahead. ","Itay Michaeli","Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. ","Darren Wells","Good morning.","Itay Michaeli","My one question really was just on free cash flow. Anything you can do to help us kind of dimension the puts and takes in the fourth quarter and really that we step back whether you expect the free cash to ultimately cover the dividend this year on a full year basis? And then lastly, if you can just talk about given some of the initiatives that you're taking on, how we should think about cash restructuring or rationalization payments in the next couple of years.","Darren Wells","Yeah. So yeah I think you've -- probably yeah I mean, you've seen that our restructuring cash estimate for this year has given the actions we've taken. We've bumped it up a little bit, from around $50 million to around $65 million.","So allowing, obviously some cash related to the additional restructurings, we've announced. That restructuring cash in the past has been -- when we're going through restructurings has been $100 million or so. So I think, there's room that that could go up a bit, as we execute on these restructuring's we've discussed.","If we come back to the cash flow for this year, I think I guess, bottom-line we continue to believe our cash flow for the year is going to allow us to cover our CapEx and our dividends, which means obviously that we'll continue to get some improvement in working capital in the fourth quarter.","The fourth quarter is the -- is generally the quarter for return free cash flow positive for the year, as of our working capital comes down, related to some seasonality in cash flow. So I would say helping us further is earlier this year.","We've put in place some programs to improve working capital management. And we did see some benefits of these initiatives in the third quarter. So working capital investments in the third quarter were better than they were a year ago, and we expect those to continue to benefit us in Q4.","In addition, we took down our CapEx. So we've got some investments that we have pushed out, delayed a bit, given the industry environment that we have in a few markets, markets like India that Rich mentioned.","So we've got investments lined up there that just don't need to take place as quickly. And so we have pushed those off a bit. And so I think you'd take all that together, I think we're comfortable that we'll be able to cover our CapEx, and our dividends this year without increasing our net debt.","Itay Michaeli","That's very helpful. Maybe just a super quick follow-up on that, and maybe it's a early to talk about 2020. But these levels of CapEx are these sustainable? Or do you think at some point -- I guess what would you need to see to take that up?","Darren Wells","Yeah. I mean, I think, as we start to look forward and consider the opportunity for some recovery, in some of these markets we're obviously going to want to invest, ahead of that recovery.","We want to make sure we're able to take advantage of opportunities to grow in premium tires. The timing of that I suppose is the big question. And given we're still developing our 2020 plans, I don't -- I'm not in a position to give any specific guidance for next year.","But I think going forward, I would expect that, as we think about what additional actions we want to take for growth in growth markets. And what additional actions we want to take to improve our manufacturing cost from a footprint perspective, there will be some additional investments we want to do.","Richard Kramer","Yeah. And Itay I would just add to that. If you think about how we've managed through cycles in the past. I mean, we've been able to manage levels of higher and lower spend.","I think effectively relative to what's happening in the market and timing our investments, fairly well being prudent with how we spend. And I think this is just another example of it.","We would expect that yes there are investments that we need to make in the future. And we feel that we'll be in a position to make them.","Itay Michaeli","That's all very helpful. Thanks so much.","Richard Kramer","Thank you, Itay.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ashik Kurian with Exane. Please go ahead.","Richard Kramer","Hi Ashik.","Ashik Kurian","Hi.","Richard Kramer","Good morning.","Ashik Kurian","Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. First one just trying to get your comments on expected demand in the U.S. for Q4, the SOI drivers and then on the free cash flow. It looks like to me at least that you would need a fairly significant improvement in your working capital in the fourth quarter to technically cover your dividend.","And how much of that is being driven by some level of destocking? And I know you made comments earlier in your -- or the comments about trying to get inventories down.","So just wondering whether, some of the free cash flow support that you will get in fourth quarter will come at the expense of destocking, and might limit some of the SOI recovery in the fourth quarter.","Darren Wells","Yeah. So there's no question, we expect to have reduced inventory by the end of the year. And that's been part of our plan. We've taken production actions to help support that.","And so that -- part of the benefit, or part of our progress in the fourth quarter would be improvements in inventory. I'll also say that the -- our level of accounts payable, given the recent production cuts has come down. So we're -- we've had less benefit from accounts payable.","That's something we also expect improve by year-end, as we get ready to ramp up production a bit for the first quarter. So there are a couple of different things there that I think will be helpful for us, as compared to where they've been the last few quarters.","The other thing is that and this is very typical our receivable balance tends to come down at the end of the year. And that generally is just timing of customer purchases.","Richard Kramer","Exactly yeah.","Ashik Kurian","Okay. But there's no more than normal level of destocking that you plan to do in Q4. Because I know a couple of the peers have announced a fair bit of destocking.","Darren Wells","Yes. So Ashik, the destocking that we're doing, I think it will be an improvement versus where are we have been the last couple of quarters. But it gets us back to levels that are more appropriate for the business. So, it is an improvement of where we are right now, more than it is an improvement compared to prior years.","Ashik Kurian","Okay. And then just one last question, I know, you did put a positive spend on truck volumes coming -- potentially coming down next year in North America. But I mean the broad outlook for both North America and Europe for truck volumes doesn't seem too great. And again, I mean most people have much more bearish assumptions for both the OE and even the replacement market is likely to do in Europe and NAFTA. Just curious to know, what sort of contingency plans do you have if the truck tire volumes were to take a sharper downturn next year than what's in your plan? I mean, should we be looking at more restructurings especially on the truck tires side? Or will it be -- I mean what other means do you have to protect margins on the truck side if volumes do take a sharper downturn?","Richard Kramer","Ashik, I think it's a good question. I think, maybe a little context might help as well. And we've talked about in the past, where we look at a key element of how we manage our truck business is going to the fleet and selling that whole sort of cradle to grave our fleetHQ, our whole system of selling a new tire, selling a retread tires, selling a replacement tire being able to service them essentially anywhere in the U.S. and get them up and running in less than 90 minutes. I think, we're -- we've managed that. We've done over two million calls on that.","And I think, if you think about the value of the fleet business, it certainly doesn't insulate from economic or cyclical changes in the truck tire markets, but it does act to be a lot more sticky and a lot more of a consistent business model than simply riding the waves of OE going up and down or truck build going up and down. And I think, we have I think very well sort of calibrated our business to make sure that we balance off and don't go too far in one direction or another.","And what I mean by that is, in the past, I think we had dedicated a lot of capacity to the OEMs as truck build were going. That's good in the sense of selling volume. It also presents challenges in that -- it usually goes that the OE side runs at the same time as the replacement side. And that tends to be a mix down insofar as your capacity is going to OE and not available for the fleets.","As we've balanced that off better, we're less susceptible to the OE swing, not that we won't have an impact, but dedicating less volume there means we have more dedicated to our replacement business. And I think, we've balanced of that off very well and I think that's how we better managed through these cycles.","Now, if the volume downturn is more severe than we're anticipating, I think that we have I think shown very good foresight, a very good actions in terms of making sure that we're balancing off production with demand in the marketplace. And if that would happen, we would -- we'd really see no reason that we wouldn't be proactive to make sure that we're managing demand, managing the factory and managing cash properly. And again, it'll be temporal because, we know that volume will come back. But again, if you think about how we set ourselves up to win in that fleet side of the market with premium tires, I think that helps us weather a downturn much better.","Ashik Kurian","Okay. Just last question from my side. A few tire makers have announced price increases with different timings in Europe on the consumer side. Anything from your side that you can comment and what you are planning to do or have done already in Europe, given that the markets are weak, so it is clearly a more challenging exercise to put through price increases?","Darren Wells","Yes. No we've taken a price increase effectively be in effect starting in the fourth quarter in our European business.","Ashik Kurian","Okay. Cool. Thank you.","Darren Wells","Thank you, Ashik. Appreciate it.","Operator","And this will conclude today's Q&A session as well as concluding Goodyear's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Call.

Please go ahead.","Nicholas Mitchell","Thank you, Keith, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for Goodyear's fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. I'm joined here today by Rich Kramer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Darren Wells, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","The supporting slide presentation for today's call can be found on our website at investor.goodyear.com, and a replay of this call will be available later today. Replay instructions were included in our earnings release issued earlier this morning.","If I could now draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statement on slide two, I would like to remind participants on today's call that our presentation includes some forward-looking statements about Goodyear's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments today.","The most significant factors that could affect future results are outlined in Goodyear's filings with the SEC and in our earnings release. The company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","Our financial results are presented on a GAAP basis, and in some cases, on non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures discussed on the call are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent as part of the appendix to the slide presentation.","And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rich.","Richard Kramer","Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. During today\u2019s call, I\u2019ll review our full year performance in the context of industry conditions that are affecting our business units. I\u2019ll also discuss several initiatives for 2019 that are designed to strengthen our connected business model. Darren will follow with a detailed financial review of the quarter and share thoughts on how we are thinking about the business going forward.","First, let me start by saying I\u2019m not satisfied with our overall performance in 2018. Our higher raw materials, strong U.S. dollar and industry volatility in China negatively impacted our results our operational execution was below my expectations for our team and of our capability as demonstrated by past performance.","The realities of today's challenging macro backdrop mean that we need to intensify our focus on factors that we can control including our expenses and cash flows. However, it's also important to ensure that we are running the business for the long term.","We are exceeding our performance from the previous cycle despite a challenging environment. This is confirmation that our strategy is working and that our investments are strengthening our competitive position in the market helping us deliver higher highs and higher lows at each point in the industry cycle.","We must not lose sight of the opportunity to leverage our brand our products and innovation in all our markets and particularly during this disruptive time as the underpinnings of the auto industry are evolving in ways unimaginable only a few years ago.","We head into 2019 with a focus on execution and with product and business model innovation as a priority. We believe in our current capabilities to drive results and in our leadership in addressing how consumers want to buy. tires and how the purpose and use of the car itself is changing.","Turning to slide four, our business teams delivered several operational wins during 2018. Most notably, our consumer replacement shipments increased 2% as we recovered volume in our key mature markets led by above industry growth in the high margin 17 inch in greater category in the U.S. and Europe.","In the U.S., retail sellout of the Goodyear family of brands was strong throughout the year outpacing the industry aided by the success of our assurance weather-ready product line.","In 2018, weather-ready crossed the 1 million tires sold threshold faster than any other premium product line launched in the company's history. I'd like to congratulate everyone that made this achievement possible. It's a testament to our product innovation and the power of the Goodyear brand.","Our commercial truck tire shipments increased as a strong commercial product portfolio and a suite of industry leading fleet solutions allowed us to benefit from the positive momentum in the transportation industry.","In Asia, we grew volume outside of China while our performance in China was impacted negatively by a sharp contraction in OE production and slower economic growth during the second half of the year.","We continue to broaden our reach in the country including continuing to buildout our retail network as a long-term growth potential remains intact. Globally, we added to our OE pipeline by securing numerous new fitments with many on electric vehicles including the Eagle F1 Asymmetric 3 SUV being selected for the e-tron Audi\u2019s first fully electric sport utility vehicle. These wins will begin adding to our volume in 2020.","In the replacement channel, we implemented price increases in several geographies as we work to capture the full value of our award-winning products and brands and recover higher raw material costs. In addition to these operational accomplishments, we achieved several strategic objectives during the year three of which I'm very excited about given their ability to enhance the customer experience.","First, we successfully launched TireHub, our new national distributor in the U.S. This launch is a culmination of the work we've done over the past decade to strengthen our distribution capabilities and better align our distribution network in the U.S. TireHub enhances our ability to promote our premium brands and ensure that our retail and fleet customers receive best-in-class service. TireHub also helps us prepare for the changes that we see coming especially in the way the tires are bought and sold.","Second, the consumer team in the U.S. continued expanding our mobile installation capabilities to new locations. The Goodyear Mobile Tire Shop is a market back innovation that grew out of the feedback we gained from listening to our customers. This service offering provides installation on the customer's terms. It also enhances our e-commerce platform which is crucial in a world where more and more retail transactions are occurring online. I'm pleased that the rollout remains on track.","And most recently, we launched a pilot a Roll by Goodyear which is a new retail concept. Roll provides us with the retail format that we can deploy in high traffic retail locations such as high-end lifestyle centers and business districts, a real departure from traditional tire retail locations.","Similar to our e-commerce site and the mobile installation service Roll reduces the complexity in the tire buying process as consumers can shop on their terms and select an installation option that best fits their busy schedules. Roll has tested very well with customers across all demographics especially millennials. Needless to say, we're very excited about Roll\u2019s long-term potential.","It's not an exaggeration to say that the changing consumer needs have led to the creation of entirely new company\u2019s new business models and new categories. TireHub, the Mobile Tire Shop and Roll by Goodyear represent our response to the changing consumer behavior as it relates to the tire buying process.","Each of these formats strengthened our connected business model and moves us closer to our customers allowing us to improve our service levels today and positioning us to be a leader in the changing mobility landscape.","As we enter 2019, we have several initiatives in the pipeline that will further strengthen the underlying fundamentals of our business positioning us for the future. On the manufacturing front, we will continue ramping up our new Americas plant.","In Europe, we will begin the expansion of our Slovenian plant. This project will increase the facility's output by 25%. Both of these projects will give us increased low cost capacity for premium tires.","As we think about our distribution strategy, we are focusing on capturing the growth opportunities stemming from our recent TireHub transaction in the U.S. In Europe, we will accelerate our efforts to align our distribution network.","In Asia, we will continue to develop our wholesale network and expand our retail presence especially in India and China where the long-term growth opportunities remain very, very attractive. An aligned distribution network is the backbone of the changes we are driving in how tires are bought and sold.","We will keep advancing new technologies to win EV and AV fitments which will help us build our OE pipeline for 2020 and beyond. We will continue scaling our commercial fleet solutions offerings including tire optics and proactive solutions which will help our commercial business gain share among fleet operators.","We will launch many new products in 2019 including the Goodyear WinterCommand and the Eagle Exhilarate consumer tires, the Goodyear Fortitude HT for the growing cargo vans segment and the Endurance LHS 2 for commercial tires. These tires feature our latest technology. We hold our North America customer conference last week in Dallas and I can tell you that the attendees were very excited about the products that we're bringing to market.","In 2019, our digital efforts will shift toward more personalized communications and away from the broad audience messages as we work to better address the needs of individual consumers. We will also expand our e-commerce reach to ensure that the Goodyear brand remains top of mind with today's vehicle owners.","I remain extremely optimistic about our future. We have a remarkable set of assets a powerful brand the strongest portfolio of products in our history and a growing portfolio of premium OE fitments. This trio ensures that Goodyear has a seat at the table as the changes in mobility rapidly unfold. Equally important, we have a culture of innovation a strategy to win now and grow in the future and strong partnerships with the best dealers in the business.","We have demonstrated the will and commitment to adapt and evolve. We were the first tire manufacturer to move online with the launch of our e-commerce platform goodyear.com.","We are challenging existing business models with new formats and concepts such as TireHub, Roll by Goodyear and the Mobile Tire Shop. You can expect even more from us in the future. We will not stop moving forward and we are committed to being an industry leader for generations to come.","And while a number of the challenges that we faced in 2018 have extended into 2019, I am confident that as we execute our initiatives maintain our commitment to the industry's most attractive market segments and focus on capturing the full value of our connected business model. We will ultimately find ourselves in a position where we are delivering results that meet and exceed our previous record performance. Now I'll turn the call over to Darren.","Darren Wells","Thank you, Rich and good morning, everyone. My comments today will be very much in line with those I made three weeks ago at the Detroit Investor Conferences. I said then that our fourth quarter segment operating income had come in weaker than expected given lower volume, weaker mix and worse results in our other tire related businesses.","I also discussed the supply constraints we experienced in the U.S. that along with weaker than expected winter tire sales in Europe and a further decline in the China market negatively impacted our performance.","Everything you see in our materials today and in our 10k will reflect these factors. The additional detail we're providing with today's release and slides should allow you to more fully digest fourth quarter results and help set the stage for 2019.","Turning to slide 12, our fourth quarter sales were 3.9 billion down 5% from last year reflecting the impact of unfavorable current foreign currency translation and lower volume partially offset by improvements in price mix.","Unit volume declined 3% driven by a 12% contraction in consumer OE shipments. This decline was primarily a result of weakness in our Asia-Pacific business unit which saw significantly lower automotive production in China and India.","Conditions in both countries were weaker than we anticipated explaining much of the volume shortfall in the period compared to our guidance. Replacement shipments were flat compared with prior year.","Segment operating income was 307 million for the quarter and segment operating margin was 8%. Our results were influenced by certain significant items most notably an indirect tax settlement in Brazil, discreet tax items and pension settlements. Adjusting for these items, we generated earnings of $0.51 per share on diluted basis.","The step chart on slide 13 summarizes the change in segment operating income versus last year. The impact of lower volume was largely offset by improved overhead absorption from stronger production volume in Q3.","Raw material costs increased 128 million reflecting higher commodity costs, transactional currency headwins from the strong U.S. dollar and an increase in non-feedstock costs related to stricter enforcement of environmental regulations in China.","We delivered 35 million of price mix improvements which partially offset the raw material cost increases we experienced. During the quarter, we benefited from our pricing actions, however, our price mix performance was less than we anticipated due to softness in the European winter tire market toward the end of the quarter and supply constraints in the U.S. Each of these factors resulted in weaker sales of high margin tires impacting our mix.","Cost savings of 80 million more than offset 46 million of inflation. Costs for the fourth quarter included the favorable indirect tax settlement we received in the trade tax dispute in Brazil. The negative effects of foreign currency translation totaled 24 million.","Weaker results from other tire related businesses accounted for 31 million of the remaining decline with our third-party chemical operations being the most significant individual item.","Turning to the balance sheet on slide 14, our net debt totaled just under $5 billion up $276 million from the prior year primarily reflecting our share repurchases of $220 million during the year.","Our unfunded pension liability was $599 million; $57 million lower than in the prior year period. As the impact of rising interest rates in the U.S. more than offset declines in the value of the plans fixed income portfolio.","Slide 15 summarizes our cash flow for the quarter and for the year. As in prior years, we saw a strong seasonal working capital inflow during the fourth quarter. On a full year basis, cash flow from operations totaled $960 million and working capital was a cash use of $120 million better than we previously projected. Rationalization payments and capital expenditures totaled 174 million and 811 million respectively, also lower than prior expectations.","Turning now to our segment results beginning on slide 16. Our Americas volume was 19.1 million tires for the quarter down about 2%. The decline was driven by U.S. consumer OE and weakness in Brazil. Consumer replacement volume in the U.S. was about flat versus a strong year ago quarter which saw an 8% increase.","Segment operating income was 179 million or 8.5% of sales, down 38 million from last year. Several factors negatively impacted segment income during the quarter including increased raw material cost, reduced earnings from third party chemical sales, higher product liability costs and unfavorable foreign currency translation. These factors were partially offset by favorable indirect tax settlement in Brazil of about 30 million and improved overhead absorption from higher factory utilization during Q3.","Price mix was essentially flat in the quarter as the benefits of pricing actions were offset by weaker mix. The weaker mix was a reflection of product shortages associated with manufacturing complexities and poor performance in U.S. factories.","Strong demand throughout the second half to completed our safety stock magnifying the impact of supply constraints during the quarter. These shortages existed in both our consumer and commercial truck businesses and prevented a higher level of sales of high margin tires.","Making the problem even worse was that the sales of the tires that we did have on hand were through lower margin channels some of whom like the OEs have contractual priority on supply.","TireHub\u2019s customer transition activity orders and deliveries of Goodyear branded product each performed inline or ahead of our expectations. Over the long-term, TireHub will strengthen our ability to promote our premium brands our industry leading e-commerce solution and our strategy of targeting the industry's most profitable large room segments.","Turning to slide 17, Europe, Middle East and Africa\u2019s unit sales totaled 13.7 million in the quarter virtually flat versus last year. Stronger commercial shipments and higher consumer replacement volume were offset by weakness in consumer OE, reflecting weak industry conditions and the elimination of small room sized fitments versus a year ago.","Consumer replacement shipments increased 1% reflecting stronger industry demand. While volumes were up in both the winter and all-season segments, unseasonably warm weather in December offset some of the strength we saw in the winter category earlier in the quarter.","EMEA strong commercial truck results reflected the benefits of favorable freight trends and the momentum of our proactive solutions offering. Segment operating income was 74 million or 6% of sales, a 22 million decrease from last year. The decline was mainly due to unfavorable foreign currency translation. Improvements in price mix more than offset higher raw material costs resulting in a slight net benefit in the quarter.","Turning to slide 18, Asia-Pacific tire units were 7.9 million in the quarter, a 10% decline from the prior year. Consumer OE volume declined 25% reflecting sharp production cuts by lighter vehicle manufacturers in China and India.","Replacement tire shipments fell 2% driven by ongoing weakness in China. Outside of China, consumer replacement volume increased by 5% driven by growth in India and Japan.","Segment operating income was 54 million or 10% of sales, a $63 million decrease from last year. The decline was primarily driven by lower volume in China and higher raw material costs.","Turning to slide 19, we have again summarized the positives and negatives we see affecting our results in 2019. As you might expect, this list hasn't changed in the last three weeks since my presentation in Detroit. However, I want to offer a couple of additional reflections.","First, I would soften a couple of the positives we've discussed previously. On net cost savings, you saw that in the fourth quarter, if I exclude the benefit of favorable indirect tax settlement in Brazil, our cost savings were about equal to the higher inflation levels that we're seeing. This is a good indicator of the challenge we are now facing in trying to deliver net cost savings and a driver behind our plans to announce further restructuring actions.","And regarding the ramp up of our new Americas factory, while we expect it will be able to operate at full capacity by year end, this will mean only 2 million additional units produced there compared to 2018 as we work to add more complex products including a OE fitments to its production lineup.","As we prepare for restructuring actions in our factory footprint, we expect to see a degree of transitional manufacturing costs or inefficiencies associated with moving products around. We'll highlight these costs for you as they occur.","I would also soften one of the negatives as we've seen raw materials remain at low levels for an additional three weeks. While we maintained our forecast of 300 million for raw material cost increases every week at today's level makes it more likely we'll be able to reduce that number.","Finally, we've seen pretty firm demand starting this year in both the U.S. and Europe. While it's still early it's good to see January get off to a decent start. That said, we continue to see a first quarter represents significant challenges in each of our three businesses.","Slide 20 gives a high-level summary of the trends that we see. Not surprisingly, raw material costs feature prominently for each business unit, given an expected increase of 145 million in Q1 even higher than we saw in Q4.","Slide 21 provides our analysis for your reference. As I said in Detroit, we're not providing any forecast of 2019 earnings beyond directional comments that I've made. However, in our presentation you'll find some updated materials to help you assess the year.","Slide 22 provides an updated breakdown of our raw material costs by commodity category. Slide 23 provides an updated breakdown of our consumer business between 17-inch and above and smaller rim diameter tires for 2018.","Slide 24 gives you our current expectations of industry volume growth for the U.S. and Western Europe. Slide 25 brings together an extensive set of modeling assumptions developed using current and prior disclosures and fully updated for 2018 results.","These assumptions will enable you to model changes in the industry volume mix changes the impact of higher for lower factory utilization pricing changes, raw material and currency movement and cost inflation.","To provide some other financial assumptions that we view either as less volatile or within our control. Important among these are some cash flow items. You'll see we plan capital expenditures of about 900 million up slightly from 2018 given spend deferred from last year and the impact of modest growth investments we've announced.","On working capital, we're planning to reduce this use of cash to under 100 million and hope to improve on that view as the year progresses. And you'll see that restructuring payments are down significantly from a year ago. While we expect to announce additional restructuring actions during the first half, we expect most of the cash impact of these announcements will be in 2020.","You heard earlier from Rich all the reasons he's optimistic about Goodyear's long term success. I share his confidence in our brand, our products, our position at OE and our leadership in future mobility trends.","I also believe in our ability overtime to recover the raw material cost increases that have impacted our results over the last two years and it seems set to make 2019 a challenge as well. Either through a reversal of the costs or recovery in price mix, we'll come back up the earnings cycle and benefit not only from that recovery but also from the underlying improvements we're driving in our business.","Now, let's open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","We'll take today's first question from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Rod Lache","Thanks. Good morning everybody. I had a couple of questions. First, your guidance for 2019 raw materials, is it still the case that if spot prices remain at current levels that inflation would actually be closer to 150 versus the 300 million that you guys guided to?","Richard Kramer","And that is the right interpretation. So the 300 million is based on our assumption that the average purchase price of raws in 2019 would be equal to the average purchase price of raws in 2018. And obviously, the 300 million also includes an impact for currency and some non-feedstock increases. But if we were to stay on spot rates about 150 million is where we would end up because the feedstock portion of this would be a lot better.","Rod Lache","Okay. And can you help us just interpret some of the commentary you made on price and mix? Are these manufacturing problems that constrained the mix positive in the quarters that's something that could be addressed in relatively short timeframe? And can you just comment on the pricing environment and how we should be bracketing the opportunity for price mix if everything stayed where it is right now in 2019?","Richard Kramer","So, Rod I think the shortfall that we had in price mix is as we said it's primarily driven by weaker mix. So I can say that we got all nearly all the price increases that we had expected to achieve, so I think good on the pricing front. But the small exceptions to that with the pricing that we were assuming we would get in Brazil and Turkey.","We got a little bit less that pricing was there to address devaluation in currency and both those currencies revalued a bit during the quarter and made the pricing tougher to get there. But otherwise, I think we got the price that we were expecting to get.","The supply constraint question is something that we believe we will be able to address during the course of 2019. And that was the big driver of the adverse mix in the Americas.","So, I think the -- I mean we went through in Detroit. I know you heard the commentary there the fact that these supply constraints are being driven by some additional complexity that we have in our manufacturing facilities and the fact that the strong demand early in the year had run down our safety stock so we couldn't go to safety stock and we couldn't get the tires out of the factory fast enough.","Now there are a few things in 2019 that are going to help us improve that situation. And I guess starting with that the first quarter is normally a lower volume quarter and with the factories running as full in the first quarter we should be able to catch up because we'll generally produce more than we sell in the first quarter.","So, a little bit of catch up there in addition as we take the 2 to 3 million units of OE volume down and about 50% of that OE volume decline is in North America. As we get that volume reduction in OE that frees up equipment to build replacement tires and should help us start to catch up on the replacement tires where we're in short supply.","And finally, as we move through the year the additional output of the factory, San Luis Potosi, is going to help us. Our new America's factory ramping up is going to help us with that supply issue.","So, the way I think about that is the mix headwinds that we had in the fourth quarter that related to supply issues. I wouldn't expect to see those in the fourth quarter of 2019. So it should be resolved by then. You may still see some adverse impact from supply in the first quarter.","Rod Lache","Okay. So just kind of putting all of that together you know SLP plant alone is 2 million units or $60 million positive. I mean should we be looking at something more like 50 to 100 million of positive price and mix prospectively as you start to address these issues.","Darren Wells","Well, I think if we go through the impact this adverse mix impact that we saw in the fourth quarter that were related to supply. I think given the fact that we feel like we got the price benefits that we expected from our pricing and consumer and our price increase in commercial. You could see the mix, the adverse mix impact that we had from shortage of supply could have been in the 20 to 30 million range in the fourth quarter.","So it was fairly significant. That's something that I think we will see and we fully expect to see that unwind. So in other words we should get that money back in the fourth quarter of 2019. I think the real question there is how much impact you'll have -- how much can we minimize the impact in the first half of the year.","Rod Lache","Right, got it.","Darren Wells","First half, we'll see some negative by the second half we -- in particularly fourth quarter we should see some positive.","Rod Lache","That's helpful. And then just lastly you did another 1.3 billion to 1.4 billion segment operating income this year. Could you just give us some more color on what the corresponding free cash flow would be? You did mention that restructurings only 50 million and working capital was 100 million this year. How should we think about the cash flow generative power of the company at that that level of profitability?","Darren Wells","Yes. So I think with profitability where it is right now Rod I think we look at it and say the cash flow should enable us to pay for the restructuring cash that we've gotten the plan should enable us to cover the CapEx we have in the plan and should enable us to cover the dividend but not much more than that. So I think that that's a reflection of the cash that we're able to generate at this level of earnings.","Now I will say this we do have the assumption that we would have a use of cash for working capital. Yes, and we're working to keep that under a 100 million. I am hoping that we come back later in the year and we're able to reduce that number. I mean that's one of the key objectives for the team this year and to the extent we can get more out of working capital than the situation can further improve.","Rod Lache","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ryan Brinkman with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Richard Kramer","Good morning, Ryan.","Ryan Brinkman","Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. How should investors think about your ability to stick the 2H 18 price increases in the context of the current raw material price and consumer demand environment? Given your earlier difficulty including in 2017 to stick the plan to price increases as raw material prices fall quickly and demand was soft. Could you please compare the current environment of raw material price decline and consumer demand to what we thought then?","Richard Kramer","Yes, Ryan, I think it and I think we went out with our announcement and put our price increase in place in North America last September and I think it was effective September 1st and we did a couple increases for truck as well last year. And I think if we compare it to 2017, I say one of the differences as we look today about eight to nine -- eight out of nine of our competitors in the U.S. also announced and implemented price increases or are implementing between October last year and say January of this year. So I think there is a difference in terms of what we've seen.","And the question of how we think about you know the movement in raw materials and the impact that it could have I think we have been in a period of rising raw material costs. You heard Darren talk about what our forecast contemplates versus spot today. Hey look you know if that doesn't happen that's a positive thing.","But I think it's something that we'll deal with at the time and I think we've shown an ability to you know overtime we've shown an ability to manage price mix in a decreasing environment of raw materials as well. So we would expect to be able to do that in a in a pretty constructive way should that present itself.","Ryan Brinkman","Okay. And then just lastly is there any guidance you can provide in terms of when investors might reasonably expect for the price mix to raw materials spread to turn positive or you know if you aren't comfortable calling which quarter, can you discuss the industry conditions that would be necessary to turn the spread positive.","So know for example if the current level of spot prices would remain steady and if your recent price increases do stick is that enough to turn the spread positive. At what time in 2019 or do you need from here additional pricing actions or additional spot price declines?","Darren Wells","Yes. So I think the two different ways that we can see this recovery happening. I think the one way that it could happen is for raw materials as you suggest to stay at these lower levels.","And then by the time we get to the second half we would start to see some benefit from raw material cost. And you know historically when raw material costs have come back down any price adjustments have lagged that and we've been able to recover on a price mix versus raws basis. So that is one scenario that could play out.","Another scenario that could play out is pricing dynamics could change and raw materials could head back up. And that is the scenario that's inherent in our raw material forecast. The one that we're operating with the 300 million.","We're assuming raw material prices will start to rise again and that is partly based on the idea that we will continue to see reasonably strong volumes and even the possibility of some recovery in emerging markets that have been particularly weak over the last year.","And if that recovery happens and volumes in mature markets stay steady then there's demand for raw materials that should bring those prices back up. If that happens and we see and we see different pricing dynamics then we may be able to recover or recover it by driving price mix above raws.","So there's a couple of different ways and those are ways that in historical cycles each of those two has happened. And I'm not sure we can call which of those two is going to occur and I don't think we can call any precise timing on either one of them, but I do think we've got competence. In fact, we do have confidence that overtime one of those two is going to playout.","Ryan Brinkman","Very helpful. Thank you.","Richard Kramer","Thanks Ryan.","Operator","We'll go next to John Healy with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.","Richard Kramer","Good morning, John,","John Healy","Thank you. Morning. Rich, I want to ask just a little bit more about the complexity issues that you guys are encountering in U.S. plants. I was hoping you could give us some. I don\u2019t know I want to see real life examples but just some more practical examples of kind of what's going on there.","How long those issues might persist if they're more structural in nature given the move towards some of the OE fitments that you've had and the complexities with just the excuse or we're just trying to understand kind of what the true logistical issues are and how long those might last and what type of restructuring efforts might be needed to change that trend.","Richard Kramer","Yes, so John, I guess two things here. There is one. I mean one you're addressing is the supply issue that we had in North America and how long it takes us to get on top of that supply issue. And I can give one answer on that I think the question of the impact of complexity overall is it's a bit of a topic on its own and so I guess before I answer I'll ask you which of those two would you rather I spend time on.","John Healy","I think the supply side of things might be a little bit more helpful. Yes.","Richard Kramer","No. And that's what's front and center for us right now. So as we have had a lot of success mixing up our product -- product content in the Americas so that 12% increase that we've seen in the 17 inch and above tires during the course of 2018 that's been a very good thing. And our demand has been very strong particularly in second and third quarters.","So I guess that the first thing is that we went through the second and third quarters you know selling more than we were able to supply through the factories and that's a fairly typical pattern that we tend to build more tires than we sell in the first quarter.","And then during the second and third quarter we tend to sell a few more than worth building. But this year the demand was particularly strong and that meant our safety stocks.","So the inventory that we try to keep as a buffer got run down and run down below levels that you know that we'd like to see it at. And we were working and have been working to respond with increased output from our factories and that's our sort of legacy factories as well as the New America's factory. So we have been working to sort of flex up the output of the factories and we were counting on an ability to increase that output in the fourth quarter.","And it is clear now that it's going to take us longer to get that output up even though we think we can do that. But the whole thing that makes it most difficult is that we are building -- we are building a wider variety of SKUs than we have traditionally and that means more changeovers in the factory.","And we're building a more complex -- from a technology perspective a more complex type of fires. And I mean we can take -- there are lots of examples here. But those tires take longer to build.","And you know if we look at the content of the tire itself you know we take we're generally talking about tires that have a lot higher content of silica. And we just take silica as an example, it takes 15% to 25% more time to extrude than other fillers do than carbon black does. It takes 20% more time to cure, and the extrusion process is impacted even more.","So that -- the impact of silica is one of the factors, but there are others because these are tires that have a higher number of components, and they have a tighter tolerance in a lot of cases than the tires that they're replacing.","So all-in-all, it creates a significant challenge for us in our factory footprint. We address that partly by upgrading equipment, and we've been doing that, and we'll continue to do that.","But there is some portion of this that I'll put in the category of operational excellence, where we just have to work on efficiency programs to offset the effect of this additional complexity. And I think over the long run, we will make a lot of progress on that.","In the short run, I think we're going to count on the fact that the first quarters -- the first quarter every year gives us some chance to catch up that we're going to be taking some OE volume out of these factories and the machinery that's been making those OE tires can be rededicated, repurposed to building replacement tires, helping us catch up and then leveraging the new Americas factory and the increased output there to help us catch up in our safety stock and our supply.","So I think that supply issue should -- will get resolved during 2019. And again, that -- everything I suppose is market dependent, but I think we're optimistic that we can get on top of that, and still could have some impact in the first half, but I think, we'll get ourselves clear of that as we move through 2019. ","John Healy","Great. That's very helpful. And I wanted to ask just your perspective on China with the boots on the ground that you have there. Maybe some perspective in terms of where that market is for you guys in terms of showing some leveling off or if things do appear to be still cascading lower. Just your expectations on when we might find on the floor there. ","Richard Kramer","The question of where there's a floor, I think, is still a tough one to answer. But I think overall, we don't really have our enthusiasm dampened in terms of the future and the earnings potential that we have in our business in China. The situation we saw in 2018, particularly the last half or even the last quarter, saw the new car production dropped by teens for what? Three months in a row.","The full year down 4%, which is the first time, I think, since 1990. So it's more of a very particular thing that hit us right now, and that will linger into at least the first half of 2019 as well.","But as we ultimately look to the future, a couple of things get us excited. One, the car parc on the road is still a very good one. And remember, most of those vehicles, given our high OE footprint, is 17-inch-and-above, so there's a good replacement market there.","Secondly, the OE vehicles that are coming out are very robust. A lot of those are EVs, and a lot of those are large rim diameter tires. And our future OE portfolio is shaping up very, very strong in China as well.","And yes, they're going through a bit of a dislocation right now, and we can't predict exactly when that turns around. We know over the long term, that is a market that we want to be in, and that has great opportunities and really great innovation as well.","And then the last thing I'd say is we see, from a retail perspective, lots of opportunities to expand our presence in, not only the coastal cities, but continuing to expand inward. And that white space and that opportunity to grow is still very strong.","So I view this as really just the growing pains of an economy that continues to grow at a rate that's obviously essentially best in the world. So we remain very optimistic, I would say. ","John Healy","Great. And then just one final question for me. As you guys think about TireHub, I know you just had your big Dallas kind of dealer meeting. What was the feedback? Are there any metrics that you can kind of give us about TireHub regarding dealer retention? Any sort of updated thoughts? I know you indicated it's progressing well, but just kind of maybe some detail there. ","Richard Kramer","Sure. I mean, if you look at some of the markers that we have out there, I think we essentially exceeded our transition plans as we initially laid out. Equally so, our fourth quarter volumes through TireHub exceeded our plans. We have not lost any customers.","We've had some growing pains as we've put TireHub in place as you would with any start-up company, but we have not had any significant customer losses at all as we move ahead.","And I would say when we look at their inventory, they're actually running more efficient than our previous supplier. They're running at about -- we say about 42 days. That's about 20 days less than our historical national supplier. So from that perspective, very good.","And I would say there an entity that is focused on improving their service, improving their numbers and getting the -- getting those customers and tires where they need them. So I would say, it's moving along very, very well. And I think that the issue on supply that Darren referenced earlier in the last question, that is an issue.","But I would also tell you that supply in the fourth quarter in the industry is something that was a bit of a challenge. And I think if you ask around, some of our competitors had the same problem. So that issue, I think, is out there in the near term as well. But overall, I would say, in all of the things we look at, TireHub is essentially on or ahead of schedule.","John Healy","Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ashik Kurian with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Richard Kramer","Hello, Ashik.","Ashik Kurian","Hi, everyone, thanks for taking my question. I appreciate that a lot of the discussion has been on macro conditions and the industry backdrop improving from here, but from a longer-term point of view, the absolute volume level of the market and pricing, especially in your home market, I would say, is still at very healthy level.","So given where we are in the cycle, I'm interested in getting your thoughts on how you see your balance sheet sing. I appreciate the comment on limited share buybacks going forward, but I would have expected more significant actions or strategic decision to shore up on your balance sheet given that you're saying on current earnings, the underlying deleveraging has been significant. And also, the recent volumes and earnings, do you feel justified in spending around $900 million in CapEx? ","Richard Kramer","So Ashik, I think, you're -- I am equally focused on the health of our balance sheet. So I think it is something that we take very seriously, and we intend, overtime, to move ourselves toward a balance sheet that would represent investment grade. I mean, that is the -- strategically where we want to see ourselves going.","The -- so as a result, not good to see the increase in our debt-to-EBITDA that we've experienced over the last couple of years. Although I do think we recognize there's always going to be cyclical impact to our leverage metrics.","As the earnings cycle plays out, there will be point in time where earnings will drive our debt-to-EBITDA up. And as the cycle recovers, the earnings -- the improved earnings will drive our debt-to-EBITDA back down. But our leverage, which right now is around -- at the end of the year, was around three times and depending on how you calculate it, but around three times.","I think something like two times is somewhere we would like to see ourselves long term, and we want to start to make progress on that, certainly. But as we're going through this part of the cycle, I think we -- certainly, we don't want to be using cash, but the level of CapEx and restructuring that we have planned for 2019 and the dividend are things that, at the run rate of earnings, are affordable.","The -- I think as we're able to make more progress on working capital, we hope to be able to leverage that to generate a little bit more headroom from a cash flow perspective, and that's an area of focus for us.","And as we see our earnings come back up, so as we start to see our way through the raw material cycle and earnings for us and the industry start to move back toward peak levels, we would expect to take some of that cash flow that's generated at higher earnings levels and use that to improve our balance sheet.","So I -- that is the perspective that we come in with. I am very focused on ensuring that we are not allowing our balance sheet to deteriorate any further. But I also recognize that some part of improving our leverage is going to have to come from improved earnings. ","Ashik Kurian","All right. Just a follow-up. What is your current level of maintenance CapEx? I think previously, might have been around $600 million to $700 million. But now that the Mexican plant up and running, what do you estimate your maintenance CapEx is? ","Richard Kramer","Yes, Ashik, I think we -- I mean, there are always level of CapEx that you can live with for a year or two, and those number is a little bit lower. But I think our depreciation rate, which is around $775 million; I think that's as good an indicator as any of what our maintenance CapEx would be for any extended period of time.","Ashik Kurian","One final housekeeping question for me. In the notes for your SOI drivers, there were a few one-off that you flag, including tax settlement in Brazil. What were -- Is it possible to quantify the one-off impact within SOI from some of the tax impact? ","Richard Kramer","Yes. So I think that the -- yes, the most significant item here was in the Americas, and that was the indirect tax settlement that we reached in Brazil, which was effectively reversing some value-added tax that we had paid over a number of years. And that was a benefit of about $31 million in the Americas.","And so now there were a couple of other items that moved the other way in the Americas, but that was the most significant one. That $31 million was also a benefit for us as we look at cost savings versus inflation, and that was the basis.","As I look at our cost saving versus inflation, if I take out that 31 million benefit, then our cost savings were about equal to inflation in the quarter. And that is clearly not where we want to be. But that's the -- I mean, those are the places, in the Americas earnings and in our cost saving versus inflation, those are the 2 places where that indirect tax settlement in Brazil features most prominently. ","Ashik Kurian","Thanks a lot.","Richard Kramer","Thanks Ashik.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Richard Kramer","Hey, Emmanuel.","Emmanuel Rosner","Hi, good morning, everybody. So I guess just to clarify. Are you now expecting fewer units to come out of the new plant in Mexico in 2019 versus before? And what is driving this?","Richard Kramer","Yes. So here is -- and it's a good question. So I think in previous discussions, we would have looked for the new Americas factory to produce up to an additional 3 million units in 2019. But given the supply situation that we had in the fourth quarter, we've made a couple of changes to the plan for that factory.","And effectively, what we have moved to is working to put more complex products into the new factory quicker, and that includes putting increased OE products into that factory. Now that has the benefit of helping alleviate some of the complexity in the supply challenges in our other factories.","So from a long-term perspective, it's the right thing to do, and it helps us get on top of the supply situation. But as we work to put more complex products into the plant -- the Americas plant, the new Americas plant, we now see that increase in unit volume at about 2 million units rather than the 3 million that we have previously seen. But in the long run, we still expect that factory to be able to produce 6 million tires.","So it doesn't change the long-term capacity of that factory, but it does mean, on a unit basis, lower output, although ultimately, higher value and more beneficial output for us in 2019.","Emmanuel Rosner","Okay. That's great color. So I must ask you a little bit more in those sort of supply issues. I understand your points around the wider variety of SKUs being built, more complex types of tires in general. None of those things, though, feel like new issues at least or new topics for this industry.","I think you may even have spoken about those over time as sort of like a point of differentiation between higher value-added sort of tires. Has there been sort of a meaningful step-up in the complexity or sort of more a bit of a breakdown in operational execution? ","Richard Kramer","Yes. I'll jump in here. I think you rightly point out that these issues have been lingering for a while in terms of the complexity coming into -- impacting us for a while, I should say, impacting the industry for a while in terms of complexity going up.","I think that one of the things that we -- what we saw is that because of we had such good sell-out, demand was so high and even as you saw the industry had -- I think you find the industry was a little bit short of supply on the right tires in the fourth quarter, we saw demand spike, and I think that put an incremental pressure on our factories. And we didn't get out the tires that we had planned to get out because of that complexity.","So listen, I have to say, that's on us, right? We did have more pressure. We are focused on this, as Darren said. We know how to do this. We can do better, and we will do better as we look to 2019. But it's not a new issue.","I don't think that we could characterize this complexity being new. It's absolutely a continuing issue. And as we think about whether the industry going -- is going, we do believe that, that still is an advantage for us as we look to the future. But in the quarter, we didn't do the best at managing it, and, that's on us.","Emmanuel Rosner","Okay. That's clear. And then I guess finally, looking at your outlook for 2019, I guess more -- the slide on the positives and the negatives. Which of these factors specifically are hard to quantify or either sort of prevent you from giving a more detailed or specific quantify 2019 guidance? I mean, it feels like the -- a lot of these things are more like discrete items. Some of those you've made assumptions about in the past, in previous years. So what -- where is really the uncertainty here? And why no guidance in the end? ","Darren Wells","Yes. So I think the -- we obviously spent time -- a lot of time reflecting then coming to the decision on returning to using modeling assumptions rather than segment operating income guidance. But I just -- I mean, for perspective, I participated in Goodyear conference calls for 10 years without us giving guidance.","So this is an approach that we have a lot of experience with, so it is going back to an approach that I was very accustomed to. Understand the benefit of guidance in the right circumstances, but I think we're concluding the circumstances were and are not the right ones for giving guidance. And the external factors that are driving near-term results to the greatest degree are factors that we don't control.","So I mean, commodity cost would be top of the list. Currency rates would be up there as well. And to some degree, industry volume and pricing dynamics have been very tough to call.","So if we look at the last couple of years, certainly, we've had a lot of recent evidence of this volatility and an environment that is difficult to forecast, but I think there are a number of those issues that are not really new. There are things that have traditionally been -- have driven near-term earnings and have been difficult to predict.","So I think that's what brings us back to working to do a really good job giving you modeling assumptions, giving you ways to understand how to predict the financial impact of assumptions that you might make, and we're going to continue to do that and keep those modeling assumptions up-to-date. But we ultimately got to the conclusion that, that was a better approach for us than giving segment operating income guidance.","I will also say that it is a reflection of a lot of discussions that I had with our shareholders during the course of the first 90 days I was here. A lot of those discussions had a lot of recommendations from our shareholder group that effectively, we go back to using modeling assumptions rather than segment operating guidance as a way to communicate with the investor community.","I think I will say this, and I think we'll add this, and I guess we're -- you're obviously not giving any segment operating guidance for 2019 or 2020 or any other year, so we are not doing that. We are doing the modeling factors. We will come back later this year with some thoughts on longer-term objectives for our key metrics. So we will do that.","I think we've committed that we would give you our best thoughts on 2019, which we've given you today, and then come back and have a follow-up discussion on the longer term. And I think we will come back with some longer-term objectives for some of our key metrics, but just not today. We'll do that later in 2019.","Emmanuel Rosner","Perfect. Thank you.","Darren Wells","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Anthony Deem with Longbow. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Richard Kramer","Good morning, Anthony.","Anthony Deem","Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my questions here. So just to start off first, a month ago, Darren, you publicly stated the first quarter 2019 SOI decline might look similar to the fourth quarter, which was down about 27%, even more excluding the Brazil value-added tax. Wondering if that's still the case, if first quarter 2019 can be down that much.","Darren Wells","Yes. No, I think the comment was a reflection of the headwinds that we saw in Q4 and thinking that the Q1 headwinds looked similar to Q4. So and I think our -- my thinking on that was in looking at the dollar decline that we saw in the fourth quarter and the drivers of that and the fact a lot of those drivers look very similar in Q1, I would say the same thing today. ","Anthony Deem","So with the 145 on raws, which you provided in your slide deck, because we have about $93 million negative price mix over raws. So essentially, maybe something on the lines of $50 million, $60 million positive price mix would be reasonable for the first quarter? ","Darren Wells","Yes. So I'm not going to give particular numbers. I think we're giving you the direction here. I would say that there are going to be a number of different factors that are worth considering for Q1. But I think you're right to point out that price\/mix versus raws is driving a big part of the outcome. ","Anthony Deem","Okay. Thank you. Two follow-ups. So you still have about 45% of your OE volume of low value-add tires, 60% total company. That mix is going to benefit a little bit because you're relinquishing 2 million, 3 million OE volume mostly in North America. I'm just wondering, with Goodyear having a sizable percentage of low value-added tires still, I'm wondering what the plans what the volume over the next five years, if there is any impact on absorption, and if there might be a direct connection here to the footprint restructuring. And really ultimately, do you see us modeling down OE volume for the next several years past 2019? Will that be a reasonable expectation with the hype and focus on HVA?","Darren Wells","So, I think that our expectation is that we're going to go through a dip in our OE volume in 2019. And as we've come off some low-value fitments, and those fitments particularly focused on smaller rim diameters and focused on sedan tires, we have been having a lot of success acquiring new fitments that will start to come into production in 2020, 2021, and that should take our OE volume back up. And it should improve the mix of that OE volume.","So I think, I mean, strictly speaking, that's what we expect, 2019 is a bit of a dip. And then we will -- we're going to start to come back on with some increased OE fitments, increased OE volume thereafter. ","Anthony Deem","One last question for me, please. so USTMA fourth quarter U.S. consumer replacement shipments up 5% for the industry. Goodyear, flat, it looks like. Was -- can you quantify any impact from ATV during the quarter? In that slide in the footnotes, you mentioned you exclude any impacts from ATV as you talk about your market share recovery.","And then secondly, it looks like you believe U.S. replacement can ultimately gain share on this sort of normalized run rate, excluding the ATV effect. So for 2019, Americas replacement volume, should we anticipate that Goodyear grows in excess of that 0% to 2% industry outlook you provided? ","Richard Kramer","So on the ATV question, in terms of the fourth quarter, no impact there. And while your numbers I certainly recognize, I'd also added to it. In the fourth quarter, we continue to have a very strong sell-out.","So for three quarters of the year, we started a little slower in Q1 for reasons I won't go into now, you may recall, but sell-out remains very strong for us as we ended the year. And as Darren mentioned earlier, we're seeing again good volumes in January as well. So that's kind of how we're looking at it. And then -- and in terms of 2019, we're not going to go into detail. ","Darren Wells","No, I think -- for 2019, I think the only unique item that would -- or the unique item that would make us different than the industry in 2019 would be a recovery of the onetime TireHub volume decline that we saw in 2018. ","Anthony Deem","And I think second quarter was 0.5 million unit impact. Can you remind us what third quarter was? If the fourth quarter... ","Darren Wells","Yes. So the third quarter, it was less than 0.5 million.","Anthony Deem","Right, yes. Okay, got you. Alright. thank you very much.","Darren Wells","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take today's final question from David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","David Tamberrino","Great. Darren, for the raw materials, can you just describe to us what the non-feedstock cost increases are and what's driving it? Is it higher logistics cost? Is it worse internal utilization? Is it something else? ","Darren Wells","Sure. And I think that -- listen, the biggest individual factor in the non-feedstock for us right now is the some -- the loss of Chinese supply for a lot of commodities, which it isn't -- strictly speaking, it isn't the feedstocks that are going into suppliers that are rising, but the -- I guess, the number of suppliers available has gone down, and we have had to shift to higher-cost suppliers or we have had to offset the cost of the investments that our existing suppliers in China are making to meet new environmental standards.","And to the extent it's offsetting investment they're making, it doesn't mean that their inputs are -- the cost of their inputs are going up, it's the cost of their production that's going up, and we have to cover that.","And we separate those two in order to sort of make it clear what's being driven by the movement in observable commodity prices in the marketplace versus what is unique to us and our industry. So I that's the single biggest factor. ","David Tamberrino","Got it. That makes sense, and it is helpful for you to break it out that way. And just another one for you, Darren, before I have a question for Rich. Should we interpret your comments about debt levels and use of free cash flow to kind of help pay that down over time as a change in direction from the balance strategy from a capital allocation perspective that -- did you previously employed? ","Darren Wells","Well, I think it's certainly a reflection of the experience we've had for the last couple of years. So when we get to this part of the cycle, I think our minds turned to a different place. I think the balanced strategy was very applicable when we were making -- when we were generating enough cash flow to pay for restructurings and capital investments -- reinvestments in the business and cover our dividend and have cash left over for both debt repayment and shareholder return programs. So it made sense -- may have made sense that at that point in time.","At this point in time, there's just not enough cash being generated to focus there. And unfortunately, our net debt levels have gone up for the last couple of years, and that's not what we want to see.","We don't want to go through the cycle increasing net -- our net debt in that way. Although we may see leverage go up as a result of lower earnings, I don't think we want to see a net debt rise like that.","So I think given where we are now and what we've experienced in the last couple of years, I think it has changed -- certainly changed our emphasis in the near term. I think as we go back up to peak of the earnings cycle and as we get our level of leverage moving back toward two times on a debt-to-EBITDA basis, then the opportunity just step back and think about a balanced capital allocation strategy is going to come back. But that's a ways off in the future.","David Tamberrino","Understood. I appreciate the clarification. And Rich, I have a question for you. Just on Slide eight, you mentioned a nice OE pipeline two-parter. What opportunities are there for you to regain share? What customers are you seeing this opportunity with? And that's one.","And then further, and but probably will be tied together, but for electric vehicles, what can you do to differentiate your tire versus the competitors? Or what are OEMs really asking for that is differentiated that maybe only a few top players can do?","Richard Kramer","Sure. On the first question, I think our -- the OE fitments that we're winning are really broad-based around the world. So I mentioned earlier in China, we have a number of increased fitments with a lot of local OE manufacturers in China, which is a little bit different than how our footprint -- or how or customer base has been in China over the -- over our historical time since we've been there. So that's one thing, and a lot of those vehicles are EVs as well. So that's a big positive.","Equally so, we continue to work with some of the global manufacturers on winning global fitments in both emerging markets and in the U.S. A lot of those are in the pipeline right now, and we've had big success with some of those fitments.","And as we look in the U.S., our strength continues to be on trucks and SUVs, and that trend is continuing as well. So as we -- as you say, what customers around the world, David, I would tell you, of all the top manufacturers, we are, I would say, increasing our presence with them, both in winning fitments and in working with them on developing tires for new cars coming out.","So we feel very strong about where we are on that. And in terms of the EVs, in terms of what we can do different, I think you can put it in a number of categories. One clearly is just sound, right? I mean, sound and the noise levels in an EV are much different than in a normal vehicle that we're all used to.","So things like what we've done with foam and tire, things like what we've done in terms of just the complexity around making a tire to make sure the uniformity is there, to make sure it's the right materials, to make sure that the tire delivers the ride and consequently the sound of the right where is a big deal, and that gets to both process manufacturing materials and design with the OEMs, and we have a seat at the table for doing that. So that's clearly one thing.","The next thing is around wear, and that involves a lot of the things -- the same things that I said, but wear is very, very important because, as we've talked about in the past, the torque going to the vehicle, the heavier vehicle because of the battery on it, we know that wear can increase anywhere from 20% to some of the sort of faster cars, think of some of the high-end Teslas, we've had numbers that could go up to 50% on those things as well. So wear makes a difference and how we ultimately can construct that tire to give better wear for that vehicle as well is something that we do.","And if you'd say how is that differentiated, I would -- I'd put you to may be a source you wouldn't normally think of. But if you look in our commercial industry, one of the reasons that we have the position we do with the fleets is managing the durability and the wear of those tires, and that is a, again, design process manufacturing and listening to the customers and designing backwards from that.","So those are a few things that make us a great partner for those EVs. And frankly, that's what we're experiencing. Going back to your first question, that's why we're at the table with all those global manufacturers on those EVs because we can bring that expertise and partnership and proven capability to them.","David Tamberrino","Got it. That's really in depth and helpful. Just a follow-up, I know your last question of the call. Does that present the same difficulties that you've seen with some of the SKU proliferation and the larger rim diameter tires? Or do you have enough of a runway between now and when those get to a full ramp that you shouldn't see any capacity issues or supply issues for... ","Richard Kramer","I think the answer is a little bit of both. I mean, the complexity issues aren't going our way. That is going to continue. The size and type proliferation that's out there is absolutely going to continue. That's not going to diminish.","And again, we know how to manage that, but we didn't demonstrate it at this point, and again, take responsibility for that as we look at Q4. But at the end of the day, we know how to do that and we're planning for that to increase, and that's something that we'll manage.","And I think as we look at those OEMs, we look at the fitments, we're committed to making -- to giving in the supply that they want and need. And we're going to do that. So we will have the ability to do it. There's no question about that.","David Tamberrino","Got it. Thank you very much for the time.","Richard Kramer","Thank you. So, I think that was our last call and we want to thank everyone for their attention today and appreciate the support.","Operator","And this will conclude today's program.

Then I\u2019ll turn the call over to Laura for more detail on our first quarter results and to provide our outlook for the remainder of the year.","Now in the quarter, we delivered record segment operating income of $373 million, an increase of 24% over last year\u2019s strong first quarter result. This is a great result for us and a great start to the year. While our global presence exposes us to significant foreign currency fluctuation along with other economic volatility, the strength of our North American and European businesses more than offsets several headwinds in our emerging markets including the impact of Venezuela on our Latin American business.","Our North American business was a major contributor to our success delivering a record quarter with $156 million in segment operating income, a 23% increase over last year. Our Europe and Middle East Africa business generated segment operating income of $110 million, more than three times last year\u2019s first quarter as our profit improvement plan in the region continued to gain traction. Now, as we\u2019ve discussed in our September investor meeting, our target of 10% to 15% annual increase in segment operating income is based on a balance plan of growth and cost. With that in mind I\u2019ll first address our volume in the quarter and then discuss our progress on costs as well.","Now as I comment on our volumes, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to slide five. Our volume in the quarter increased by 1%, but this is not reflect our underlined volume run rate in the quarter as it was largely skewed by the impact of unusually cold January weather in North America. Additionally, first quarter volumes were negatively impacted by the disruptions in Venezuela including our labor contract negotiations which lingered for much of the quarter before being settled in early April.","As the slide shows the run rate of our volumes in February and March are in line with our expectations and looking ahead, we feel good about our volumes in April. I\u2019ll elaborate on both first on North America and then on Venezuela. In North America as you know by now the extreme cold weather had a severe impact on sales of many companies across numerous industries.","This affected some of our biggest OE replacement customers as well and reduced our volumes by 9% in the month of January. Fewer new vehicles were produced then forecasted and many of our replacement customers were forced to close their stores. Distributors also were forced to close their warehouses and consumers simply stayed home because of bad weather. This situation improved throughout the quarter with March volumes increasing 5%.","That directional momentum carried in to April getting back to the strength we saw in the later part of 2013. I\u2019d also note that volumes were affected more than the industry given our significant business with OEMs and certain large retail customers who felt the effects of severe first quarter weather conditions on their business. Our streamline supply chain which is largely triggered by their sellout makes it difficult to recover the weather related volume reductions within the quarter.","So we access volumes in North America, we believe the first quarter was simply a pause in what we see as improving tire demand in 2014. Not only did we see strong shipments in March, but we also saw Goodyear brand share growth in the quarter. Now regarding Venezuela the combination of volatile economic conditions and disruptions due to the labor negotiations had a negative impact of about 1 percentage point on our total company first quarter volumes.","While the situation in Venezuela will remain volatile, we expect our volumes to increase in the second quarter given the conclusion of our labor negotiations. We are already producing tires to near pre negotiation levels and the demand for our tires is extremely robust substantially exceeding our supply at this time. More we\u2019ll have details on our Venezuela outlook later on the call, the second quarter volumes will improve from the depressed first quarter levels.","So overall we feel good about our momentum going in to the second quarter which is in line with our expectations we know the global economies don\u2019t grow in a straight line and that new headwinds and opportunities may present themselves. That we remain firmly committed to our full year volume expectations of 2 to 3% growth. We\u2019ll grow our volume with disciplined execution of our strategy winning in targeted market segments where we can add value for consumers, for our customers and for Goodyear as well.","Now we\u2019ll move on to costs which is the other pillar in our plan. We are very pleased about our progress in cost savings. In the quarter those savings were more than 100 million not including the benefits of lower pension expense from fully funding our US pension plans nor does it include the benefit of the closure of our Amiens France factory. Those savings are on top of the $100 million.","I\u2019m pleased with the fundamental changes we are driving in our operational excellence initiatives. From how we work with our suppliers to how we develop and engage our associates and how we maintain our equipment to significantly improve our assets and liability. The benefits of our global operational excellence initiatives will be seen in our improved reliability in operating efficiencies, our ability to produce more the right tires at the right time to most importantly improve our customer service.","It\u2019s much too early to declare victory, but we had good momentum and continued to gain traction. So in total having delivered record first quarter segment operating income, we continue to be confident in our strategy and our commitment to long-term value creation focused on our balanced plan of growth and cost. Looking back at the first three months of the year, we saw several overall trends they are welled into our business and contributed to our performance, including strong demand for high value added tires, growth opportunities in emerging markets and advanced supply chain to serve customers better and effective marketing that builds brand value. Each of these trends continues to be very robust and matches our strides.","Demand for high value added tires continue to outpace the overall industry especially in our targeted market segments where we continue to set the industry pace with new innovative products. In North America, the new Wrangler All-terrain Adventure for light trucks and SUVs has been selling extremely well in their replacement market and we anticipate continued mix improvement when we assuring all season beings to shipping to customers later this quarter. The new assurance will join the already strong strung family of insurance ComforTred, TripleTred and Fuel Max products. Our customers tell us that they expect the assurance all season will become a high volume broad market tire, enhancing the value of our mid-tier offerings.","In our EMEA business, we saw 6% consumer replacement growth. The increased volume reflected improved sell out and continuing recovery in the region as we are helping our customers grow their businesses by providing them more of our high value branded products. In Europe, Goodyear efficient grip performance, and Dunlop\u2019s quarterly response for rank first and second in the German Automobile Club\u2019s recent summer tire tests. The combination of impressive third party rankings and industry leading tire label grades across our portfolio has its very optimistic about the upcoming summer tire selling season. I can say confidently during my time at Goodyear, we have never had a stronger line up of Goodyear branded products around the world then we have today.","Now another trend that remains strong is growth opportunities in emerging markets. Excluding the issues in Venezuela, our consumer replacement volumes increased 10% in the rest of Latin America during the quarter. Our investments to produce more high value added tires in our Americana plants in Brazil have resulted in a steady cadence of new product introductions across the region. Goodyear Assurance, Eagle Sport and Wrangler SUV tires were launched to consumers in Brazil during the first quarter and will be introduced to other country throughout 2014. These innovative products illustrate our commitment to winning in growth markets. Also we continue to improve our customer service as Goodyear was named the 2013 Supplier of the Year by Wal-Mart Mexico and Central America.","Goodyear Mexico achieved it's recognition through its innovation strategies, customer excellence and service and production in customer support. This is a terrific honor for our team there. As the Latin America market continues its conversion to HVA tires, our investments, new products and distribution networks are helping build our brand strength, more and more will capturing the opportunities for growth that this region presents energizing our dealers and our associates are like. Our advantage of supply chain is helping us swim with customers in the share markets as well. During a recent visit to Europe, one of our major customers told me that Goodyear\u2019s fill rates were at levels he had never experienced before and well above other suppliers. In fact, he asked his team to double check the date which of course proved to be accurate. This kind of real customer feedback is the proof for me that our initiatives are working. This is a specific on the ground example of the progress we\u2019ve made in our EMEA business and confirmation that our focus on operational excellence is yielding results. We\u2019re driving efficiency across the supply chain to reduce cost and working capital are improving customer service. We\u2019re extending our value proposition beyond great innovative tires, we\u2019ve made progress but have much more room for improvement and I can say that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re intending to do.","And finally, we\u2019re helping grow the value of the Goodyear brand through increased marketing support, most visible in the United State. For example, this year marks the 60th anniversary of our supplier relationship with NASCAR. We often say that NASCAR drivers are our most demanding customers and superior performance on the track inspires confidence and trust in all of our products. Goodyear brand loyalty among NASCAR fans is as strong as ever. We\u2019re also making great progress in driving consumer demand through digital platforms. Goodyear.com is now far and away the most visited North American tire manufacturing website. It\u2019s driving an already high and increasing volume of purchase ready leads to Goodyear\u2019s preferred network of dealers. Our marketing strategies to drive demand to our preferred dealers have been very effective in improving tire mix consistent with our focus on targeted market segments.","I\u2019m very excited about the progress we\u2019ve made with innovative marketing technologies and again, I can tell you we\u2019re only getting started here. Now in addition to that, we recently unveiled the next generation of our world famous corporate icon, the Goodyear Blimp. With nearly 90 years of equity built into this symbol of dependability, the new state-of-the-art airship will embody the innovation that has become synonymous with Goodyear. Starting this summer, you\u2019ll see the first Blimp in our new fleet supporting our brand, our products and customers across North America.","Our brand is our number one asset and you will us continue to leverage it more and more to drive growth around the world. Our first quarter results offer further evidence that we are solidly on the path toward being profitable through the economic cycle, one of the keys to our destination of creating sustainable economic value. We had many positives in the quarter that helped us offset the challenges and will service fuel to continue our momentum. The underlying industry trends remain strong and favor our competitive advantages.","Clearly we\u2019re pleased with our 24% year-over-year segment operating income growth. But as we\u2019ve said repeatedly, we\u2019re running our business for the long term and this is just one quarter in a multiyear plan. Our emphasis remains on executing our strategy and staying on track to achieve our 2014-2016 target of 10% to 15% annual segment operating income growth. We\u2019re committed to our strategy road map and to our destination of creating sustainable economic value.","Now before I conclude, I\u2019d like to acknowledge an honor our company received last month when Goodyear was named the world\u2019s most admired motor vehicle parts company by Fortune Magazine. This recognition is a testament to the hard work of all 69,000 Goodyear associates around the world and the progress we\u2019ve made together in taking Goodyear to a new level of performance. It validates the success of our strategy roadmap and serves as a meaningful mile marker on our journey towards creating sustainable value. And with that, I\u2019ll not turn the call over to Laura.","Laura Thompson","Thank you, Rich and good morning everyone. First, I\u2019ll start with the review of the first quarter and then I\u2019ll provide an update on our outlook for 2014. We\u2019ll then open the call for your questions. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 11 and review a few key items on the income statement. As Rich stated, we are pleased with the start of the year. In the quarter, segment operating income increased 24% versus a year ago which is a great way to start the year. I\u2019ll go into more detail later on each of the businesses, but strong performance from our more developed markets in North America and Europe offset weakness in emerging markets and Latin America and Asia.","For the quarter, revenue was down 8% or $384 million and is primarily due to two items. First, lower non-tire related revenue of $202 million driven by a lower third party chemical sales in north America and second, the impact from unfavorable foreign currency exchange of $126 million driven primarily by the weakening of the Brazilian Real, Venezuelan Bolivar and Australian dollar. We generated growth margin of 21.3%, an improvement of 250 basis points versus the prior year. SAG increased by $22 million. This increase reflects higher incentive compensation cost, primarily driven by improved operating results and our higher stock price which has more than doubled since March 31 of 2013.","We achieved $373 million in segment operating income and 8.3% in SOI margin. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter where SOI margin has exceeded 8%. Excluding the significant items listed on Slide 21, our first quarter tax rate as a percentage of foreign segment operating income was about 16%. Our earnings per share on a diluted basis for the quarter is net loss of $0.23. Our results were impacted by certain significant items including a change in the foreign currency rate at which we translate the financial statements of our Venezuelan operations. You saw this in our April 10th 8K filing. This change resulted in a foreign currency charge of $132 million or $0.47 per share. After allowing for those certain items our adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.56.","A summary of those significant items can be found in appendix of today\u2019s presentation on slide 21, the step chart on slide 12 walks first quarter 2013 segment operating income the first quarter 2014 segment operating income. Higher sales volumes and higher fourth quarter production levels resulting in an improvement in unabsorbed overhead benefited our results by $50 million year-over-year. Strong costs savings for the quarter more than offset the negative impact of inflation for a net benefit of $36 million. Lower raw material costs more than offset reduced price mix for net benefit of $17 million.","Our mix was negatively impacted in the quarter by a significant reduction in off-the-road tire sales, these tires are used primarily in the mining industry. Foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $16 million year-over-year. Overall our $71 million improvement in segment operating income demonstrates the ongoing success of our strategy, our ability to navigate to difficult political and economic conditions and our focus on controlling costs as a key element to our balanced plan for achieving 10% to 15% SOI growth per year.","Now let\u2019s turn to the balance sheet information on slide 13. Cash and cash equivalent at the end of the first quarter were $1.9 billion down from $3 billion at the end of the 2013 as we utilized almost $1.2 billion to fully fund the hourly U.S. pension plans in January. Our global unfunded pension obligations are now largely international pay-as-you go plan.","Our net debt totaled $5.3 billion at the end of quarter an increase of $2 billion compared with the end of last year. The change is primarily due to three things, first the use of almost $1.2 billion in cash to fully fund the hourly US pension plans, second a seasonal billed and working capital and third the re-measurement due to the changes in Venezuela\u2019s currency rate. As a final point, I also want to mention that we used approximately $23 million to repurchase 850,000 shares of Goodyear common stock during the first quarter.","This repurchase is part of our shareholder return program announced last September. Free cash flow from operations is shown on slide 14. As expected during the first quarter of 2014, we used $513 million of cash, driven by working capital increase of $590 million. We typically see a seasonal working capital increase in the first quarter as the normal timing of winter tire collections in Europe drive fourth quarter receivable balances lower. Additionally, we build inventory in the first quarter to support our strong forecasted sales in North America in the second quarter.","Moving now to the business units on slide 15, I\u2019ll start with North America. Our North America business unit continues to deliver strong results. North America reported record first quarter segment operating income of $156 million over 8% of sales this is an increase of 23% year-over-year. Our volumes were down 1% in the quarter. As Rich described earlier we were impacted more in the industry given our significant relationships with OEMs and certain large customers who felt the effects of the severe first quarter weather conditions on their businesses. Strong consumer tire shipments in the month of the March contributed to the bigger branded share growth in the quarter. North America also released the raw material cost benefits of $61 million that is largely offset by lower price mix of $58 million. Price was impacted by reductions provided through raw material pass-through agreement with OE, fleet and OTR customers.","Mix was negatively impacted by significantly less sales of off-the-road tires. Our manufacturing cost was $47 million lower than the first quarter last year and benefited from improved factory utilization, lower pension expense and lower profit sharing. North America\u2019s segment operating income at 8% a sale result in a return on invested capital that generates significant economic value and makes growth in North America business and attractive investments.","Europe, Middle-East and Africa delivered segment operating of $110 million in the first quarter, a significant improvement over last year. SOI margin increased to 6.6% from 1.9% in the prior year. The first quarter 2014 was the fourth consecutive quarter with year-over-year earnings growth. Volumes increased 7% year-over-year in the first quarter. Our replacement and OE volume increases were mainly driven by improved industry conditions, continued focus on targeting profitable volume growth and the progress that we have made on improving our customer service.","EMEA\u2019s performance in the first quarter also reflects continued success in the commercial business, where we had volume growth in our fleet business as well as in Eastern Europe. We also experienced positive price mix in our commercial business demonstrating our strong product and service proposition. Factory utilizations further improved in the first quarter and as previously announced, we closed one of our factories in Amiens, France.","We continue to closely monitor the situation in Ukraine and Russia. Thus far the situation has not had a material impact on our overall EMEA business, as the scale of our Ukrainian operations in relatively small. In summary we continue to focus on our previously announced profit improvement plans to restore our Europe, middle-east and Africa business to historical levels of profitability. The significant improvement and the run rate of our profitability over the past twelve months is reflective of the economic recovery as well as the result of the actions we have taken thus far. EMEA is off to a good start in 2014, but of course we have more work to do.","Turning to Latin America, operating income was $42 million for the quarter, $18 million less than the prior year. All of the year-over-year decline in earnings can be attributed to lower production and profitability in Venezuela as a result of labor disruption and the overall unfavorable foreign currency exchange for the business units. Positive price mix price mix and lower raw material cause offset the negative effects of inflation, lower volume and the ramp-up cost of our Brazil plant expansion. We saw 10% growth in our consumer replacement volumes in Latin America outside of Venezuela, driven by a strong response to our new product.","This growth was more than offset by the temporary volume decline in Venezuela and the lower OE volumes in Brazil, where vehicle manufactures reduced productions significantly in the first quarter.","As you may remember, we highlighted the slowdown on our year-end call and as expected it has materialized. In addition to the foreign currency change previously mentioned, we expected that the government price and profit margin controls and a reduced production during the first quarter to adversely impact Latin America\u2019s segment operating income by $40 million to $60 million for 2014 with about $10 million of that impact having already occurred in the first quarter. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and adjust the changing circumstances as needed. Our Asia-Pacific business reported segment operating income of $65 million for the quarter, a $19 million decrease year-over-year. The decline in operating income is driven by unfavorable foreign currency exchange of $8 million and a significant decline in our off the road tire sales. Unit volumes of $5.2 million in Asia were about 2% higher than a year ago given strong growth in India and modest growth in China which more than offset the impact of weaker demand in Australia. Relative to China, we remain optimistic about the long term. But we anticipate more short term demand fluctuations as the Chinese economy continues to evolve.","We have successfully navigated volatility in this market before and I am confident we will do so again in 2014. We realize growth in China will not be a straight line as the quarter demonstrated. The long term picture remains positive and we are committed to winning in China. In total, our four SPUs increased segment operating income by 24% year-over-year, a great way to start the year. Now looking at the full year, the key segment operating income drivers are listed on Slide 16. In line with our 2014 to 2016 targets, we continue to see sales volume growth of 2% to 3% for 2014, as the ongoing economic recovery in EMEA and growth in North America is expected to offset emerging market weakness particularly in Latin America.","For 2014, we are assuming price mix and raw material cost changes will be slightly positive reflecting the first quarter benefit and continued lower raw material cost more than offsetting the negative mix impact of the lower OTR sales that are expected for the remainder of the year. Since we last talked on our year-end earnings call, we have seen demand and price for OTR tires decline as mine operators control their costs and work down inventories. We now see more moderate growth in OTR demand for 2014 based on the mining industry reacting to lower commodity prices. That said we expect increases in our tire production volumes will generate approximately $50 million to $75 million in benefits from lower unabsorbed overhead for the full year.","While our overall production volumes are essentially consistent to what we expected at the time of our fourth quarter call, the weakness in the global mining industry is having an impact on the mix of production. Given that large OTR tires carry a much higher per unit unabsorbed overhead cost versus an average tire, we now see the remaining benefits of increased consumer and commercial production being attenuated by the impact of lower OTR units. We expect our cost savings initiative to fully offset the combined impact of general inflation as well as our further investments in advertising, marketing and R&D. While our level of advertising was essentially unchanged in the first quarter from prior year, we expect advertising and marketing investments will increase during the remainder of 2014 to support our growth plan.","Based on current spot rates, we expect a negative foreign currency exchange impact of approximately $60 million for the year. This includes the headwinds due to the change in exchange rates for Venezuela, although it does not assume any further devaluation of the Bolivar. We expect that benefits from decreasing startup expenses at our new state-of-the-art plant in China to be $20 million to $25 million year-over-year. This benefit will be offset by the increased cost related to the modernization of our plant in Brazil which are also expected to be $20 million to $25 million in 2014.","The closure of our Amiens facility in the first quarter will generate approximately $40 million of savings in 2014. And as a reminder, the annualized benefit of this closure and the related exit from the farm tire business in Europe will be approximately $75 million. We have included the pension expense savings on the key segments operating income driver slide to highlight that $80 million of the overall reduction in pension expense flows through SOI. Additional financial assumptions for 2014 are listed on Slide 17.","For the year, we expect interest expense in the range of $430 million to $455 million and financing fees of approximately $60 million. Our income tax is expected to be approximately 25% of international SOI. As discussed on our last call, each quarter we assess current profitability and weather sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize existing deferred tax assets. The result of the analysis continues to lead us to believe that we maybe in a position to release all or a portion of the U.S. valuation allowance during the second half of 2014.","If the valuation allowance is released in 2014, the expected increase in annual tax expense for 2015 and beyond will be approximately $150 million per year, although we do not anticipate any U.S. cash taxes for at least five years and significantly reduced rate for several years thereafter. Including the positive benefit on earnings, a prefunding and freezing the hourly U.S. pension plan, we expect global pension expense of approximately $175 million in 2014. We expect global pension cash contribution to be about $1.3 billion including the recent, almost $1.2 billion that was put into the hourly U.S. plan.","For the year, we expect our working capital to be neither a significant source, nor a significant use of cash. And our capital expenditures and depreciation amortization outlook are unchanged from our last call. Our financial targets for 2014 to 2016 are listed on Slide 18. They remain unchanged and we remain committed to achieving these targets. Annual 10% to 15% segment operating income growth per year through 2016 delivered through a balance plan of unit volume growth and cost savings. Annual positive free cash flow from operations and adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times by the end of 2016.","Our first quarter performance confirms that our strategy is working and gives us further confidence in achieving our targets. As demand continues to improve, we are well positioned with quality products, highly technical manufacturing capability, our well established distribution network and a trusted and respected global brand to create incremental value for our consumers, our customers and our shareholders. Based on our strong 2013 cash flow and recent funding of our hourly U.S. pension plan, our board is in the process of reviewing the balanced capital allocation plan that we shared with you in September of 2013.","We remain committed to a plan that will ensure we achieve our leveraged targets while continuing to invest in high return growth CapEx initiative and providing for shareholder return programs. As always, we will be balanced in our approach with a focus on growing long term shareholder value. We will present our updated capital allocation plan on May 29, as part of the Keybanc Automotive Conference in Boston.","Now, we would be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll take our first question from Itay Michaeli with Citi. Please go ahead, you\u2019re line is open.","Rich Kramer","Good morning, Itay.","Itay Michaeli - Citi ","Good morning. There just couple of questions. One, may be you allude us to just now or few minutes ago, but on the financing fee of $60 million it seems like it\u2019s a new item for the full year. Does that relate to this capital structure announcements that you\u2019re planning for late May or is that something different?","Laura Thompson","No, it does not relate to that in any way. It has always been an expense for us, it\u2019s an addition to the interest expense we show you on the outlook pages, but it\u2019s always above $15 million a quarter and we really just gave it to give more transparency, we\u2019ve got some questions on it in the past.","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citi","Okay. It\u2019s not like a new headwind, but just a little bit more detail on that \u2013 detail, okay.","Tom Kaczynski ","But, Itay, just to be clear, it\u2019s Tom. Those are financing fees that are amortized the debt issuance fees and also factoring fees and they run 14 to 15 million a quarter so we\u2019ve always have in other expense, but we wanted to provide just a little bit more transparency on that.","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citi","Great, thanks for that clarification, Tom. And then just hoping you can talk about the cadence for the rest of the year, both for SOI and also particularly for volume, given the short fall the headwinds in Venezuela because of labor disruptions, I think you mentioned maybe that was a point of volume and the catch up in weather, should we think about the second quarter volume maybe at the higher end of 2 to 3% or above, I hope you can help us kind of better model the cadence for volume and any thoughts cadence for SOI as well would be helpful?","Rich Kramer","Yeah, Itay, I\u2019ll start on volume and Laura can jump in on SOI as well. I would say the first quarter was as we said a pause we had a number anomalies and most significant where that the weather in particularly the January weather in North America which we try to pick for you in the slide included in the deck. That was a really an anomaly that really impacted the full quarter, but really wasn\u2019t reflected indicative of the trend that we saw particularly in consumer replacement. So I think number one first quarter for North America really you have to look at the trend coming out of February and March, maybe I add even a little bit more color to that, we gave you sort of total reportable units on slide five in the deck, if I take that back to consumer replacement January was actually more severe it was down higher than the 9% about 11% and February, March were actually stronger than the total in consumer replacement, we\u2019re up 3 in February and up 7 in March.","So with the volume we had I think it makes our North America earnings really very impressive in terms of what the team put forward. But I think if you look at those run rates I think it get us back to the expected run rates 2% to 3%. In terms of Venezuela we will see second quarter units come back after we\u2019ve got the team working back there in the factory I mean we literally have people stacked up at our stores to buy tires, so Q2 volume will improve in Venezuela. The Brazil OE volumes that Laura mentioned those will continue to be an issue for us probably for the balance of the year, you\u2019re very familiar with what happening with the OEMs down there.","And I might add even a little bit more color to China. In China what we\u2019re seeing again we believe in a long-term for certain, but what were we really seeing there is a combination of a little bit weaker economy, and we see we\u2019re going to tightening credits for reasons I think everyone on the call is familiar with and we see dealers holding back a bit because of decreasing natural rubber which flows to their inventory faster than other parts of the world. So as we look to the balance of the year we think that the China will also improve from a volume perspective. In terms of the 2% to 3% trend moving ahead I think that we really aren\u2019t going to get any more specific in terms of the high end or low end of the range, there are so many things that we have to factor into it and I think we\u2019re happy saying 2 to 3% is a best guidance we want to give on that.","Laura Thompson","And as for the SOI cadence for the year, we are really pleased with the first quarter performance but as we look out right, you\u2019ve heard us talk about headwinds really for us all we can say is that the SOI are, what we reaffirmed our target today is that for the year SOI will be up 10% to 15%.","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citi","Perfect, thank you both for all the clarification. Just last question on, good to see that the price mix versus raw was revised a slightly positive for the year, the spread in Q1 was $17 million, Laura is that good way to think about 17 a good way to kind of model what slightly positive would mean on a go forward basis for the full or there is puts and takes that maybe suggest Q1 might not be an indicative run rate for the full year?","Laura Thompson","So, to answer to your question, Q1 would be indicative of how to look at the balance of the year and included in that outlook is sizeable negative impact from our OTR business on mix. But what we did in the first quarter is a good way to look at the balance of the year.","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citi","Terrific. Thanks so much for the detail, appreciated.","Rich Kramer","Thank you. ","Laura Thompson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Laura Thompson","Hi, Pat.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","Yeah. Thank you very much and good morning. I guess, the slide five was very helpful and where you go out there, you presented that to help us think about what sort of the undistorted run rate is, but I guess the question is this, in aggregate, right for north America you were down a little bit because January was so weak. Can you just help to understand like how that contrast to some of the quarterly data that comes out from things like the RMA and I guess Michelin also, I mean, I understand that those are not perfect metrics, some they may pull only certain members and have some timing differences, but you know maybe just a little color on that would be helpful.","Rich Kramer","Pat I think it\u2019s actually a very good question. I tried to allude to this in my remarks as well. So as we look at it, and I\u2019ll focus on consumer replacements specifically, we would say the industry grew about 1% in the quarter and I think your rate reported point there is different views of that, so excuse me, 3% in the quarter not one, but there is rightly different views on that as you look at all those. So we would say consumer placement up three, our volumes obviously didn\u2019t keep pace and in particular I would tell you that we were impacted more significantly by the January weather than the overall industry and that\u2019s by in large because we have our both \u2013 our OE and our replacement large retail customers are really serviced in sort of a real time basis focused on sell out rather than stacking inventory if you will.","So when they get in that and impacted by weather it impacts us more significantly than others. And let me give you maybe a couple of quick examples and I\u2019ll start with OE because I think it\u2019s a model everyone is familiar with, we shift really to a just-in-time cadence there, which our OEM customers obviously take our tires and put them on cars as they use them for sale or they put them out for sale immediately.","When they shutdown which they did in the quarter, because of \u2013 they slowed down off late in the quarter because of the weather as well, we stopped shipping until they start again and there is not inventory buildup. And again I think you understand that model. So while this isn\u2019t going to be a perfect analog, a similar situation happens to us with certain of our large retail customers, because to a significant degree, excuse me, we shift to them really with that every efficient supply chain, it\u2019s really there to support and sellout. And if their sellout slowed down again because of the weather like it did in the quarter, we get that direct impact to our volumes and like the OEMs, we typically have a \u2013 I think a very important point, we have a large share of the OEMs as we do some of these large regional retailers or excuse large retail customers, so when they feel this impact, it impacts us disproportionately.","And I would say we did feel this in the first quarter because of weather which frankly was the first time I\u2019ve ever experienced that since I\u2019ve been with the company, but for us this is great business, we serve it with an advantage supply chain that focuses on their sellout getting tires for them to sell to consumers and where we\u2019re doing this bumper cause in Q1 because it\u2019s really a better customer base for us to go forward and sell. We\u2019d rather sell tires to go out to consumers than just get stacked up into inventory. So really a first quarter aberration I would tell you than a trend and I think you rightly pointed out focus on those sort of coming out trends of the quarter rather than the building in trend.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","Thank you. Yeah, that\u2019s definitely helpful. On slide 7, my follow-up question was just on Europe and specifically what you are seeing for the summer tire season. I think you had said that in the past sort of last year, you weren\u2019t as well positioned competitively. On your slide 7, you highlight a couple of new products there. So maybe can you address a) what \u2013 how you feel your position for this year ahead of the summer season and also if you could give us some color on the level of inventories within EMEA for summer that would be helpful as well.","Rich Kramer","Sure. I would say \u2013 I was \u2013 in fact I was just over there a couple of weeks ago and I would tell you in terms of our preparation for the summer selling season, our team over there including many of the people that have been with our company for a long period of time would say unequivocally that we have the best summer product line that they\u2019ve had in their long ten year career is a good year. This gets to a combination of the industry leading [indiscernible] that we had as well as some of the new products that are out being graded by the summer magazines. As I\u2019ve pointed out, we won a good year in Dunlop brand, we\u2019re number one and number two slot in a very important German magazine test and remember \u2013 those tests are raided more than on just a label but on numerous other performance characteristics as well, so as we head into the season, absolutely well prepared to do that.","And I would tell you that we referred to in the prior year let\u2019s say with some customer service issues where we wanted to sharp on and I would tell you we have made very significant improvements in our customer service, our advantaged supply chain is working better, much better for us over there. In fact it\u2019s why I tried to highlight one of the examples in my remarks earlier. So I do think we\u2019re well positioned. I think Europe inventories are generally in pretty good shape over there. So I think we should be in good shape going into the quarter \u2013 into the summer selling season, we feel very good about it. And I would tell you we are also already as out as it seems and are getting ready for the winter season as well. And as you could imagine reporting a lot of effort to make sure we\u2019re well prepared for that coming into 2014.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Terrific. Thanks for all the information.","Rich Kramer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Rich Kramer","Good morning, Lache.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Good morning. A couple of things. It sounds like you are saying that the North American volume performance and market share of this quarter was an aberration, so just to clarify, going forward would you expect the demand for good year to track more closely to the industry and just broadly speaking obviously we\u2019re seeing better data on replacement demands in North America and Europe both for light vehicle and commercial tires. Has there been any change associated with that in the level of discounting in the market or of course that fills in the market just as it would seem that their capacity utilization would begin to tighten up?","Rich Kramer","Rod, I guess, the first thing is, as we came out of North America in the last few months, as we look at this, as we had very \u2013 a very strong growth in our targeted market segments and we had increase in our Goodyear branded share and I think those are two things to point out as we ask our volumes relative to the rest of the industry. Remember, we are focused on those parts of the market where we can add the best value for our customers, for our consumers, and for ourselves. And I think that\u2019s absolutely the path that we\u2019re going to continue to go on.","We look at the market I agree with you, the market environment in North America remains very good. The underlying demand for our tires is very strong and should even get better as we look at the introduction of the assurance all season and to our new product line and our customer service continues to improve and be very good. So I think we feel very positive about how we feel versus the industry for the balance of the year.","And relative to the notion of the supply, demand equation in North America. I would tell you maybe the best way to continue to say this is, we still see the demand and growth for HVA tires in many cases particularly when you bring OE into the picture being a bit tight for those tires in terms of the supply. So supply and demand probably are not equal yet in terms of where HVA growth is and we don\u2019t think as we look for the long term that, that\u2019s going to balance yourself out on global basis. And I think that\u2019s true a bit in North America. I think you\u2019ll see points in time where that may change, but over the long term I think the growth in HVA will still be very significant.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank","And could you just clarify you are thinking in terms of the outlook for raw materials going forward there is obviously lag between what we see in the stock markets and your P&L, you\u2019re expecting some greater benefit on that line in Q2. And maybe also comment on the outlook for the other tire related businesses, obviously dragging down the results a bit in first quarter. How should we be thinking about that for the rest of the year?","Laura Thompson","Okay. So I\u2019ll take the first one on raw materials first. So in the first quarter, as expected, our raw material costs declined 6% year-over-year and based on current tire rates we do expect that to continue for the balance of the year fairly evenly across the quarters. And then as for the other tire related businesses, we have a neutral outlook as we put on page 16 of the presentation the impact of the unabsorbed overhead for OTR tires is already build in to the unabsorbed overhead outlook on that same chart.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. So you\u2019re saying down 6% per quarter the rest of the year for the raw materials and then neutral year-over-year for chemicals business just to clarify.","Laura Thompson","Yes, exactly.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank","The last thing I didn\u2019t hear you comment at all on the commercial truck tire business which obviously the much higher margin business for everybody, I seems like that business has been pretty strong here both in North America and Europe. Is that a meaningful tailwind for you at this point?","Rich Kramer","Rod, I think you\u2019re right to point out both things, one we didn\u2019t focus on as much in our remarks today, but in Europe and North America coming out of 13 we\u2019ve done very well in the truck business and I would say we have \u2013 it is the bit of tailwind and I think part of that\u2019s driven by our product portfolio that is in very high demand as well as our service model particularly in North America. In fact you see more and more companies trying to get in to that service model sort of fleet solutions business and we\u2019re in as well. And that\u2019s really driving volumes in to replacement market as we put together cradle-to-grave value proposition that our fleets are really putting value on, so they\u2019re looking at us we\u2019re not just provide a tire but keep their up time moving and that\u2019s been very successful for us.","From an OE perspective we also see that the demand for new trucks continue to be strong and I would say that\u2019s benefit to us as we look ahead as well. In summary Ron I think the truck business is something that\u2019s been going very well for us, in mature markets and as we look at the introduction our truck products in China we continue to see very good growth there, remember we\u2019re fairly small player but we put in equipment and make those truck tires we introduce multiple new products there is working very well for us. And finally in Latin America we had a significant truck presence there as well and those markets even in tougher economies particularly in Brazil our truck products are still moving very well.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank ","Benefit from that not quite as large as the negative from the OTR is that why you focused on the OTR in your comments?","Rich Kramer","Yeah. I mean, Rod, as an item OTR clearly given the mix that becomes in from those OTR tires, remember our revenue per tire for an OTR tire could be anywhere from couple thousand bucks to 50 or $60,000 so as you lose some of those 57, 63 inch tires there, they\u2019re fairly significant to the mix item we thought that something that we needed to point out.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank ","Thank you.","Rich Kramer","Thanks Rod.","Laura Thompson","Thanks Rod.","Operator","Thank you and our final question will come from Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc Capital. Please go ahead.","Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital","Good morning.","Rich Kramer","Good morning, Brett.","Laura Thompson","Good morning.","Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital","I was just going to ask you this kind of conceptual question about Europe which will be with the assignment of Darren over to Europe there\u2019s been some speculation I think in the events in the community is that, you might make some additional plans or announcements with regards to your strategy in Europe kind of over and above what you\u2019ve already discussed is that a possibility or should we consider that assignment is execution on what your current plans or stated plans are at this point?","Rich Kramer","Yeah, Brett, I would say from our strategic direction I would point you back to what we talked about in the September Investor Meeting there\u2019s been no changes from that we\u2019ve been trying to be very clear about that we\u2019re committed to that. Our team across the globes and all our business units each have their roles as well as our functions and delivering that plan and I would say that\u2019s what Darren\u2019s focus as part of his assignment as well. So it\u2019s really about us delivering the plan and frankly setting ourselves up for future growth beyond that.","Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital","Excellent, thank you very much.","Rich Kramer","Thanks, Brett. Okay. Thanks every one. We appreciate it. And thanks for your attention today.","Laura Thompson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference, you may disconnect at any time. And have a great day."],"9913":["Goodyear Tire & Rubber (NASDAQ:GT) Q4 2012 Earnings Call February 12, 2013  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Gregory A.

My name is Kevin, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the program over to Greg Fritz, Goodyear's Vice President of Investor Relations.","Gregory A. Fritz","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Goodyear's Fourth Quarter 2012 Conference Call. Joining me today are Rich Kramer, Chairman and CEO; and Darren Wells, Executive Vice President and CFO. On today's call, Rich and Darren will discuss our fourth quarter results, 2013 outlook and review the pension strategy we announced this morning.","Before we get started, there are a few items I need to cover. To begin, the supporting slide presentation for today's call can be found on our website at investor.goodyear.com. A replay of this call will be available later today. Replay instructions were included in our earnings release issued earlier this morning.","If I can now direct your attention to the Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Today's presentation includes some forward-looking statements about Goodyear's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments today. The most significant factors that could affect future results are outlined in Goodyear's filings with the SEC and in the earnings release. The company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","The financial results presented are on a GAAP basis and in some cases, a non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP financial measures discussed in the call are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent as part of the appendix to the slide presentation.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Rich.","Richard J. Kramer","Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Today I'll discuss our fourth quarter and full year results, elaborate on significant progress we have made, comment on the areas where we face challenges and discuss our plans to address these challenges. I'll also provide some perspective on the year ahead. But let me say upfront that overall, I'm particularly pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results and the execution of our strategy. The exception, however, is Europe as its economy continues to worsen despite some recent financial stability.","Now before I get started, let me provide some context. Industry volumes in 2012 were a challenge throughout the year, and in particular, mature markets were close to levels that we saw during the great recession. In the U.S., the economy improved, lifting OE sales, but replacement volumes remained depressed. In Europe, economic weakness continued, and consumer sales, which had been resilient in 2011, became increasingly weaker throughout the year. Though Latin America and parts of Asia were stable, growth was not robust, and some of our key markets, such as Australia, were extremely weak. That provides the backdrop for both our success and our challenges in 2012.","Overall, our segment operating income for 2012 was just over $1.2 billion, marking the second year in a row and only the third time in the company's history that we've reached that level of performance. Now in addition, we delivered strong cash results for the year as our progress on working capital helped generate $700 million of free cash flow from operations. These positive results were driven by strong performance in 3 of our 4 businesses.","In Latin America, we delivered solid fourth quarter results that reflect a stabilizing business. Investments in our operations in Brazil are helping reenergize the business in our most important market in the region. In addition, our businesses outside Brazil delivered historically strong results. Our focus on asset utilization and investment to increase our production capability in the region is aligned with our strategy to mix up in the faster growing premium market segments where our brand, our technology and our innovation have the most value.","Asia Pacific delivered record segment operating income of $259 million for the year. Weakness in Australia, our largest business in the region by revenue, created a challenge for both the top line and for earnings. Offsetting this weakness was solid performance in the ASEAN countries and strong growth in China. We're beginning to see the benefits of our strategic investments in China, which supports our focus on premium segments, where we continue to increase share by growing faster than the industry.","The highlight of our 2012 performance came from our North America business. A record fourth quarter pushed our full year earnings to $514 million, beating our 2013 target of $450 million a year early. In addition, the business delivered a margin of 5.3%, marking the first time in more than 10 years that North America has achieved that level. Also, we're recovering our cost of capital. Not only are we generating profit, but we are creating economic value.","As you know, returning our North America business to profitability is one of the key strategies on our strategy roadmap. We delivered these results in NAT through disciplined delivery against the key how-to's. For example, we focused on market-back innovation. By reenergizing our brands through the simplification and complete rejuvenation of our Assurance, Eagle and Wrangler product lines over the past 4 years, our product portfolio is the best in the industry. These are tires that consumers want to buy and customers want to sell. We targeted profitable segments. By making choices on where to play, supported by deep analytics, we identified those segments of the market that offer profitable volume growth and where our value proposition is a competitive advantage. As a result, we achieved improved price mix and grew share in these key segments.","Another illustration of winning in targeted market segments was in the original equipment business. We partnered with key OE customers, rather than pushing volume for volume's sake. Today, Goodyear is not only on 7 of the top 10 selling vehicles in the United States but also has a profitable OE business. We make strides in operational excellence as well, becoming a better supplier for our customers while simultaneously reducing inventory and improving efficiency. Our North America supply chain is a clear competitive advantage and, going forward, will only continue to improve.","Credit for executing our strategy goes to our North American team, led by Steve McClellan. At our annual North America Dealer Conference 2 weeks ago, our customers praised the team for its consistency and the clarity of its plan and for the integration of the business's goals with those of our dealers. Our team has never been more closely aligned with our customers and their business.","I'm proud of our progress in NAT, whose turnaround is comparable to any in the auto industry. In 2009, this business lost more than $300 million. In 2012, we delivered record earnings but more importantly, built the foundation of sustainable economic value creation in line with our strategy. And while we clearly have momentum, it's not enough. We're not focused on 1 year of earnings. We're focused on results delivered consistently over the long term.","So in addition to driving the key tenets of our strategy, we must continue to focus on productivity improvements, and we must address the ongoing volatility from our existing defined benefit pension plans. We will address both of these issues as we drive toward consistent value creation.","Now even with the success in North America, our 2012 results were tempered by ongoing challenges in Europe. During the fourth quarter, it became increasingly clear that the effects of the European economic crisis will be felt for an extended period of time. While recently, there has been some stabilization, we believe there has yet to be a comprehensive and lasting solution to the euro crisis. The resulting slow economic growth will continue to dampen consumer demand. This is particularly evident in the European auto industry, where vehicle sales are at 20-year lows. Multiple plant closures announced by European automakers point toward weak forward projections, which will inevitably impact the automotive supply chain. As this economic weakness continues, we see an environment where supply in many industries, including tires, will exceed demand.","Relative to our business, EMEA saw full year volumes decline of 16% or about 12 million tires. Consumer sellout continued to be weak amid high unemployment and economic uncertainty. Dealers reacted to the weak consumer demand and their already high inventories by reducing their orders even more, resulting in continued inventory destocking in the region. In addition, another milder-than-normal beginning to winter affected industry demand for winter tires, a traditional strength for Goodyear. The adverse industry environment was further complicated by internal challenges we had in providing the service our customers deserve and due to a high cost structure that's not flexible enough yet to handle the economic volatility.","Now recognizing these challenges and our overall outlook on Europe, we are implementing a profit improvement plan to return Europe, Middle East and Africa business to its historical margins. We're taking aggressive actions now to rebuild our earnings power rather than waiting for the pace of growth in the region to accelerate. Our plan in Europe is focused in 3 areas: first, in increasing share in our targeted market segments; second, accelerating growth in emerging markets; and third, driving productivity improvements in our supply chain, including our manufacturing facilities. I'll provide some color around each one.","First, we must win in Europe's profitable market segments. In many of these segments, including ultra-high performance and Run On Flat, for example, Goodyear has traditionally enjoyed a competitive advantage because of technology leadership, innovation and success in the magazine tire tests. We must continue to lead these segments and leverage our leadership in the newly implemented tire label ratings to further distinguish our winning products from the competition. Led by our lineup of newly released Goodyear EfficientGrip and Dunlop Blue Response products, Goodyear has the highest rated label portfolio in the industry, with more Ba-rated tire products than anyone else. This is a tremendous achievement delivering on our promise to lead the industry in tire labeling.","Now second, building upon our existing brand strength, we will increase our commitment to growth in emerging markets in the region. Growth in these markets creates opportunity for both consumer and commercial truck tires, supported by our leading brands and technology. We're confident that winning in these markets will lead to improved profitability in the region.","And finally, we are committed to productivity improvements throughout our operations in Europe. We're targeting $75 million to $100 million in productivity gains with further back-office consolidation, increased factory utilization and operational excellence initiatives that will improve factory output, reduce wastes and unnecessary losses in our factories and improve the supply of premium tires to customers in our targeted market segments. Our productivity improvement goal is in addition to the $75 million in expected earnings improvement from the announced closure of one of our manufacturing facilities in France. The passenger tires produced in this plant are low-value tires that are neither in demand nor consistent with our strategy. Additionally, the high cost of this plant's operation has affected our competitiveness in this region for an extended period of time.","While this profit improvement plan will take place over a 3-year time frame, we're confident in making steady progress over that time and beginning to see the results in 2014. Similar to our improvement plan in North America, we will leverage our brand strength in targeted market segments while improving our productivity and customer service. And keep in mind that North America's turnaround was accomplished without the advantage of growing emerging markets.","We already have begun executing a plan to rebuild our business in EMEA in a way that is consistent with our strategy roadmap and has the power to create sustainable results for the long term. We believe in the market opportunities in Europe and remain confident in our ability to deliver improvement in EMEA. The successful execution of our transformation in North America is proof positive that we know how to do this.","Now let me turn to another challenge we are addressing, the significant impact of record-low interest rates on our pension liability. As you know, this is an issue that many companies are facing. Despite the benefits of both our contributions to our pension plans and the strong performance of our portfolio last year, our unfunded liability has continued to increase. Our unfunded pension obligation has driven unexpected volatility in our earnings and cash flow for many years, at times overshadowing significantly improved operating performance and disrupting operating cash flow projections.","As you know, we've taken steps in the past to address legacy obligations, including establishing a VEBA trust to remove retiree health care obligations, freezing our salary pension plans and moving associates into 401(k) plans. We intend to proactively address the persistent risk posed by our unfunded pension obligations just as we addressed other benefit obligations that threatened our long-term strategy. We are announcing a pension funding strategy today, which Darren will discuss in detail during his remarks. Our goal is to drive consistent, sustainable value creation over the long term. By addressing our chronic, unfunded pension obligation, we will free up our business to drive further shareholder value.","Regarding our expectations for 2013, I'd like to start by revisiting the key -- the 3 key targets that we identified in March of 2011. First, we set a segment operating income target of $450 million for our North American Tire business. We reached and surpassed that goal 1 year early despite declining industry volume and higher-than-expected pension costs. Second, we set our global segment operating income target at $1.6 billion by the end of 2013. Since setting the bar at that level, we have delivered consecutive years of at least $1.2 billion in a slow growth cycle, something that we've never done before. With that said, given the continued weakness in Europe, we are adjusting our outlook. We expect total segment operating income to be between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion this year, still a 12% to 20% increase over 2012 and record levels for our company. Finally, we targeted break-even cash flow in 2013. We have delivered strong cash performance over the past 2 years and continue to target positive cash flow in 2013.","We feel very positive about the progress made in our North American, Latin American and Asia Pacific businesses in 2012, and are confident in our ability to continue delivering improved profitability. We believe the fundamentals of our business are strong and that the megatrends shaping the tire industry play to our strength. We believe our strategy roadmap is clear. And despite challenges in Europe, we believe we are positioned to deliver positive results over the long term. And while we anticipate that growth in the global tire industry will continue at a modest pace in the near term, we still believe that a return to a more robust tire industry growth is not a question of if but when, and we'll be ready for it. We continue to make the necessary adjustments to our business now but to be prepared when the cycle continue -- when the cycle returns upward. We are confident in the fundamentals of the tire industry and in our ability to continue our positive momentum.","Now I'll turn the call over to Darren.","Darren R. Wells","Thanks, Rich. We have quite a bit of material to cover today, so I'll keep my fourth quarter remarks brief to leave more time to discuss our pension strategy, our 2013 outlook and your other questions.","Turning to the income statement on Slide 11. Our fourth quarter revenue decreased 11% from last year to $5 billion. The decline primarily reflected a 7% reduction in unit volume and lower third-party chemical sales due to the year-over-year decline in butadiene spot prices. EMEA volumes accounted for about 80% of the overall unit volume decline. Revenue per tire increased 1% compared with the prior year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, and we continue to benefit from mix improvements, reflecting our ongoing focus on profitable market segments.","We generated gross margin of 18.7% in the quarter, a 340-basis-point improvement versus the prior year despite lower volumes. Improvement was largely driven by continued strong price mix performance as we continue to see the benefit of lower raw material costs. Gross margins also reflected strong cost savings.","Selling, administrative and general expense decreased $17 million to $707 million during the quarter. Foreign currency translation and lower advertising expenses more than accounted for the decline in SAG.","Excluding discrete items, our fourth quarter tax rate as a percent of foreign segment operating income was about 21%. As in 2012, we expect 2013 income tax expense as a percent of foreign segment operating income of approximately 25% to 30%. Fourth quarter after-tax results were impacted by certain significant items. A summary of significant items can be found in the appendix of today's presentation.","Turning to the segment operating income step chart on Slide 12, you can see the comparison of operating income compared to the prior year. Favorable raw material costs and price mix were significant drivers of the year-over-year improvement during the fourth quarter, and we're in line with the outlook we provided in October. Lower volume reduced income by $57 million, while production cuts resulted in $119 million of additional unabsorbed fixed costs during the quarter, even after Union City closure savings. Cost savings of $106 million more than offset general inflation of $63 million. This significantly exceeded our $3 billion -- 3-year $1 billion cost savings goal.","The other category includes higher pension expense and a $15 million benefit from other tire-related businesses primarily related to third-party chemical sales. The year-over-year improvement in chemical earnings was attributable to the low level of earnings we reported in 2011. We expect to see this impact reverse in the first quarter as we reported strong chemical earnings in Q1 of 2012. We expect to see a negative year-over-year variance of approximately $25 million for other tire-related earnings in Q1.","Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 13, our net debt totaled $2.8 billion. Compared with a year ago, our net debt increased $376 million. The increase included costs related to debt refinancing and notes prepayment and also reflected the lease of a new headquarters facility as debt on the balance sheet.","Year-end unfunded pension obligations increased to $3.5 billion from $3.1 billion a year ago. While our portfolio returns exceeded our 8.5% return assumption, lower discount rates and increased life expectancy assumptions more than offset the returns. As Rich mentioned, we've announced a strategy to pre-fund and de-risk our U.S. plans. I'll discuss that plan in more detail in a moment.","I'd like to highlight our year-end inventory, which was just over $3.2 billion. We aggressively reduced our production schedules to balance our supply of tires with a challenging demand environment. We've made strong progress not only in reducing inventory on the balance sheet but also in reducing unit inventory levels, which are down approximately 4 million units from 2011 year-end levels. While these production cuts adversely impacted earnings in 2012 and will have a carryover effect in Q1 of 2013, they protect our cash flow and mean the future volume recovery will drive increased production volumes and lower unabsorbed overhead.","Slide 14 shows free cash flow from operations. During 2012, we generated $701 million of free cash flow from operations. This cash flow was used primarily for contributions toward our unfunded pension obligation. In addition, we also reduced our gross debt position and made payments toward restructuring activities.","Moving to individual business units, I'll start with North America. North American Tire reported segment operating income of $116 million in the fourth quarter compared to $21 million in the prior year. North American unit volumes were down 5%. Lower volume in Consumer Replacement, Commercial Replacement and Commercial OE were offset partially by increased volume in Consumer OE. In the fourth quarter, North American Tire realized a raw material cost benefit of $150 million. Our price mix was lower by $11 million, partially attributable to our raw material cost pass-through arrangements with OE customers. North American Tire's fourth quarter manufacturing costs reflected higher unabsorbed overhead of approximately $65 million as we've lowered our production levels in response to the softer industry environment. Consistent with prior quarters, we realized approximately $20 million in savings from the closure of our Union City factory in July 2011, bringing our full year savings to approximately $80 million. North America's full year segment operating income totaled $514 million, the highest ever achieved in North America, and a recovery of over $800 million over the last 3 years. This is important: North America's segment operating income margins, at over 5%, now result in a return on invested capital that adds economic value for shareholders and starts to make growth in the North America business an attractive investment going forward.","EMEA results in Q4 reflected the trends that we've seen over the last 3 quarters. While our revenue per tire remained solid and we benefited from lower raw material costs, our overall results were weak, the result of significantly lower volume and the impact of high manufacturing cost structure in a weakening economic environment. While some of our volume weakness relates to declining industry volumes, a part of the volume decline reflects the need to improve our value proposition. This value proposition includes our service levels, supply chain flexibility and our cost structure. As you heard from Rich, our technology continues to lead the industry with summer tire label grades that are best in class. While actions to improve our service levels and our supply chain are well under way, it's clear we need to make a substantial improvement in our cost structure and our manufacturing flexibility.","Given the weakness in the European industry, the closure of Amiens is critical to ensure competitiveness. As Rich mentioned earlier, we are taking additional actions in the areas of targeted market segment growth, accelerating our emerging markets presence in the region and improving our productivity. These actions, along with our continued investment in industry-leading products and technology, will help us return our EMEA business to its historical margins even if recovery in industry volumes are slow.","Unit volumes in Latin America decreased just under 1% during the quarter. Excluding the impact of exiting the bias truck tire business, total unit volumes would have increased 4%. Total replacement volumes increased 2% during the quarter, driven by our Consumer Replacement business. The strength in our replacement units was partially offset by a 6% decline in Commercial OE. Despite the strong Replacement volume, total Latin American net sales in the fourth quarter were $541 million, increasing 9% versus the prior year. Unfavorable foreign currency translation and the sale of the bias truck tire business more than accounted for the decline. These reductions were partially offset by improved price mix. Operating income was $61 million during the quarter, $13 million above prior year level. The improvement was mainly driven by favorable price mix of $35 million, which was offset partially by cost inflation.","Unit volumes in Asia Pacific were 5% higher than a year ago, given strong growth in China and recovery from the 2011 flood in Thailand. Our Asia Pacific business reported segment operating income of $57 million for the quarter. Excluding the Thailand flood impact and Pulandian start-up costs, our earnings were up about $6 million versus prior year, reflecting solid price mix and favorable raw material costs. Overall, we continue to be pleased with our performance and see further opportunities in Asia, particularly in continuing to gain share in China and in executing a turnaround in Australia as we adjust our business model to current market realities.","Before turning to the outlook, I'd like to take a moment to discuss the pension strategy that we've announced this morning, which is summarized on Slide 16. As Rich highlighted earlier, we've taken many actions to eliminate our exposure to legacy obligations. Today, we're announcing our intent to pre-fund and de-risk our plans as they are frozen. The frozen salary pension plans currently account for approximately $1 billion out of our $2.7 billion U.S. underfunded position. We expect to use debt financing to raise funds for these accelerated contributions.","Skipping to Slide 20, we summarize the implications of our pension strategy. Pre-funding our U.S. salary plans would result in improved operating cash flow, reduced volatility in our pension funded status and the impact that funded status has on leverage, earnings and cash flow. While pre-funding itself will be neutral to overall leverage, our goal is to pre-fund and de-risk our pension plans, more closely aligning our financial results with the performance of our tire business.","As a precursor to accelerated funding actions, we've put in place derivatives to reduce our exposure to market movements during 2013. Slide 22 shows our sensitivity to discount rate changes, incorporating the effect of these hedges. As you can see from the analysis presented, we maintain the majority of the benefit of an interest rate increase while significantly limiting our exposure to an interest rate decrease during 2013. These actions reduce our exposure to market volatility going forward as we move to execute our pension strategy.","Turning to Slide 23, you can see our 2013 industry outlook for North America and the EMEA. In the Consumer business, we expect Replacement markets to be flat to up 2% in both North America and EMEA. In OE, we continue to see positive trends in North America and expect industry demand will increase approximately 5% in 2013. In EMEA, we expect to see the softness continue into 2013 and expect industry shipments to decline another 5%. Turning to commercial truck, we expect both North America Replacement and OE demand equal to 2012 levels, although we expect the first half of the year to show some softness before improving in the second half. In EMEA, we expect Commercial Replacement demand to increase about 5% after a soft 2012. In OE, we expect demand to be flat to up 5% for the year.","On Slide 24, you'll see the modeling assumptions behind our 2013 segment operating income expectations. While our segment operating income expectation is a record level for Goodyear, it represents a 12% to 20% increase over our 2012 segment operating income, which is below our $1.6 billion target, driven by EMEA and the recently announced devaluation in Venezuela. As we implement our profit improvement plan for EMEA and work our way through the impact of the devaluation in Venezuela, the $1.6 billion should be achievable, just not in 2013. Outside of EMEA, we're clearly ahead of plan -- that plan that we set out 2 years ago.","We are well ahead of our plan on North America, which at the time was by far our most challenged business unit. In addition, we've delivered far better cash flow over the last 2 years than we expected and remain on target to deliver positive cash flow in 2013. We'll achieve this with 30 million to 40 million fewer units than we originally planned to sell in 2013. But from that perspective, the fundamental earnings power of our business is substantially ahead of plan, despite pension deterioration, the delay in completing the restructuring plan for consumer capacity in Amiens, France, and despite dramatically weaker volume and lower manufacturing capacity utilization, and despite adverse currency effects.","In EMEA, we are taking actions to address deterioration in that market. These actions, combined with the growth opportunities we see in emerging markets and the opportunity from pent-up demand across many mature markets, positions us well for continued earnings growth as we move beyond 2013.","With that, we'll open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from the site of Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a couple things. First, on your volume expectations for North America and Europe, you said 0% to 2% for Replacement. Wondering what does that imply for Goodyear? Is it similar? Just over the course of this past year, you had some underperformance both in -- in both of those regions.","Richard J. Kramer","Well, Rod, I think from our North America businesses, as we look ahead, we don't see a robust industry in terms of what the economy is doing here, but we still see sort of the GDP type of growth in the economy, and that's going to drive the volume forecast that we see.","Darren R. Wells","Yes, so I guess, Rod, if you look at our -- I mean, our view is that we'll have low-single-digit growth this year. I think if you match that up with the industry outlook, you're going to find it's pretty well in line.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Can you comment also on raw materials. If spot prices stay where they are right now, how would you see that going forward?","Darren R. Wells","Yes, so I think the answer on this is a little bit longer answer, Rod, because I think if we just said that raw materials remain flat for the remainder of the year, there would be a raw material cost decline in the neighborhood of $800 million. Yet the difficulty is that we do -- I mean, we do see some recovery in industry volume this year, but to the extent volumes start to increase again, we would expect that raw material costs would start to increase also. And that's effectively what we've had to take into account as we look at what our performance looks like during the year. Because we are expecting some improvement in volumes even at low single digits, us and the industry. And I think that to go along with that, we have to expect the raw materials are going to start to increase again as well. And as you know, our expectation over time is that raw material costs are going to continue to rise.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And just lastly, a little clarification here on the pension funding. What discount rate are you using right now? What's the rate of return on your assets that you're assuming? Is that current discount rate a good proxy for the underfundedness just given that you're planning to shift more towards fixed income? And can you just lastly add a little commentary on why are you making these changes right now? Did something serve as a catalyst for that?","Richard J. Kramer","So, Rod, I'll start, and I'll let Darren go through the discount rates with you as well. But I think as we think about this -- I'll just personalize it a little bit. I've been here now about 13 years. In the early part of the last decade, we were about $2 billion underfunded. And after we put in literally billions of dollars into our pension plans and doing a lot of things like changing the benefit structures that we had, moving to 401(k)s, freezing the salary plans and the like, we end 2012 with an unfunded domestic pension plan of about $2.7 billion. In other words, after putting a lot of money in, it's gotten even worse. And we know why that is, discount rates and the like. So we take a step back and concluded ourselves that we need to address the volatility we have here. As you know, it's volatile to our earnings, to our leverage, to our cash flow and ultimately, to our stock price. And as we think about the strategy roadmap that we've put out, as we think about the destination of where we want to go to create value over the long term to improve shareholder value, we think that this is very much consistent with that. So that's sort of a view into the thinking of what we're doing here. But, Darren, you could -- you can elaborate on the discount rates.","Darren R. Wells","Yes. So, Rod, the -- at the end of the year, the average discount rate for the U.S. plans is about 3.7%, which compares to about 4.5% at the end of last year. We obviously -- I think given the movement in the bond markets, discount rates have probably risen a bit earlier -- early this year. But at year end, it was 3.7%. We continue to assume -- for the purposes of our pension expense estimates for 2013, we're assuming portfolio returns at 8.5%. So that has not changed. I will tell you that as we execute the pre-funding actions, we will adjust that. As we pre-fund, we will shift the portfolio more toward fixed income, which means that assumed return will come down. But as we execute those actions, there are a number of assumptions that we'll have to provide you to update for those funding actions. So what you've got right now is 2 things. You've got sort of our normal pension assumptions going into the year. So you've got our required contributions, which are around $300 million. And you've got our pension expense, assuming we don't do anything beyond what we've done right now, which is just the hedging transactions that we talked about. As we implement pre-funding, those assumptions are going to change. But since the pre-funding is not done, we've given you the baseline assumptions, and we'll update you as we need to.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","When you say fixed income, moving toward fixed income, I'm presuming you're not assuming entirely fixed income. Do you have some ratio in mind of what asset allocation should be?","Darren R. Wells","Yes, so, Rod, I think we'll take a pass on that right now, and we'll come back as we execute that. But I think the closer we get to fully funded, the closer we're going to be to being fully invested in fixed income. And I think the ultimate idea is that once the plans are fully funded, that we would have an asset portfolio that would be made up of bonds that would closely mirror the bonds that are used to calculate our discount rate. So that if there was a move in the interest rate curve, the gain on the asset would offset any loss related to discount rate and vice versa.","Operator","We'll go next to the line of Itay Michaeli from Citi.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just first, 2 clarifications on Europe. One, are any of the savings from the French closure, to get $75 million, contemplated in the 2013 SOI target, or is that mostly a 2014 event?","Richard J. Kramer","No, Itay, that is not going to be achieved in 2013. That's one of the things I think we concluded as we went through the fourth quarter, is what the status of that situation is. Obviously, we made some changes to that with -- to what we were on plan to do with our announcements in early January -- or late January, I should say. And the impact of that sort of pushes out the benefits we're going to get beyond 2013.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's helpful. And then the $75 million to $100 million of additional productivity over the next 3 years, should we think about that as a gross savings that could be offset with some inflation, or is that sort of a net-of-inflation savings number we should be modeling?","Richard J. Kramer","Our target is that's gross savings. That's as we look at -- excuse me, the $75 million is net savings, I'm sorry, excuse me. But the goal that we have is to drive those programs to take our European business back toward its -- toward the historical profit margins that we've seen in the past.","Darren R. Wells","Yes, so when you look at cost savings actions overall, Itay, you're going to -- you heard the view that as we look at cost savings going forward, we're going to at least offset inflation. You should look at those -- that $75 million to $100 million of productivity actions in Europe as being over and above inflation.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's great. And then go back to volume, the Q1 outlook is still sort of weak, and you do expect improvement throughout the year. Can you talk about what you're assuming for dealer stock situations, restocking, destocking in both North America and Europe throughout 2013?","Richard J. Kramer","I think, Itay, as we talk about North America, we said now for a number of quarters that as we look at what we see, we see low inventory in the RMA manufacturing inventory, we see low inventory in the channels, which continues to point toward an opportunity for a rebound. So inventories are low. As volume comes back, we think there's going to be an opportunity for restocking. As we said, it is not a question of if but when. But as we plan the year, we see the opportunity for it happening. However, as we talked earlier, our growth rates in North America continue to be in that low-single-digit rate. For Europe, we continue to see higher inventories still, as we said in our remarks. Because of the low -- weak economy there, dealers continue to sort of take a wait-and-see attitude. The sort of weak start to the winter again resulted in dealers still having higher inventories than we'd like. So it's very hard to get insight into exactly what inventories are across Europe. But I would tell you, our view right now is it's still higher inventory levels, and that's certainly played into our volume outlook and our adjustments to our outlook on Europe for 2013.","Operator","And we'll go next to the line of Aditya Oberoi from Goldman Sachs.","Aditya Oberoi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Guys, I had a question on your guidance for segment operating income. At the midpoint, it implies $150 million cut, and that is driven by a couple of -- 2 or 3 factors. Can you bucket how much of an impact is due to Venezuela and how much is EMEA and then how much is Europe?","Darren R. Wells","Yes, so, Aditya, I think the -- what we've done -- first of all, I guess on the Venezuela situation, obviously, that's one that's -- it's a very recent effect, so that was just announced at the end of last week. So we've tried to take that devaluation and work it into our foreign exchange expectations for the year. So the foreign exchange impact that we expect for the year is a negative impact of $40 million to $60 million, a significant part of that driven by the situation in Venezuela. But I'll say that we're internally [indiscernible], we're still evaluating Venezuela, so not easy to pin that down with any precision at this point. But you can certainly assume that there is some element there. I think the impact beyond that is very focused in EMEA, and I think we look at that, we look at where we've been over the last 3 months, we -- I think we were still, even as late as October, continuing to work on a plan that would get us to $1.6 billion. And what we saw as we went through November, went through December and went through January, was -- rather than recovering, rather than Europe recovering, it, in fact, continued to get even weaker. So we were seeing very significant slide there in volume, very weak winter season, so the environment there getting even tougher. And what became clear is we were going to have to take another approach to the situation in Amiens, France, which we announced at the end of January. But clearly, if we'd been able to complete the restructuring and sale of that factory, then that would have given us an opportunity for benefits in 2013. As it is now, the -- we've begun the consultation process on a plan to close that factory in its entirety, so both the Consumer and the Farm Tire production. But that process is going to take us longer, so we won't get the benefit in 2013. I think we take all of that and add to it the continued weak outlook for auto production in Europe. And we see a number of things that are going the wrong direction, so you can tell that a lot of the impact we're looking at here does relate to Europe.","Aditya Oberoi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And that's helpful, guys. And one more, if I may. You guys did a good job in constraining or pulling back on inventory versus where you guys were in the recent past. Do you think it could weigh on your sales? Because historically, we have seen like having tight inventories at dealer level has impacted your sales and market share in the past.","Richard J. Kramer","No, I think we actually feel very comfortable how we've managed our inventories. And I think what I'd point toward is the improvements we made in the element of our strategy around operational excellence as we've -- as we made progress on our internal processes and forecasting and the like, we've actually been able to improve our supply to our customers while maintaining lower inventories through the process changes we've made, and that's one of our focus, to make that a sustainable improvement to how we manage the business. So of course, inventories may move around as we see -- when the industry does come back, we'll adjust a little bit accordingly. But at the end of the day, our goal is to run our business on lower inventory while improving our service levels. And I would say particularly in our North America business, we made tremendous progress on that in 2012.","Operator","We'll go next to the line of John Murphy from Bank of America.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This pension stuff is really interesting, and the timing sounds pretty good from a borrowing standpoint. I'm just curious, as we look at the $2.7 billion underfunded, looks like you got $1 billion that is frozen at this point. Is that sort of the target of the capital or the debt raises, the $1 billion? Or if there's a big appetite, would you be more opportunistic and maybe do something even larger? Just trying to understand how big this effort might be.","Darren R. Wells","Yes, no, John, I think you -- yes, I mean, you picked up on the right point there, which is the fact that we see this as a 3-step process: first is to freeze the plan; second, to pre-fund it; and third, to de-risk the asset portfolio or the investments related to it. And right now, the only -- the part of our pension plans that are through step 1 or the freezing step is that $1 billion. So that's effectively what's eligible for the pre-funding step as we sit here today. Having said that, I mean, our view is that we should take the step of freezing in our other plans as well. Obviously, that will require discussions with our workforce and some additional steps that will take some time, so that hasn't happened yet. We're obviously anxious to do that as quickly as possible, but the -- for right now, what we'd be looking at is the $1 billion of the unfunded amount that's in frozen plans.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that's great. And then just a second question, as we look at the SOI increase year-over-year in 2013, it's about $150 million to $250 million, which is a big increase. And you guys are kind of indicating that Europe is not going to be so great on a year-over-year basis. I'm just curious as we look at the 3 other major regions where you think that real strength or increase year-over-year will be, will that be really North America, Asia Pac or Lat Am? I'm just trying to understand where you see that big positive year-over-year increase.","Richard J. Kramer","Yes, John, we don't -- obviously, we don't give guidance on each of the -- each of our SBUs, but I think as we looked at the $1.6 billion target, I have to say all of our businesses were really on path to achieving the sort of the goals that we set out for them. So I think we see certainly a continued, sustainable progress in North America. As we said on the call, our Asia business, led by the growth in China and our new factory there, presents us with excellent opportunities. We're growing there faster than the industry and gaining share in the segments that we want. And we got some headwinds in Australia, but we're managing them, and hopefully, we'll see some upside. And in Latin America, we're stabilizing our business there. We've seen improvements in Brazil, and obviously, that's a great market and a great place where our brand and our distribution is still a big asset for us. So to those 3 businesses, really, we still see the same things we saw before. It's really a question of what Darren went through in Europe around a weak economy, weak -- weaker volumes, a tougher auto industry and the impact that's going to have on our volumes and unabsorbed overhead. That's really where we stand.","Operator","We'll go next to the site of John Healy with Northcoast Research.","John M. Healy - Northcoast Research","Question for you, Darren, on cash flow. I think in the slides, you mentioned working capital would be neutral to the use of about $100 million. I hope you can give us a little color on how you get there, with the thought that volume increases low single digits and the thought that with volume gains, maybe raw material prices go up a bit. Are there some things working in the background that are making you guys more efficient at kind of managing the working capital of the business and maybe how you think about working capital longer term as you guys enter this next phase of, hopefully, industry growth.","Darren R. Wells","Yes, so, John, yes, I think it's a fair question. And as we look at this, the fact that we're -- we look to use anywhere from $0 to $100 million this year, obviously, it's not part of our long-term outlook. I mean, our long-term outlook has been that working capital should be neither a source nor a use. However, I would say in the last couple years, and in 2012 in particular, we did very well and, in 2012, generated a significant amount of cash from working capital. If I take the long-term perspective, I would say we have consistently driven down working capital as a percent of sales, and that is what we plan to continue to do. We're going to continue to work on that rhythm. I would say that for much of the last 5 years, significant amount of progress has come in working on our accounts receivable and working on our accounts payable. I think with the work that we're doing in operational excellence, we see some opportunity in inventory, and that's where I think I see some of the forward opportunity. We've essentially delivered some of that in our North American business, and that's been -- as Rich said, that's a part of the story. We've delivered it in North America, and we've maintained and improved our service levels. There are other parts of the world where our supply chain processes are not as advanced and where we have that same opportunity. So I think we're looking at being able to continue to drive down inventory levels, and that's going to allow us to continue to drive down working capital as a percent of sales as a long-term matter. Having said that, 2013, with the volume increases that we're looking at and the fact that raw materials may come back, I think that that's what led us to the view that there may be a modest use of cash there in 2013.","John M. Healy - Northcoast Research","That's helpful. And then I was hoping you guys could give a little bit more color on the environment in Australia. I know you called it out earlier in the prepared remarks, but maybe just also on the competitive environment there, how the [indiscernible] and just your thought process on when that market may turn.","Richard J. Kramer","So, John, Australia is a business where basically our business is all retail at this point. As you may remember, we closed a number of factories over the past few years, and by and large, the retail business that we have there is really being impacted by the economy. As you're I'm sure aware, the non-mining economy in Australia is very -- is a very difficult one right now, and that's what we're feeling. In addition, Australia is a market that gets a lot of imported tires, so a lot of that market is certainly receiving some of the volumes from other parts of the world, which also adds another headwind to our challenge there. That said, our retail presence there is significant. We feel the value proposition that we have and that we're going to improve is going to put us at a competitive advantage in the region. We've taken a lot of actions to do that in terms of new products, in terms of how we go to market there and in terms of significant cost reductions, both within our stores and within the supply chain in Australia as well. So the environment there I think will remain tough. I think to a large degree, it's going to be contingent on the Australian economy at large, but we're not going to wait again for the economy to improve to drive improvements in our business. Long term, we see it as a good business. Near term, we're going to continue to work hard to get to an improved position at this point. Now, John, also say -- well, I'll leave it at that. I'll leave it up to your [indiscernible]. That's it.","Operator","Moving next to the site of Brett Hoselton from KeyBanc.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask you a little bit about Europe and some of your thoughts there. I guess, specifically first of all, increasing market share, what segments are you thinking about in terms of your potential market share increases there?","Richard J. Kramer","Yes, I think, Brett, I think we -- I highlighted, and I think Darren may have commented as well, we play very well in the premium segments there, ultra-high performance, Run On Flat, winter high performance, 4x4, all these segments, and those are opportunities where our technology really plays traditionally, and we're going to continue to go after those markets. Now in addition to that, the new opportunity in Europe is in tire labeling. And as I made a remark -- as I made comments in my remarks, that as we look at the summer portfolio, the high-performance summer portfolio that's out right now, our Goodyear brand and Dunlop brand products are really doing fabulous. I'm extremely pleased with the team and how they put together the technology, industrialize it and have these products to market to lead the industry in the best labeled portfolio in the industry right now. That's a huge win for us. And when we talk about -- in our strategy, we talk about technology being an advantage for us and really the megatrends playing up to technology increases plays to our advantage, I think labeling is really the proof point of why we think that and what we're capable of doing.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And as you think about your comment regarding European margins returning to historic levels based on the actions that you're looking to take here, can you talk a little bit about how should we think about your operating income progressing from 2012 to 2013 in Europe? Do you expect it to improve? And then in terms of returning to historic margin levels, is that kind of in line with the 3-year restructuring that you're looking to do, or is that more of a \"we think it's going to take 2 years,\" or is it 5 years? How do we think about the timing there?","Darren R. Wells","Yes, so, Brett, I think you've picked up the right point in terms of the productivity plan. Yes, so we've got a couple of things going on. I think, base income level for 2012 was $252 million premium. We've said that we will have some modest volume growth in the Consumer Replacement business, but overall, not a lot of volume growth in Europe, so there's not a lot of volume in 2013. And I think we've said that the savings -- or the profit improvement from the restructuring plan in Amiens is something that won't affect 2013. And I think we look at the productivity as $75 million to $100 million over 3 years, so there may be some modest amount there achieved in 2013 but not a lot. So I think you can look at this and say that a lot of the actions that we're taking are going to affect 2014, 2015, to the extent there is some volume recovery in 2013, and that's helpful. But that's the thing that is going to be most helpful in the near term.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then just finally here, the growth in the emerging markets, I believe that's a European comment, and it's -- I think you're thinking Eastern and Central Europe or some of the regions or countries in that area. Is that correct?","Richard J. Kramer","Yes, no, you're right on, Brett.","Operator","And we'll take our final questions from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A follow-up question on the share. You have been giving up share in North America the last few quarters to focus on segments that you really want to be in and to boost the price mix. So when you're talking about future share gains, are you referring to just the segments you are in or versus the overall market?","Richard J. Kramer","Yes, I think, Ravi, our strategy is to focus on profitable volume. So we've often said, not volume simply for volume's sake. And our volume weakness that you refer to is reflected in a number of factors really on an overall basis, reflecting our weighting toward more mature markets and as you rightly pointed out, our choice to leave certain of those businesses. So I'm very pleased, I have to say, with the disciplined strategy that the teams have implemented and executed, and particularly in North America. We've made some very good choices both on the Replacement side and the OE side to drive our profitability. And as we've always said, our goal is to win in those targeted market segments where our value proposition delivers value for ourselves, for our customers and for our consumers. That's where we're going to focus. And by definition, that hasn't been at the low end of the market, which is why we exited some of those opening-price-point tires. That said, we're very cognizant that volume in total is not something that we can take our eye off of and we won't, but again, our focus will not be on simply volume for volume's sake.","Darren R. Wells","No, the only other thing I could add there, Ravi, is the fact that we did see share gains in the Goodyear brand at the end of the year. We're continuing to get -- continuing to build the value of that brand. So it's other area -- other tires outside the Goodyear brand that have driven some of the volume losses.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Understood. If I can also ask a question on Amiens, obviously, you've had difficulties with that facility for a while. Are you now and do you have a greater degree of confidence now that you'll be able to close it this time around compared to what happened the last couple years?","Darren R. Wells","Yes, I think, we worked -- as you know, we worked for 3 years on a plan that would've closed Consumer production in that factory and preserved the jobs in Farm Tire production by selling the factory. That plan was rejected by the majority union in the factory. So we announced on January 31 that we'll now pursue a full closure of the Amiens North facility and that we're going to exit the Farm Tire business in Europe. So that -- in some ways, it's unfortunate because I think there was an opportunity there. But the fact is that this is, in many ways, a more direct approach. And I think we're not happy with where we've ended up. But the fact is we're going to go through the required consultation process, which has begun. We had an additional works council meeting today in Paris. We can't completely estimate the timing of the plan, as we've talked about, but we're going to move our way through the process, and today's meeting was another step in the process. So I think we're confident in the plan that we've laid out. We are taking care to present plans that support the employees and limit the social consequences of the closure as much as possible. But this is the -- really, the only option we have left, and we're going to move our way through it.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And finally on the pension, I apologize if you touched on this before, but what's the timing on the debt freeze, and are you planning to do that through a convert or some other method?","Darren R. Wells","Yes, so the comment was that we're going to use the debt capital markets. We can't comment any further than that.","Gregory A. Fritz","Okay, I think that wraps up the call. We appreciate your attention today. Thanks very much.","Operator","And this concludes today's program. Have a great day. You may disconnect at this time."],"9920":["The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to hand the program over to Christina Zamarro, Goodyear's Vice President, Investor Relations.","Christina Zamarro","Thank you, Tony, and thank you, all, for joining us for Goodyear's third quarter 2014 earnings call. Joining me today are Rich Kramer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Laura Thompson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, there are a few items we need to cover. To begin, the supporting slide presentation for today's call can be found on our website at investor.goodyear.com, and a replay of this call will be available later today. Replay instructions were included in our earnings release issued earlier this morning.","If I could now draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statements on slide two. I would like to remind participants on today's call that our presentation includes some forward-looking statements about Goodyear's future performance; actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments today. The most significant factors that could affect future results are outlined in Goodyear's filings with the SEC and in our earnings release. The company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","Our financial results are presented on a GAAP basis and in some cases, a non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures discussed on the call are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent as part of the appendix to the slide presentation.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rich.","Richard J. Kramer","Thank you and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to take a moment to welcome Christina Zamarro as our new Vice President of Investor Relations. Christina is a long time member of Goodyear\u2019s Global Treasury team and I know she has already met with a number of you. She\u2019s a great addition to our team, so welcome Christina.","Now, today I\u2019ll discuss our strong third quarter results. I\u2019ll also address the North America volume questions that are likely on your mind and provide a brief look ahead to 2015. Laura will follow with the review of our other businesses as well as the financials.","By now you\u2019ve read the highlights of our press release. Record third quarter segment operating income of $520 million and segment operating margin of more than 11% the best in more than a decade, segment operating margins of greater than 10% in all four of our businesses, an all time record quarter for North America with earnings up 30% year-over-year. Europe, Middle East and Africa back on track with a 57% improvement in segment operating income and another strong EPS quarter.","These results are the outcome of taking actions that are consistent with our strategy and putting our best efforts into how we build the value of our brands and products for the long term. You\u2019ve seen it now for four years. In addition, I believe that delivering record results for such an extended period of timed validates our strategy especially in an environment of headwinds created by persistent global economic volatility and political unrest.","Now in that environment I am pleased with our financial performance, but I\u2019m even more gratified by how we achieve those results. For us, the how is sticking to our strategy. We are running our business better every quarter becoming more efficient and creating sustainable shareholder value just as we said we would.","In regard to the third quarter, I can\u2019t recall a time when it was more critical for us to have a discipline and commitment to the execution of our strategy. It\u2019s easy to stay on strategy and deliver strong financial results in a robust economy but the real value of a strategy can be seen when record results are delivered even in the midst of volatile market conditions. ","That commitment in execution was tested over the past three months particularly in North America where I\u2019ll focus my comments this morning. I\u2019ll discuss what happened to volume, how we responded, the results of that response and what we expect going forward.","During the quarter, the rubber manufacturers association reported that U.S. consumer replacement industry grew at sell-in that is sales into the channel by 3% year-over-year. At the same time, Goodyear\u2019s North America replacement volume declined 4%. These numbers don\u2019t tell the full story, so let\u2019s take a closer look at what\u2019s driving the numbers.","Replacement volume in our North American business was impacted by two main factors. First, there was an early aggressive and distorted pre buy of low end Chinese tires in anticipation of another tariff on import of these tires. And second, we faced challenges meeting increased demand for some of our premium branded products. The most crucial factor in the quarter was the distorted impact of the significant pre buy of low end Chinese tires on industry sell-in volumes to dealers and distributors in anticipation of another import tariff.","I referred to this on our last quarter call anticipating that the market would be affected by such advanced purchases. In reality, it happened even faster and with more market impact than anyone could have expected. Though the potential tariff would not occur until mid-2015, the pre-buy activity we saw this quarter some nine months ahead of a possible tariff being in place was more significant than what we saw just one quarter ahead of the tariff actually being implemented in 2009.","This activity may also have been fueled by the possibility of the tariffs being made retroactive to October of this year. To get ahead of the impacts of the potential tariffs, dealers and distributors increased their purchases of Chinese tires in multiples of their normal purchase volumes and made significant investments to build inventory. In an unprecedented wave of speculated buying, many purchased a considerable portion of next year\u2019s tires this year and now have stock piles of low end tires to sell.","Now a key point to remember as channel inventories grow even larger is that sell out in North America, sell out being what consumers are actually purchasing at retail is only growing at an annual rate of between 1% and 2%. We expect to see a similar increase in 2015 as well. The distortions in the third quarter sell-in industry volumes made comparisons to share market and industry growth trends especially challenging.","On slide five, we provide some context for what we believe is behind the industry volume numbers and will help put our own volumes in better context. The 3% industry sell-in increase reported by the RMA was driven by a 25% year-over-year increase in Chinese imports. When adjusted for those imports, we estimate that the industry demand for other tires would have declined about 4% in the quarter.","Though as you know we do not prioritize sales at the low end of the market, Chinese imports affected our sales. The quantity of these imports in the market did two things. They occupied an abnormal amount of physical inventory space, some of which is normally filled by our own economy in mid-tier branded products and they reduced our customer\u2019s liquidity.","Now as you would expect our response to this anomaly was consistent with our strategy. We didn\u2019t overreact to distorted market conditions and the spike in dealer buying patterns, we didn\u2019t chase on profitable volume and we\u2019re not in the business of making tires to sit in customers warehouses for extended periods and we didn\u2019t sell next year\u2019s tires at discounted prices today. Instead, we stayed focused in an environment that would have made it easy to divert from our strategy. That focus led our North America business to deliver record segment operating income of $210 million, a second straight quarter of more than 10% operating margin and improved price mix versus raw materials compared to the second quarter.","Going forward, we will continue to offer a compelling value proposition to our customers and consumers that will continue to win in the market place. Staying disciplined in this environment not only proved to be value generating in the quarter, but also positioned us well for 2015 when we expect to see solid demand for our products to continue. Needless to say, I\u2019m very comfortable with the decisions we made in the quarter.","Now, moving onto the second factor, I\u2019d like to call your attention to slide six. Demand for HVA products continue to increase and that at a faster pace than expected, which led to escalating back orders for some of our premium tires. Our high value added branded products with the strongest margins continued to be in high demand. We can trace this back to one of our mega trends. HVA tires moving onto mid-tier vehicles, that\u2019s happening quickly and is putting pressure on our HVA replacement supply. The success of such products is the assurance of season and the Wrangler all-terrain adventure has kept demand ahead of our capacity.","This strong demand validates our strategy and the value of our brand as consumers continue to seek out and prefer our tires. While we believe we have gained share with our premium products this year, we continue to take steps to capture profitable growth in this segment in the future. As we head into 2015, our recent in plant growth CapEx investments in our North America factories will deliver more high margin premium branded tires.","In addition, we will leverage our Global HVA footprint to supply North America and looking ahead recently announced new plant to supply the Americas will come online in 2017 and help us meet the robust demand for high value tires in the future. As a result, we will supply more HVA tires in North America to grow profitably in targeted market segments in 2015 and beyond.","As I discussed in my opening remarks, we are confident in our ability to deliver strong results across the entire company because of our commitment to an execution of our strategy. We will not chase volume for volume sake, we will compete for profitable growth in targeted market segments with a value of the Goodyear brand, our innovative quality products, our pervasive distribution and service networks and the best team in the industry provide us with competitive advantage. We are achieving real cost reduction driven by operational excellence initiatives. We are rolling out across factories around the world. Two years into this program, we have built a solid foundation to enhance the efficiency of our supply chain to help us get the right tire to the right customer at the right cost.","And we\u2019re not running our business for one quarter or one good year, but to create sustainable value for the long term. Through three quarters this year, our global business has generated nearly 1.4 billion in segment operating income. We will achieve a fourth straight year of more than 1.2 billion in earnings, something never before accomplished. That is what our strategy was built to do.","Looking ahead to 2015 we anticipate the challenging economic and political conditions will persist through next year. In light of the distorted market place in North America and continuing softness in many global economies which Laura will cover in more depth, we expect our volumes to grow between 1% to 2% in 2015. In North America, the unusually high inventory levels of Chinese imports will likely have a negative impact on overall industry growth for at least the next 12 months. In this environment and with increased supply of high value Goodyear tires, we expect that we will perform better than the industry.","We remain confident in our strategy and see demand for our products remaining strong. We are reaffirming with confidence our 2014 to 2016 financial targets of 10% to 15% segment operating income growth per year and annual positive free cash flow from operations. For 2014 specifically, we expect earnings growth near the high end of our range. Having been through multiple cycles of the tire industry, I can say that Goodyear is better prepared than ever to handle the volatility of our global industry and come out of it stronger.","We\u2019ve turned around our North America business. We fully funded, frozen and [de-wrist] our largest U.S. pension plans. We\u2019ve addressed our high cost footprint around the world and we successfully launched a wave of innovative new products. All of this enabled us to put a balanced capital allocation plan in place mindful of our shareholders and reinvestment in our business to drive growth.","Our focus has shifted to sales and marketing excellence. One of the key how to is on our strategy roadmap. Think of sales and marketing excellence as a companion to operational excellence, an initiative I outlined in one of my early calls as CEO and other starting to deliver measurable results. After successfully turning around our business, we must now pivot to growth, profitable growth. Our commitment to growth was demonstrated by the hiring of Richard Kellam as our new head of global sales and marketing. Richard has more than 25 years of global expertise in sales and marketing and will help lean our efforts to capitalize on our value proposition and increase our consumer focus.","As I reflect on another record quarter, I\u2019m extremely proud of our teams and our achievements. Our results are evidenced that we have the right strategy in place and we will not be deterred by volatility in any of our markets. This is how we run our business. Now based on the commitment to our strategy, our execution to date and the current share price levels we plan to repurchase up to 150 million of our common stock in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re creating sustainable long term value now and are confident in our ability to meet the challenges ahead and continue to deliver outstanding results.","I now will turn the call over to Laura.","Laura K. Thompson","Thank you, Rich, and good morning, everyone. My remarks this morning will start with a review of the third quarter financial results. As Rich\u2019s comments focused largely on North America, I will go into more depth on our operating result of our other businesses. I'll then finish with some initial view on 2015. We'll then open the call up for your questions.","Let's turn to Slide 10 and review a few key items on the income statement. We are very pleased with our strong third quarter earnings performance. Segment operating income for the quarter increased to a record $520 million, a 21% increase over last year bringing the year to-date growth to 17%. Unit volume in the quarter decreased 2%, replacement volumes were down 1% primarily driven by North America as Rich just explained.","Original equipment volumes were down 3%, primarily driven by Brazil, where the recessionary economy continues to negatively affect OEM production. For the quarter net sales were down $345 million.","Third quarter sales decreased by $137 million because of foreign currency translation and $72 million from lower volumes, additional price mix reduced sales by $95 million primarily because of the effect of lower raw material cost on pricing including normal raw material indexed agreements.","Our gross margin was 24.5%, an improvement of 340 basis points versus the prior year. This reflects the value of our brands and products in the marketplace and our focus on cost reductions that are being led by our operational excellence initiative.","In the quarter, we achieved a record $520 million in segment operating income and 11.2% in SOI margin. Each of our four business units posted margins exceeding 10%. This is the first time and at least 15 years that we have achieved these margins.","Our third quarter operating tax rate as a percent of foreign segment operating income was 18% lower than prior guidance due to better than expected profitability and lower tax countries.","Our earnings per share on a diluted basis for the quarter was $0.58, our results were impacted by a few significant items which are listed in the appendix of today\u2019s presentation on slide 25. After allowing for those items, our adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.87.","The step chart on slide 11; walks third quarter 2013 segment operating income to third quarter 2014. The impact from lower sales volumes was nearly offset by the benefit of higher second quarter production levels in Europe, Middle East and Africa resulting in a $2 million net year-over-year change.","Price mix net of raw materials accounted for a net unfavorable impact of $14 million. The continued weakness in the off-the-road business once again fully explains the decline year-over-year. Raw materials decline 6% during the quarter.","Price mix versus raw material performance reflects an improvement over the second quarter. In addition, it is important to note that our revenue per tire excluding foreign currency remained flat sequentially.","Strong cost savings of $135 million were driven by our operational excellence initiative more than offsetting the negative $75 million impact of inflation for a net benefit of $60 million. Continuing along the items on the walk chart, foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $31 million year-over-year, primarily driven by the weakening Venezuelan Bolivar and Euro.","Now let\u2019s spend few moments on the bar titled other given its magnitude and the progress we have made on several key strategic initiatives that we outlined to you previously. The first is the closure of our Amiens, France facility earlier this year, which delivered $16 million of savings in the quarter. We remained on track to deliver $75 million on an annualized basis.","In addition, the actions we took on our U.S. pension plans saved us an additional $14 million in the quarter. These were two significant areas that we committed to address as part of our strategy and which we have delivered according to plan. Addressing the U.S. pension was critical especially given where interest rates are today. The remaining items within other are shown in the footnotes of the chart.","Now let\u2019s turn to the balance sheet information on slide 12. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the third quarter were $1.7 billion, while net debt remained at $5.1 billion. During the quarter, we refinanced our Pan-European accounts receivables securitization facility extending the term through 2019. This facility is one of our lowest cost financings around the world and will support the European regions top line growth going forward.","Pre-cash flow from operations is shown on slide 13. During the third quarter, we generated $87 million of cash which was an improvement over the prior year. We continue to demonstrate strong free cash flow performance with nearly $800 million generated over the past 12 months. This level of cash generation is consistent with the funding required to support our capital allocation plan.","Slide 14 shows our focus on shareholder return programs. First, on September 1st, we paid a $0.06 per share dividend, a 20% increased over the prior quarter. Second, under the existing $450 million share repurchase program for 2014 through 2016, we purchased approximately $30 million of our common stock during the quarter and $83 million year to-date.","In addition, as Rich mentioned earlier we plan to repurchase up to $150 million of our common stock in the four quarter. We believe our current stock price does not reflect the components we have in our strategy and our ability to achieve our targets.","Moving now to the business units on slide 15, I will start with North America. In the third quarter North America reported an all time record segment operating income of $210 million and achieved an operating margin of greater than 10% for the second quarter in a row.","The team in North America delivered a positive price mix net of raw material cost of approximately $22 million despite industry market disruption. Manufacturing cost were reduced by $32 million and coupled with positive mix increased our SOI margins by 280 basis points year-over-year.","Rich covered the volume story, but I\u2019d like to highlight a couple of key points. Over the last few years we have been focused on refreshing our new product portfolio. The result in 2014 is very high demand for our new Assurance All-Season passenger tire and Wrangler All-Terrain Adventure light truck tire lines. These tires are wining with customers and consumers.","In 2015, we will have several additional new mid-tier product launches as well. We will meet the demand for these products through the CapEx investments we have made and continue to make in our existing factories. Additional capacity from our global footprint will help as well.","In our commercial truck business our new Fuel Max drive tire is already being enthusiastically received by our customers and transportation fleets. Our industry leading cradle-to-grave fleet solutions business model is using technology to help keep the fleets on the road with increased up time. It is clearly a competitive advantage for Goodyear and will contribute to our profitable growth.","Turning to Europe, Middle East and Africa, we delivered segment operating income of $181 million in the third quarter. An improvement of 57% over last year\u2019s was $115 million. The third quarter was the sixth consecutive quarter with year-over-year earnings growth.","SOI margin increased to 11.2% from 6.6% in the prior year, margin improvement in the quarter was driven by reduced manufacturing cost derived from the closure of our Amiens plant and improved factory utilization in our other facilities. We also benefited from positive price mix net of raw material cost of $26 million. The continued execution of our profit improvement plan across the regions also has significantly increased our margins.","Our timing of early winter tire selling programs which started during the second quarter helped increased volume by 3% year to-date while causing a 1.3% decline in unit volumes in the third quarter.","Strong magazine test results for our new UltraGrip 9 winter tire confirm the strength of our total value proposition. We grew share in the commercial truck business in the quarter on the success of our premium products despite difficult industry conditions.","We are pleased to see our business in Europe approaching historical levels of profitability even a mix of volatile environment. Weakness in the overall European economy and the euro will continue to present headwinds as we complete 2014 and move into 2015.","As a reminder, the winter tire segment accounts for significant portion of the European tire industry particularly in Northern Europe. While we are planning on a green winter, we will continue to manage our production and inventory by closely monitoring sell out.","Turning to Latin America, segment operating income was $49 million for the quarter, $40 million less than the prior year. The decline in our results is driven by the continued economic volatility in Venezuela, and the recessionary economy in Brazil, including the significant decrease in new car production.","We expect the headwinds to continue including a volatile and weakening reality, but we believe Latin American markets will be growth market over the long term. We are prepared to stay the course and continue to invest in a region to support our growth.","We are seeing the benefits of our increased HVA supply despite these current economic headwinds. In 2014, we have introduced seven new products in the region and have strong volume growth in our consumer replacement business with double-digit growth in Brazil and Mexico.","We are expanding our distribution and increasing our points of sales in both countries. We are implementing a growth strategy that leverages and expands the Goodyear brand and our distribution footprint.","Before we leave the Latin American results, I would like to provide a quick update on Venezuela. So far this year, Venezuela results have negatively affected Latin America\u2019s segment operating income by $43 million versus 2013.","We began to feel the impact of the challenges in Venezuela during the fourth quarter of 2013, so we expect the comparative results to improve next quarter. However, the environment remains volatile and our outlook assumes no further significant devaluations or production disruptions.","Our Asia Pacific business reported segment operating income of $80 million for the quarter, a $14 million increased year-on-year. Unit volumes of $6 million in Asia Pacific were about 7% higher than a year ago.","We are particularly pleased with our performance in China where our consumer replacement volume grew by double-digit well ahead of the industry. Clearly the Chinese economy has slowed versus previous predictions including our own. But the team continues to perform well by growing our business with new and existing customers.","Recently our products were recognized by J.D. Power ranking highest for customer satisfaction in both the luxury car and SUV segments. Goodyear also won the most influential tire brand by the China auto part suppliers association related to our S200 commercial truck tire. As we\u2019ve always said the China market will not grow in a straight line. We are prepared for that and we\u2019re staying on our plan.","Weakness remains in our OTR business in the region, which is influenced by lower commodity prices and the weak Australian economy. Looking ahead, we continue to see the Asia region as a key growth opportunity and we are continuing to build our teams, our products and our capabilities to drive future business and to win in our targeted market segments.","Based on the progress each of these four businesses has made through three quarters and our confidence in our strategy we now growth in our segment operating income for the full year 2014 to be near the high end of our targeted 10% to 15% range. And we also expect tire unit volume will be flat to up 1%. We have included the 2014 SOI drivers and other financial assumptions in the appendix of today\u2019s presentation.","As we think about 2015, let me first say that our strategy, our balanced capital allocation plan and our target to grow segment operating income 10% to 15% each year to 2016 remain unchanged.","Slide 16 provides preliminary planning assumptions for 2015. We see volume growth of 1% to 2% next year and positive price mix versus raw materials of about $50 million to a $100 million. We expect raw materials to remain at current spot rate or to decline slightly.","We expect another solid year of operational excellence savings. As you know this program is a key element of our strategy roadmap. In addition, we expect to realize the remaining cost savings from the closure of our plant in Amiens and the exist of the EMEA farm tire business.","Our earnings growth is supported by our investments in CapEx. In 2015 we expect our CapEx to be about $1.2 billion consistent with our previously announced capital allocation plans. Slide 16 also includes other factors that are contemplated for 2015. We will provide an update on our outlook items during our fourth quarter call.","In summary, our outstanding performance during another quarter of global economic volatility strengthens our confidence to deliver our target and creates sustainable economic value.","Now, we\u2019ll open the call up for your questions","","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll take our first question from Itay Michaeli with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","","Richard Kramer","Good morning, Itay.","","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citigroup","Good morning and congratulations everyone.","","Richard Kramer","Thanks.","","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citigroup","I was hoping -- thanks for the preliminary 2015 outlook. I was hoping if you could talk a little bit more about the confidence level on the price mix versus raw material improvement there, I think Laura you mentioned kind of flattish raw material assumption. What the split between kind of pricing mix and maybe also you can update us on the OTR business as well?","","Richard Kramer","So, Itay, just from a broad view on how we think about price mix next year and how we think \u2013 I think maybe I go back and look how were you looking at the global economy. And I think it\u2019s safe to say that there\u2019s a lot of headwinds as we look into 2015 given what\u2019s happening in Europe both the economy in the euro and the like. But that said, we feel confident in the new products that we have coming out into the marketplace, and we continue to do that region by region, Laura touch on a few of the products that are award winning in China.","We\u2019ve essentially refurbish our entire product line in Latin America. We have new products coming out again in North America next year on top of the products we have in Europe. So in terms of a portfolio driving the value, the brand and being compensated for that in the marketplace we continue to feel very good about heading into 2015.","And from a raw material perspective, clearly we\u2019ve seen a decrease in raw materials. This year we anticipate that we\u2019re not going to see big spikes going into next year. So I think you\u2019ll see some of that tailwind as well as we go. So, we remained pretty positive about how we think that we can bring price mix to the bottom line next year again.","","Laura Thompson","Yes. No doubt. And then, in addition to that as we think about OTR next year, we\u2019re certainly not expecting any kind of a recovery, but for to kind of remain the same. So we will no longer have a negative impact on price mix versus raw kind year-over-year as we go out to next year. And even though the raw materials are really as we said, kind of the same or flat, we still have somewhat of a tailwind in the first part of the year from the raw material. And then, again, mix driven by all the good products and the core consumer and commercial business results.","","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citigroup ","That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. And then just a question on cost savings. It looks like you seem to accelerate the pace this year is off \u2013 of already impressive pace a year ago and probably into next year as well, just talk a little bit more about where you\u2019re seeing these incremental opportunities and particularly where you add -- how much you realize on the European productivity stock planning you previously laid out?","","Richard Kramer","So, Itay, I\u2019ll start and Laura can talk to the specifics on Europe as well. But we feel pretty good about it and I\u2019m going to address it in the context of on umbrella of our operational excellence initiatives. And there is two types of cost savings that we go after. Certainly the ones that we need to and we\u2019ll continue to focus on which is just better cost management by the company, quarter after quarter, year after year, and then there is what we might call efficiency of productivity which really goes into the operational excellence initiatives we have, which spans both getting more efficient in our factories in terms of making more of the right tires at a lower cost by driving efficient programs across our global footprint.","And we\u2019re seeing the benefits of that both in things like a better cost, lower maintenance cost for our factories by having better up time, by putting programs in around the world that are delivering results. We\u2019re seeing it an increased output in certain of our factories in the HVA tires that we want. Frankly I\u2019m very impressed with some of the benefits that we\u2019ve gotten and greater output of the tires that market wants particularly in Europe. And we see that happening today. Our programs today are only in a number of plans around the world.","We see that expanding to all of them, so there\u2019s a lot more of that efficiency in cost to get out of our factories. And we also have significant programs around our raw material cost or general purchases if you like, things that we call our supplier collaboration programs where we work with them to try to create programs that are beneficial to us and to them and to continue to get those cost savings to the bottom line and that\u2019s been very effective for us this year.","So, I mentioned in my script. I refer to operational excellence. I think on one of the early calls when I took this job as an area that we were going to drive and we\u2019re going to see benefits down the road, patient execution to get the results, that what you\u2019re seeing and we expect to see more of that going out into 2015 and beyond.","","Laura Thompson","Right. And Itay on the \u2013 I think we talked about $75 million to $100 million in a three-year plan for cost savings within EMEA and that was to end the third year would be in 2015. We\u2019ve not really split out or given a specific number related to the $75 to $100 million. We just show it as part of the net cost savings for total company. But certainly as Rich mentioned our stronger than expected cost savings did primarily come from Europe and is very much in line with achieving that $75 million to $100 million by the end of 2015.","","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citigroup","And then just maybe one quick one if I could sneak it in on pension expense just a point of clarification, any impacts at all from mortality table like anything or can you able to give a slight deck for the third year outlook 2015? That\u2019s all I have.","","Laura Thompson","Right, we take a look at the mortality table, really, I think last time we did, we look at \u2013 we do each year, I\u2019m sorry, we look at the mortality tables each year, but last time we made a change based on U.S. life expectancy was in 2012. As we go we\u2019ll give any update we can to our liability for this. But certainly as you know it wouldn\u2019t impact cash in the near term and would have small impact on expense as we see it going forward.","","Richard Kramer","Itay, I\u2019m happy to talk about the impact of mortality tables rather than discount rates. It\u2019s a positive.","","Laura Thompson","That\u2019s a better conversion.","","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citigroup","That\u2019s different one, absolutely, yes. Okay. That\u2019s all I had. Thanks so much.","","Richard Kramer","Thank you.","","Laura Thompson","Thank you.","","Operator","Thank you. Next we\u2019ll move to David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs","Yes. Hi. Thank you.","","Richard Kramer","Good morning, David.","","Laura Thompson","Hello, David.","","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs","Good morning. Congratulations on the quarter. Just kind of following in line of questioning on cost savings, I mean, the double-digit operating margins across the four regions was rather impressive especially in light not hitting double-digits in Europe since I think 2005 one of the quarters there. Could you kind of speak to the sustainability of those in North America as well as Europe kind of going forward?","","Richard Kramer","David, again, I\u2019m going to put it into the bucket of the programs we have and our operational excellence initiatives. And I would tell you the programs we feel very confident will continue to deliver the savings and the efficiencies that we need to drive the business going forward both in terms of cost reduction and in terms of incremental production of the right tires that we need as we head into the 2015 and beyond.","I will tell you the absolute amount of savings we\u2019ll continue to clarify that particularly as we look into 2015, Laura can comment on that. But I will tell you that we see a tremendous amount of opportunity for incremental savings across all those buckets within our operational excellence initiative.","","Laura Thompson","That\u2019s right. And you know something David that\u2019s been on our strategy roadmap for several years, so it is a program we just started last quarter. It is one o those things to get it to be sustainable, you\u2019ve got to create the right foundation for it and sometimes starts off flow as you build that foundation. But I think that laying that strong foundation, having the plans going forward, rolling it out in a methodical approach around the world, it really will gives us that confident in long term sustainability especially through conversion cost savings.","","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Just looking kind of sequentially from 2Q to 3Q it seems as if a lot of it really came to fruition in the last quarter, so very interesting?","","Laura Thompson","You know, David, and I\u2019m sorry, let me clarify for you. So we did have a $120 million through the third quarter. We expect for the full year $130 to $150 and as we note in the comments to that chart on page 19, there are some investments in our marketing and our R&D new product portfolio that do happen in the fourth quarter that somewhat offset it. So the pace of the cost savings remains strong, but as we note this is also where we offset some of our incremental investments in our products going forward.","","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs","Understood, that helps clarified. Perhaps a next question there is a competitor in Europe that reported a week or so ago that sounded from them it looks like they were going continue to chase volume in the region by lowering price, I mean, how much of that have you contemplated in your forecast for 2015 and has that really affected pricing within the market?","","Richard Kramer","David, I would tell, we certainly can\u2019t comment on what the competitions doing, but I would say a disciplined strategy and how we\u2019re going to approach the market. If we look at our results in the quarter and year-to-date and if we look at revenue per tire taking out exchange and things like this, you would see and Christina can walk you through the details if you like later on.","Our revenue per tire is essentially flat when you adjust for exchange. So we\u2019ve been disciplined in how we\u2019re approaching the market. And I talk a lot in my remarks about what we\u2019re doing in North America and what was a very unique market to say the least but those type of comments and the strategy direction that we\u2019re taking hold for Europe as well and that\u2019s what team, Darren and the team are doing in Europe right now.","And we would see that continuing into 2015. David, I will say as we always have from time-to-time we do need to adjust prices. We have raw material indexes that relate to our OEMs and certain fleets and we\u2019ll adjust for those prices as we see fit. And we\u2019ve seen raw material come down and you\u2019ve seen some of that as well as we\u2019ve gone to do it. But certainly we expect to stay on our strategy as I\u2019ve described it.","","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs","All right. And then maybe just lastly before I jump, about $150 million in share repurchases outlined for the fourth quarter how much of that has been done to-date if any?","","Laura Thompson","Zero.","","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Understood. Thank you.","","Richard Kramer","Thanks David.","","Operator","Thank you. Next we\u2019ll move to Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","","Richard Kramer","Good morning, Rod.","","Laura Thompson","Hi, Rod.","","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","Good morning, a couple of things. Just first on the price mix versus raw materials. It was better in the quarter than you had been expecting during at least based in your commentary on the Q2 conference call. Could you just talk a little about the components of that $112 million, how should we be thinking about the pricing part and the mix part, what\u2019s changed?","","Laura Thompson","Okay. So no doubt and just to be specific with, I think you\u2019re referring to is on the second quarter call we talked about price mix net of raws, we expect it to be about the same or about $44 million negative in the third quarter, and it actually came in $14 million negative in the third quarter.","And really that\u2019s primarily due to what I would say stronger price mix especially mix than was in our forecast particularly in both North America and in Europe and when you listen to the volume story, you can hear that we especially in North America sold a lot less in the low end which caused a nice favorable mix for us in North America, so that\u2019s really the primary difference. And it is $30 million, it is different but on a very large revenue base somewhat small and hard to get it exactly precise on a forecast.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","Okay and then on slide 19, you suggested that price mix versus raw materials would become neutral in the fourth quarter, and then presumably positive again then as you look out to next year, earlier you were thinking that there would be a positive comparison in the fourth quarter because the mix comps in OTR would be easier versus the fourth quarter of last year. So what\u2019s moving around there that would make that less favorable if this quarter was more favorable?","Laura K. Thompson","","Yes, and it really is just timing Rod as we think about the two different quarters in the regions, we saw a little better than expected this quarter in the third quarter and kind of feel like the fourth quarter be a little worst. It is true that OTR kind of annualizes itself in the fourth quarter, so no big change there. But again, to your point it is slightly different, but it\u2019s really just driven by timing.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","Okay and also kind of along the same lines, your guidance for cost savings versus inflation if I remember correctly was that it would be a slight drag and it came out significantly better. How should we be \u2013 is that also kind of a timing issue what we saw this quarter?","Laura K. Thompson","Yes, I mean I think so. Right, we have had full year at the second quarter cost savings of about $50 million and that increased as we went through the third quarter, but it\u2019s really essentially about the same for the full year.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Just lastly, obviously I wouldn\u2019t expect you guys to be commenting on [LBO] and those kinds of things but it just \u2013 it does underscore kind of the cash flow generative power of the business and it certainly is positive that you are looking to allocate more capital for share repurchases to sort of put your money where your mouth is on the evaluation. How should we be thinking about that kind of on a going forward basis? Are you sort of suggesting that on a go-forward basis you\u2019re going to exercise more just pressure and flexibility vis-\u00e0-vis share repurchases to take advantage of valuation because up until now the primary message was just getting to investment grade?","Laura K. Thompson","Right. Really in essence there is no change to how we feel about the entire balance capital allocation plan including returning value to our shareholders. This is just like many of you based on the current stock price we don\u2019t think it reflects the confidence we have in our results, in our strategy going forward. So we\u2019re going to take this opportunity to buy up to $150 million in the fourth quarter.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","Okay, but nothing prospective beyond this in terms of how you are thinking about capital allocation?","Richard J. Kramer","","No, Ron, we put \u2013 I\u2019ll jump in there.","Laura K. Thompson","Yes, sure\u2026","Richard J. Kramer","We\u2019ve put a obviously a lot of time and effort into putting together and articulating the capital allocation plan and again we see it very balanced in terms of being shareholder friendly if you like in terms of dividends and share repurchases. We see it as what we view is the right thing to do to invest in our business to get more of those HVA tires which we need more, and focused on our leverage metrics as well. So no change in how we look at that point.","Laura K. Thompson","That\u2019s right. And it is based on our three year plan that started in 2014 and we\u2019re three quarters into a three year plan, so no change.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","","Right. Okay, thank you.","Richard J. Kramer","Thanks Ron.","Operator","Thank you. Next we\u2019ll move to Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Ryan Brinkman- JPMorgan","Hi, congrats on the quarter. Thanks for taking the questions. Just regarding the positive preliminary outlook for price mix raw [mets] spread in 2015 a couple of more questions on it. First it seems like from one of your earlier answers that you are assuming the latest commodity prices straight line, is that the case whether then estimated in the future trend I ask because I think there\u2019s some expectation that some better [indiscernible] rubber prices could now fall due to the decline in oil prices.","And then second, does the outlook assume any pricing benefit from U.S. tariffs and Chinese tires or would that be additive?","Richard J. Kramer","So just and Laura can jump in as well. So the thing to remember on how we look at raw materials very hard to determine where raw material prices are going. Our view has been over the long term that raw material prices would continue to increase, we haven\u2019t obviously we haven\u2019t seen that, we seen it actually go the other way right now. As we look to the 2015, what Laura mentioned earlier is remember we have a lag in terms of and it can be as much as six months, when we buy raw materials to when it actually comes through cost , the sales in terms of the tire being sold. So, by virtue of that we\u2019re going to see a tailwind going into 2015 just as the math works to get that, and that\u2019s something that will happen as we go.","And we don\u2019t make, we don\u2019t have use on really where raw material prices will end up. I\u2019ll point out that one of the corollaries that we had frankly years ago they got a little bit disjointed when oil prices got so high as if we saw a corollary between oil prices and natural rubber. That maybe something that gives us a better indication of how natural rubber will move over the near term. But we don\u2019t really, we\u2019re not setting a mark in what the natural rubber will be in 2015. And relative to the tariffs obviously we don\u2019t have a view on what will happen, that\u2019s a decision by Department of Commerce in the ITC and that\u2019s for them to make and then we\u2019ll deal with it.","Ryan Brinkman- JPMorgan","Okay. And then regarding the oil price decline, at least that is already taking place, presumably that will result in a fall off in gasoline prices, how do you think about that impacting miles driven and replacement shipments as they head into \u201915?","Richard J. Kramer","Actually I think it ideally will be a bit of a tailwind for us. I think the last numbers would take us average through June, I believe it\u2019s about up about 1.4% but of course that\u2019s before we\u2019ve seen the more precipitous drop in fuel prices right now. So, I think in general what we\u2019re seeing and it\u2019s actually a good thing. I think it\u2019s positive for us, positive for the industry is that miles driven are trending back in the right direction and it\u2019s positive because there was a time I remember being in an investor meeting a number of years ago, Rod probably would remember.","And we had a long discussion about where mobility was for consumers, because with gas prices high there was a view that people were going to stop driving or driving a lot less. And then we hit the recession where we saw that happen again. And now we\u2019re what multiple years out of the recession and we actually see that miles driven are trending back to where they were previous session levels after being flat for a long period of time.","So I think it supports the fact that citizens in the U.S., drivers in the U.S. value their mobility and for us that\u2019s a good thing over the long term and certainly lower gas prices help that as well.","Ryan Brinkman- JPMorgan","Okay. Thanks and just last question on some of the cost drivers. For savings overall, do you think you are in a position again where you sustainability drive cost savings and excessive general inflation and then on the so-called other line, I see in the footnote there\u2019s a $23 million benefit from lower incentive comp. Is that kind of like stock indexed compensation tailwind that might not continue if your shares hopefully are rebound?","Laura K. Thompson","Yes, it does it includes that. That\u2019s right. And then back to the net cost savings for our 2015 yes, exactly we expect to just similar to our track record in the past to have our cost savings net of inflation be a positive number in 2015.","Ryan Brinkman- JPMorgan","All right. That\u2019s helpful. Congrats again. Thanks.","Laura K. Thompson","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our final question from Emmanuel Rosner with CLSA. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA","Hi, good morning and thanks for squeezing me in. Yes first question and a point of clarification on the 2015 pricing expectations. If I want to focus only on the pricing and not on the raw materials, I understand that raw materials could be a tail wind at the beginning of the year because of the lag, but just on the pricing, do you expect an improvement in pricing conditions in 2015 versus the trend that we\u2019ve seen in 2014? And in particularly related to that you were speaking about stock piles of Chinese tires because of a prebuy, do you think that in addition to an impact on shipment this could have also an impact on the industry pricing?","Richard J. Kramer","","On the first point obviously we don\u2019t comment on pricing. I would tell you our view has always been that we feel the value of our products is what we look to be compensated for in the market. So value of our products, the brand, the distribution, the service, the quality of the products is all what we try to get compensated for in the market and that\u2019s what will continue to drive in 2015, again supported by new products supported by the programs we have out in the market place to do that and we feel very confident about that going into 2015.","And the impacts of the stock piles of inventory I guess is a situation that\u2019s going to play out and will be impacted by the decision of the DOC in the Department of Commerce and the ITC and whatever those decisions are, are what we\u2019ll have to deal with. And I think what I would refer you to is to look back at what happened at the tariffs when the 421 tariffs were put in place, certainly there were other environmental things going on around there as well like increasing raw material prices, but that\u2019s one way to potentially think about what could happen. If they were to go in place, but again, the question of whether they will or not is one we don\u2019t have a view on it, it\u2019s a decision by the ITC and the Department of Commerce.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA","Okay, and then on Europe. I mean obviously very impressive margin performance in the challenging environment in general. Do you view these sort of margins as sustainable obviously you had some significant cost savings but the challenges in the region seem to be not to be abating, do you think these margins are sustainable in the long run?","Richard J. Kramer","We certainly do over the long run. And I would say we do feel very good about the results in Europe in the quarter and year-to-date. We\u2019re doing what we said we would do. We\u2019ve got the right portfolio. We\u2019ve got a great winter tire product, we are dealing with our cost over there and we are really probably most importantly re-establishing our value proposition with our distributors and dealers out there and being more competitive in the market place and doing so versus where we were in the past.","And you are seeing that in our results. Emmanuel, I have to just build on your point, clearly what we\u2019re seeing in Germany in terms of the economic conditions there certainly in the euro zone itself and with the weaker euro and with consumer demand being obviously challenged a bit more recently consumer confidence, excuse me \u2013 the headwinds clearly are in Europe and that\u2019s something we are going to have to deal with both with again winning in our targeted market segments but also focusing on cost in that environment.","I\u2019d add one other thing for you to think about in Europe particularly as we look ahead and that\u2019s a comment Laura mentioned that a large part of the tire market in Europe is the winter market. And right now, as Laura said, we\u2019ve planned for a green winter as we look at it but I\u2019d also say that right now it\u2019s pretty warm in Northern Europe, so it\u2019s not snowing over there yet and while we\u2019ve had a great sell-in to the market with our products the question as it always is it\u2019s going to be what happens on sell-out. So we certainly like it to snow a little more over there to help that process move forward. But that will be something we need to deal within the quarter as well.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA","Very helpful. And then just one real final point of clarification. A follow up to Ryan\u2019s question on the benefit from lower incentive compensation, can you maybe give us some of the drivers of \u2013 what drove this, this benefit, is it really mostly the stock price decline during the quarter, because it was obviously a large benefit, so how should we think about it as we model on the future, years and quarters?","Laura K. Thompson","It\u2019s really driven by the stock price, right. They reverted last year\u2019s change in the stock prices.","Richard J. Kramer","Nothing more complicated than that.","Laura K. Thompson","Right, very simple.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA","Okay. Thank you very much.","Laura K. Thompson","Thank you.","Richard J. Kramer","Okay, thank you Emmanuel and thanks everyone for participating today. We appreciate your interest and attention. Thank you.","Laura K. Thompson","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's conference."],"10073":["Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. (NASDAQ:GT) Q3 2016 Earnings Call October 28, 2016  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Christina Zamarro - Vice President of Investor Relations","Rich Kramer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Laura Thompson - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs","Paresh Jain - Morgan Stanley","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA","Operator","Good morning everyone and welcome to The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn today\u2019s program over to Christina Zamarro, Goodyear's Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Christina Zamarro","Thank you, Tony, and thank you everyone for joining us for Goodyear's third quarter 2016 earnings call. Joining me today are Rich Kramer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Laura Thompson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, there are few items we need to cover. The supporting slide presentation for today's call can be found on our website at investor.goodyear.com. And a replay of this call will be available later today. Replay instructions were included in our earnings release issued earlier this morning.","If I could now draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2, I would like to remind participants on today's call that our presentation includes some forward-looking statements about Goodyear's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments today.","The most significant factors that could affect future results are outlined in Goodyear's filings with the SEC and in our earnings release. The company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","Our financial results are presented on a GAAP basis, and in some cases, a non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures discussed on the call are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent as part of the Appendix to the slide presentation.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Rich.","Rich Kramer","Thank you, Christina, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I\u2019ll cover updates to our industry and our 2016 plan since we last spoke at our Investor Day meeting in Boston. Then I\u2019ll briefly discuss each of our regional businesses. As always, Laura will follow with a detailed financial report before opening the call for your questions.","Our third quarter results were highlighted by continued growth in segment operating margin. All three of our global businesses achieved operating margins above 12% led by our Asia-Pacific business, which delivered 18.3% operating margin. In addition, our year-to-date core segment operating income grew to a record nine-month level.","We delivered global segment operating margin of 14.5% for the quarter in a more challenging overall industry environment, particularly in our U.S. commercial truck tire business. This performance demonstrates the strength of our value proposition and our sustainability of margin growth in our business.","As we discussed at our September Investor Day, our strategy is built to take advantage of the trends shaping our industry. Global demand for a high value-added large rim diameter tires is increasing and we believe that our portfolio of these products plus our connected business model position us on the path to sustained growth and competitive advantage.","I\u2019m also very pleased with the decisions we are making in our business units to drive and stay on our strategy. We continue to have opportunities to pursue short-term volume in increases that recognize that these opportunities are in unprofitable parts of the market that are not growing. In other words, any potential near-term gains would fall outside our long term strategy.","The value of a strategy is in its consistent execution regardless of industry and internal conditions. At Goodyear, we are committed to consistent execution of our strategy. Now during the third quarter and particularly late in the quarter, we experienced some headwinds to our plan.","In addition to generally weaker overall industry conditions, three specific items affected our third quarter results and our expectations for the fourth quarter. I\u2019ll comment on each this morning. First, as a result of the challenging market conditions and lower volumes in our U.S. commercial truck tire business, we experienced higher conversion costs in the quarter.","Second, we saw increased competition in deterioration in the pricing environment in EMEA, specifically in the smaller than 17-inch rim diameter consumer tire segment of the market. And third, there was incremental weakness in our OTR business consistent with what you\u2019re seeing in the mining industry.","While these distinct items had a near term impact on our results, the headwinds do not detract from our value proposition in the market or our ability to execute our long term plan and achieve our 2020 targets. In fact, we made strong progress in the quarter in our targeted market segments that we reviewed with you at our September investor meeting.","I\u2019d like to address each of our business units starting with the Americas. Our third quarter segment operating income was a solid $305 million and segment operating margin was strong at 14.7%. Even so, our results were lower than expected. To recap what we saw on the quarter, I\u2019ll depart from the usual flow of my review and begin with our U.S. commercial truck tire business given its impact on this quarter. ","The U.S. commercial truck industry continues to be effected by weak OE volumes and the impact of tariffs on Chinese imports in the replacement market. The current industry environment in heavy truck, especially new truck production, continues to be challenging. Net orders for North America Class A trucks were down 29% in September alone and 39% year-to-date.","In addition to this trend, an impact in the quarter related to a specific commercial OE customer exacerbated the weakness in the overall market. As you would expect, in response to the lower OE demand, and to better manage our inventory we reduced our production levels further during the quarter. The resulting increase in unabsorbed overhead in turn caused unexpected third quarter period caused given the already lower utilization in our factories. ","Our outlook also includes additional ticket cuts to be made in the month of October. So the weakness in the OE segment, coupled with the pre-buy associated with the expected tariff on Chinese truck tires have created a short-term supply demand imbalance in the marketplace. You recall a similar pre-buying balance related to the tariff impact on consumer replacement tires as well. ","We expect the supply demand and balance to improve over the next several quarters and we are confident in the strength of our portfolio of Goodyear Dunlop and our value oriented Kelly brands together with our industry-leading service network that offer our customers the right tires for their specific needs. Apparent with our industry-leading fleet solutions business model our commercial truck tire business remains competitively advanced in reducing operating costs for our fleet customers in any economic environment. ","During my time at Goodyear, we\u2019ve experienced volatility in the commercial truck OE industry before. For example, we saw a spike in new truck purchases triggered by pending emission regulations and mandatory engine changes. We've managed through these and similar circumstances in the past and know from experience that the demand imbalance always turns around. We expect this time to be no different.","Switching now to the Americas consumer business, we saw robust margin expansion with strong mix-up in both the U.S. and Brazil. Consumer margins in the Americas were up 200 basis points in the quarter, driven by growth in those 17-inch and larger segment in the U.S. Industry growth in these premium tires was 8% in the quarter, outpacing growth in the overall market by nearly 3 times. And as was the case last quarter Goodyear outperformed the market growth in this segment. This remains a proof point of the soundness of a strategy. ","However, across the broader consumer replacement market we\u2019ve continued to see some destocking at the dealer and distributor level and a sluggish retail environment. As a result, we now expect the U.S. replacement industry to be up only modestly at 1% for the full-year. Regardless, we remain bullish on the mix-up trend and supply demand situation for tires that are 17-inches and larger. That market remains robust. ","The underlying fundamentals in our industry, particularly miles driven, gasoline prices and fuel consumption remain strong. Vehicle miles travel increased by a record 3.4% in August and is a strong indicator of the immediate term demand. While the broader market consumer tire selling trends did not afford us an opportunity to offset headwinds in our commercial truck tire business this quarter, we expect more favorable demand in the consumer replacement market in the future. ","As I said many times, we are not pursuing more volume for volume sake. Our team remains disciplined in our approach as we pursue profitable volume growth. The demand for our premium high-value added tires and replacement is still strong and we continue to be challenged to fully satisfy market demand. ","We continue to be focused on increasing our capability and managing our production cost to increase our supply of the right tires for this demand for the balance of 2016 and into 2017. This remains our number one priority. So, overall, the Americas underlying consumer business performance remains robust and demonstrates the earnings power of the value proposition in our core business and with the San Luis Potosi factory coming online in late 2017, we are on track to increase our supply of 17-inch and larger tires as this market continues to grow. ","Turning now to EMEA, we delivered stable segment operating income and year-over-year margin expansion of 70 basis points despite a weaker and more competitive industry environment. The European consumer replacement industry was flat in the quarter, driven by slight increases in summer and slight decreases in winter segments. The winter industry was down 1%, as we\u2019ve continued to see dealers and distributors delay winter purchases. ","Despite a very low comparable from last year's green winter selling industry winter volumes in Europe were down 3% in the month of September. The winter segment did see robust growth in the 17-inch and larger segment, which was more than offset by a decline in smaller sizes. ","In the summer replacement industry however, increased competition including a continued presence of imported Chinese tires, particularly in Eastern Europe led to year-over-year volume declines in the quarter in our less than 17-inch segment of the market. ","In that environment, we didn't chase volume for volumes sake. We stuck to our mix up strategy to capture the volume value of the Goodyear brand for us and for our customers consistent with our objective to pursue profitable growth. ","As you recall from our Investor Day presentation, we expect global growth in the 17-inch and larger portion of the market at 15% through 2020, more than three times the long-term industry growth rate of 4%. That\u2019s the opportunity. Now at the same time, we see the market for 16-inch and smaller tires to be increasingly oversupply and less profitable. That shift implies declining growth, increased competition, and overall tougher industry environment for the smaller sizes over the same period of time. ","So, we saw the effect of these factors on the summer tires segment already this quarter, our 2020 plan contemplated this impact and included corresponding actions we would take to address our presence in competitiveness in this part of the market. Our plan includes taking the necessary steps to shift our resources and reduce our exposure to declining less profitable market segments as evidenced by our footprint action we announced earlier this week in Philippsburg, Germany.","This is one of the restructuring steps required to execute our 2020 plan and is at the core of what we believe is needed to recalibrate our EMEA business to the more profitable segments of the market. This is among the difficult, but necessary decisions that will be required to execute our plan and we are committed to do just that. ","As we've demonstrated continually over the past decade, we will reduce cost while investing in our business to grow. We are confident that our line-up of high-value added large rim diameter tires will enable us to meet the increasing demand in the industry's most profitable high growth segments. ","We continue to have complete confidence in our strategy and we won't compromise our long-term value proposition in the marketplace. In Asia-Pacific, our third quarter segment operating income was a record $99 million, an increase of 38% from last year's performance. In addition, segment operating margin was 18%. Our unit volumes were up 12%, excluding the impact of the new Japanese replacement business. ","China had an outstanding quarter as volumes increased more than 25% versus the prior year. Once again, our growth was broad based as consumer OE was up 30%, and consumer replacement volume increased about 20%. On a year-to-date basis, our volume growth in China is about twice that of the industry. ","Similarly, we saw above market growth in India in the quarter of nearly 9%. Our performance across these and other countries is driving share gains for our entire Asia-Pacific region. We\u2019re very pleased with our results in Asia-Pacific and we\u2019re consistently building our foundation to enable continued long-term growth in the region. ","We\u2019ll continue driving new product introductions, OE pull-through and build-out of our distribution network to support sustainable long-term growth. Reflecting on our 2016 targets, clearly we have experienced short-term obstacles in our markets. You saw in our press release this morning that we\u2019ve revised our 2016 segment operating income targets to be between $2 billion and $2.25 billion. ","As I\u2019ve said, the tire industry does not move in a straight line. Our team is prepared to deal with that volatility and will continue to be focused on long-term economic value creation in our business. In light of the progress we have made up over the past several years, I am pleased with the resilience of our margins despite the recent turbulence affecting our business.","Achieving this stability is perhaps the best indication of the strength of our strategy and the changes we\u2019ve made to Goodyear's business over the past several years. The headwinds we\u2019re experiencing this year do not track from our value proposition in the market or our ability to execute on our long-term plan. We continue to see our view of the industry megatrends being be reaffirmed as the demand for 17-inch and larger tires remains robust. ","We know that we\u2019re in a very competitive tire industry and there will be occasional obstacles and distractions that will challenge our focus. Winning in the global tire business will require hard work, agility, and discipline, but I am absolutely confident in our commitment to executing our strategy and we will continue our progress toward our 2020 target of $3 billion in segment operating income, and $3.5 million to $4 billion in returns to shareholders as part of our 2017 to 2020 capital allocation plan. ","We are as focused as ever on working on behalf of our customers by being the industry's innovation leader being first with customers being the leader in profitable segments to the market and as a result of being a company that continuously drives sustainable value. ","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Laura.","Laura Thompson","Thank you, Rich, and good morning everyone. Today, I will cover our third quarter results and provide more detail on key income drivers in the quarter. I\u2019ll also cover updates to our 2016 outlook before we open the call up for your questions. Turning to the income statement on Slide 8 and as in prior quarters, we have provided callouts that highlight the impact of the deconsolidation of Venezuela. ","Our unit volume, excluding Venezuela was about flat year-over-year, as growth in Asia-Pacific was offset by declines in Americas and EMEA. The deconsolidation of Venezuela reduced net sales by $155 million. In addition, lower volume negatively impacted revenues by $73 million. ","Other tire related revenues were lower by $59 million, driven by the 2015 sale of the North American motorcycle business. Our gross margin increased to 28.9% and segment operating margin increased to 14.5% in the quarter. Our earnings per share on a diluted basis was $1.19, our results were influenced by certain significant items. Adjusting for these items, our earnings per share was $1.17, which represents an 18% increase versus last year. ","Turning to the step chart on Slide 9, which walks third quarter 2015 segment operating income to third quarter 2016, the negative impact of lower volume and production was $25 million. Lower raw material cost of $41 million more than offset reduced price mix of $38 million for a net benefit of $3 million. Cost saving actions of $93 million, driven by our operational excellence initiatives more than offset the $33 million negative impact of inflation, delivering a net benefit of $60 million. ","Foreign currency exchange was a slight headwind of $5 million, reflecting the continued strength of the U.S. dollar, particularly against the British pound. Other was lower by $40 million, which was driven by the following three factors. First, a $14 million impact from the sale of our North American motorcycle business bringing the full-year impact to $30 million. Second, our commercial tire and service centers negatively impacted the quarter by $10 million, reflecting the more difficult environment for the commercial truck business in the U.S. And third, lower earnings in our third party chemical business driven by the receipt of a royalty payment last year. ","Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 10, cash and cash equivalents at end of the quarter were about $1 billion. Total debt is down more than $200 million from the second quarter, and net debt is down slightly as well. The increase in net debt versus year-end reflects the normal working capital seasonality in our business. The increase in net debt versus the prior year period includes the impact of Venezuela's deconsolidation. ","Free cash flow from operations is shown on Slide 11. For the quarter, we generated $150 million of cash. Working capital was a use of $264 million and in-line with the typical third quarter seasonality of our business. Additionally, cash flow from operating activities was $357 million in the quarter. ","Turning to Slide 12, the Americas business generated segment operating income of $305 million in the third quarter or 14.7% to sales. The year-over-year decline in SOI is more than explained by three factors. First, a $43 million impact from lower commercial truck demand, including higher conversion and period costs related to unabsorbed overhead, and the impact on our commercial tire and service centers. ","Second, a $39 million impact of the deconsolidation of Venezuela; and third a $16 million impact from the sale of the GDTNA business last year. Unit sales in the third quarter were $18.6 million or down 8% versus 2015. The negative impact of Venezuela and the sale of GDTNA together was about 600,000 units. Excluding these impacts U.S. consumer volumes were about flat and U.S. commercial shipments were down 12%. ","The remainder of the unit volume decline was driven by lower consumer OE and replacement volume in Brazil and Canada. In summary and despite several notable headwinds, the Americas region, particularly the underlying performance of our U.S. consumer business which saw 200 basis point of margin improvement remains sound. ","Turning to Slide 13, Europe, Middle East and Africa generated segment operating income of $152 million in the quarter. Segment operating margin expanded 70 basis points to 12.3%, primarily driven by our continued focus on cost efficiency. This benefit was offset by the impact of lower volume in the quarter. ","Overall, EMEA unit volumes declined 4.5% year-over-year. EMEA\u2019s OE unit volume was down 8%. We began the quarter with lower expectations for our OE unit volume, following choices we've made consistent with our OE selectivity strategy and our intensifying focus on the more profitable 17-inch and larger rim size fitment. This impact was amplified by reduced demand as one of our customers experienced a supply disruption and lower than plan production during the quarter. ","Replacement tire shipments were down 3%, which is more than explained by increased competition at the lower end of the market in our summer consumer business, all in less than 17-inch rim diameter products. We have seen mild weather across Europe in October and continue to take a cautious approach on volume expectations for the remainder of the year. That said, the strength of our winter product portfolio has us well-positioned to drive future business and win in our targeted market segments.","As Rich mentioned, we are executing plans to realign our EMEA manufacturing foot print to enable growth in profitable market segments, while building a foundation to deliver sustainable earnings. We are confident about the regions long term growth opportunities and remain committed to that long term growth.","Turning to Slide 14, Asia-Pacific delivered record third quarter segment operating income of $99 million, a $27 million improvement versus last year, with the main driver continuing to be strong volume growth. Our segment operating margin in the region increased to 18.3%, up from 15.7% a year ago. ","Asia-Pacific\u2019s volume was $8 million tire units, representing 33% growth versus last year. Excluding the impact of our acquisition of the Japanese replacement tire business, the remaining volume growth is primarily attributable to our key markets in China and India. We are well-positioned in Asia-Pacific and continue to be excited about the long-term growth opportunities there.","Turning now to Slide 15, we have updated our full year SOI drivers. Overall, we now expect volume growth of 1% to 2% for the year and our unabsorbed overhead benefit has been updated to about $20 million. Fourth quarter unit volume will be about year-over-year as we expect continued pressure in a weaker environment in Brazil and in a less than 17-inch rim diameters summer segment in EMEA.","Raw material costs were unchanged versus our prior outlook at down 4% for the year. Although our net price mix versus raw material cost benefit has been updated to approximately $55 million benefit. This includes the impact of a more difficult commercial truck industry environment in the U.S. Reflecting our strong cost performance in the third quarter, our cost savings is revised up to about $150 million for the year.","Our fourth quarter net cost savings will include a $30 million headwind for favorable adjustments to our general and product liability accruals last year. Regarding foreign currency translation, we now expect a headwind of approximately $25 million based on current spot rates. The final update in other, reflects a weaker environment for our other tire related businesses, particularly the U.S. commercial tire and service centers. This driver now reflects an additional $10 million headwind for the year.","Our full year SOI guidance totaled $2.00 billion to $2.25 billion for 2016. Additional financial assumptions for 2016 are listed on Slide 16. We have tightened the range for interest expense, which is now expected to be $360 million to $375 million for the full year. The next change is a slight increase in working capital, which is now expected to be a use of approximately a $100 million. We expect CapEx to be about $1 billion, which was the low end of the range we provided in July. ","Finally, I\u2019ll cover updates on our capital allocation plan. We repurchased $50 million of stock during the third quarter. We\u2019ve repurchased $613 million so far under our existing $1.1 billion share repurchase authorization and $200 million year-to-date. We plan to purchase about $500 million in total for the year, which leaves about $300 million that we expect to complete over the balance of the year.","Finally, we remain committed to our 2017 to 2020 capital allocation plan and our 2020 target of $3 billion in SOI. The temporary weakness we are seeing in our commercial business will not impact our ability to deliver on our long-term plan. With our announcement to close the Philippsburg, Germany facility we will use $165 million to $190 million of our 2017 to 2020 restructuring basket. The majority of this cash is expected as an outflow in 2018.","The plant has 6 million units of capacity today, primarily in the less than 17-inch market. As part of our restructuring plan, we will reallocate production of the larger more profitable sizes to existing facilities within our footprint at a lower cost. This action further enables our focus on high value segments of the market, while continuing to reduce our exposure to declining market.","Now, we\u2019ll open the call up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Rich Kramer","Good morning, Rod.","Rod Lache","Good morning. I guess the - the most important question I want to ask you is, just in terms of the supply demand dynamic because ultimately the biggest driver of the earnings that you put up is going to be pricing versus raw materials and how that evolves, especially now with spot prices for some, raw is up a little bit off the bottom. I understand that the supply demand dynamic is going to be really good on the greater than 17-inch tire market, but you are calling out a few markets obviously that are relatively weak, could you just give us some context on your exposure to the less than 17-inch tire market and how you see that kind of playing into your strategy of offsetting raw material costs with pricing?","Rich Kramer","Yes, so Rod, it\u2019s a good question, fair question. I guess the first thing that I would tell you sort of unequivocally, we don\u2019t view that there is any change to the upside to the trend of 17-inch or greater that we talked about. We still believe and I know you know these numbers, but we see almost a four times increase in 17-inch and above versus the normal market. So, that situation full stop is exactly the same of what we see and the question of what does that mean, you are relating that back a little bit to the volume price mix versus raw material equation, particularly in-light of, I think you are right to call out some raw material headwinds coming in, in 2017. ","I would tell you Rod we have a track record even before we had sort of the tailwind of the 17-inch and above market coming in to manage volume price mix effectively and we would intend to do the same moving forward. I can tell you that I am very pleased in the quarter even with the discipline that the businesses have had. I made reference to this in my comments as well. On the lower end of the market, particularly in Europe, we stuck to our value proposition and we stuck to our strategy and we didn\u2019t chose volume for volumes sake. ","We stuck to the value proposition and you might be right to assume we lost a little volume in doing that, but it is the right thing to in that part of the market that\u2019s declining that\u2019s crowed that\u2019s increasing unprofitable, less profitable, I\u2019ll say and in getting more competitive as we go. So, we stuck to our guns; that\u2019s what we are going to do. And we married that up also with a foot print action to give us the flexibility to take these actions going forward. So, very pleased with the discipline there. And I can also tell you even in the quarter. ","On the 17-inch and above market, I won\u2019t go into different markets here, but we actually increased our pricing and our value proposition even in the quarter in doing that and you see that coming through broadly speaking in the margin improvements that we had both in North America and in EMEA. So, as we look at this I would say we don\u2019t see any change in what we talked about in September. ","We don\u2019t see any difference in terms of the opportunities that we see and if anything Rod, I would tell you, we\u2019re really focused on accelerating the change in Europe as we move ahead and accelerating it means exposing ourselves to having to take certain decisions courageously in terms of dealing with some of the segments of the market that we don\u2019t want to play in and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re going to do. We know how to do it and it\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re going to do going forward. So, I will just pause there for a moment Rod.","Rod Lache","Yes, it\u2019s good to hear that you\u2019re raising prices on the greater than 17-inch, but can you just put some brackets around what your exposure is, I know you\u2019ve prioritized to the higher end, but what is the exposure as it stands today to the less than 17-inch market and if you were to look at current spot prices for raw materials, what\u2019s the magnitude of raw material headwind that you\u2019d expected at some point presumably next year?","Rich Kramer","So Rod, I think we kind of said as a total company or globally we\u2019re about 55% of our OE business is 17-inch or greater and our goal is to increase that by about 5 percentage points as we get out to 2020. I won\u2019t break it down by region in particular, but I\u2019ll tell you, our exposure in North America and then in Europe are the highest in OE and in total, I would say Europe today is roundabout I think approaching around 30% of our total business is that 17-inch and above. ","You have to remember that the, you know the middle part of the market which includes some 17-inch or below 17-inch tires is still a lot of tires that we have. And some of that business is very profitable as well. So, we will continue to drive that business, but we\u2019re also going to continue to reduce our exposure to that going forward. That will, some of that will actually move into 2017 as we do that, but again the right decision for us is we take the capacity out and as we continue to mix up and change over that capacity to make 17-inch and above.","Laura Thompson","And then Rod, just on your question on the raw materials, so certainly based on the current spot rates you are right to say that we will see higher raw material cost in 2017 than in 2016. Now they have increased, the raw have increased recently, we do expect some moderate reduction in those over the next couple of months as we look forward, but we do still see it up year-over-year. When you look at the first quarter of 2017 that certainly will have headwinds because raws were so low in the first quarter of 2016. ","Now we\u2019ll get into exact percents and so on as we get to the February call as we always do, but I\u2019ll just continue to point out, I think at Investor Day we showed a couple of charts where historically I think it was over the last five years there is always RMIs that come into play a particular quarter of so, but we have been able to do that whether to manage through that whether raw materials where increasing or decreasing. ","Rod Lache","Okay. And I presume the strategy is to continue that just to match on the pricing side whatever the raw material cost do?","Laura Thompson","Yes, absolutely, right. We make investments for our products. Our value proposition what we bring to the marketplace, there is absolutely nothing has changed on that mentality.","Rod Lache","Okay.","Rich Kramer","And Rod, I just want to maybe just add a little bit more on the mix question you said, because I do think it is an important one. It is the essence of the positive market that we see. Again I\u2019d go back and if I could elaborate a bit, remember this starts with OE, which is where we are getting these fitments, and then if I could even point you back, you don\u2019t have to look at it now, but I think it\u2019s on page 55 of what Steve McClellan reviewed in the Investor Meeting. ","He showed a diagram that showed round about a 10-year period for the OE, percentage OE of our business at 17-inch and above to sort of make its way into the replacement business, given two to three to four year change of those tires going forward. We see that trend happening very fast and that\u2019s the upside, that\u2019s the positive nature of what we have and that\u2019s where the supply demand equation still sits in favor of ourselves as we move forward. That also says that as we migrate through that we still sell a lot of 17, or below 17-inch tires and some of those certainly at a profit. ","So, I don\u2019t want to leave you with the view that we are not selling any of those. As you know that\u2019s still a big size of the market in total, but we\u2019re increasingly shifting over to the larger RIM diameter tires and I know you know this, but remember even though there are smaller volumes the margins are higher and our driving what we have in our results. The 16-inch and below, increasingly crowded, oversupply, declining, literally competing against hundreds of brands in there, particularly some of the Asian brands come into Europe as we\u2019ve talked about in the past. ","So, as we address that proactively we won\u2019t exit it immediately, but will continue to mix up and that\u2019s where that margin profile was going to come. It is, I would say a great trend that we have in the industry as we look to the future. So hopefully that helped a little bit, Rod.","Rod Lache","Yeah, thank you.","Rich Kramer","Thank you.","Operator","Next we will move to Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Ryan Brinkman","Great, thanks for taking\u2026","Rich Kramer","Good morning, Ryan.","Ryan Brinkman","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So, it looks like the volatility around the commercial vehicle tire shipments is having a relatively large impact on SOI, can you maybe frame for us the relative contribution or variable profit of commercial vehicle tire versus a light vehicle tire?","Laura Thompson","Sure. Commercial truck on average we\u2019d say about $60 a tire. Consumer I think, we usually is just under 20, about $18 a tire.","Ryan Brinkman","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And I remember a couple of years ago that it might have been exactly two years ago, you not realized as much raw material savings even though commodities were lower because you shipped fewer OTR tires, which is relatively more raw materials and so you didn\u2019t have quite the savings, is something like that maybe happening to a lesser degree in 3Q this year just given that, I imagine commercial vehicle tires where they use a lot less raw materials that OTR tires?","Rich Kramer","Ryan I\u2019ll, no that\u2019s really not an issue. As I try to articulate in my remarks. I think if you look at our commercial business we really sort of had these three elements that impacted us in the quarter. You know one was frankly we had a weakness in consumer or in commercial OE volume new trucks, we saw trucks down I think 29% in the quarter and just to be \u2013 add a little bit of clarity and transparency on it, we tend to - when we see those we manage our inventory, we take production out. ","As we took that production out, what happened to us is, when we go through our unabsorbed overhead calculations as part of our accounting policy, as you take that volume out, we can trip a number, which was again very candidly unexpected where instead of that unabsorbed overhead or lower factory utilization turning up as a product cost and then being released is cost of sale when the tire is sold, it effectively gets recorded in the period that we take the production cut in this case in September.","So that was an issue that hit us in the quarter. Then we had a specific customer issue, where we are again, I won\u2019t elaborate on, but we\u2019ll say we\u2019re sticking to our value proposition as we go. And then we had frankly just lower volumes. This one is very hard to predict, but we had significant increases in the pre-buys ahead of the tariff and commercial truck tires. I think we had non-RMA members in the U.S. were up, I think 35% in Q1, I think 74% in Q2, and down 23% in Q3. And frankly that\u2019s really hard to predict those pre-volume numbers as we go. And remember that\u2019s in an industry where sort of ton miles and the way to measure freight is, let\u2019s just say relatively flat and not up. ","So, dealing with that also had an impact in the quarter. Again, little bit harder to predict, but this is something we\u2019ve seen before. Dealers have loaded up on truck tires that means there is a little shelf space, but that will work its way through. Our products are leading in the industry. Our fleet solutions model continues to be very strong. That will work its way through, it will take care of itself as we go forward and we\u2019re working through a distortion. Unfortunately and again just to be very transparent about it; that did have an impact on us in the quarter. So that was one of the things I would say. The OTR did hit us, but that was a little bit more of the cyclicality of the mining industry, it wouldn\u2019t be what you\u2019re referring to which I do remember about a year or so ago.","Laura Thompson","And that Ryan, just for your - as you look at SOI walks and so on, that OTR impact pretty much hit in the mix of the bucket, okay.","Ryan Brinkman","Okay. That was really helpful commentary, thank you. And then just last question is, if you could talk about the drivers of the very strong shipping growth in Asia-Pacific, maybe in-light of the very strong China light vehicle production over there, perhaps you could remind us of your OE versus after market exposure, I think it is different in that market than in the U.S., and then what is your outlook for that region kind of going forward as maybe as per IHS, the China light vehicle production growth decelerates, but perhaps there is tailwind in the aftermarket, how do those net out?","Rich Kramer","So Ryan, I am actually very pleased with the way our Asia business is delivering right now, particularly in China and Christina or Laura will correct me, our percentage of OE there is about 60%, it\u2019s higher than it is in other regions and that\u2019s because when we went to set up our business there, it started out as essentially all an OE business and therefore that mix still tends to be weight towards OE. That will sort of rectify over time. I would say a couple of things, one the industry was still a very strong, particularly the OE industry. I'd also point out that the OE industry in China does have volatility to it as well, but it was very strong right now and what we\u2019ve done over there is very consciously tried to create, I would say or creating a business model that\u2019s branded, that\u2019s focused on 17-inch and above, the larger rim diameter tires, and also focusing on getting the right vehicles to have that pull through. ","We've also created a network of stores of distribution points that we manage very consciously. It\u2019s easy to open a lot of outlets and then how to close them later, frankly we've encountered that in the past, but we're very methodically managing our distribution channels over there and using digital and using other tools to reach those consumers. So, our China business from a brand, from a product, from a mix, from a customer basis is very strong and obviously we know that growth is in Asia and in China. So, we're very positive on that and I think as we said in the September investor meeting, we're planning to increasing our capacity at Pulandian factory, and I won't elaborate here. We also increased, announced capacity increases in India as well. So, area of the world is growing here, area of the world that people are continuing to drive and we're positioning ourselves well for it.","Ryan Brinkman","Great, thank you.","Rich Kramer","Thank you.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll move to David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Rich Kramer","Good morning, David","David Tamberrino","Hi thanks. Good morning. I got a couple of follow-ups from earlier questions and a few of my own, just on the mix, I think you said you were 55% OE, HVA globally, but you didn't give a replacement breakdown, what does that look like globally for HVA 17-inch and above tires?","Rich Kramer","So, overall, I think it\u2019s around about the 40% range, if I'm about correct?","Laura Thompson","Yes 35% to 40% in replacement, yes.","David Tamberrino","Okay, that's helpful. And on the commercial vehicle side, obviously understanding the supply demand disruption that impacted the quarter, wondering what you\u2019ve seen so far in the October timeframe from a trend perspective, is this going to take another couple of months to work through the excess supply and this is a potential 2017 rebound in volumes, on the replacement side for commercial vehicle or is it going to be an issue into the first half of 2017?","Rich Kramer","Well David clearly based on the, well I maybe I shouldn't say clearly, but based on the guidance that we did put out there will be a drag in the fourth quarter of the unabsorbed overhead from lower truck production or lower commercial production as well. So that is one of the headwinds that we're facing in the fourth quarter that caused us to change the outlook. So that will continue. How long it takes, the truck product to work through the shelves and the distribution that\u2019s a harder one to call, but we know that will happen just as it happened with the consumer side. ","So, it doesn't concern me. It is a question of when, not if. And then the larger question of what happens in 2017, I think that\u2019s largely going to be what happens from an industry perspective, and I think as we look to our guidance for 2017 we\u2019ll let you know. OE, you know new truck production as I mentioned, I think down 29%, I think it was in the quarter and 39% and 38% year-to-date. ","So that will change. I mean David, one thing I\u2019ll tell you about the truck industry, having done this a while, you get to a feast or famine and right now we have the new truck production down, it will come back as we move ahead. Engine changes, whatever it is, we have pre-buys and fall off, so it will come back. I\u2019m very confident of that, but as we look to 2017, I would say we will wait to get to the fourth quarter call and we\u2019ll be in a position to give you I think a better guidance on that.","David Tamberrino","Understood. As I think about some of your competitor\u2019s, one of them is a little bit larger than you are in the mining tires segment, and they are essentially calling for a rebound within the market in 2017, is that what you are seeing, is that your base case and what if anything in terms of rebound in mining tire demand is baked into your forecast for 2017 through 2020.","Laura Thompson","Right, so, you know David for our September Investor Day, we certainly did not build-in a rebound in the OTR business. Maybe a little bit of an improvement, but not a rebound. We don't see that also for 2017. As we look at it, we still think 2017 will be under tremendous pressure. Now the good news is, and I, may be famous last words, it does feel like we are at the bottom as we go, but again we\u2019ve not baked any rebound into the 2017 through 2020 plan as we go. ","David Tamberrino","Okay. And then if I think about it just getting back to the levels or maybe not the levels in the 2012, 2013 as we were peaking, but a couple of years ago in 2014 there was about a $19 million headwind in price mix for the entire year, and a large majority of that was driven by the productions in mining tires. I mean is that notwithstanding, you still had the mix up from the consumer tire business and commercial vehicles still performing well. So my question is, if we were to see a rebound in mining is that potentially $50 million, $100 million, $200 million in favorable mix coming back into your P&L?","Laura Thompson","Yes. I mean the short answer is, yes, right. You\u2019re exactly right, back in 2014 a big part of that negative mix was there. So we are at about half of our profitability levels right now, off of our peak. So you're in the ballpark. It is big numbers when it rebounds.","David Tamberrino","Thank you, that's helpful. And then just lastly on the restructuring benefits, obviously announced something this week, was that is in addition to what was communicated from 2017 through 2020?","Laura Thompson","That's right, that's right. So, when we were - at Investor Day and I think you and I talked long about it, we certainly on Investor Day included restructuring cash. We knew we were going to continue to take actions, but couldn't make any announcements and we talked about the benefits then being upside to that. So it\u2019s really the 30 million is incremental to the 2020 plan.","David Tamberrino","Understood. Thank you very much for tanking taking the questions.","Rich Kramer","Thank you.","Laura Thompson","You're welcome.","Rich Kramer","Thanks David.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll move to Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Rich Kramer","Good morning, Adam.","Paresh Jain","Good morning everyone. This is actually Paresh Jain in for Adam. A couple of questions, first one, I wanted to reconcile growth in the greater than 17-inch segment. We recently had one of your peers come out with their own forecast of growth in that segment where [indiscernible] seems to be in the 7% range in the high single-digit range through 2020, almost half of yours and LMC focus, so is there something I\u2019m missing in that comparison or it\u2019s just a difference in expectations?","Rich Kramer","Yes, I really can't speak to that. We can speak to our view, it\u2019s very hard to speak to theirs. So maybe that\u2019s something we could help you with off-line, but it\u2019s hard to talk about that at this point.","Laura Thompson","Yes. And then when you look at the numbers, I mean when you kind of look back at the couple of charts we had in the deck pages 5 and 6 and you look at the growth in the 17-inch it substantiates it right.","Paresh Jain","Right, you also aligned with LMC there, so I just wanted\u2026","Laura Thompson","These are the actuals. As we reported out on the third quarter actual, you can see the growth in every quarter it goes.","Rich Kramer","It\u2019s just hard to comment on someone else's announcement.","Laura Thompson","Exactly.","Rich Kramer","So, we'd rather not do that.","Paresh Jain","Got it. And then a follow-up on Asia, I wanted to get your thoughts on margins there again, we are an unchartered margin territory here, since it\u2019s still a market dominated by OE sales, curious to know what kind of feedback or if any pushback you get from OE is on the pricing front, just given where the margin levels are?","Rich Kramer","Well, I would say, our focus whether it\u2019s OE or replacement, really is predicated on the value that we're bringing, our value proposition to all our OEMs, including the Asian OEMs and that\u2019s around technology, it\u2019s around innovation, it's around helping them solve their problems, and it\u2019s around being able to do the complexities that we talked about in our investor meeting that not everyone else in the industry can do. ","So, our focus is really to help them solve their problems and deliver it to them, the tires they need to achieve the out outcomes that they need, and I think the value we bring has a proportional relationship back to the value that we received. So our goal is to help them solve their problems, to help them make better vehicles, and if we do that, I\u2019m confident that our value proposition will be recognized.","Paresh Jain","Thank you.","Rich Kramer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question in queue comes from Emmanuel Rosner with CLSA. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Emmanuel Rosner","Hi good morning.","Rich Kramer","Good morning, Emmanuel.","Emmanuel Rosner","Good morning. Just, high level question, conceptually you and your investors about a month ago, very, very bullish tone and obviously you remain bullish on the long-term, but it seems like maybe the near-term headwinds are quite a bit towards then what you just saw a month ago. So, what has changed so dramatically within the last month, are some of the things you are describing really seems to have, you know accelerate to the downside over the last 30 or 40 days?","Rich Kramer","No. Emmanuel, I think it\u2019s a certainly a fair question, I would say that really our outlook hasn't really changed. What we had to do is what we have to do to reach those 2020 targets, making sell 20 million more 17-inch and above tires. That is at the core of what we have to go do and if you say what\u2019s on my mind? Every day and what we\u2019re driving the team to it\u2019s actually that. And that means mixing up and making more the right tires in North America where you know we\u2019ve been a little bit short supply. We have to make the right tires at the right cost, no change from what we\u2019ve been saying and no change from what we have to do. In EMEA, again trying to be very candid with you, we saw the replacement market decrease about 8% in September alone. ","We are out there trying to capture the value of our brand, the value of our value proposition in the marketplace. We stuck to our guns, we did not pursue volume for volume sake, as we are looking to mix up, and we've taken the action. As Laura said, we couldn't necessarily talk about it at the September meeting, to be able to address our switch from mixing up to the higher end of the market. That kind of came through a bit more in September even then we thought, frankly we didn't anticipate a market decrease in summer like that. The markets in Europe are a little difficult, you know we also said, we planned on another green winter, but we actually saw winter volumes down again in September, off of a week last year. So, Europe, a little bit, little bit even tougher then we saw, but that\u2019s the tire business. So that\u2019s okay. We're sticking to our guns and driving our strategy. ","So, I would say really nothing has changed. In fact, if we peel back and we don't get to that detail, if we look at our 17-inch and above business, if you want to just still on to that, in North America very strong, in Europe very strong, in Asia very strong. So I would say those themes are moving ahead. And if again, I say what happened between now and September 15, the commercial business I went through, I sort of walked you through, what happened there. I\u2019m not happy with it frankly, but it is what it is, and part of that was a volume recognition and then volume recognition on our unabsorbed overhead accounting I should say. Europe was our migration forward and frankly that is the strategy and we\u2019re going to be aggressive in doing that and we did have a little bit of an OTR headwind, but I\u2019m not going to say that's a difference maker, that\u2019s more on the periphery of what we have to say. So, higher raw material cost going into 2017. ","We will have some of the SLP start-up cost coming into 2017, we won't get that until latter half of 2017 when we will get the units out of that. As others have mentioned, I guess I just said the higher raw material costs going in, you know those are some headwinds we are going to see, we're going to see some of the production cut hang over go into the first quarter as well, but we also know we've got tailwind on the 17-inch and above market. Asia continues to be very strong and these are - our cost savings will continue to move in. So, we are on our path, as I said it won't be in the straight-line. Our 2020 plan is what we're focused on, no real change from that, but look the tire business will have headwinds along the way and we\u2019ll deal with them.","Emmanuel Rosner","Understood. And then just to make sure I fully understand some of the puts and takes on the, I guess impact on the 2020 plan, when you are saying the no change to 2020 from the declining below 17-inch market in EMEA, is that, I mean and that it was already contemplating is that basically - what are you exactly saying, that it was a headwind in the quarter and potentially in the fourth quarter, but that\u2019s sort of like the shrinking exposure to that and that was all already part of the plan?","Laura Thompson","Exactly. And I think Emmanuel the only difference, getting out the declining 17-inch market size for us was on part of the 2020 plan and in fact that was part of our presentation in there. What we did, was as we saw that declining much faster as we moved into September looking at our forecast as well. We just accelerated the timing of it, right. And now we went ahead and made the advancement and are moving forward. It\u2019s really in the plan, just probably where we were on September 2015, we moved it up in the plan.","Emmanuel Rosner","Okay. And then a final one just on the, still on the outlook, obviously your implied fourth quarter SOI, so probably a little bit below what previous plan would serve like required for 2016 are there any different sectors in the fourth quarter than what you have been describing for this past quarter?","Laura Thompson ","I think I mean just make sure we've got a chart in the deck, right. It talks about the impacts to 2016 that\u2019s page 4, and then we also list all of our other key drivers to each segment operating income drivers and balance sheet drivers as part of that.","Emmanuel Rosner","Okay then on the sequential basis?","Laura Thompson","Yes and Emmanuel just as we talked about it, don't forget that the overhead impact from truck and the industry weakness that is in the fourth quarter as well and is a little bigger impact to the income statement in the fourth quarter then even the third.","Emmanuel Rosner","All right, understood. Thank you.","Laura Thompson","Okay, you're welcome.","Rich Kramer","Thanks, Emmanuel. ","Operator","Thank you.","Rich Kramer","I think that was our last question. I just want to close by saying, we've, personally I've been doing this for now for about over 10 years in my various positions here, and I will just tell everyone again and from personal experience, look the tire business has its disruptions and it always will, whether it\u2019s industry cyclicality, it\u2019s tariffs, it\u2019s OEM production adjustments, it's volume oriented competitors, whatever it might be those are certainties that are going to happen along the way. ","The key in our key is to have a sound strategy to have the constancy of purpose and to not be dissuaded by all these externalities to move away from that strategy. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing at Goodyear. At times it can be harder than others, but that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. Listen, it was a tough quarter. I\u2019m not the happiest with it and I will say that with the appropriate humility, but our core business is sound. The market is very strong for us and our strategy is working. We got a lot to do to the 2020 plan, and I\u2019ll just let you know that\u2019s what we're focused on and that\u2019s what we are committed to deliver. So, thanks everyone for your time today.","Laura Thompson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at any time and have a great day."],"9919":["The Goodyear Tire & Rubber (NASDAQ:GT) Q2 2014 Earnings Call July 30, 2014  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Thomas Kaczynski - Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President","Analysts","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Operator","Good morning, my name is Tony, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to hand the program over to Tom Kaczynski, Goodyear's Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations.","Thomas Kaczynski","Thank you, Tony, and thank you, all, for joining us for Goodyear's second quarter 2014 earnings call. Joining me today are Rich Kramer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Laura Thompson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, a few items we need to cover. To begin, the supporting slide presentation for today's call can be found on our website at investor.goodyear.com, and a replay of the call will be available later today. Replay instructions were included in our earnings release issued earlier this morning.","I'd like to remind participants on today's call that our presentation includes some forward-looking statements about Goodyear's future performance, and actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments today. The most significant factors that could affect future results are outlined in Goodyear's filings with the SEC and in our earnings release. The company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","Our financial results are presented on a GAAP basis and, in some cases, a non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures discussed on the call are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent as part of the appendix to the slide presentation.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rich.","Richard J. Kramer","Great. Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'm very happy to report that we delivered record results in the second quarter. These results were driven by strong consumer replacement volumes in all of our regions, as the Goodyear brand and Goodyear's value proposition continues to be a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Our performance reinforces the confidence that we have in our strategy. In a quarter where we saw continued economic volatility, particularly in the emerging markets, we posted segment operating income of $460 million, a second-quarter record. We now generated $833 million in segment operating income for the first half of the year, a 14% increase over the same period in 2013.","Achieving these results, even amidst global economic challenges, is perhaps the best reflection of the strength of our strategy and the changes we've made to Goodyear's business. This further renews our confidence in hitting our target of 10% to 15% annual segment operating income growth through 2016. The quarter included volume increases in consumer replacement across all of our 4 global regions. Global volume is clearly a topic you've been focused on, and with good reason. However, I'll reiterate one of the core tenets of our strategy, and that is that we're not pursuing volume for volume's sake. We're pursuing profitable volume growth in our targeted market segments.","But the consumer replacement performance only begins to tell the story, so I'd like to acknowledge several highlights from the past 3 months. First, let's look at our growing markets. In China, June was a record month for our consumer tire sales, and for the quarter, we continued to grow faster than the industry. Overall, our performance in China is especially rewarding, as it followed a challenging first quarter, and in response to the more challenging China economy. Consistent with our strategic approach, we grew with the right mix of products and channels where the Goodyear brand has its greatest value. In addition, we earned new OE fitments that are consistent with our targeted market strategy.","Competition in Asia Pacific is still intense and challenges remain in Australia in the OTR business, which affected our total results for the region when compared to the prior year. Nonetheless, in this environment, I'm very pleased with the team's execution in the region. Latin America faced headwinds in the quarter, as OE production remained weak. The economic turmoil continued in Venezuela, and the Brazilian economic outlook deteriorated. Even so, our team in the region delivered outstanding performance with double-digit percentage increases in consumer replacement over last year. This was particularly true in Brazil, where our ongoing rollout of new high-value Goodyear-branded products across the region is yielding strong results.","I visited the region during the quarter and saw firsthand both the progress of our current efforts and the potential ahead. Goodyear dealers are excited about our new products, such as the EfficientGrip performance tires and Wrangler ArmorTrac for SUVs, available in more sizes and types than they ever have been before. Our commitment to investment in the region excites our dealers as well, and this includes the upgrades to our Americana plant that are providing them with more of the products that are in demand. And they are excited about our new and expanded sales and marketing tools focused on demand creation, as we've redoubled our efforts to help our dealers grow their business profitably. In total, our associates and dealers in Brazil are energized by Goodyear's leadership in an increasingly competitive environment.","Now I'd like to spotlight the strong results in our mature markets. Our Europe, Middle East and Africa business delivered segment operating income of $117 million, more than doubling its results from 1 year ago. Its operating margin for the first half of the year was 7%, demonstrating progress in returning the region to its historic margin level. Our balanced approach of growth and cost control was especially critical in EMEA. Laura will provide details on this later on. And in addition, we're doing a much better job in the region of supporting our customers, thanks to a strong value proposition and product lineup. For example, in addition to our industry-leading label product portfolio, our winter tires won influential magazine tests, resulting in strong initial orders for these products. Now you may recall that I referenced a concern in prior quarterly calls with the competitiveness of our value proposition in Europe. I'm pleased to say that we've made progress in this area with our key European customers, and our results reflect that progress. Now while the European economy has certainty stabilized from its low points, structural challenges remain as well as volatility, particularly in emerging markets, including Russia. Now in that environment, the EMEA business continues to execute its business strategy very well.","And finally, our North America business did more than simply maintain its momentum. It took its performance to a new level. North America delivered $208 million in segment operating income, its best quarter in history. Not just its best second quarter, its best quarter ever. And to give you some perspective, $208 million is more than the North America tire business earned for any full year from 2001 to 2010. In addition, the business surpassed 10% segment operating margin, its highest quarterly margin in more than 15 years. Now some of you may remember when our next-stage metric for North America was 5% segment operating margin. Now our performance consistently exceeds that mark.","And driven by the Goodyear brand, our second quarter consumer replacement volumes in North America were up nearly 6%, significantly outperforming the industry. For the first half, our consumer replacement volumes were up 3%. Again, we're very pleased with this performance. Our volumes were achieved by remaining consistent and true with our strategy of winning in those targeted market segments where we can add value for consumers, for our customers and for Goodyear. We won't be distracted by fluctuations in the low end of the market, which can distort industry trends.","Now that occurred a few years ago, before and after the implementation of the 421 tariffs, causing extreme swings in both overall industry volumes and period-to-period comparisons. During these swings, Goodyear remained steady and true to our strategy and will continue to do so should those distortions repeat.","Now looking at our overall results, I want to quickly address price\/mix versus raw material costs in the quarter, which Laura will discuss in detail a bit later. The decline that you saw was driven largely by the headwinds in our OTR business, which we highlighted last quarter. I remain pleased with our price\/mix versus raw materials strategy in our consumer and commercial businesses, as evidenced by strong volume, strong revenue per tire and gross margin in the quarter. We believe our ability to overcome various headwinds and deliver record results in the quarter is the outcome of our commitment to continuous improvement, with a sharp focus on decreasing cost and improving customer service. We're targeting the most profitable market segments, pricing for the value of our products and making continual progress on operational excellence. In sum, we are performing as we expected with a commitment to building sustainable value over the long term.","Now shifting gears, I want to quickly touch on a few of the elements of our capital allocation plan. As you'll recall, we shared this plan last September and outlined plans for the use of the more than $3.6 billion of cash to be generated in 2014 through 2016 to enhance long-term shareholder value. Laura provided an update to the plan at the end of May. To date, we reinstituted quarterly dividends, which are now at $0.06 per share; we activated our stock buyback programs, investing $54 million in the repurchase of 2 million shares in the first half of 2014; we funded our hourly U.S. pension obligations with cash generated from operations; and we identified areas of growth CapEx, planning investments to increase future value.","At the end of May, we announced that one of those focal points of the growth investment is the construction of a new state-of-the-art manufacturing plant for the Americas. This plant will supply our North America and Latin America replacement customers and OEM customers with high-value tires that they demand. In fact, we are already seeing demand outpace capacity for some of our high-end HVA products and can foresee reaching our HVA supply limits soon. Our strategic focus will remain on these products and we're looking forward to our new production facility coming online in 2017. And just as we are not pursuing volume for volume's sake, we're not adding capacity for capacity's sake. This new plant will support profitable growth in our North America and Latin America regions. There are many companies that can increase capacity, but only a select few that have the combination of a strong value proposition to respond to the market, together with the manufacturing capability required to win in the marketplace. And at its core, what's required to win in the tire industry is not much different than in other industries. The companies with long-term success are the ones with the strongest value proposition, the ones who anticipate the needs of the marketplace and respond with high-quality products or services that satisfy those needs, and the ones with brands that the customers and consumers know and trust.","Goodyear's value proposition has many elements, including a trusted iconic brand that's known around the world; industry-leading products; diverse distribution channels capable of responding to customer requirements; strong customer relations, particularly at the OEMs; and an unwavering focus on the consumer. Now taken individually, none of these elements are strong enough to create differentiating value in the marketplace. Our value proposition is rooted in our ability to integrate all these elements better than anyone else. Goodyear's competitive advantage comes from the alignment of these individual parts, multiplying their value. That alignment of strength, fueled by operational excellence on the supply and manufacturing side, is what we believe it will take to win in the evolving global tire industry. More importantly, we believe Goodyear is the company that will deliver.","Now the confidence we have in our competitive advantages is reflected in recent updates that we've made to our strategy roadmap. The changes are small and do not constitute a new strategy for sure, but express where our business is now and help more clearly define, both internally and externally, how we will grow in the future.","Now if you turn to Slide 7, I will quickly take you through the updated roadmap. In the previous version, we noted in the top box where we are, that pensions remained a challenge. That has been changed, as nearly all of our U.S. pension plans are now fully funded. Moving to the key strategies on the left, we've adjusted each of the regional comments. On the original roadmap, we defined North America strategies as returning to profitability. Now that we've completed the turnaround in that business, our sights are set on profitable growth. While leading in China remains as a priority in Asia Pacific, we acknowledge the larger expectation of growing in the entire region. The performance of our Asia Pacific business relies on more than just China, and this update sends a more comprehensive message. In EMEA and Latin America, we're now focused on returning to historical profit levels, reflecting an appropriate strategic update for both of those businesses. It's a better description of our current priorities. And moving to the key how-to's, we updated only one element, targeting profitable market segments is now folded into a larger focus on sales and marketing excellence. With this addition, we've clearly aligned the key how-to's with more consistency, as sales and marketing excellence joins market-back innovation excellence and operational excellence. Specific initiatives within sales and marketing excellence will start to take shape over the remainder of the year, as we continue to position Goodyear globally for profitable growth.","And finally, to be clear and transparent relative to our expectations of growth, we added a new first point to our destination. Top line and bottom line growth are now at the top of the list in our plan to create sustainable value.","So in summary, we're very pleased with our performance in segment operating income growth over the first half of the year. We're confident that volume will continue to grow over the long term and we remain committed to our strategy of pursuing profitable volume and share in segments where the Goodyear brand is a differentiator. That confidence is supported by the value we can generate through our integrated business model, working from the market back, responding quickly and effectively to the needs of consumers. The evidence of that value creation can be seen in our products, our operations and most importantly, in our results.","Now with that, I'll turn the call over to Laura.","Laura K. Thompson","Thank you, Rich, and good morning, everyone. My remarks this morning will start with a review of the second quarter and our first half results. I'll then finish with an update on certain items included in our outlook for 2014's earnings and cash flow. We'll then open the call for your questions.","Let's turn to Slide 9 and review a few key items on the income statement. We are very pleased with our solid second quarter performance. Segment operating income for the quarter increased to a record $460 million. For the first half of the year, SOI has increased 14% over last year. This is firmly aligned with our expectation of 10% to 15% SOI growth for the year. Similar to the first quarter, strong performance in North America and Europe was able to more than offset weakness in emerging markets. Sales volume in the quarter increased 3%, driven by strong replacement volume growth of 6%, partially offset by a 4% decline in OE volume. For the quarter, net sales were down $238 million. Our sales reflect the benefit of $106 million of higher volume, but that benefit was more than offset by lower non-tire revenue of $148 million. The lower non-tire revenue is driven primarily by lower third-party chemical sales in North America. We expect the impact to significantly lessen going forward.","In addition, price\/mix reduced sales by $146 million, primarily due to 2 factors: first, the effect of lower raw material costs on pricing, including normal raw material indexed agreements; and second, a significant decline in our Off-The-Road tire volumes, which resulted in lower mix.","Lastly, foreign currency exchange was unfavorable by $52 million. We generated gross margin of 24.1%, an improvement of 270 basis points versus the prior year. SAG increased slightly, reflecting higher investments in marketing and advertising of $9 million versus the second quarter last year.","In the quarter, we achieved a record $460 million in segment operating income and a 9.9% in SOI margin. This is a direct reflection of the sustainability of the strategies that we are driving across all of our businesses. Our second quarter operating tax rate as a percentage of foreign segment operating income was 21%. Our earnings per share on a diluted basis for the quarter was $0.76. Our results were impacted by a few significant items, which are listed in the appendix of today's presentation, on Slide 19. After allowing for those items, our adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.80.","The step chart on Slide 10 walks second quarter 2013 segment operating income to second quarter 2014 segment operating income. Higher sales volumes and higher first quarter production levels benefited our results by $40 million year-over-year. Strong cost savings for the quarter of $103 million more than offset the negative $69 million impact of inflation. Lower raw material costs only partially offset reduced price\/mix for a net unfavorable impact of $44 million year-over-year. This unfavorable impact was primarily due to lower Off-The-Road tire sales. We are very comfortable with our price\/mix, as evidenced by our overall revenue per tire remaining the same in the second quarter as the first quarter and gross profit margins that are at their highest in recent history.","Separately, we saw a reduction in price\/mix versus raws in the quarter relative to our previous outlook that we provided in April. We indicated price\/mix versus raws would be a slight positive or similar to Q1. There are 2 factors that caused a different result. First, we sold significantly more consumer tires and less commercial tires in the quarter, giving us a less rich mix than expected. And second, the raw material cost benefit was less than we forecasted, as raw material costs were down 4% versus the prior year rather than the 6% we had anticipated.","Continuing along the items on the walk chart, foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $13 million year-over-year, primarily due to Venezuela. Other includes savings from the Amiens, France closure and lower pension expense, partially offset by investments in advertising and R&D. Cost savings net of general inflation and after investments in marketing, advertising and R&D, were a net benefit of $24 million for the quarter.","Slide 11 walks first half 2013 SOI to first half 2014 SOI. Given the unusual weather-related impact to volume in our first quarter and the rebound in the second quarter, the first half reflects a more normalized view of our performance. In the first half, higher sales volumes of about 2% and higher production levels resulted in a benefit of $90 million. Cost savings of $214 million exceeded the $144 million impact of inflation for a net benefit of $70 million for the first half of the year.","Raw material costs were lower in the first half by $156 million, almost offsetting the reduced price\/mix of $183 million. The unfavorable $27 million net impact is more than fully explained by lower Off-The-Road tire sales, which negatively impacted our mix in the first half of the year.","Lastly, foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $29 million year-over-year. Overall, we are pleased with our first half performance of growing SOI by more than $100 million or 14%. We are equally pleased with how it was delivered, a balanced execution of growth and cost initiatives.","Now let's turn to the balance sheet information on Slide 12. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the second quarter were $1.6 billion, down a little over $200 million from March. Total debt is down more than $350 million from March and, consequently, net debt fell to $5.1 billion at the end of June compared to $5.3 billion at the end of March. I also want to mention that we used approximately $31 million of cash to repurchase approximately 1.2 million shares of Goodyear common stock during the second quarter. This brings our first half purchases under the share repurchase program to $54 million or 2 million shares.","Free cash flow from operations is shown on Slide 13. During the second quarter of 2014, we generated $314 million of cash. Over the last 12 months, our free cash flow from operations was $724 million. As we continue to generate cash, we remain focused on a balanced capital allocation plan that builds for our future with high-return growth investments, advances the path toward an investment-grade credit rating and provides for a significant shareholder return program.","Moving now to the business units on Slide 14. I will start with North America. North America reported record segment operating income of $208 million and achieved operating margins of greater than 10%. This is a significant achievement and reflects the sustainability of our strategy to grow profitably in targeted market segments. Unit volumes were up 3%, driven by increased sales in our replacement business, which was up 6%. Our growth was driven by strong demand for Goodyear-branded tires in our most profitable targeted market segments. While we are pleased with the volume performance in North America for the quarter, we would point you to the year-to-date performance of about 1% growth as representative of our trends going forward. As I mentioned, given the unusual weather-related impact to volume in our first quarter and the rebound in the second quarter, the first half reflects a more normalized view of this year's volume. Similar to prior quarters, price\/mix was unfavorably impacted by reductions from raw material indexed agreements, although mix remained positive in total, despite significantly lower sales in our Off-The-Road business. Manufacturing costs were lower by $9 million, due to improved factory utilization and lower pension expense, which was partially offset by increased profit sharing in our factories of $9 million. Our strategy of targeting profitable market segments, mixing up in products through market-back innovation, pricing for the value of our tires and controlling our costs have enabled us to continue generating sustainable economic value in North America.","Europe, Middle East and Africa delivered segment operating income of $117 million in the second quarter. A significant improvement over last year's $51 million. SOI margin increased to 7.4% from 3.2% in the prior-year period. The second quarter was the fifth consecutive quarter with year-over-year earnings growth. Volumes increased by 3% in the second quarter versus last year. Industry conditions remain favorable, with year-over-year market growth in consumer tires. Our volumes in Europe were up by 500,000 units versus prior year, mainly driven by those improving industry conditions and a propitious start to preseason winter sales, driven by our new Ultra Grip 9 tire line. Our volumes in commercial truck were impacted by weaker demand. This occurred primarily in emerging markets, driven by less transport demand and decreased fleet activity. We continue to leverage our success with new products, as well as our strong service proposition in this business. Factory utilization improved based on increased throughput and the closure of our facility in Amiens, France. While our progress in Europe is substantial today, we have more work to do in this business as we take advantage of improving industry conditions and work to reduce costs further.","Turning to Latin America, operating income was $59 million for the quarter, $23 million less than the prior year. All of the year-on-year decline in earnings can be attributed to 2 factors: first, challenges in Venezuela; and second, the impact of lower OE volumes in Brazil, where as you know, vehicle manufacturers continue to reduce production significantly. Positive price\/mix offset the negative effects of inflation and the costs related to our expansion of the Americana plant in Brazil. We continue to see a strong response to our new products across the region and, as a result, our replacement volumes grew 13% this quarter, almost completely offsetting the weakness in OE. Excluding Venezuela, our replacement volume increased 17% this quarter in Latin America.","During the second quarter, we successfully returned our Venezuela production to normal levels after completing our labor negotiations. However, we continue to face other challenges with our business, such as the lack of availability of U.S. dollars to timely pay our suppliers for raw materials which are required to keep the factory running. Venezuela remains a challenging business environment and we continue to monitor the situation closely and adjust to the changing circumstances as needed. We continue to expect Venezuela to negatively impact our Latin American SOI by $40 million to $60 million for 2014, with about $27 million having already occurred during the first half of the year. This assumes no further devaluation or meaningful disruption to production, which could have a further negative impact to operating results.","Our Asia Pacific business reported segment operating income of $76 million for the quarter, a $15 million decrease year-over-year. More than all of the decline in operating income is driven by a significant decline in our Off-The-Road tire sales and unfavorable foreign exchange of $4 million. Unit volumes of 5.8 million in Asia Pacific were about 5% higher than 1 year ago, given strong growth in China, which was up 13%; and India, which was up 12%. These increases more than offset the impact of weaker demand in Australia. We are winning with customers in China with double-digit volume growth in the second quarter, driven by strong sales in our targeted market segments. We remain confident in our strategy and committed to winning in China.","Now looking at the full year, the key segment operating income drivers are listed on Slide 15. In line with our 2014 to 2016 targets, we continue to see sales volume growth of 2% to 3% for 2014. For the full year, we are assuming the net of price\/mix versus raw material cost changes will be slightly negative. While we expect the second half price\/mix versus raws to be essentially neutral, we do expect the third quarter impact to be similar to the second quarter. Based on current spot prices and our forecasted mix of products, we expect raw material costs to be down 5% for the full year, a slight adjustment from prior guidance. We continue to expect approximately $50 million to $75 million in benefits from lower unabsorbed overhead for the full year, although we are now trending towards the high end of the range. As a result of increased cost savings, particularly from Europe, we are raising our full year cost savings versus inflation outlook from neutral to about $50 million benefit after offsetting increased investments in marketing, advertising and R&D. The strong cost performance in Europe is consistent with the $75 million to $100 million of productivity benefits we described in 2012 as part of our profit improvement plan for Europe. Based on current spot rates, we expect a negative foreign currency exchange impact of approximately $60 million for the year. This includes the headwinds due to the change in exchange rates for Venezuela, although it does not assume any further devaluation of the bolivar.","We are increasing the savings expected from the closure of our Amiens, France facility to a range of $40 million to $50 million in 2014. The annualized benefit of this closure and the related exit from the Farm Tire business in Europe will be approximately $75 million. Pension expense savings has increased slightly to $90 million, reflecting favorable plan experience versus our estimate.","Additional financial assumptions for 2014 are listed on Slide 16. For the year, we now expect interest expense in the range of $415 million to $435 million, a slight improvement versus the prior outlook. Financing fees are forecasted to remain at approximately $60 million. Our full year income tax rate is expected to be approximately 25% of international SOI. As discussed previously, each quarter, we assess our current profitability in North America and whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize existing deferred tax assets. The result of the analysis continues to lead us to believe that we may be in a position to release all or a portion of the U.S. valuation allowance during the second half of 2014. If the valuation allowance is released in 2014, the expected increase in annual tax expense for 2015 and beyond would be approximately $150 million per year or a 35% tax rate. However, we do not anticipate any U.S. cash taxes for at least 5 years. The outlook for depreciation was increased slightly to approximately $725 million for the year. We lowered the outlook for global pension expense to $150 million to $175 million in 2014. We expect global pension cash contribution to be about $1.3 billion, including over $1.1 billion that was put into the hourly U.S. pension plans during the first quarter of this year. And for the year, we continue to expect our working capital to be neither a significant source nor a significant use of cash. And our capital expenditures outlook is unchanged from our last call.","In summary, our businesses have delivered strong results in the first half of the year and are on track to deliver 10% to 15% SOI growth in 2014. Our market-back focused innovation has enabled us to launch 22 new products during the first half of 2014, and we are seeing strong demand for these products as demonstrated in our consumer replacement results. Additionally, our cost savings initiatives continue to fall to the bottom line. Our first half results give us confidence in our strategy and that our strategy will deliver our 2014 to 2016 targets.","Now we'll open the call up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Look, just on -- my first question is on the pricing. Is it possible to segment out the impact of OTR? More specifically, what I'm trying to get at is just a little bit more color as to how the pricing environment is for passenger and light truck and how you would assess the overall competitive environment. Has there been any pressure in that segment as well, maybe stoking fears that capacity coming back is causing a little bit of that good discipline to erode? Or would you really isolate the pricing pressure, really, on the OTR side?","Richard J. Kramer","Yes -- no, Patrick, good question. And I would tell you, if I look at it -- so maybe I'll address it both ways, year-over-year and then sequentially. But year-over-year, it's essentially -- it's primarily all due to OTR, as we highlighted in the remarks and, frankly, as you just said. With that said, I can tell you that I'm really -- I'm satisfied with our price\/mix versus raw material equation for the core consumer and commercial businesses. We see that in revenue per [ph] tire, in addition to the strong volumes that we've had and the strong gross margin that you saw in the quarter as well. And maybe a simple way to think about this to sort of give you how we see it and how we think about it, we've given guidance in the past or we've given a formula in the past that sort of 85% of our top line relates to our core tire business, if you will, our tire business, and excludes chemical and some of the other things. If you were to do that, take 85% of that number and calculate a revenue per tire -- 85% of our sales number, what you'd see is, sequentially, from Q2 to -- excuse me, Q1 to Q2, you'd see our revenue per tire basically flat at about $97. Actually, the math would say Q2 actually went up slightly from Q1. And if you take that all the way back to Q2 in 2013, you'll see that number was higher, it was about $107. But when you look at that year-over-year change of the $107, let's say, down to the $97, the bulk of that is driven by FX, not by price decrease. Some of it is price decrease, but I can tell you that price decrease is less than the raw material decrease that we've gotten, as we said, 4% in the quarter. So I would say it's less than that. So I would say, as we look at this, we are not -- I'm not uncomfortable at all with where our price\/mix versus raw material equation is. From a trend standpoint, I'd say, it's right in where we thought it would be. And again, along with the strong volumes and the strong gross margin we have, I think it's another proof point. And finally, I'd go back to what we said back in September and then I think what we reiterated at the end of the year, where we said price\/mix versus raw material would essentially be flat to offset each other for 2014. Last quarter, we said it'll be slightly positive, now we're saying it's slightly negative. We're really sort of working around the edges here, and the driver of that really is OTR. And again, if I might add, the change in the forecast really is a mix change. We sold fewer truck tires, which are heavier, so we got less of that raw material benefit coming through. And we sold more consumer tires than we sold truck tires so -- than we forecasted, so we saw a little bit less of that price come through. Because obviously, a truck tire is at a higher price point than a consumer tire. So that change is really, I would just say, a temporal mix change. Nothing really more than that. So hopefully, that gives you some color.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It does. I mean, just to build on that, so it sounds like the reason there's no real sequential change in per unit price is that -- should I interpret it that OTR is really kind of stable at very low levels and it's a year-on-year headwind, but it's not getting sequentially worse?","Richard J. Kramer","Yes. That's a fair way to look at it.","Laura K. Thompson","Yes.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then just lastly. I mean -- and I know this is kind of what's sort of implied in what you just said, but is it then correct to interpret this as there really isn't any fundamental change in sort of the level of aggressiveness on the passenger and light truck side, in your view?","Richard J. Kramer","No, I think what you see flowing through is the lower raw materials that we've seen come through year-over-year. And Patrick, that said, I mean -- I think I'll be the first to tell you, it was competitive last year, it's competitive this year. So it's no easy walk out there for sure, but nothing beyond that, that I'd tell you.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess, my other question was just on Latin America. You guys actually had pretty good margin protection despite the environment there, actually. I was kind of happy to see that. But is there any -- I guess, for instance, in Europe, you've done a lot to sort of address what has been kind of a slower volume environment over the years, right, and we're seeing the fruits of that. Is there any -- I think you used the word maybe structural issues, I think, when you were talking about the regions, so I was just wondering, is there any kind of work to be done to take additional cost out of Latin America that could be sort of a kind of a tailwind ahead of us?","Richard J. Kramer","Patrick, I would say, what's going on in Latin America and really driven in Brazil, but it's true in the other countries as well, is -- I used the term sort of redoubling. I mean, we have really revamped our product line there, we've brought more sizes and types to the forefront, we're putting a lot more aggressive ad campaigns and marketing campaigns forward to help our dealers grow their business. They see that happening, they see the investments that we're making in our factory down there in Americana, they've heard about the Americas factory that we talked about to supply Latin America and North America. And frankly, we've got a lot of momentum down there. So I would say, we've taken costs out of there in the past, we'll continue to be very judicious on it. But at the end of the day, we're really working on our value proposition to help our dealers grow. And Laura said 13% total consumer replacement, the consumer business was actually higher than that, our Brazil business was actually higher -- even higher than that. We had strong volumes in Mexico, we had strong volumes in some of the other countries. So I would say, this is a -- really, an effort we're making to grow our business profitably with our dealers down there, and that's more of the focus than structural cost which, of course, we know we still need to work on in places like Europe.","Operator","Next, we'll move to Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just, I wanted to -- just to follow up on, first, on the price\/mix versus raw materials. So it was minus $27 million in the first half, and I think you said neutral for the second half and similar in Q3. So negative $44 million-ish in Q3, which would imply positive $44 million or so in Q4. If that's right, what is sort of in your kind of high-level view that drives the positives as you get towards the end of the year? And can you maybe elaborate on how you see Q3 and Q4 raw materials playing into that?","Laura K. Thompson","Yes, sure. So first of all, following what you said, everything was exactly right. What you implied, it is $27 million net as we look at it through the first half of the year and that is all driven by OTR. And really, what happens as we move into the fourth quarter, is the negative effect year-over-year of OTR really stops happening. That's what starts to put us back on a path we're more used to in price\/mix versus raws.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Does the ITC investigation, in your view, matter at all in terms of the North America or the Asia pricing environment?","Richard J. Kramer","Rod, maybe I'll jump in. The first thing I guess I'd have to say about that is that as we look at potential of the ITC, we continue to be in favor of free and fair trade around the globe. That was our position last time, it's our position this time. So as you know, that's not the part of the market that we actually play in. So it's not exactly in our sweet spot in terms of what happens. But we know that if those tires don't come here, they may go to other places around the globe, tires move around. So we don't know exactly what the implications of that are going to be yet as we move forward. I will tell you, the decision from the ITC is out into the future, we don't know where it is. But we already actually saw some, let's call it, irregular order patterns of maybe people anticipating something happening, early stages of that. So I don't know exactly what we think is -- what is going to happen if this thing moves forward. I can tell you, we're going to stick to our strategy of driving tires in our targeted market segments. And that's worked for us, as shown by our results, as shown by what we did over the past few years when the 421 Act was in place. So we'll sit back and see what is going to happen at this point.","Laura K. Thompson","Yes. And no doubt, Rich, the last time we had the tariff, we did see it impact, right, in the lowest tiers of the market. But I'll remind you, that was in the environment of significantly lower raw material costs. They were dropping like a rock, right? So we'll see, right? We saw an effect last time in the lowest tier, we'll see what happens this time.","Richard J. Kramer","And Rod, the thing I'd add to Laura's comment is that, the thing that we're paying attention to are just the distortions that will happen to the industry. Because we see people buying ahead and then, as tariffs came off, we saw people stop buying. And then once the tariffs came off, they started buying again. And this all happens at the low end. So you get these -- as you know, you get these big distortions in the marketplace that really aren't indicative of normal sell-in to the market, let alone normal sellout to the market. So I think that's as much on our minds as anything else.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And just 2 other quick things, hopefully. Can you just give any color on your outlook for the Asia Pacific region in the second half. And on corporate overhead, it's been running like $50 million to $66 million per quarter as I go back for several quarters, and this quarter was about $35 million. Can you just maybe give us any color on what drove that and whether we should extrapolate from that going forward?","Richard J. Kramer","So from an Asia perspective, Rod, I would tell you, as I mentioned in my remarks, China was quite difficult, as we saw in the first quarter. We saw that improve in the second quarter and we see a little bit of momentum going into the third and fourth quarter at the back half of the year. As I mentioned, we performed very well in that market, particularly in the second quarter. So I'm pleased with that. And we certainly see a path to continue that going into the second half of this year. But obviously, we always say China is not going to growing in a straight line, so we've got to be ready for everything. From a region perspective, India continues to perform well. And we don't talk about it much, but our business there is performing very well. In the ASEAN countries, we see pretty good performance in places like Thailand, where we have some political uncertainty, but the market is okay there. Malaysia, very similar. The headwinds will continue to come from Australia and, as you know, we have a very big business there. And that's really the hangover of the slower mining industry that sort of makes its way back into the general consumer in Australia, and that impacts us given our retail footprint there. The positive thing is the OTR business will tend to get better as we start lapping the downturn of that business, and you'll start seeing that I think in Q4, we'll get a little bit of a benefit from that. So we remain bullish on Asia but, again, not in a straight line and not without headwinds. But long term, we continue to believe that it's a very good market. And in terms of corporate overhead, I don't think there's anything else that I would say. A lot of that in that corporate overhead is some of the incentive comp that moves the stock price and the like. What I can tell you is that our focus is going to continue to be on driving cost out of the business. And we know that that's something that we need to do both in better times and not-as-good times and we're going to continue to put programs in place to do that.","Laura K. Thompson","Okay, sure. And then no doubt, Rich, the other -- I think that corporate other did benefit in the second quarter versus the second quarter of last year. We had a little bit lower incentive comp. Last year, we had the big change in the stock price which, it certainly does continue, but not as great a degree as we had last year. So that is one of the drivers as well.","Operator","Next, we'll move to Itay Michaeli with Citigroup.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a couple of questions, just one more on the price\/mix over raws. Just given the improvement you expect in the fourth quarter as the year-over-year comps become less difficult, could the OTR piece become a bit of a tailwind in 2015?","Richard J. Kramer","Itay, I think it's too early to comment on that. I mean, what we see happening now, you've heard this before, but the actual -- the mining industry, iron ore and the like, in Australia is actually up year-over-year. The industry is up around about 5% and the like. The issue that we see is not -- the mining service companies and the mining companies and the like continue to go through their inventory and are continuing to use that as they move forward. So I think I'm not going to make any classifications on where it goes. I think we're prepared for the industry to get a little bit better, but how and when that happens, I think we're going to remain cautious and manage the business accordingly.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And then just a couple of housekeeping. The pension savings guidance was raised by $10 million. Is there any pull-forward in '14 from some of the savings that you outlined previously for 2015? And then -- that's one. And then secondly, on that, I know that, that gets bucketed into the other in the SOI walk, and that looks like both pension and I think depreciation year-over-year should be tailwinds for you in the second half of the year. So should we expect that other bucket to be a net positive in H2 versus last year?","Laura K. Thompson","So first of all, no -- to answer your first question, no. All right? We don't see anything as we go -- picking up as we go into 2015. Certainly, as we look at the other bucket, we expect depreciation to be up as we go into 2015.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I'm sorry, I was talking more about the second half. I think the full year depreciation guidance actually implies a bit of a reduction year-on-year in the second half of '14 versus '13, and the pension savings, perhaps, accelerating as well. So if I take those 2, should I expect the other bucket in the second half of '14 to be year-over-year higher versus last year?","Laura K. Thompson","Well, first of all, D&A, we did increase the guidance from $700 million to $725 million as a full year estimate, right? It's just our -- improving our forecast as we go throughout the year, right? And then as we look at other for the second half of the year, we do expect that to be really about what we saw in the -- I don't know, about the first half of the year. Fairly neutral.","Richard J. Kramer","Itay, I think the way I'd think about it, there will be some movements in there but nothing significant that would drive it. I think that's the right way to think about it.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. That's helpful. Just lastly, the North America OE volume, down 4%. Production, obviously, was up in the quarter. Just maybe help us reconcile what was going on there in the quarter?","Richard J. Kramer","Itay, I would say there's really nothing more in there other than continuing to drive our selectivity strategy. We saw some decisions that we wanted to take relative to fitments that we were on. That's what we've done, that's what we've been doing. I think you also got to look at it in the context of the consumer replacement increase that we had. Our consumer replacement business was up by about 6%. So these are really a matter of choices more than anything else. I wouldn't read -- I would tell you not to read into it beyond that. We've got some great fitments with the OEMs, we continue to build on that business, we've got a lot of those OEM fitments that are going to start to come back into the replacement market in the next couple of years. So I think it's nothing more than selectivity and, really, no other strategic change other than that.","Operator","Thank you, and at this time, we are out of time for questions. I'll turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.","Richard J. Kramer","Well, good. I just want to thank everyone for joining. We had a great quarter, and we're going to continue on with the same strategy as we head into the second half of the year. So thanks for the attention.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at any time, and have a great day."],"10225":["Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I will now hand the program over to Christina Zamarro, Goodyear's Vice President of FP&A and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Christina Zamarro","Thank you, Keith, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for Goodyear's third quarter 2018 earnings call. I'm joined here today by Rich Kramer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Darren Wells, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","The supporting slide presentation for today's call can be found on our website at investor.goodyear.com, and a replay of this call will be available later today. Replay instructions were included in our earnings release issued earlier this morning.","If I could now draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2, I would like to remind participants on today's call that our presentation includes some forward-looking statements about Goodyear's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments today.","The most significant factors that could affect future results are outlined in Goodyear's filings with the SEC and in our earnings release. The company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","Our financial results are presented on a GAAP basis, and in some cases, on non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures discussed on the call are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent as part of the appendix to the slide presentation.","And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rich.","Rich Kramer","Thank you Christina, and good morning, everyone. Before beginning my remarks, I'd like to welcome back Darren Wells who recently rejoined the company as our Chief Financial Officer. For those of you who are unfamiliar with Darren, during his prior time with Goodyear, he was instrumental in the development of our turnaround strategy during the mid- 2000s and was the architect of several of our major capital structure decisions.","He also served as a leader of our email operations and helped to bring stability to the business. Throughout his tenure, Darren has experienced several business cycles and can add valuable perspectives as we work our way through the current environment. With his deep knowledge of Goodyear, the tire industry and its familiarity with many of our analysts and investors, it goes without saying that we're very excited to have Darren back on the team. Welcome Darren.","In the third quarter, segment operating income totaled $362 million and segment operating margin was more than 9%. Our global tire shipments increased by 2% on a year-over-year basis, driven by the significant gains in the Americas and EMEA. Globally despite significant headwinds in China, we grew both our consumer and commercial volumes led by our consumer replacement and commercial OE businesses. During the quarter, we continued to improve the operating performance in our key mature markets, driven by the benefits of strong mixed trends, and solid volume growth.","Our teams delivered outstanding growth in the premium segments of the US and European consumer replacement channels. These gains contributed to improving momentum in our two largest regions as EMEA delivered operating income growth of more than 20%, and the Americas turned in its best year-over-year performance since 2016. We're pleased to see that our total operating performance was relatively stable in a period of increasing volatility. The issues that began to emerge in the second quarter have persisted into the fourth quarter, including a stronger US dollar and deteriorating market conditions in China.","In addition, newly enacted emission standards in Europe, growing economic volatility in Latin America, and a changing global trade environment have added incremental challenges for the overall industry. While these factors have a near-term impact on our results, the headwinds do not traject from our value proposition in the market or the continued execution of our long-term strategy. Our teams are delivering on improvements in volume and mix in our mature markets, while continuing to build on our capabilities to expand our opportunities for growth.","With the strength of our products, our people, our brand and our focus on business model innovation, the current environment does not change my perspective on the longer-term trajectory of our business in the new mobility ecosystem.","Turning to Slide 4. I'll cover the performance of the Americas as well as the industry conditions in the region. US consumer replacement industry selling demand was up 5% in the quarter representing an acceleration versus the first half of the year. In comparison, our US consumer replacement volume was up 11% and higher than the second quarter when our shipments increased 8% after adjusting for the significant impact related to the transition from ATD to Tire-Hub. Our transition to Tire-Hub is progressing smoothly and Tire-Hub's daily sales and delivery rates continue to increase steadily.","We're pleased with the team's execution and dedication to this strategic initiative. Industry growth in the 17 -inch in larger segments came in at 9% in the quarter. And once again, we grew share in this important segment outperforming the market by over 2.5x. Goodyear's sellout volume or consumers buying at retail was up 5% in the US. We have now seen three straight quarters of mid-single digit growth and sellout demand which is a testament to the quality and value of our products. The strong retail demand has improved inventory turns in the channel leaving wholesale inventory of Goodyear branded products with our distributors in excellent shape.","Just this month, Goodyear's assurance weather-ready reached yet another important milestone more than one million tire sold. This latest achievement comes just a few weeks after the tire was ranked number one among consumers in the Grand Touring all season category. In addition, last week a leading consumer magazine ranked the Goodyear's assurance CS Fuel Max the highest among SUV all season tires. This is great news and again a testament to the quality of our products.","The strength of our product portfolio in combination with the lean channel inventory should enable us to capitalize on our plans to drive a richer mix and improve value proposition going forward. Our U.S. commercial operations continue to leverage the strong freight environment including record setting ISA truck orders; our commercial only volume was up more than 30% in the quarter. Commercial replacement volume was down slightly partially reflecting the strong OE performance and some transitory ramp up inefficiencies in our U.S. plants.","Overall, we continue to have a constructive outlook for our U.S. commercial truck business as the drivers of the industry demand remain robust, including ton miles utilization rates and spot rates. While industry conditions improved in North America, growing economic and political volatility in Latin America contributed to a more challenging backdrop in the region. These dynamics have notable impact on our performance in Brazil, which accounts for a significant portion of our operations in Latin America.","Our total shipments in Brazil fell 2% in the third quarter reversing the trends seen through the first six months of the year, when volume increased in the mid-single-digit range. We saw deterioration in both our consumer and commercial businesses reflecting lost economic momentum in the wake of the national transportation strike weakness in the Riyal and uncertainty surrounding the presidential elections.","While the replacement market is softening our consumer OE business in Brazil grew 10% during the quarter as we've continued to grow our share with new platforms particularly in the 17-inch and greater segment. Additionally, as we have completed the modernization of our American and Brazil plan, we have expanded our OE business with more manufacturers to capture growth in the coming years as the Brazilian and Latin America economies improve.","Turning now to Slide 6, our EMEA business delivered solid performance during the quarter aided by improving industry conditions. The European consumer replacement industry grew 2% with ETR and main members outperforming. In comparison, our consumer replacement volume was double the growth rate of the overall industry. Our share gains in the 17-inch and greater category continued in the third quarter as we delivered 12% growth, 200 basis points ahead of the industry.","EMEA's commercial truck operations delivered robust results across the board. OE volume rose 14% versus last year, replacement shipments increased 5% reflecting the strength of our fleet services model and favorable industry conditions. We feel good about our relative position versus the industry during the final months of the year given our strong performance and this year's third party winter and all season tire test.","Our successes include the Good Year Vector IV seasons, which earned podium finishes in all six tests this year including three first place finishes. In addition our winter tires continue to be highly recognized by leading European tire magazines and the market place as we grew share during the third quarter in this important segment. Now clearly the unpredictable winter weather will affect buying patterns. Regardless, we are confident our award winning winter products will position us to win in the market place.","Lastly, I'd like to acknowledge a significant win by our OE team in the region. Audi selected the Eagle F1 Asymmetric 3 SUV for the e-tron; it's first fully electric SUV. These tires use Goodyear's sound comfort technology which effectively reduces the interior vehicle noise by 50%. Being fitted onto the Audi e-tron is a testament to the work of our technology and engineering teams, the work that they're doing to improve handling while reducing rolling resistance and noise levels. The great job by that team.","Now turning to Slide 7, I'll cover Asia Pacific performance and provide an update on operating conditions in China. Asia Pacific shipments fell 4% as declines in China more than offset growth across the other countries in the region. We're not seeing any substantial signs that suggest industry conditions in China are likely to improve in the near term. OE customers continue to ratchet it down their production forecast and response the softening end market demand and elevated inventory levels. In September, passenger and commercial vehicle sales declined 12% and 8% respectively.","While the magnitudes of these declines are significant, ROE business in China is tracking in line with the view we expressed on our second quarter call. At that time we consciously made the decision to plan for a very difficult OE environment in the second half of the year based on our analysis of market conditions. This turned out to be the correct decision and allowed us to take some offsetting actions ahead of the sharp deceleration. The replacement market is also being negatively impacted by events currently shaping the business environment in China.","We're seeing ongoing destocking activity and deteriorating retail demand. We expected a significantly weaker replacement Market in China, when we revised our forecast earlier in the year. However, market conditions are now below our expectations primarily due to the weaker-than-expected sellout trends. We continue to believe that the weakening fundamentals in OE and replacement channels reflect tighter credit conditions, a weak stock market and worsening consumer and business sentiment all cyclical factors.","While China's economy has not responded as quickly to stimulus as it has in the past. We are encouraged by the government's recent actions to reduce individual income tax rates and to create liquidity through monetary easing for the fourth time this year. It may take some time for market conditions in China to improve, but our continued investment positions us and our business to come out of the cycle even stronger.","Looking back at the quarter. I'm satisfied with our volume performance in our major markets. In the US and Europe, we are regaining share and driving strong mix gains both of which contributed to our overall performance in the quarter. As we enter the final months of 2018, our expectations are that these trends will continue albeit with some moderation as we face more difficult comparisons, especially in the U.S.","Even with these successes a variety of industry and macroeconomic headwinds has changed the landscape in 2018 and will continue to have an impact in 2019. We think that it's prudent to take a more conservative view of our near-term potential given that we are in a period of increasing volatility. While the current environment will keep us from reaching our full potential in the short run, we have a strong track record of successfully navigating through similar conditions in the past. As we look ahead, we'll continue to leverage our strengths where the markets are healthy and take a disciplined approach to manage near-term challenges and set ourselves up for future recovery.","While the macro environment has become more volatile in recent quarters, we will not abandon our unwavering commitment to pursuing growth in the industry's most attractive market segments and ensuring that we capture the full value of our brand and products in the marketplace. More importantly, you will see us continue to challenge the industry's traditional business models in order to build on our competitive advantages. Tire-Hub is a perfect example of disrupting the status quo to strengthen the value of our brand and enhance our value proposition to the consumer. Additionally, just this month we launched Roll by Goodyear, a new retail concept in two major markets that is designed to enable us to win with consumers.","I'm confident that our strategic plan and the investments were making are improving our long-term competitive position in the market.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Darren.","Darren Wells","Thank you, Rich and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying that I'm very excited to be back on the Goodyear team. While we're going through a period of some adverse macroeconomic conditions, the underlying business fundamentals impressed me as being stronger than they were five years ago when I did my last earnings call as CFO. Even though I'm only 30 days into my return to the role, I wanted to take a couple of minutes to offer you some initial impressions.","My first impression is that the current cycle of raw material cost increases has a lot in common with prior cycles. There are some differences as well but overall I don't see anything that should change our ability to recover margins over time. I'll talk more about this in a few minutes.","My second impression is that the tire industry hasn't gotten any easier Even in times with pretty good economies; we find challenges that make our near-term financial results difficult to predict. For Goodyear, this means we have to continue to focus on disciplined execution of our operational excellence initiatives, as well as on our connected business model, making sure that we are as well positioned as possible when the current volatility settles.","My third Impression is there are businesses positioned with the right capabilities to navigate these challenges. I'm impressed by the progress over the past few years on multiple fronts. The company is continue to address its cost structure, continued its strategy of reinventing U.S. distribution and it's made investments in technology that sets us up for changing automotive ecosystem. Hopefully, you can tell how enthusiastic I am about our prospects in the coming years that are one of the reasons I've rejoined the team. However, I also realized that you're very focused on understanding our near term results and having better visibility in to how the next few quarters may play out.","Today, I'm going to focus on the fourth quarter. I should be able to come back at the beginning of next year with the full perspective on 2019. After we get to that point, we'll start to look at 2020 and beyond. In the meantime, I look forward to continuing the dialogue ahead with many of you over the last few weeks and getting to understand your views and questions as we work through our plan for next year.","Turning back to Q3. I want to start by reflecting on where we are in the raw material cycle, and how I see the similarities and differences versus prior cycles. The chart on Slide 9 illustrates the net impact of price and raw material cost over the last seven quarters and compares that impact to our experience during the last similar cycle, which I remember well in 2010-2011. Each of the line starts in the quarter where we first saw the step up in raw material costs. In this cycle it was the first quarter of 2017. In the prior quarter it was Q2, 2010.","You can think of the area below and above the horizontal line as margin compression and expansion relative to the base line at the start of the cycle. You can see that during the prior cycle, margins were compressed early on and then started to improve ultimately taking nearly three years and five price increases to fully recover.","You also see the recovery wasn't in the straight line but we got there. I remembered a lot of questions during 2011 focusing on whether the industry has changed and whether we could really get back the raw material costs. These questions were especially intense when the recovery rate dropped back down in the fourth quarter of 2011. We remain confident then and we remain confident now that we can recover the loss margin over time, but it takes time. This later cycle seems to be last longer which doesn't feel very good, but probably reflects the couple of dynamics that are different this time around.","First this cycle's raw material cost increased is less severe only about $900 million for Goodyear over eight quarters, versus the last cycle when we saw $900 million in only three quarters. So much quicker last time and a bigger impetus for industry pricing to move.","Second in the last cycle, raw materials kept rising after the initial three quarters, ultimately increasing for 11 quarters in a row. This was another driver of industry pricing. In this cycle raw materials flattened out after the initial three quarters before starting to increase again. This make pricing decisions more difficult as it was less clear which direction raws would take. As the line for the current cycle shows, we are recovering and we'll continue to focus on getting full value for our products in a competitive marketplace. The recovery may not be a straight line but the destination doesn't change.","Transitioning to a review of our performance during the quarter, I'll begin with the income statement on Slide 10. Our third quarter sale was $3.9 billion, up slightly from a year ago as the benefits of higher volume and favorable price mix were substantially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation. Segment operating income was $362 million for the quarter, and our segment operating income margin was 9.2%, both relatively consistent with prior year. Our results were influenced by certain significant items, most notably the gain we've recorded on the Tire-Hub transaction. Adjusting for these items, we generated earnings of $0.68 per share on a diluted basis.","The step chart on Slide 11 compares third quarter 2018 segment operating income to third quarter last year. Higher volume and improved factory utilization resulted in a $35 million increase in operating income. Raw material costs were essentially flat but worse than we expected reflecting the impact of foreign exchange on emerging markets as well as adverse cost for some inputs we source in China and I'll talk more about this as I review the outlook for the fourth quarter.","Price mix was lowered by $10 million. This reflects the flow through impact of pricing actions taken during the third quarter of last year. This year-over-year decline was mostly offset by favorable mix. Cost savings was $69 million more than offset the $44 million negative impact of inflation delivering a net benefit of $25 million. The negative effect of foreign currency exchange and other totaled $18 million and $35 million respectively.","Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 12, cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $896 million. Working capital was in line with our typical seasonality, but decreased $250 million year-over-year, reflecting an increase in accounts payable given higher year-over-year production volume and increase raw material costs. Net debt was effectively unchanged versus a year ago.","Slide 13 summarizes our cash flow and the period. Cash flow from operating activities was $60 million for the quarter similar to the year ago, and $1.3 billion on a trailing 12 month basis. While net income was up for the quarter, it was largely a reflection of non-cash gain on Tire-Hub, Those reversed out in calculating cash flow from operating activities.","Outside free cash flow, we repurchased $100 million worth of our common stock in the third quarter or about 4.2 million shares. For the first nine months of 2018, we've repurchased $200 million worth or just over 8 million shares.","Turning now the segment results on Slide 14. Americas segment operating income was stable versus 2017. Revenue increase 3% with higher volume and higher non-tire revenue more than offsetting on favorable foreign currency translation.","While, in the U.S., consumer replacement volumes were up 11%, Brazil consumer replacement volumes declined 6%, offsetting part of the strength in the U.S. Segment operating income reflected at $23 million benefit from this increased volume, including the impact of higher factory utilization. The benefit of higher volume was more than offset by lower price mix, higher raw material costs and higher manufacturing costs.","One final point in the Americas, third quarter results were impacted by two specific items, first $21 million for a favorable settlement we received in a trade tax dispute in Brazil. And second, a $6 million negative impact for bad debt reserve in Brazil. So a net $15 million positive from these two items.","Turning to Slide 15. EMEA delivered solid volume growth but saw relatively flat revenue given unfavorable impact of foreign currency.","Winter tire sales and consumer replacement started out strong during the third quarter, reflecting low channel inventory after robust sellout the end of last winter. Toward the end of the quarter, weather remained relatively warm and selling slowdown. As many distributors were waiting for increased demand in the retail channel before taking further deliveries. As always weather will be a key contributor to our fourth quarter volume in EMEA.","Our commercial business as Rich said continued to deliver strong performance both in replacement and OE in EMEA. Segment operating income increased 23% during the quarter, driven primarily by lower raw material costs and positive price mix, which were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation. The translation was a function of a weaker euro and the devaluation of the Turkish Lira during the quarter.","Turning to Slide 16, Asia Pacific's third quarter segment operating income was $57 million. A year-over-year decline reflects a challenging industry environment in China, where our OE and replacement volumes each declined in excess of 20%. We also recorded $4 million of incremental bad debt expense in the quarter, primarily related to one of our smaller China OE customers. Outside of China, the region saw double-digit consumer placement growth in Japan and India. OE volume outside China was essentially flat. We see only in India though as a watch out going forward.","While recent weakness was a result of the national transportation strike and flooding. More recently tightening liquidity, rising fuel costs and recent insurance regulation are creating further challenges for OE sales in India. Despite a tough current environment, we continue to build a foundation for future growth in China. Our growing pipeline of OE fitments including the electric vehicle segment will help us to drive OE volume and replacement demand over the coming years.","Slide 17 updates our outlook for full year segment operating income drivers. We now see unit volume at the low end of our prior range. Principally to reflect continued softening of consumer replacement demand in China and weaker demand environment in Brazil. We also expect less benefit from factory utilization on overhead absorption. As a result of this volume weakness in our key emerging markets. We have increased the benefit we expect from price next of $45 million, reflecting the impact of recently announced pricing actions partially offset by lower mix driven by the weakness in China.","While we've taken steps on pricing, we've also seen increases in our raw material cost for Q4. This takes the full year impact of raws to $270 million. The increase in raw material cost reflects the impact of currency in our emerging market locations, as well as some higher input cost particularly for carbon black and other oil based derivatives that we source from China.","We're seeing cost increases in these materials at least partly due to strict reinforcement of environmental regulations in China. The response to this enforcement several of our Chinese suppliers have closed plants, curtailed production and raised prices to cover the cost of unplanned investments required to meet the new environmental standards. So these increases are purely commodity related but they're still having an increasing impact on material spend.","The last point I want to make on this page is regarding our cost outlook. This forecast is $10 million below our previous guidance and is in area that we control. Well some of this deterioration is situational and related to changes we're making in our factories to prepare for the future; we have some performance challenges that we have to overcome. This is another area that we'll come back and talk to you about when we talk about 2019.","While we will continue to look for opportunities to improve price mix and drive addition volume our best deal on segment operating income incorporating all these factors as that will exceed $1.3 billion. We look to improve from there, but we feel like this is an appropriate expectation given the recent changes we've seen. The focus now is on the steps that we can take to improve our momentum as we entered 2019 even as raw materials look to be higher and emerging market businesses look like a challenge will continue into the first half.","Now we'll open the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","We'll take our first question from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead your line is open.","Rod Lache","Good morning. Just first of all two housekeeping items. Can you just confirm the accounting for Tire-Hub shipments at this point, are they still on a consignment basis? In other words there's no benefit from channel filling there and are you bucketing some of the big changes that we've seen in Turkish Lira, Peso and some of those other pretty significant moves in the raw material bucket?","Darren Wells","Yes. So, Rod, I think, I'll answer your second question first and say, yes, the devaluation does have transactional impact that we do put in raw materials to the extent our factories in Turkey are buying raw materials that are denominated in dollars or in non- Lira currency. So you're thinking about that one the right way. And I think it confirm there's no benefit from moving tires into the channel with Tire-Hub.","Rich Kramer","And Rod that's by definition that's not the purpose of it and certainly that's not happening in the quarter and we're pretty much through the consignment element of it as well.","Rod Lache","Okay and I'm just hoping you can help us with a few kind of perspective items, one is, is pricing mix really accelerating to about a $100 million in the fourth quarter? And I'm wondering how we should be thinking about some of these things that we look out to 2019 just on a preliminary basis? If price and mix adjustments you're making right now hold what would that mean for 2019? How should we think about raw materials? And then any other color that you can provide for us on some of the other things that you've mentioned in the past like San Luis Potosi ramp and the non-recurrence of the Tire-Hub and cost reduction. Some of those things are as they stand today looking out to 2019?","Darren Wells","Yes, Rod, let me, I guess the first thing I'll say is that I won't, I offer you what I can on 2019. I think our plan for 2019 is something that I'm certainly still working with the team to try to better understand. So there's going to be some elements of 2019 that I won't be prepared to comment on today. But I think your point on the price mix performance for the fourth quarter is a fair one. And based on achieving $45 million of price mix for the full year, but that does imply that the fourth quarter is going to be a big turnaround so we're going to go from having negative impact of price mix over the last three quarters to having a very significant positive effect of price mix in Q4. And I think that is something that is a positive for us as we set ourselves up for 2019.","The other positives I guess as we look out to 2019 that we've got some clarity on at this point is, yes, and I think you've pointed some of these out that the continued ramp up of our factory in Mexico and the additional units that will be getting out of that factory which are both high margin units and have a better cost structure. Then - we would high cost factories. The reversal of some of the impact of Tire-Hub. So some of the hit we've taken for reduced volume in Tire-Hub this year, obviously, that will unwind next year, and will provide some positives.","And we'll have, I think we'll continue to have net cost savings. I think it's worth having a longer discussion about and I'm not fully ready for that discussion yet. But we've got, our net cost savings I think we look at in the fourth quarter is being a bit lower than it has been the rest of this year. And ultimately, it's being done for some good reasons, but that doesn't mean that's not a concern for me.","On the negative side, I think raw materials as we look out to next year given where raw material prices and currency sit today would be $350 million or $400 million increase. And obviously that does include the foreign exchange effect that you referenced. And that includes our view of foreign exchanges today. I should say what foreign exchange is today rather than our view, where our raw material cost are today and a view of the changes that we're having to make related to the supply issues in China that I mentioned in my prepared remarks.","So with that fairly an increasing hurdles. I think we were looking at $150 million to $175 million when Rich and Christina were out in Laguna. Now we're looking at $350 million to $400 million going into next year. Foreign exchange is also going to be a negative. And at today's spot rates would be another $40 million or so. The China environment, obviously as we look last this year's first half in China was pretty good. If the current conditions continue, then the first half of next year would be up against pretty tough comps in China and would continue to be a headwind. So I think a number of things there that are going to be challenges for next year.","Obviously, against that we're going to be working on the price mix question as well as what we can do to grow volumes. But even on the volume front, because of some selectivity on our part getting out as some of the less profitable OE fitments that we were on. We're facing OE volumes that even if the industry stay stable we'd be down 2 million or 3 million units in OE. Focusing on our mature market businesses that. So we've got some volume there that we're going to have to look freeze up some tires for replacement which is good. But it is still some volumes going to come out for us.","So I think we're looking at a number of those factors. And those are all factors that will take into account as we pull together our overall view for 2019. And we'll pull that together and talk about our view of 2019 when we get the pass the year-end.","Rod Lache","Okay, thanks. And just to clarify if the, on that turnaround in price and mix. Is that something that kind of all things being equal. You would have 3 more quarters that sort of that level through next year or is there something unusual that is occurring in the fourth quarter of this year that was that number?","Darren Wells","Yes. I mean, we're obviously getting pass the anniversary of some of the price decreases and that's helpful. Some of the price balance that took place last year. That's helpful for Q4 and it will be somewhat helpful going forward. Rod, just I'm not at a point where I'm comfortable giving you a clear view of where price mix is going to be going into 2019. But I think we're --obviously we are making progress there. Continuing to deliver very strong mix and taking some continued action on price including the price increase that we announced in the U.S. that really started benefiting us will start benefiting us in Q4.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Healy with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","John Healy","Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask to say a kind of a big-pictured question on the volume side, so three quarters in a row with replacement market growth in the US, clearly you can point to the economy driving that. But can you help us understand what's changed? And maybe a view of how sustainable this will? obviously not 11% but sustained growth, and we might expect sustained growth for the next few quarters on the replacement side, your level of confidence there?","Rich Kramer","Yes, John, I think, I think I'll go back and maybe refer to questions that we got a lot last year that I suspect many remember. And that was when we saw such a robust economy relative to sentiment and consumers and VMT and everything else. And we weren't seeing the demand out, the sellout demand in the marketplace.","And what we said back then it was going to be a question of when not if. And I think that when is now. And I think that's what you're seeing. And as you think about this year, go back to Q1 remember, our volumes were down about I think about 3% or it was $3 million, I can't remember exactly what the number was.","We were down in Q1 but sell out was up 8% at that time. And what we said is that pent-up demand was going to come forward because inventory channels were emptying. And since then just as you said, we've had a very, very, in North America and in Europe we've had very robust second quarter volumes and very robust third quarter volumes.","And on top of that what you're seeing is the channels are in good shape as well. So that speaks to where we are, as I said on my script we've had good, we've had mid-single digit sell out for three quarters now. And that trend is we're about ending October continues into October.","And if you think about that we're getting the volume, we're getting sellout, and channels are in good shape. And as Darren just mentioned, the benefit of our price is going to come in into the fourth quarter. So you've got a lot of those things all working together right now which is exactly the momentum that we want to take in to end the year and then take out into 2019.","So I think it's really the economy, the demand for our product, the demand to support VMT and tread rubber burning finally coming to fruition.","John Healy","Okay, helpful. And then I thought slide 9 was great in terms of illustrating previous cycles and the raw increases, but when I look at that slide you highlight the eleven quarters it took to recover the raw increase. Given the environment on the volume seems healthy. And you guys seem like you expected to continue, can that period of time in terms of recovering the raw prices actually potentially be shorter do you think the net 11 quarter timeframe. And how do you think that might play out?","Darren Wells","Yes, So, Rich, I'll start on this one. And I think the fact that we're - our volume is recovering. And our market share is in a strong position and clearly those are things that make the job easier. We've been through obviously a period of time last year where volume went the other way. And that continues to be something that we have to be watchful of because we're working to recover this but we're working to recover it in a competitive marketplace.","Yes, the thing I find to be the, require the most thought about this particular cycle, is that the raw materials have been through periods of flattening out, which makes it sort of harder to read the direction. And if we got to a point where we believed raw materials we're going to go back down. And I don't think we're there but if we got to that point, then it would raise questions about which direction pricing would likely take.","And I think that's the biggest uncertainty for us as we move forward, but I think that what we've done in the third quarter. And I think what we'll continue to work on is going to demonstrate that we're committed to, taken that area that we're experiencing, you're under the line so to speak over the last seven quarters. And create some space above the line. As we did in the last cycle and that, that is the model, it is a business that has these raw material cycles. And that, that's how we work through and we're going to continue to hammer away at that.","John Healy","Great and this is one final question for me, Tire-Hub, any color you could give us just on how installer response has been to the launch. You are seeing good retention of the dealers that you had in your network prior. And are you seeing any big wins out there in terms of geographies or just markets where you had been, may be underserved in the past?","Rich Kramer","Yes, John, I would say it's frankly exceeded our expectations in terms of its ramp up and in terms of servicing customers. Like any startup if you will, there's hiccups along the way. And I think on a customer by customer basis there's probably been some out there and we work diligently to get through that but no customer losses, no big customer losses and none at all really.","And the process is working very well as we intended. And I think as we think about it from a strategic perspective, it's absolutely in line. And what our strategies and what our intentions are, so to get off on the right foot, I think was key for us and that's exactly happened.","In terms of growth, we never intended to have significant growth in 2018 as we ramped it up. I think if you look out to 2019 and beyond, that's where you're going to see the benefits of expanding the distribution. And it will also support some of the new initiatives that we're working on, whether it's goodyear.com, and working with our partners out there, our partner dealers, and our other aligned distributors, or the new retail concept that we're testing out as well in a few markets in Washington called Roll by Goodyear, and I can elaborate on that if you like. But that's what Tire Hub's for, and I'd say it's on plan and frankly even a little bit ahead of plan.","Operator","And we can take our next question from Anthony Deem with Longbow Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Anthony Deem","Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. This first one's for Darren. I'm wondering if we can get an update on your leverage ratio outlook and investment grade intention. At the beginning of this year it was Goodyear's goal to grow EBITDA, to lower the leverage ratio more so versus paying down debt, and just wondering where we sit today, with you in the CFO role, will buybacks remain priority over deleveraging?","Darren Wells","Yes. So, Anthony, I think you've raised a good question here, because obviously when we look at our shareholder return programs, those programs were always meant to be a reflection of our ability to generate cash. And as we go through this part of the raw material cycle, our results and our cash generation have been impacted.","I would say that we are still committed to having a balanced, investment grade type balance sheet, I mean that is a long-term objective for us. It's something that has, I think, always been part of the DNA here, and has a lot to do with the types of companies that we compete with. So we need to have consistent access to reasonable cost capital through the cycle, and so the investment grade balance sheet is what helps drive that.","So, as we've seen, obviously our debt - I don't know, different leverage ratios available but certainly on a debt-to-EBITDA basis, we were having some nice improvements down into the mid 2s. And our intention was to continue to work toward a ratio of around 2x. And instead in 2017 and 2018, because of the results, I mean the drop in EBITDA, our leverage ratio has moved back up. And I think the commitment is still there, to answer your question.","I think we're going to have to balance our commitment to shareholder return programs with our desire and our strategic need to keep improving our balance sheet. So I mean that commitment is clearly there. So I think the balance is going to have to be struck, and we've had, so far this year we have repurchased about $200 million of Goodyear stock.","So, a fairly substantial amount, I think that's something that we're going to have to moderate, quite honestly, as a result of what our cash flow is. And in order to do the right things for our balance sheet. We've got confidence in our business for the long-term, no question, you would have seen that in the increase that we made in the dividend recently.","So I don't think it's a question of what we think we can do, or the cash we can generate in the long run, but as we go through a cycle like this, and given that it's difficult to predict how long a cycle like this lasts, we're going to have to take some steps to protect the balance sheet. Does that answer your question, Anthony?","Anthony Deem","Yes, that does, it's probably tough to commit to a targeted timeframe, I assume, at this point, right, because previously it's 2020.","Darren Wells","Yes, I think that's fair. I mean, we're going to be taking a hard look at our 2019 plan, and then obviously coming back to take a look at where we think we're going to be 2020 and beyond. So we need some time to work on that, I need some time to work on that, just from a personal level. So we will come back on that question. I understand the question, and obviously we'll keep having dialogue and listening to our investors, and the viewpoint that they have.","Anthony Deem","Thank you. I have a few more questions if I may. And sorry if this is already answered. Can you specify exactly how much of the $80 million raw material guide down for 2018 is related to transaction impact versus increases in the commodity and non -commodity costs? Spot pricing was just sort of flat to slightly lower, raw material cost third quarter versus second quarter. So just want to get that's mostly FX driven.","Darren Wells","Yes. So I think that of the $80 million about $30 million of it is foreign exchange related. There is another substantial factor here and there is some that is a reflection of higher commodity costs. And most of the increases that are not foreign exchange related are in the categories of carbon black and some of the-- and some oil based derivatives that we purchase. Within that carbon black and oil based derivative category, you heard me mention earlier the fact that there has been a fairly significant change in the availability of supply in China.","And over the last several years, a lot of the production of these materials has shifted to the point where most of it is made in China. And so if China then starts to regulate through environmental regulations or other policies, starts to reduce the amount of this material that's produced. A couple of things happen, both of which are affecting us. One, there are some suppliers that just stop and you aren't able to make the required investments to comply with the environmental standards. And therefore if you are a customer there's you are forced to change supply. And generally you're changing supply for a higher cost supplier.","The other effect is that all the suppliers in the market start to raise their prices to recoup the additional investment for those who are able to make it, recruit the additional investment in meeting the environmental standards. So it is something that that pushes up those materials and for our Asia-Pacific business and even for our business in North America, we do a lot of our procurement for these materials in China. So that is playing into it, and it also plays into our outlook for raw material cost going into next year.","Anthony Deem","And I know you're not prepared to give the price mix outlook for next year, but given the circumstances that you just described do you see Goodyear undergoing another round of price increases maybe here in the fourth quarter?","Darren Wells","Yes. So I think, we will probably going to stand on the fact that we're going to recover the --we're focused on recovering the impact of raw material costs on our margins and doing it over time. we have to do it in a way that fits the marketplace that we operate in. So I'm not going to point to particular timing, but I think we're making a big step forward in Q4 and it's something that we'll get a lot of time and attention from us going forward.","Anthony Deem","Great, then it's one last quick one, is 5% a good estimate for the pre buy benefit for US consumer replacement shipment growth? The 11%, we saw about 5% industry growth. So assuming maintain market share was the pre buy benefit 5 to 6 percent-ish.","Darren Wells","So when you talk about the pre buy benefit, I want to make sure I'm answering the right question here or we are answering the right question. Are you talking about the pre, the question of, are there people buying tires ahead of our price increase?","Anthony Deem","Yes. As I understood it, it was September first price increase that was somewhat expected in the marketplace to the third quarter. So I was, I believe that you gave some opportunity for free buy for your customers and wondering if that provided a benefit to your shipment.","Rich Kramer","Yes. Frankly, it's been very positive in the sense that there's really been no significant pre buys, I would say not only for us, but as we look around at our customers, our multi branded customers. We haven't seen a lot of that from an industry perspective at this time. So I would say it's been very moderate, certainly relative going back to some of Darren's comments when we went through this before, and some of these recoveries of raw material price increases in the past were expected you might see some prices, there some free buy. We saw very little of that and again I think that goes back to the earlier question of volumes, sell in volumes are good, sell out volumes our good. Channel inventories are good and the price increases that we've put in as of September 1st have been very favorably received from our perspective, so they're sticking.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ashik Kurian with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Ashik Kurian","Good morning. Can I just start with following up on the previous questions. I mean did you just say, did you imply there was no pre buy effect because I think from or we understand your price increases were probably effective from September 1, most of the other Tier one I think price increases are from Q4, well the main question I want to ask because I think last time around in 2017 your pricing was slightly out of sync with the rest of the industry which had an impact on your volumes. This time around and especially for Q4 are you seeing any big distortions between your volumes and industry or you think both pricing and volume development is pretty much in line with what it is for the members.","Rich Kramer","Ashik, I would say in line. I mean again we didn't see any significant free buy and I guess maybe to answer the question directly, we said industry was up five, our volumes were up eleven in North America, greater than 17-inch industry was up 12, we were up 24. And you've seen those volumes now up for tracking like that for two quarters in a row. So it wasn't the announced price increase that caused the pre buy that drove our third quarter volume to be clear.","And as we said sell out continues to be good and that continues in October. So the volumes we had have not been, the incremental volume hasn't been a pre-buy as we move ahead to be clear.","Ashik Kurian","And should we worry about the Europe because no one's announced price increases there. Is that just a reflection of the high level of inventory there, lackluster market I mean any thoughts and how likely it is your price increase in Europe?","Rich Kramer","So, Ashik, remember, we did do a price increase in the commercial business that we talked about on the second quarter call. And again if you want to think and sort of environmentally at least from a macro perspective, here we have replacement markets in Europe and the corridor up five for commercial this is, and OE up about 14. So volumes are good, our business is good; industry is good. And as we look at this, what we see is a market that's good and taking pricing on as we look at the Europe truck market. Remember, passenger is much different particularly in the winter segments.","Darren knows as well, winter pricing --our pricing on winter tires is set earlier in the year. So as we go into that selling season, it's sort of set as we go. So we didn't expect any incremental price as we went into third quarter. Having said that, remember we said our volumes on selling have been very good. We gained share in the winter markets and we did that on the back of some excellent products out in the marketplace. We'll see sell out start to happen now in October. We would have hoped it happened in September, but the weather still been warm as you know over there.","So we'll see those tires coming out and getting pulled into the market, and then have a restocking of the distribution ideally in the fourth quarter, assuming we see snow coming into the market. Now, remember and I said this last time the opportunity to revisit how to recover our raw material costs will be with the new summer tires or the summer tire season that will start late in the fourth quarter as well. So we will be as Darren said earlier, we'll be looking closely at how we approach that market given the high raw material cost as summer tires get set in the market later in the fourth quarter.","Ashik Kurian","One more on China. What are your views on the Chinese sellout trend? I mean is the weakness we are seeing in sell in largely destocking by the dealers due to credit issues or is there been an underlying sellout weakness as well? And also given your high OE proportion of sales in Asia if you do get a volume weakness, do you think you have enough demand in the replacements side to offset it?","Rich Kramer","So, Ashik, you hit on both points. Clearly, we've seen the deterioration in China and we haven't found the bottom yet as we go. And remember, as you point out, our mix in China is much higher, we're about 60:40 OE to replacement. So if you look at both markets, I say we leaned in to the OE market in Q2 and right now I think the orders, the OEM order books to us have kind of come to where we said they would be in our forecast in Q2. So it's been deteriorating, but we feel pretty good and as you know, auto sales have been down three months in a row. September down 12%, as really pretty severe as we go.","That said I'll just comment on OE, we continue, I'm very pleased with the win rate that we're getting on new OE business in China particularly EVs and particularly around large rim diameter tires with both transplants and domestic producers. So I think OE will rebound as the economy gets better in China, but clearly the headwinds are there. On the replacement side, Ashik, I think you hit it right. What you saw was essentially credit drying up. Remember a lot of distributors paying bank acceptances, those large even mid to small size distributors, when they don't have access to liquidity, and they can't pay. You see them essentially selling tires that they have to get cash to pay down their debt whether it's in the tire business or for other businesses they've owned.","So we're clearly seeing less purchases going in, but there's also because sellout is slow, there's also a lot of inventory in the channel right now. And I think that's what has to work its way through, and that's going to come through with consumers buying cars and buying tires. And I think that's a sort of a derivative of the slow economy in China that we all know about right now. And as we said in the past, the government, the Chinese government clearly puts stimulus into the economy. Our sort of rule of thumb was it took about two quarters to sort of turn up in our business and get volumes flowing again. Despite the government reducing reserve rates, reducing income taxes, putting more liquidity in the market, we still yet to see the benefit of that stimulus sort of hitting the end consumer to start to empty the channels and get buying going again.","So it's taking a little bit longer this time. We get that but again I'll say it doesn't really deter our view that China is a great market and continue --will continue to be down the road. So we'll work our way through this. And yes, less OE demand gives us more to sell in replacement, but we need to see that sell out in replacement happen and we're just not seeing that yet.","Operator","And we'll take our final question today from David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","David Tamberrino","Great, good morning, gentlemen. Darren you kind of dancing around in a couple of times, I figured just ask you directly with you coming on board now should we view the 2020 guidance that was previously set as off the table?","Darren Wells","Yes. So, David, I think right now I'm focused on making sure that - yes, I have been focused on making sure we understand where we are in the fourth quarter. And as soon as we get past today call, I mean the work is all going to be about where we're set up for 2019. I think that the question around 2020 is going to have, it's going to a degree be dependent on the external environment. In the past, if we look at the past cycle, we could say there was some very quick recovery. So there was the over a two year period of time we saw our segments operating income jump dramatically, coming out of the last cycle.","So I think it will be, part of the determination is going to be where we are in this raw material cycle. And so really not going to make any definitive comments about it today other than to say that by year-end we're going to be in a position to talk in a robust way about 2019. And once we get through the discussion and lay out where we are in 2019, we're going to go to work on a view of where we are for 2020.","David Tamberrino","Okay and on that topic because I do really like slide 9 and trying to fit this into prior cycles. What I was surprised by within your commentary that you didn't really address the capacity situation within the industry today versus where we were previously. And the growing or recovering global backdrop from 2010 to 2013. So I'd be curious to hear your comments on how do you think that overlay with a lot of capacity that's been coming online because we had a really great period from 2013 and 2014 and 2015 with tight supply and demand, tight capacity utilization on HBA tires. And declining raw mat that we had a lot of projects greenlit.","I'd love to hear that overlay from you on that capacity and how that might be different this time than the prior cycle?","Darren Wells","Yes, no, and David I think it is the right question. And at some point in the future I think we'd like to do a larger discussion on how we see the supply versus demand balance evolving in that 17-inch and above or the high value tires. There are clearly some dynamics here that I understand that there have been a lot of new factories constructed. And there are some new competitors in the market. As I look at our businesses in North America and in Europe, the performance that we're delivering right now doesn't seem to indicate a situation of oversupply. And that we're getting to a point where we're going to be delivering volume and price mix improvements simultaneously.","And I think that's that is an indication you have nothing else of a reasonable balance between the two. I realized that during that time in 2013-2017 because there was a real shortage of supply for some of the high-end product. I think for some of that product that's still true. Big question about how much capacity has been impacted by the additional complexity and the slower build cycle times on these higher end tires. And yes it's a question I have and I think it's one that we want to continue to inform you and our investors about. So it may be that I can't give complete clarity there, but I'll say I don't see the evidence that I would expect to see of an oversupply situation.","David Tamberrino","Okay, that's helpful. Look forward to that discussion in the future as you obviously take a look deeper into it. I appreciate you guys fit me in and taking the question.","Rich Kramer","Thanks David. So, everyone thanks. We appreciate you are listening today. Thanks for your attention.","Operator","And this will conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."],"10077":["Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (NASDAQ:GT) Q3 2017 Earnings Conference Call October 27, 2017  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Christina Zamarro - Vice President, Investor Relations","Rich Kramer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Laura Thompson - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan","Itay Michaeli - Citi","Ashik Kurian - Jefferies","Operator","Good morning. My name is Keith, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Goodyear\u2019s Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Thank you.","I would now like to hand the program over to Christina Zamarro, Goodyear\u2019s Vice President, Investor Relations.","Christina Zamarro","Thank you, Keith. And thank you everyone for joining us for Goodyear\u2019s third quarter 2017 earnings call. Joining me today are Rich Kramer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Laura Thompson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, there are a few items we need to cover. To begin, the supporting slide presentation for today\u2019s call can be found on our Web site at investor.goodyear.com, and a replay of this call will be available later today. Replay instructions were included in our earnings release issued earlier this morning.","If I could now draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statement on slide two, I would like to remind participants on today\u2019s call that our presentation includes some forward-looking statements about Goodyear\u2019s future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments today. The most significant factors that could affect future results are outlined in Goodyear\u2019s filings with the SEC and in our earnings release. The Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","Our financial results are presented on a GAAP basis and, in some cases, are non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures discussed on our call are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent as part of the appendix to the slide presentation.","And with that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Rich.","Rich Kramer","Thank you, Christina and good morning everyone. We released our results a little while ago, so I'd like to get right to them and leave plenty of time for your questions. In the third quarter, we continue to experience several of the conditions that affected our second quarter. The factors contributing to the ongoing challenges over the past three months included lower consumer replacement industry volumes, a raw material cost headwind of more than 30% the most of any quarter for the year and production cuts by automakers, reflecting both lower car sales and the need to reduce higher summer inventories.","In addition, in the U.S., hurricanes Harvey and Irma posed an incremental headwind in the quarter. These factors drove an increasingly challenging competitive environment and negatively affected our results beyond what we had anticipated.","During the quarter, our segment operating income was $357 million and segment operating margin was 9%, which reflect these ongoing challenges in the overall industry environment. Our third quarter volume was down 5%, driven by declines in our consumer replacement business. It's important to note that in total, the decline in our consumer replacement volume in the quarter occurred in the smaller less than 17 inch rim sizes. This is the segment of the market where the competitive dynamics are less favorable and even more so in today's volatile environment.","Our 17 inch and larger rim size segment was stable as EMEA outperformed in both the winter and summer tire segments and the U.S. was affected by its relative price positioning in the market. It's clearly the experienced short term obstacles in our markets that we need to work through. That's my responsibility, and I'm committed and confident in the capabilities of our team to overcome these obstacles just as we have in the past.","Our track record is a credible one. Equally important is keeping our perspective and commitment to our strategy. The current market conditions of simultaneous raw material headwinds, slow consumer industry growth and significantly reduced new car production, would make it easy to pursue a volume oriented strategy instead of mixing up to the larger rim diameter tires to drive our profitable growth over the long term.","I know the commitment to that plan is being tested by some near term headwinds. The value of the strategy is in its constancy of purpose. It is in that context I continue to be confident that we've made the right strategic decisions for our business as we look out over the next quarters and years. I'd like to address each of our business units, starting with the Americas on slide four. The Americas third quarter segment operating income was $189 million and segment operating margin was 9%.","Despite improvements in the economy, U.S. consumer replacement industry selling was down 1% in the quarter. You\u2019ll recall that as we ended the second quarter, channel inventory was unusually high given the level of pre-buy ahead of the price increases earlier in the year. Furthermore, U.S. industry sellout, meaning consumers buying at retail, was about flat. Noting some extreme weather during the quarter, we estimate that the hurricanes Harvey and Irma were a combined headwind of about 1% for the industry.","With that as a backdrop, the Americas consumer replacement volume was down 7%, driven by declines in the less than 17 inch rim sizes where we continue to feel the impact of our relative price positioning in the U.S. market. As you know, we implemented price increases across our business units earlier in the year in response to higher raw material costs, which reached a peak increase of 32% during the third quarter. You\u2019ll recall that as we exited the second quarter, our average price increase in the U.S. stood significantly higher than our competitors, as shown in relation to the tire manufacturers\u2019 PPI index.","During the third quarter, net index increased only marginally. In addition, we continue to see an increased level of promotional activity, including rebase and discounts, just as they were in the second quarter. Because of this relative positioning, we have adjusted our price mix expectations in the second half from about 5% to about 4%.","Taking wider look at the volume performance in the U.S., I want to add some perspective supporting my confidence that our business remain solid. This is best demonstrated by the segmentation of sales volume across our different channels in the quarter. Sales volumes in our retail channel was strong. This includes retailers we serve directly, third-party dealers, auto dealers, affiliated dealers and our company-owned stores, including e-commerce. In this channel, we candidly outperformed industry sell-in with our performance in the mid single digit range.","The performance is this customer facing channel reflects the strength of our products, market share and the pull of the Goodyear brand in today\u2019s market. The overall strength in retail demonstrates the value of interacting directly with our customers and consumers together with our line partners.","These results reinforce that our value proposition remains intact, driven by the power to Goodyear brand and our customer service. In contrast, our consumer replacement volume declined in the U.S. was entirely explained by the wholesale channel. As you know, the wholesaler model is based on a buy-low sell high trading component that creates volatility in the industry, driven by speculation about where pricing may be headed. This practice can be heavily influenced by, among other things, raw material volatility, which historically stabilizes as that volatility subsides.","As current conditions can be characterized by higher channel inventories from pre-buy, continued weak sell-out and decreasing raw material prices are relative price position resulted in our volume trailing the market in the wholesale channel. If we had adjusted our price position further, we likely could have sold or pushed more tires into the channel. However, we believe such an action would have only influence the near-term sell-in and would not have affected our long-term sell out market share trends. In the interim and given our current conditions, we believe we have managed our business the right way for the long-term rather than chasing volume for volume sake in that short-term.","Turning to slide five. The fourth quarter marks the launch of our latest new product, the Goodyear Assurance WeatherReady, our new premium traction tire for CUVs and passenger vehicles. Designed from the market back, the WeatherReady excels in all weather conditions without sacrificing other premium features, such as ride durability and noise.","The total size of the market for Assurance WeatherReady is about 80 million tires. Our line-up features 40 sizes and covers more than 80% of the market, much greater coverage than competitive offerings. More importantly, Assurance WeatherReady is heavy focused on the 17 inch and larger sizes. This new tires position to win in this segment, which is growing much faster than the industry.","Looking ahead, we believe the underlying trends supporting the U.S. replacement industry are robust. In July, miles driven increased eight tenth of a percent to a record of 284 billion miles. At the same time, miles driven for the trailing 12 months rose 1.6%. Fuel prices remained low and U.S. unemployment is favorable. We continue to believe that it's not a question of if sell-out trends improve, but when.","And with that in mind, we continue to support our sales with distinctive marketing and advertising. For example, we\u2019re in the process of finalizing a new multiyear partnership with NASCAR. In addition to being the excusive tire provider for NASCAR\u2019s top three series, we will continue to use to sport its teams and drivers in creative marketing programs across traditional and digital media. Our long term partnership with NASCAR is one we are proud of and lines up perfectly with our targeted consumer base. With the strength of our products another Goodyear brand, the current environment does not change my perspective on the long term trajectory of our business.","Another important market for the Americas is Brazil, and I'm pleased to share its third quarter showed a tremendous growth in volume and mix on all fronts. Brazil's consumer OE business grew 25% and consumer replacement grew in the high single digit range. On the commercial side, we continue to see growth in replacement and OE turned in a very significant improvement in unit volume. These results indicate that country is showing concrete signs of climbing out of its two year recession. While our business in Brazil is far from its historical earnings level, our team is well positioned to capitalize on opportunities as the market recovers. We\u2019re very clearly headed in the right direction.","Turning to slide six. I'll cover the industry environment in Europe. EMEA delivered segment operating income of $87 million and segment operating margins of 7%. Our volume declines in EMEA were primarily driven by our consumer OE business. This decline was driven by less than 17 interim sizes, as well as fitment changeovers. Our forward focus in Europe is with selected customers, driving a stronger connection to the replacement profit pool with premium fitments.","The European consumer replacement industry, excluding non-members, was down 1% in the quarter. In this weaker environment, our EMEA business grew share in 17 inch and larger rim sizes, and this performance came without significant adjustments to our expectations for price mix during the quarter.","As you know, we\u2019ve taken the necessary steps, such as the closure of our plant in Phillipsburg] for Germany in July to shift our resources and reduce our exposure to slow growth less profitable market segments. This is one of the restructuring steps required to execute our strategic plan and is at the core what we believe is needed to recalibrate our EMEA business to the more profitable segments of the market. In support of that strategy, during the quarter, we announced plans for a new production facility in Luxembourg called mercury. The plant will provide the capabilities to increase our agility and flexibility to meet the growing demand for small volumes of high margin premium Goodyear tires, and to deliver them to customers on demand faster than ever.","Our industry leading innovative new products continue to be recognized in influential magazine test across Europe. The Goodyear of Vector 4 seasons, our all season tire, was the winner in multiple leading automotive magazine tests. The Goodyear also grew performance and the Dunlop Winter Sport 5 also claimed the top spot in several European magazine tests. We\u2019re very pleased with this independent validation of our winter products.","As we\u2019ve demonstrated continually over the past decade, we will reduce costs, while investing in our business to grow. We are confident that our line-up of high value added large rim diameter tires will enable us to meet the increasing demand in the industry's most profitable high growth segments.","In our Asia Pacific business unit, segment operating income was $81 million and segment operating margin was 14%. In China, we continued to see double digit volume growth in our consumer replacement segment, which more than offset declines in our consumer OE volume. China\u2019s OE sales rose in September for the fourth consecutive month, underscoring growing momentum in the world's largest auto market after a slower start to the year.","China's auto inventories have stabilized as well. These trends leave us feeling very confident about our China OE business heading into the fourth quarter. Our confidence is strengthened by multiple new OE platform wins in the 17 inch and larger rim sizes, and continued expansion opportunities for consumer replacement in tier 3 and tier 4 cities.","Turning to slide eight, and looking ahead. We remain focused on the opportunities we see for profitable growth across our regions. Sell-out trends in our key markets, excluding the impacts of the hurricanes in the U.S., have turned positive and are more reflective of our longer term expectations. We also see U.S. and European channel inventories as more balanced heading into the fourth quarter. As I mentioned earlier, however, with the weaker industry environment in the U.S. during the third quarter, we've adjusted our volume and price mix expectations.","As a result, we now expect our 2017 segment operating income to be about 1.5 billion. Our pricing strategy this year has left us exposed in weaker markets, especially to the smaller rim size segments. The revisions to our outlook leaves room to adjust our volume or price mix is necessary as we move through the quarter. Raw material headwinds are beginning to subside and these competitive dynamics should normalize over the coming quarters. We continue to expect multiple sources of increased earnings in 2018, driven by improved benefits of volume, price mix, net of raw materials and our cost savings initiatives.","Even in the current environment, our strategy hasn't changed. Each of our regions has made choices to focus on segments of profitable volume growth in our markets, and not push volume for volume sakes. Be assured that we are making the right adjustments to deal with the tougher market conditions we've seen in the third quarter as we continue to execute against our long term strategy. Clearly, I'm not pleased with our performance this year or with the circumstances that drove it. But as I said consistently, during periods of earnings growth and during periods of earning contraction, the tire industry does not move in a straight line and we're not managing our business for one quarter or one year, but for the long term.","We're confident that our volume will return to growth and remain committed to our strategy of pursuing profitable volume and share in segments where the Goodyear brand is a differentiator. And we remain well positioned for the changes we know are coming as the new mobility ecosystem emerges.","I'll now turn the call over to Laura.","Laura Thompson","Thank you, Rich. I'll begin with the income statement on slide nine. Our units were down 5% year-over-year reflecting lower consumer volume, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. Our third quarter sales were $3.9 billion, up 2% from a year ago. Third quarter sales reflect 5% higher revenue per tire, excluding currency, which was partially offset by lower volume. Segment operating income was $357 million for the quarter and our SOI margin was 9.1%. Third quarter earnings per share, on a diluted basis, was $0.50. Our results were influenced by certain significant items. Adjusting for these items, our earnings per share was $0.70.","The step chart on slide 10 walks third quarter 2016 segment operating income to third quarter 2017. The negative impact of lower volume was $53 million, an unabsorbed overhead primarily in Americas segment, was $33 million. Increased raw material costs of $300 million more than offset improved price mix of $131 million for a net headwind of $169 million. Our raw material costs were up 32% for the quarter. The third quarter marks the peak of our raw material cost increases for the year.","Cost savings actions of $72 million, driven by our operational excellence initiatives and efficiencies in SAG, more than offset the $36 million negative impact of inflation, delivering a net benefit of $36 million in the quarter. Foreign currency exchange was a modest headwind of $4 million and other was a benefit of $6 million as both incentive compensation and advertizing expense were lower year-over-year.","Turning to the balance sheet on slide 11. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $822 million. Total debt was up $363 million and working capital up $236 million year-over-year. The increase in working capital was driven by higher commodity cost reflected in inventory.","Free cash flow is shown on slide 12. Cash flow from operating activities was $31 million for the quarter and $1.1 billion on a trailing 12 month basis. For the quarter, we used $155 million in free cash flow, which includes capital expenditures of $186 million and an increase in working capital of $294 million.","Turning now to the segment results, I\u2019ll start with the Americas on slide 13. In the quarter, the Americas reported segment operating income of $189 million or 9% to sales. The impact of positive price mix was more than offset by higher raw material cost. Operating income was also unfavorably impacted by lower consumer volume and unabsorbed overhead, resulting from production adjustments.","Unit sales were $17.1 million tires. Our consumer replacement volume was down 7% versus 2016, driven by a weaker selling environment and our relative price positioning in the U.S. As Rich mentioned earlier, our consumer replacement volume declines were driven by decreases in the wholesale channel where inventories were full heading out of the second quarter. We also saw continuing volume impact from reductions in OEM production in our consumer OE business.","Our consumer OE volume was worst than we expected during the quarter due to the OE's aggressive actions to trend inventories. As a result, we've adjusted our U.S. OE industry outlook from down 4% to 5% to down 6% to 7% for the year. Our commercial replacement volume was up 2% and commercial OE unit volume was up 12% in the quarter, both also reflecting a sequential improvement from the prior quarter.","Brazil's consumer OE volume showed strong growth and its consumer replacement volume was up 7%. While we remain at a point where we are still operating the low optimal absorption levels, Brazil\u2019s healthy volume improvements give us confidence as we look ahead. While our overall results in the Americas were challenged in the third quarter, our business remains fundamentally sound. We are well positioned to take advantage of favorable trends in the industry.","Turning to slide 14, Europe, Middle East and Africa reported segment operating income of $87 million in the quarter, which represents a decrease of $65 million versus 2016. The decrease in SOI was driven by higher raw material costs and lower consumer volume. These headwinds were partially offset by improved price mix in the consumer replacement business and our continued focus on cost savings.","Unit sales were $14.9 million in the third quarter, down $0.5 million from prior year. The volume decline primarily relates to the consumer OE business with unit volume down 13%, driven by the decreases in the less than 17 inch size fitment. Replacement unit volume was down 1%, primarily in our consumer business, driven by lower industry demand. EMEA\u2019s 17 inch and larger rim size tires outperformed the market in both the winter and the summer segments.","As Rich mentioned, we completed Phillipsburg plant closure in July to reduce exposure at the lower end of the market in our consumer business with summer industry volumes declined 11% year-over-year. With the exit of this volume now behind us, EMEA will have a positive comparable on replacement volumes and the cost benefit in the coming quarters. EMEA\u2019s commercial replacement business grew volume and share, reflecting the strength of our fleet services model with their proactive solutions.","Commercial OE was also less in the quarter. We have seen miles weather across Europe in October and continue to take a cautious approach on volume expectations for the remainder of the year. That said, the strength of our winter product portfolio has us well positioned to drive future business and to win in our targeted market segments.","Turning to slide 15, Asia-Pacific delivered third quarter segment operating income of $81 million, an $18 million decrease versus last year. This year-over-year decline in earnings was mainly driven by significantly higher raw material cost that more than offset the benefit of higher prices mix. Our OE business was down 1% due to the timing of our fitment. Our replacement business was down 2% due to our relative price positioning and selective parts of our business.","Those factors more than offset the volume growth in China where we had double digit increases in consumer replacement volume. Despite the short-term headwinds from higher raw material cost and fluctuations in our OE business, we are confident about the region's growth opportunities in the fourth quarter.","Next, I\u2019ll cover significant updates to our outlook drivers on slide 16. We expect full year volume to be down about 5% from 2016, reflecting expectations for flat volume in the fourth quarter. We see our full year raw material cost headwinds at about $736 million with the first quarter representing about 22% increase versus last year.","Our net price mix versus raw material assumption is now a headwind of about $300 million, following adjustments to our price mix as a result of the competitive industry environment and the higher raw material cost outlook. We continue to track toward our net cost savings of $140 million for the year. Foreign exchange is now expected to be a slight positive for the year. Based on current spot rates and the other category, should be $5 million headwind versus last year with lower incentive compensation and advertising, partially offsetting higher depreciation, R&D and the start up costs for our San Luis Potosi plant.","Taking these drivers together, our 2017 SOI outlook is now about $1.5 billion. With the peak of our raw material headwinds now behind us, we are increasingly confident in our earnings trajectory and margin improvement as we move forward.","Other financial assumptions are shown on slide 17. We have refined the range for interest expense to $345 million to $355 million and decreased corporate expense by $20 million, driven by incentive compensation adjustments. In addition, we have lowered our full year assumption on our booked tax rate to 28%, which reflects the impact of reduced earnings in the U.S. Our cash tax rate remains unchanged at 15%. Finally, we continue to execute on our capital allocation plans.","Earlier this month, we increased our common stock dividend by 40% to $0.56 per share on an annualized basis. In addition, we repurchased $175 million of our common stock in the third quarter or about 5.6 million shares. We intend to purchase about $400 million in stock in total for the year, which leaves almost $200 million, that's subject to our performance, we expect to complete over the fourth quarter or early 2018.","Now, we'll open the line up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","David Tamberrino","Good morning Rich, good morning Laura, thanks for taking my questions here. Obviously, a tough quarter and a tough environment. Wondering if you can help me square the circle on this. Volume guidance coming down, price mix guidance also coming down. Shouldn't volumes improve if you lower the price? And I ask this before you respond as I think about the Mexico plant launching over the next year or two, you're going to have another 6 million of capacity. How do you get your share back when launching that new capacity if there isn't reduction in price given where the market is right now?","Rich Kramer","Sure. David, I think you summed up right, tough quarter and certainly it\u2019s a tough environment, as well. And I think some of the things you alluded to, reflect that. You know I would say, you looked at some of the volume, you looked at our 2018 guidance and you saw some of the volume come down in the price mix versus the guidance that we had in the last quarter. And I think what you're seeing is a view that's just reflective of the current environment that we're in. And we wanted to take a view that says, hey, this is what we think the environment is going to be as we head into 2018. And that\u2019s really what we\u2019re looking at.","I think your point on how we get our share back and what the environment is like. Look, as we go out to 2018, I want to say that as we explained on the call, 2017 had some what we might view as anomalies or some assumptions that we made that that didn\u2019t work out relative to some of the industry going down, let's say. But as we get out to 2018, I think as we look at the mega trends, as we look at OE recovering, as we look at 17 inch and above growing, all those trends are still there.","And in the underlying -- the underlying volume assumptions that we have in there, yes, we\u2019ve baked in what's happened in 2017. But I would tell you that the trends are still there, the opportunity for us to go back and get the share is there for us. Remember, we broke down, tried to give you a view of where we lost the share in the wholesale channels. And I think those are things that will work their way through, as well as we see a more stabilized environment as we look out into the future.","And again, coming back to your point, I think there probably is some conservatism in the volume outlook that we have. I mean, if I say directly like that.","Laura Thompson","I think we just -- as we look at it, really to come back to you with more details around 2018 and then the very credible fashion at this point, the volume, yes we\u2019re saying that what's going on doesn\u2019t turn around right away. It takes some time. And then on the raw material side, since our call, they continue to bounce around, right. At the end of the second quarter was more of a tailwind for next year. Now, it's much less of a tailwind as we went. The spike is out of the raws, but there are still well above 2016 levels.","So again, with the raws and the outlook, we\u2019re just saying, given the current environment this is where we're trying to have to say, it is right now, is there potentially some upside, yes. But given the current environment, we want to be real credible as we talk about 2018 on both the volume and price mix versus raws.","David Tamberrino","And I think that\u2019s fair from that prospective, just thinking about hey, your competitors have acted a little bit more tactically and gone after volume in a slower growing environment. So the question become, hey when you have more supply, how does that change the dynamic for you and the value proposition, may be as a follow up to my question. As we think about some of the other global tire manufacturers, the definition of what they call HVA or premium tire, that continue to create up a little bit in rim size or diameter. At what point in time do you think if it does happen? Does the 17 inch size become a little bit more commoditized for some of other tier 2, tier 3 players, growing their share there? And did that ultimately continue to creep up into '18 and '19 overtime? And how could you address that or help us think about that, commoditization on\u2026","Rich Kramer","David, it\u2019s a good question. And I would say, just as to say directly not for a long period of time, and maybe a couple of points. As you look at even 16 inch tires today, 15 inch tires today, still a big segment of the market, more competitive clearly than let's say 17 inch and above. But before 17 inch and above moves into that type of environment, it will take quite a long time. So I don\u2019t see that as a segment of the market that\u2019s going to go backward sooner than later. I don\u2019t see that at all.","Secondly, I think and more importantly than just that, one of the things that I want to stress again, it's not just about building a factory or being able to make the tire and push it into the marketplace. The way to drive profitable growth in the market is really seen in together all those things from technology to great products to a brand to be on the right OE fitments, and pulling it through our distribution network is part of our whole connected business model, that\u2019s the way to create value.","So while some of that capacity is coming in and some of it's certainly in 17 inch and above, I don\u2019t know that all of it that hits the market will be as those manufacturers try to learn how to deal with the marketplace that we\u2019re seeing. But it's not just about building a factory, that\u2019s not how you create value. You create value by creating it for the consumer for our customers all the way through the channel. And that\u2019s where I continually said and I'll continue to say that\u2019s where Goodyear adds value, that\u2019s where our brand, our distribution network, our line partners comes into play and that\u2019s how we create value, not just by being able to make a tire of a certain rim size.","Laura Thompson","And if you think about, I think also Rich the plant coming online, right, as we think about it David. It wasn\u2019t that long ago, we were really short tires in the U.S. market, industry wise. And we\u2019re going through a time period, especially the third quarter where the OE is down double digits, lots of tires available but as what these inventory cuts. So I think, it always feels like there is a lot of tires during a certain week times in market. But ultimately all that capacity is really needed to meet that growth in greater than 17 inch.","Operator","We will take the next question from Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Rod Lache","For the year, on a year-over-year basis, obviously, your adjustment to net price versus raw materials looks like it\u2019s a bigger adjustment to net price. And when you look out two the drivers for next year on slide 8, $240 million to $400 million, it was $505 million to $650 million last quarter. So I could see that your pricing expectations are weaker. And my question is, there is volume, it's coming in very low and there is capacity that\u2019s coming online every quarter. You guys pointed this. I think it was 50 million units of additional HVA capacity per year at the Investor Day. So does it feel like the supply-demand balance is a real risk? And I'm just wondering what you can point to that should give us confidence that this stabilizes? Do we need to see a decent recovery in demand for that to become less of a risk?","Rich Kramer","So Rod, one I would say, an increase in demand certainly will help a lot. And coming out of our second quarter, we assumed a higher sellout to a better industry than we saw. So certainly that would help. And our belief is that it's still coming just by looking at economic indicators out there, whether it's GDP, whether it's the consumers\u2019 balance sheet, whether it's miles driven. We still feel confident that that sellout trend is going to happen. So certainly, that would help.","Going back to the supply-demand question though, I think our view continues to be that the supply demand equation, particularly for the large rim diameter tires, is still in balance. And we look at that by saying as we go back and look at the industry trends that we see driven by the OEMs that\u2019s not changing at all. So on the demand side we don\u2019t see that going backwards at all. We don\u2019t see that changing at all. Equally so, as we look at capacity coming online, which you mentioned and I think rightly so. I think the thing that maybe throws this year into a little bit of an anomaly goes back to what Laura said and that we've had significant OEM cuts.","So, as you know one of our big domestic manufacturers who happens to be a big customer of ours as well, had I think 25% production cuts in the third quarter. Those tires, and just use that as an example of other OEMs as well, that production they're cutting by enlarge is 17 inch and above, because that's what they're putting on these vehicles. That's a good thing for us. In a period where they cut production, those tires come back into the replacement market. So we saw some of that incremental headwind as we looked at the markets in 2017 as well. That's not the overall driver. But when we look on balance that certainly didn't help us right now.","Now, we don't think that that's ultimately going to continue. Those OEMs are retooling right now and the vehicles they're going to -- the tires they're going to be putting on those vehicles are in line with the trends that we see coming. So we don\u2019t see that this is a permanent change or something that's going to change our point of view. And then I just go back and reiterate to Laura's comment. Remember, not too long ago we were and I would argue 17 inch capacity, 17 inch above in the industry was actually short supply to the OEMs.","So this is an industry that I don't say just to say the words, it doesn\u2019t necessarily move in a straight line. A while ago, we're short on supply. Now, we're little bit long on supply. As we look out over the long term, our confidence remains that that balance is going to be ultimately where it\u2019s at. And that's just something we have to work through.","And if I could say, Rod, maybe just one more thing. The decisions that we make to the point is a rough quarter, but the decisions we made were consistent with our view. And going back and taking an aggressive stance, particularly coming out of Q2 and particularly giving what we did in view of our coming out first in the U.S. and Europe on pricing, given the high raw material cost. In that view, we still believe we made the right decision by having done something different, particularly coming out of Q2.","I don\u2019t know exactly the outcome that would have happened, had we done that what in terms of results. But what I do know is we clearly would have undermined and inhibited our long term trajectory on taking advantage of those 17 inch and above tires.","Rod Lache","Well, the expectations as you know as far as the reproduction instead were near -- were closer to the peak here in North America. So I would imagine that what you're counting on is an improvement in the replacement market more than anything else to achieve that 10% or 15% volume growth that you've been talking about. Can you just talk about -- you changed the way you guys are disclosing your regions and now basically consolidating things to the Americas. What was Goodyear's U.S. replacement volume year-over-year in the quarter?","Rich Kramer","Rod, we've put them together and talked to them as region now. So I think that's\u2026","Rod Lache","We can follow up if you don't have it handy. I guess obviously, there's market share losses here that are occurring and it had been occurring for a while. Could you just talk about how we should be thinking about restructuring? Because you guys have a history of aligning the capacity to whatever the demand is doing. In the past, you talked about something like $150 million a year of restructuring. Is that the right ballpark that we should be thinking about if this demand environment persists?","Laura Thompson","So I think, nothing to announce in terms of restructuring. The capital allocation plan has figures in there. I think those are still very valid and very relevant, but nothing there. If you're thinking about like the U.S. market and where we're going, we need that capacity. We continue to convert that capacity to greater than 17 inch, which takes the way tires less than 17 inch from the market. So, I don\u2019t see any big change in that outlook. Right now, we\u2019re at the place where we're continuing to convert and we were shutting down the Phillipsburg plant in Europe. And that gives us a tailwind as we go forward and regain some growth, some share now with more greater than 17 inch tires, which they did really well in the third quarter ahead of the market and greater than 17 inch growth. But overall, I don\u2019t see any change in our really restructuring cash spend overtime.","Rich Kramer","And Rod, relative to the U.S., I think your question was a big grounded in the U.S. as well. As you know very well, we\u2019ve taken out a lot of capacity related to markets that we didn\u2019t think that were when growing or where the profit pools where they are essentially or we could make money doing it. We've done a lot of that, as you know, and those are out. I think if you think about how we're looking at it, going forward, it's about building the capacity to meet market demand, something like San Luis Potosi.","And then other than that it's really about making sure we're just refining our capacity to be able to meet market demands in terms of type of products. From a share perspective, our view is that we have the opportunity to continue to grow share in the parts of the market we want. And when you look at share in 2017, we try to break out a little bit where we\u2019ve actually continued to do well, is relative to our direct to consumer and our retail customers, if you. The dynamics in wholesale, given the raw material environments and environment we talked about in the call. That\u2019s where we\u2019ve had an issue. And that volume we don\u2019t view as a permanent loss of volume.","Laura Thompson","Just before Rod some thoughts are, so the U.S., if you look at the Americas, in total, it has the volume down 7.7%. If you broke that out, the U.S. market would be down about 9%. And as Rich talked about it that is all in the wholesale channel. Now, as Bob said, there is some good little bit of growth in Brazil right but that really gets that total back to about 7.7% down.","Rod Lache","And just lastly just to help us modeling on the free cash flow. Your accounts receivable were up a lot on three week volume. Could you just explain what was behind that in the quarter?","Laura Thompson","I think it's just the timing of the winter tire sales in Europe, which started pretty heavily over the last -- really at the end of the second quarter, but really just timing.","Rod Lache","So is it different than it was last year, because you did mentioned that it's been a pretty mild winter?","Laura Thompson","This is just starts -- we had gotten the inventory and the channel down to a good level. So we did sell some tires in the second quarter and third quarter into that channel, and that\u2019s the receivables from them. There is no concern there. We look best as always to make good collections in the fourth quarter.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Adam Jonas","Do electric cars, e-tires, I'm not an engineer, but I believe that vehicle power in a way both contribute to tire ware. So if I compare the power and way to say a Model S or Shelby Bolt, to other cars as a same footprint. They\u2019re really much more powerful and weigh about 20% or 25% more mass. So you must have data on this.","Rich Kramer","So, you\u2019re absolutely right. And Adam our current model that does something similar, a lot of the all wheel drive vehicles as they push power to each of those wheels, you have a similar phenomena. You can get a bigger impact just as you\u2019re pointing out from an e-vehicle, because as you said, the power goes directly to those wheels. So this goes exactly to the design of tires to meet the specs of the manufacturers to be able to do that. And Adam it also says why the replacement market for those tires for e-vehicles out into the future is so important to us.","And that\u2019s why as we think about working with the OEMs today as we\u2019re doing working on designing tires and developing tires, particularly for those vehicles and then again looking at the net present value of that as we think about the replacement market.","Adam Jonas","I just don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve ever seen any data presented from you on that, any scientific data you must have it so just maybe a suggestion or as you start to provide a little more transparency there, but thank you. Second question, my final question is [Lift], I believe recently said that ride sharing accounts for 0.4% of miles traveled in the U.S., which is similar with our numbers. That\u2019s roughly 15 billion miles per year. I'm using round numbers here right and tires get replaced every 50,000 miles, that\u2019s 1.2 million tires per year. Starting to become a significant level of industry volume albeit at small but rapidly growing, getting to like a volume of a small plant maybe soon a large plant. When do we see this first fleet wide cooperation between a ride sharing giant in a tire firm?","Rich Kramer","I think we are -- I'll just say, we\u2019re working on those things. As we speak, Adam, we\u2019ve had relationships with them already on let's say a less formal basis. What we\u2019re working is what you\u2019re talking about and how we can do that, so nothing to say at this time. But we are working on those things. And I would tell you, Adam, one of the things related to what you\u2019re talking about in terms of approving our credentials to be able to support this as we look to the future and even going back to your last question is you heard us talk about that partnership with Test Loop, and that really is an incubator of learning how the vehicles function on road in taxi like environments or ride sharing like environments to see how the tire performs in there and get the data to be able to do that, not only for our purposes but for the purpose of then being able to share that with the fleets and then being able to help them manage those fleets better, not only on just replacing tires but on their cost per mile as they move ahead. And that\u2019s the value proposition that we are working through right now.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Ryan Brinkman","So starting on the question on the volume front, but when I think -- look at your volumes in 3Q, they were down 5% and for 4Q, you were expecting a flat volume. There seems to be stabilization embedded in that numbers, stabilization of the environment right now. What is driving your confidence that the promotional activity you\u2019re seeing from competition in 3Q doesn\u2019t process into 4Q? I know, you have started talking about 2018 already. But what's the visibility into the volume trajectory in 4Q, right now?","Rich Kramer","So, as we think about that, I think the first point I would make is we looked out to Q4, we did adjust our assumptions, which is inherent in the forecast that we put in there. And we did that with, as I said, room to be able to react to the competitive environment during the quarter as well. So I think that's the first thing that I would say.","And as we look at our volume going out and in the competitive environment we have, we feel that the volume we have flat year-over-year is something that is sensible in the environment we're in and we look at what's going on in each of the market. So for the Americas, for instance as I said, we\u2019ve made the adjustments to our value proposition out in the marketplace to be more competitive, given the environment that we're seeing. We also see better channel inventories than we did earlier in the year, let's say.","We also think we'll see, not significantly, but some improvements in OE production during the quarter given again a lot of those inventories came off, a lot of the car sales came off the loss, those inventories now are back to rather I guess positive levels, which means they need to be replenished but we see some production coming on.","And also we have new product introductions, particularly the Assurance WeatherReady in the U.S. products. We're really excited about replacing our old Assurance TripleMax and our TripleTred, and that's off to a great start already. So those are some of the things that we feel will allow us to be more competitive in the Americas. And I'll just stop there for a moment, because we can go through each of the regions. But we have things like that as we go into Q4 that say our volume outlook is one that's sensible to us and with room to react to make sure that we deliver.","Ryan Brinkman","And just moving away from North Americas for a bit for one question, which is -- so your European margins were I think 6.6% this quarter and you already talking about a mild winter and cautious about volumes for next quarter. So when should we think about starting to see some improvement in those margins. Is it midway through next year or how should we think about the trajectory here for margins in Europe?","Laura Thompson","I mean, I think you're on the right track, right. We shut down the facility in Phillipsburg and that really exited a lot of those less than 17 inch tires. So yes, we see first of all that behind us and better volumes as we go forward with more greater than 17 inch capacity along the way. So feel better about that. That also provides a cost benefit with it that'll come in to 2018 as well for about $45 million next year so again, both of those things.","Now, we continue to work on our channel work, our product line up. We've won great magazine testings in our winter tires. We still are counting on that unfortunately another green winter is how we\u2019ve modeled things out. But should we ever go back to a more normalized winter tire market that will help as well, okay. It is good mix in our European business, because of OE, the fitments that come off of there and as those flow into the replacement market.","The European market in total is just a notch behind the U.S. in terms of its greater than 17 inch. It's a little bit stronger in OE in the U.S. than it is in Western Europe. But that trend continues. So, I think all of those things together to me is how we continue to make progress on those margins, and are very focused on that for our European business. But to do them the right that gives us sustainable profitable growth versus just a one-time profit improvement.","Operator","We'll go next to Itay Michaeli with Citi. Please go ahead.","Itay Michaeli","Just going back to the 2018 price mix versus raws, I apologize if I missed this. But could you just share what the raw material assumption there is for 2018? And just then just the overall assumption for promotional activity in the 17 inch and above and 17 engine below as well?","Laura Thompson","Let me try to walk you through this. So, I guess as we look at 2018 and again two pieces here right, and I\u2019ll stick with the raw materials for a second. So where we were at the end of the second quarter, we did see a big tailwind for 2018. That has lessened, raw materials do continue to bump around, up and down. On today's spot rates, you would say that may be $75 million to $100 million of benefit in raw materials in 2018 year-over-year. But again, the raw materials do continue to move, right. They\u2019ve really not recovered from that high point in 2017, only partially.","But as we look out, given the current environment, we\u2019re essentially saying that on a net price mix versus raws that price will equal raw materials in 2018 is our assumption on our guide and really the benefits year-over-year come in form of mix, all mix, is it what stilled into the assumption at this point.","Ryan Brinkman","And then going back to the fourth quarter, any color preliminary you can share on how October is trending thus far relative to your expectations?","Laura Thompson","I think we would just say just we don\u2019t do month by month plays. But obviously everything -- what we're talking about today, the guides we\u2019re giving, the outlooks taking the consideration, our view of October as well.","Ryan Brinkman","And then lastly on CapEx in the last quarter, you took it down as the volume came down. Are these the levels we can expect that into next year as well? Could it be distributional opportunity to trim down the CapEx, if market conditions remain difficult, but you expect that to generally trend higher again in the next couple of years?","Laura Thompson","It's probably just like you said. Right now, because of the output, throughput in our factories this year, we were able to take the CapEx down and preserve all the CapEx for the greater than '17 inch, the new facility that\u2019s coming online. As we look forward, as market conditions improve that will go up slightly to may be more like the levels we started the year at or so. And we\u2019ll fine tune that in February with you. But yes, we always adjust if market conditions get stronger or weaker we always make adjustments to that CapEx to really line it up with the timing of when we can get the returns on it.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Brett Hoselton","So I want to follow on with the price mix versus raws discussions. Really struggling, simply because it seems as though your 2018 expectations are very conservative. From what I understand what you just said Laura was that the $75 million to $100 million tailwind you expect in 2018 is simply raw materials coming down and it sounds like you're also expecting some benefit from mix. But that\u2019s not included in your guidance. And it sounds like you\u2019re attracting no recovery in pricing. So it all seems extraordinarily conservative in my mind. And I know things change dramatically, but am I missing something?","Laura Thompson","So may be just -- may be I\u2019ll clear it up a little. But where you are correct essentially is that we\u2019re basing our outlook on the current environment. We\u2019re just assuming at this point that it doesn\u2019t turn around. We wanted to credibly provide an outlook based on what's actually going on today. We do see this as something that works itself out overtime, but it doesn\u2019t turnaround right away. So, let's go back to the price and the mix versus raws.","So essentially net price mix versus raw $75 million to $100 million next year is all mix. So yes, I said that at current spot rates, which could change, we see a tailwind of $75 million to $100 million next year. But given the current environment, again, we\u2019re just saying, what that\u2019s we\u2019re going to have to say, we may have to give that up. And we would say, yes, there is absolutely upside. What the timing of that upside is what's hard to predict given the current environment and the weak market, some of the weak markets. And I think just wanting to give more specificity around 2018 the way we see it today that\u2019s our approach to it. We will, as always, keep updating this as we work though the fourth quarter. If we think stabilize more, we\u2019re much happier with how quickly things might turnaround as we enter the year. There might be some upside to that as we lay out very specific numbers for you in February for 2018.","Brett Hoselton","Just for clarification. Did I understand that your raw material assumption, excluding price and mix. Is that next year we\u2019ll have a tailwind of $75 million to $100 million?","Laura Thompson","That\u2019s correct.","Brett Hoselton","But your total net price mix versus raw material is tailwind of $75 million to $100 million. So where does the mix benefit come from? Or where is that reflected in your guidance?","Laura Thompson","So the price -- so what it is, price equals raw materials. So if raws go down $100 million, price goes down $100 million, think of it that way. And then that effect is the mix and that\u2019s where I'm saying on the price versus raws, you\u2019re right that ought to be a tailwind. But we have said listen given the current environment to be very credible with you as to what\u2019s happened in the second and the third quarter this year, that\u2019s our assumption for 2018. Do we see upside, as the timing of that, what kind of plays out that\u2019s when we\u2019ll build that into the guide for your, give you a view to that.","Brett Hoselton","And then you\u2019ve got the one shot, which you\u2019ve shown that over a period of five or six years, you\u2019ve been able to offset higher raw material cost over a period of time. You\u2019ve got $300 million headwind this year, yet next year, you\u2019re expecting $75 million to $100 million tailwind. So is there some reason why at some point in time you will make up the difference between that $300 million headwind this year and the $75 million to $100 million tailwind next year. Has something changed in the industry or do you think this is a temporary phenomena?","Laura Thompson","So nothing changed in the industry. We think it\u2019s a temporary phenomena. What I think we\u2019re trying to get nailed down is the timing of that. So to your point, there is no reason to believe that it won't. That is the history. Even in the history, it shows several quarters of not in line between price and raws. And I think again, given the current environment, that\u2019s the way we\u2019re building our assumptions at this point. But if we get more clarity to that timing as the markets and the industry rebound in certain areas that\u2019s when we\u2019ll go ahead and build that into the guide. But to your point, this is still a temporary issue that we\u2019ve got.","Rich Kramer","And Brett, I'll just reiterate Laura's comment. Again, I think we think it\u2019s a function of this current environment rather than a reflection of what's going on. I mean, we\u2019ve got weak sell-out in the U.S. and Europe. We've had pre-buy and high channel inventory impacting us. We\u2019ve had OE come in. And it's a confluence of all these events. And then we had this volatility in raw material. And we obviously have taken some assumptions on that. And now we're looking at it, as Laura described. And I think we're still working on it. But as we look at the world today, that's what we're thinking. And you can rest assured we're not finished.","Brett Hoselton","And just one final thought. So VAR channel check suggested that comparisons were going to become more easier on the consumer sellout side, which would bode well for consumer sellout and selling of course, and so forth. It would seem as though that\u2019d be an opportunity for pricing to become more rational in price mix versus raws spread to start to improve some. But is that the logical chain of thought?","Rich Kramer","I think your thinking is logical.","Operator","And we'll take today's last question from Ashik Kurian with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ashik Kurian","Just have one question left. You've highlighted the impact from wholesale channels on the volumes in the U.S. Just trying to understand a bit better as to why you would underperform, especially in the third quarter, because based on what your competitors have reported, mean their price mix in the quarter isn't that drastically different from what you have reported. So is your understanding that your pricing is still a lot higher than what your competitors have? Or is it just a fact that the wholesalers are just waiting for you to lower your prices in 2018, given that you have a raw material tailwind?","Rich Kramer","I think, I'll start and Laura can jump in. I think, Ashik, I think the one thing I'll go back to our commitment to what our strategy is and what we're doing, and our ability or sense that what we're trying to do is make sure that we continue to stay on strategy. And ultimately protect what we see is our value proposition is our number one priority is creating value over time. As we've done that and selling into a distributor channel, you have a channel that has the capability to store inventory, has the capability to take advantage of free buy, has the capability to take advantage of promotional programs. And those programs allow those tires to sit in inventory.","We obviously had a value proposition that wasn't as attractive to them as they went forward. And I think that's ultimately what was -- what caused that. And that's why all our volume loss was in that channel. As we went to retail, we saw actually what I'm very pleased with the performance that we had in that channel, both in terms of mix and our service in that channel. Now, having said that, your point on competitors, I can't really speak to what they've done or how or what their programs were. We don't know. Obviously, don't have the reporting that we do or haven't been out that we could even look at that. But I don't know that.","What we do know is if we just go back to our PCI charts that we had last quarter, we didn't put that in and we're not going to get in the habit of putting that in. But what you'll see is not a tremendous uptick of the lower bar of the chart we showed last year, the green bar, which was the tire PPI. So I can't speak to competitive actions. I can look to the PPI and say that we stuck to our strategy and then you can go from there in terms of your assessment.","Laura Thompson","And Ashik if you, for the U.S. market, that PPI at the end of June was at 1.2% up, right. At the end of September, it\u2019s up 1.6% for the U.S. market. And that's a published data point, so just to understand.","Ashik Kurian","Can I have a quick follow up? I mean, what does your pricing done sequentially Q3 over Q2? I mean, I would guess probably flat, but across the regions and is it expected to be broadly flat in Q4 as well? I know, year-over-year the numbers probably get a bit distorted with the pricing actions you would have done in 2016. But just sequentially what has your pricing done?","Laura Thompson","It does vary by region. We don\u2019t really go through it that way. I think, one of the charts we showed had the -- showed the 4% as price mix for tire, Q3 and Q2. So essentially no change, in total.","Rich Kramer","You can see that on slide seven, Ashik, if you look there you can see that and you can obviously look back to our Q2 number for that as well.","Rich Kramer","Okay, thank you, Ashik. And again, we appreciate everyone\u2019s attention today and we\u2019ll talk to you next quarter. Thank you.","Laura Thompson","Thank you very much.","Operator","And this will conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect.

My name is Keith and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Goodyear\u2019s Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I would now like to hand the program over to Christina Zamarro, Goodyear\u2019s Vice President, Investor Relations.","Christina Zamarro","Thank you, Keith, and thank you everyone for joining us for Goodyear\u2019s second quarter 2017 earnings call. Joining me today are Rich Kramer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Laura Thompson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, there are a few items we need to cover. To begin, the supporting slide presentation for today\u2019s call can be found on our website at investor.goodyear.com, and a replay of this call will be available later today. Replay instructions were included in our earnings release issued earlier this morning.","If I could now draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2, I would like to remind participants on today\u2019s call that our presentation includes some forward-looking statements about Goodyear\u2019s future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments today. The most significant factors that could affect future results are outlined in Goodyear\u2019s filings with the SEC and in our earnings release. The company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","Our financial results are presented on a GAAP basis and, in some cases, a non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures discussed on the call are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent as part of the appendix to the slide presentation.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rich.","Rich Kramer","Thanks, Christina, and good morning, everyone. As always we appreciate you joining us today. This morning I will provide an overview of our second quarter results. I\u2019ll also address industry conditions our outlook and some of the questions that are likely on your mind. Laura will follow with the financial review of the quarter and walk through the detail of our revised outlook.","In the second quarter segment operating income was $361 million and SOI margin was 10% and an increasingly challenging overall industry environment, particularly in our consumer business. While these results were in line with the most recent guidance we provided for the quarter at an investor conference in June, I\u2019m certainly not pleased with them. Before Laura gets into the detail, I will take a few moments to explain the key drivers of our second quarter performance and more importantly the implications on the balance of 2017 and 2018.","As we told you on our first quarter call heading into the second quarter, we expected a decline in unit volume similar to the first quarter driven by our strategic reduction in some of the smaller rim size tires in EMEA and lower auto production. But the second quarter played out much differently than we had expected. We saw incremental weakness in the OE market especially in North America and China.","During the second quarter, auto manufacturing inventories remained well above normal levels in the U.S. and China, due to softer demand than underlying production. We also saw incremental challenges in replacement, which I\u2019ll address in a moment. As a result we produced our full year U.S. consumer OE industry outlook from about flat at the time of our first quarter call to down 4% to 5%. We continue to closely watch OE industry trends particularly in China.","On Slide 4, I\u2019ll cover the tire pricing environment through the first half of the year, as it had a very significant impact on our replacement volumes. I\u2019ll note that while the data we\u2019re showing on the chart is limited to the U.S. market. The pattern is indicative of the environment we have seen another regions particularly in the European summer tire market.","First, a brief explanation of the chart. The green line is a U.S. government statistic called the tire producer price index, which measures the change in the manufacturer selling price of tires. The blue line is the average change in the price of Goodyear tires. Both lines are measured relative to December 2016. The graph on the left side of the chart is as of the June investor meeting and the right side is where the quarter ended.","As we began the year, the industry was facing its steepest rise in raw material input costs in six years. In response we announced price increases that became effective in both the U.S. and Europe during the first quarter to help offset these raw material headwinds. And we didn\u2019t just announce those increases we implemented them. As we said in June, our volume in April was significantly worse than we had anticipated. This was primarily due to the impact of the relative timing of our announced price increases has shown on the chart. As we exited the second quarter, our pricing stood more than 400 basis points higher than that of the overall industry versus year-end. This variance is markedly worse than what we expected and the revisions we\u2019re making to our outlook today are reflective of the situation.","In addition to adjustments to our forward assumptions on our price mix versus raw material, we have also adjusted our volume expectations for the third quarter due to our relative positioning in the marketplace today. We continue to have opportunities to pursue near-term volume increases, we recognize that these opportunities are largely an unprofitable declining segments of the market.","Nonetheless the current environment does not change my perspective on the longer-term trajectory of our business. The value of a strategy is in its consistent execution regardless of industry and other external factors. And I can tell you that we will continue our consistent execution of our strategy. We see these challenges as near-term headwinds that we\u2019re working through. The tire industry is subject to periodic volatility that we are well equipped to deal with. What we\u2019re experiencing today is more reflective of the turbulence of the environment than indicative of industry trends.","On Slide 5, we\u2019ve outlined several of the factors that have contributed to this very challenging first half. First, and perhaps most significantly, the rapid increase we saw in raw materials earlier in the year was followed by an equally extreme decrease. This is uncharacteristic versus the traditional patterns we\u2019ve seen in our raw material costs over the last 10 years.","Second, sellout trends in the first half were down about 2%, leading to higher than normal inventory in the channel. This inventory build was further exacerbated by a significant amount of industry pre-buy during the first quarter.","And third, the OE industry has weakened throughout the year, which added incremental pressure in the replacement market, particularly in the U.S. As I mentioned earlier, the industry is feeling the impact from a lower SAR this year and from the OE\u2019s planned inventory reductions in 2017.","The combination of these three factors has led to a first half environment unlike anything that I have ever seen given the favorable trends and miles-driven gasoline prices and employment, which are trends generally supportive of our industry. As you would expect, our response to this anomaly was consistent with our strategy. We didn\u2019t overreact to distorted market conditions and the weaker sellout environment. We didn\u2019t chase unprofitable volume and we stuck to our strategy of pricing for the value of our products and brands in the marketplace. And we did not load our distributor shelves with third and fourth quarter volume at discounted prices today.","Instead, we stayed focused in an environment that would have made it easy to divert from our strategy. That focus led our businesses to deliver 10% operating margin and relatively stable price versus raw materials in our consumer replacement business. So it\u2019s in that context that I\u2019m very comfortable with the decisions we made in the quarter despite the short-term results that they produced.","Going forward, we will continue to offer a compelling value proposition with new products for our customers and consumers that will win in the marketplace. Staying disciplined in this challenging environment will position us well for the remainder of 2017 and for 2018 when we expect to see solid demand for our products to continue.","On Slide 6, we\u2019ve shown the trend in our growth in the greater than 17-inch segment of the market over the last several quarters. While the majority of the volume impact we felt in the second quarter was focused in the smaller room segments, we did still see a temporary impact in the greater than 17-inch segment during the second quarter.","By June, our run rate in the U.S. had returned to a more normalized level, and we expect that level of performance in the future. With the majority of the competitive pressures during the first half occurring in the smaller room sizes, we accelerated the closure of our Phillipsburg factory. The factory was officially closed earlier this month, about six months sooner than planned.","We will continue to look for additional opportunities to reduce our exposure in this declining, less profitable segment of the market. Our strategy is designed to take advantage of the long-term trends shaping our industry. Global demand for high-value- added large rim diameter tires is increasing.","This trend will continue into the future and works in our favor as our portfolio of award-winning products and our connected business model position us on a path to sustained growth and competitive advantage. Looking ahead to the remainder of the year and into next year, we see many of the headwinds we\u2019ve been facing becoming more constructive. Sellout trends have been positive in both May and June and more reflective of our longer-term expectations.","The improved sellout should reduce channel inventory levels as we head into the fourth quarter. In addition, at current spot prices, raw materials will be a significant tailwind in 2018 as well. We also anticipate our fourth quarter exit margins to be very strong as our raw material headwinds begin to subside in the fourth quarter.","Turning to Slide 9 and looking ahead to the remainder of the year and into next year. We see downward pressure on our 2017 outlook in the $1.6 billion to $1.65 billion range. Our intent is to at least regain that lost ground in 2018. As it relates to 2018, we continue to see multiple sources of increased earnings.","First, improved volume growth in our replacement businesses as the price raws environment normalizes relative to 2017. This benefits both sales volume and unabsorbed overhead. Second, the continued recovery in our U.S. commercial business. Third, a tailwind from net price\/mix versus raw materials. We have a demonstrated history of being able to offset raw material headwinds over time, and we will continue to see great mix-up in our business. And fourth, continued cost savings from our operational excellence initiatives and from the Phillipsburg plant closure.","I am confident that our long-term growth trajectory will continue to be strong and that the underlying trends in our industry play to our strengths. Having been through multiple cycles of the tire industry, I can say that Goodyear is better prepared than ever to handle the volatility of our global industry and come out of it even stronger. We expected external headwinds to occur in our 2020 plan, that\u2019s the tire business.","But candidly, we didn\u2019t expect that, that occur in 2017, but that\u2019s reality and we\u2019re actively working through it. As we look to the future, we\u2019ve been more focused on capitalizing on the trends that are shaping our industry over the years to come, which we outlined at our Investor Day last September.","The mobility ecosystem is changing rapidly. Whether it be from changes in consumer experiences, mastering complexity or in autonomous vehicles and the service model that comes with them, we are attuned to the long-term opportunities and our ability to capitalize on them. This quarter\u2019s results or some bumps along the way don\u2019t diminish our optimism or our focus.","As I discussed in my opening remarks, we remain confident in our ability to deliver strong results over the long term because of our commitment to and execution of our strategy. We will not chase volume for volume sake, we will price for the value of our products and brands in the marketplace. We will compete for a profitable growth in our targeted market segments where the value of the Goodyear brand are innovative quality products, our pervasive distribution and service networks and the best team in the industry provide us with a competitive advantage. And as I said often, we\u2019re not running our business for one good quarter or one good year, but to drive sustainable value creation over the long-term.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Laura.","Laura Thompson","Thank you, Rich. I\u2019ll begin with the income statement on Slide 10. Our unit volume was down 10% year-over-year, and was driven by two factors. First, lower overall OE demand and second, lower consumer replacement volume following a weaker sell-in environment during the quarter. And in that market, we were further impacted by the relative timing of our price increases.","Our second quarter sales were $3.7 billion down 5% from a year ago. Our second quarter sales reflect higher revenue per tire of 4% excluding currency, which was more than offset by the lower volume particularly in the U.S. and Europe. Segment operating income was $361 million for the quarter, and our SOI margin was 9.8%. Our second quarter earnings per share on a diluted basis was $0.58, and our results were influenced by certain significant items and adjusting for these items our earnings per share was $0.70.","The step chart on Slide 11, walks second quarter 2016 segment operating income to second quarter 2017. The negative impact of lower volume was $98 million unabsorbed overhead was $40 million. Increased raw material costs of $189 million more than offset improved price mix of $127 million for a net headwind of $62 million, which was primarily driven by the timing lag in our OE RMI indexed agreement. Raw material costs were up 21% year-over-year.","Cost saving actions of $59 million driven by our operational excellence initiative and efficiencies in SAG more than offset the $34 million negative impact of inflation delivering a net benefit of $25 million in the quarter. Foreign currency exchange with a modest headwind of $3 million and other was a benefit of $8 million.","Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 12, cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were about $900 million. Total debt is down $160 million and net debt is up $75 million from a year ago.","Free cash flow as shown on Slide 13, for the quarter we used $125 million in free cash flow reflecting capital expenditures of $226 million and an increase in working capital of $166 million, which was driven by higher raw material costs reflected in our inventory.","Cash flow from operating activities shows cash generation of $101 million for the quarter, $204 million less than the prior year, the difference is primarily due to the impact of higher raw material costs on working capital and lower net income.","Turning to Slide 14, the Americas reported quarterly segment operating income of $213 million, excuse me, or 10.5% to sales. This reflects a $78 million decrease versus 2016 driven by the impact of lower consumer volume and unfavorable factory overhead resulting from production adjustments.","Unit sales in the second quarter were 17.1 million tires down 9% versus 2016. Our U.S. and Canada consumer OE business was impacted by overall OEM production reductions and the timing of fitments. Our consumer replacement volume was down 9% versus 2016 driven by a significant decrease in April.","U.S. consumer replacement volume was up 1% in May and June. Commercial OE unit volume was up 1% in the quarter and commercial replacement volume was down 6%, both reflecting a sequential improvement from the first quarter. We feel good about the improved performance of commercial truck during the quarter and its potential in the second half of the year.","Americas earnings in the second quarter reflect solid performance given raw material headwinds and market volatility. The region is well position to continue to execute their strategy going forward.","Turning to Slide 15, Europe, Middle East and Africa reported segment operating income of $77 million in the quarter, which represents a decrease of $71 million versus 2016. This decrease was driven by overall less volume. Higher raw material costs and lower consumer volume were partially offset by improved price mix in the consumer replacement business and our continued focus on cost saving.","Unit sales were $13 million in the second quarter, the volume decline primarily relates to the consumer replacement business and it is attributable to increased competition and lower summer tire industry demand. The summer tire industry challenges were slightly offset by growth in our winter tire volumes, which increased 10% compared to 2016.","Our strong [Audio Dip] position has us well positioned to capture consumer demand in the winter market during the second half. OE unit volume was down 11% primarily in our consumer business driven by lower industry demand. Results for the commercial truck business decreased driven by unfavorable price mix versus raw materials in the replacement business and lower volumes.","Similar to consumer, our commercial truck business was also impacted by the relative timing of our price increases. And as Rich mentioned, the closure of our plant in Philippsburg, Germany was completed in July. The closure eliminates 6 million units of capacity, primarily in less than 17-inch segment of the market. As part of the restructuring plan, we will reallocate production of the larger more profitable sizes to existing lower cost facilities within our footprint.","This action further enable our focus on high value segments of the market, while continuing to reduce our exposure to decline in segments. We continued to execute plans for EMEA to enable growth and profitable market segments and to deliver sustainable earnings growth.","Turning to Slide 16, Asia-Pacific delivered second quarter segment operating income of $71 million, a $21 million decrease versus last year. The decrease was mainly driven by significantly higher raw material cost which more than offset the impact of higher prices and favorable mix. This was especially visible in our OE business, where raw material index base agreements tend to follow raw material price with the timeline.","Asia-Pacific\u2019s volume was 7.3 million units, relatively flat compared to the same quarter last year. The sales volume of replacement tires was slightly lower versus last year, mainly in our commercial replacement business due to price increases, we announced earlier in the year.","On the other hand, our consumer replacement business grew 1% year-over-year, driven by growth in the 17-inch and above segment. Our OE volume was up 2%, primarily due to continued market growth in the region supported by a rebound of new car sales in India. This growth was partially offset by industry weakness in China, driven by the reduction of tax incentives for new car purchases. Despite the short-term headwinds from higher raw material and fluctuations in the China OE industry, we are confident about the region\u2019s growth opportunity.","Next I\u2019ll cover the changes and the drivers of our outlook on Slide 17. We now see full year volume down about 3.5% from 2016, with volume down about 3% in the third quarter. This volume reduction will generate higher unabsorbed overhead as we align production in our factories with our revised forecast. We expect the third quarters unabsorbed overhead to be similar to the second quarter.","In line with our comments in June, we expect our full year raw material cost headwind to be about $700 million based on current spot rates, with the third quarter representing about a 32% increase versus last year. Our net price mix versus raw material assumption is now a headwind of about $175 million, following adjustment as a result of the competitive industry environment. The majority of this headwind will occur during the third quarter, when our raw material headwinds peak at $300 million.","Net cost savings remain at $140 million, as we continue to see solid benefits from our operational excellence initiatives. Moving to foreign exchange, we now expect this to be neutral for the year based on current spot rates. Other is a negative of $30 million for the year, as lower expected incentive compensation will partially offset plant startup costs and incremental depreciation in R&D. We expect the third quarter to be negative $30 million and the fourth quarter to be about flat.","Taking these drivers together, our 2017 SOI outlook is now $1.6 billion to $1.65 billion. Other financial assumptions are shown on Slide 18 and there are only a few changes. We continue to expect strong free cash flow in 2017. We lowered our capital expenditure assumption from about a $1 billion to $800 million to $900 million for the year, as we align our spend to current market needs.","Working capital will be a use of $150 million. In addition, we now estimate our restructuring payments will be about $225 million for the year, following the accelerated closure of a plant in Philippsburg, Germany.","Finally, we continue to expect execute against our capital allocation plan. We intend to purchase about $400 million in stock in total for the year, which leaves about $370 million, with subject to our performance, we expect to completely over the balance of the year.","Now, we\u2019ll open the line up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We take our first question from David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Rich Kramer","Good morning, David.","David Tamberrino","Good morning, Rich, good morning Laura. Thanks for taking our questions here. I think the first question that I have and several investors have, because it was noticeably absent from the slide deck and it was in the June 14 presentation.","Where you\u2019re seeing today and where you see 2018 shaping up? Are you still on track in your view for the 2020 SOI target of $3 billion? And I ask that not just for what\u2019s going on today within the market, but also from some of the underlying assumptions you had for USR, I think you were using some LMC automotive forecast, which had like an $18 million SAR in 2020, so I\u2019m trying to understand how you feel about that guidance almost a year in now and given what\u2019s going on within the market.","Laura Thompson","Okay. Sure, David. Maybe I\u2019ll start and then Rich can fill in if you\u2019d like. So I think, David, there is no doubt last September when we laid out our long-term plan, right, we knew headwinds were possible. They always come up in our industry. But clearly, we didn\u2019t know how to anticipate them in the early part of the first year of that plan. However, as we sit here today, we see a lot of these headwinds as temporary in nature, but there is no doubt that while things are quite volatile at this time period, we\u2019ll have to get back to you and walk you through that.","The underlying fundamentals, as Rich walked through in his script and as we\u2019ll see in the numbers and continue to see in the numbers going forward remain very strong, and we\u2019re confident in those drivers. But there is no doubt that what\u2019s going on in the first year of that plan absolutely has an impact on it. But again, I just \u2013 I keep talking about this, the temporary nature is there for the headwind, and we feel very confident that, that \u2013 the underlying trends in the industry are still very strong, and we\u2019re in a great position with our strength to drive growth through those trends, frankly.","Rich Kramer","Yes. David, I would just echo Laura\u2019s comments. I\u2019d say, as I said in my script, we expected headwinds. We didn\u2019t expect them so soon. So we got there work our way through. And I think in this time, we need a little time to see how the second half shapes up. Again, we\u2019ve made some adjustments that we\u2019re very comfortable with and then we\u2019ll be back to you with an update going forward. I think it\u2019s a little premature for us to answer that question as concretely as you\u2019re asking right now, a lot of moving parts. I will tell you, again, because I think it\u2019s the core of our 2020 plan are the megatrends that underlie the drivers to hit those numbers. And I will tell you, those things we don\u2019t really view as changing.","You mentioned the SAR, which forecasts are going down. You all probably seen the numbers again today of sellouts are there, auto, sales and inventories and the like. But we also know that a lot of those plant closures in the second half are the retool, and those retoolings are going to be for exactly the type of tires that we want to sell or we want to sell to or we want to be on going forward both at OEM replacements. So a lot of those megatrends, they\u2019re still alive. They\u2019re still there. We\u2019re working through what\u2019s the tumultuous environment situation. So it makes a little hard at this moment to be candid to answer that question as definitively as you like. But we will \u2013 we\u2019ll certainly update that as we go by the end of the year.","David Tamberrino","Understood. That\u2019s fair. And then just a second one from me. As we think about the change we saw that tire PPI inflection downward into June from May after it was coming up nicely. Can you just kind of walk us through what you were seeing within the environment from your competitors mostly because the price\/mix less raws variance is about $200 million from where were a month ago versus, or say, where we are today. What really drove that pretty meaningful change? Is it competitors that were in following through with the price increases, competitors just looking to take share and pricing down? Maybe just walk us through help us understand.","Rich Kramer","So David, as you\u2019d expect, I certainly can\u2019t comment on what others have done in the industry. We tried to use that PPI chart as sort of an indicator for you to see some of the trends that are out in the marketplace, if you will. I will tell you, I can comment for us, and clearly, our strategy is clear. Our strategy is to recover the value of our products, whether that\u2019s branding, whether that\u2019s innovation, technology and raw materials, clearly, an element of that.","And that\u2019s what we did. That\u2019s what we told you that we were going to do. And as we look at our blue line on there and if you look at Slide 7 on our price\/mix per tire and the sequential improvements, Q1 to Q2 and then on into the second half, we see the raw materials are there. We see that we need to go capture the value of our brands, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re \u2013 that\u2019s what our intent is and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.","Laura Thompson","Yes. And I would say, David, I think to add on to that, maybe I think Slide 5 as we, again, try to just explain what\u2019s going on out there. As Rich said, the PPI shows that in the end result, but I think in the first half of the year, we just have this very complex environment unlike anything we\u2019ve seen before, right. With the raws rising so rapidly, you all remember that from the fall and oil rising and then dropping. And then you have sellout down dramatically in the first part of the year, the OE pressure on top of it. I think we really \u2013 what we see going on in the industry is, again, more about that environment as opposed to some kind of a trend.","David Tamberrino","Okay. And just lastly looking at Slide 6, the volume growth reacceleration, how much of that is driven by improved retail sellouts and inventories more in line versus more capacity coming on line for you from your Mexico facility?","Laura Thompson","Sure. So I think if you \u2013 as we spoke to the second half of the year, right, and we see our volume for the full year down about 3.5%, we have, for the U.S., I think, in the U.S., we do see sellout improving. We saw it a little better in June. So we \u2013 based in our assumptions is that we kind of get back to about flat for the year in terms of industry in the U.S. environment, if that helps.","David Tamberrino","It does. Thank you. I\u2019ll turn it over.","Rich Kramer","Thanks, David.","Laura Thompson","Thanks, David.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Itay Michaeli with the Citi. Please go ahead.","Itay Michaeli","Great. Thank you.","Rich Kramer","Good morning, Itay.","Itay Michaeli","Good morning. Maybe just stick to Slide 6. Can you talk a little bit more what kind of what happened in the quarter specifically and then I think, Laura, you mentioned June looking was better, how does July look thus far? What gives you confidence in the 10% for the second half kind of recovery there?","Rich Kramer","Yes. So Itay, I think in a macro sense, again, I think as a look at the second quarter and you look at Laura\u2019s comments in June relative to the second quarter, it\u2019s pretty much in line with what we thought was going to happen. I think if you think about the adjustments we\u2019ve made going forward and maybe to build on what Laura said, what\u2019s happening and what drove even the decrease you see in Page 6 in the second quarter. Again, you have this current situation that we would say is not really reflective of a change in industry trends, but more of a function of the current environment.","Again, rapidly rising raw material cost up to 30%, then we had a big prebuy, put \u2013 had a lot of tires industry-wide into the channels, so you have full channels there. Add to that, we had a weak sellout environment going on, and then that comes in and sort of exacerbated by unequally almost significantly fast or violent decrease in raw material prices. So you have all these things pulling together that had somewhat of a tumultuous environment that we\u2019re seeing.","And then add on to that, the little \u2013 the weaker OE environment that we have and you kind of got what\u2019s happening in the second quarter. In that environment, and as you look at that bar, I would tell you that as I mentioned earlier, we had a plan, we stuck to our strategy. We have raw material prices going up starting really at the beginning of the year. Our peak will be in Q3. We have about $470 million in raw materials to offset in the second half. We have significant raw materials in Q2.","As we said, we\u2019re going to capture the value of our brand. We did what we said, and a consequence of that is, I think, Laura even alluded to in June is that we lost volume for that. That\u2019s what you see in that bar right there. I don\u2019t like losing volume, but as I said in my script, we\u2019re comfortable with the decisions we made because we have to capture the value of our brands going forward. We can\u2019t get behind on our costs, raw material being one of them. And as we\u2019ve often said, capturing and offsetting that raw material with price\/mix sometimes takes longer than others. We could be in one of those environments, but we\u2019re confident in what we did. We\u2019re confident this is sort of the tumultuous period. And that\u2019s kind of what we think \u2013 what our view is to what happened in Q2.","Laura Thompson","Yes. And I think as you go to the second half, Itay just maybe for modelling to help you, overall, as we see our volume down 3.5% for the full year, in \u2013 obviously, given what\u2019s going on, we\u2019ve lowered our expectations, frankly, right, as we go here. So we see this as manageable. Especially for the third quarter, given that channel inventory that Rich talked about, our expectations are not high for the third quarter. We see our volume probably down about 3% in total.","Now we do see the fourth quarter start to come back a little bit. As that inventory works through, the sellout get back more to flat. And then for the fourth quarter, we \u2013 in terms of total volume, we certainly have China OE, better year \u2013 much better year-over-year, things like that. If that helps maybe third quarter, fourth quarter view.","Itay Michaeli","Yes, that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks very much for the detail. My follow-up question is on CapEx being pulled back. Can you specifically talk about where are you able to find some savings there? And how to think about CapEx beyond 2017 given that you do think volume will come back further 2018?","Rich Kramer","Itay, I\u2019ll start kind of way our philosophical view on this, and that\u2019s always that we want to be very judicious allocators of capital, CapEx being one of those buckets. And when we see the volume impacts that we\u2019ve had here, it just causes us very prudently to go back and look at our capacity, look at the additions we had and reassess the timing. We would tell you, we\u2019re not impacting our sort of 17-inch and above capacity or other strategic investments that we want to make. But at the end of the day, we will go back, and I can assure you, we\u2019re scrubbing through those projects that, yes, we might need. But look, the reality of where we\u2019re at, where the industries at for the moment, we\u2019re going to go back and take a hard look at those and that\u2019s the change that you\u2019re seeing.","Itay Michaeli","And maybe just a quick follow-up on that. Does the cutback in CapEx potentially affect how we should think about future net cost savings in the out years? I know you have the number out up to 2018 as we think about that going forward, is there\u2026","Rich Kramer","No. Itay, of course, you\u2019re absolutely right, CapEx does go into efficiency and consequently cost savings, but our drivers of operation excellence initiatives aren\u2019t rooted solely in our capital expenditures. They\u2019re rooted on projects we\u2019re working on the ground floor of all our locations. So no, I would not equate it to.","Itay Michaeli","That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you so much.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Rich Kramer","Good morning, Rod.","Rod Lache","Hi, Rich, good morning. I hopped on a bit late and I missed part of your script, Rich. But I wanted to probe a couple of things. Obviously, it\u2019s a pretty volatile environment, but this is the fourth downward revision to guidance in the past year. And this one came about a month after you just provided an update in mid-July \u2013 mid-June actually. actually. So did something really change here from your perspective between mid-June and mid-July, because, obviously, we\u2019ve been hearing about very weak demand and price competition through the quarter?","Rich Kramer","Yes. So Rod, I guess what I would refer you back to Slide 4. And what we tried to do on Slide 4, that\u2019s where we compare the average price of a Goodyear Tire to an industry PPI, which we were using as a way for you to think about this. And what we tried to layout is what the expectation for the balance of the year was as of our June conference versus what we saw having more real-time data and information subsequent to the quarter. And remember, a lot of activity happens at the end of June and, of course, we\u2019ve seen it into July as well in terms of our analysis of what\u2019s happening out in the market.","So if you say what\u2019s happened, what we did was look at our position in the marketplace and making along with other factors that we referred to, higher channel inventory, weak sellout, weaker OE, decreasing raw material prices, as well as our competitive position. And it just cost us to look at the back half of the year and say, okay, what were the assumptions that we had for our price\/mix versus raw materials and how did reassess those?","And I would have you then look at Slide 7, and what you see there is our price\/mix per tire on the right-hand of that slide. What you see is still sequential increases. What you\u2019d be right to assume is those sequential increases are perhaps lower than previously planned. So I would say an assessment of the market, assessment what\u2019s going on and then making some adjustments.","Laura Thompson","And I think, Rod, just as you said, raws were rising dramatically at the end of the year and we wanted to get out ahead of that, get our price increases in place as we announced them. It doesn\u2019t mean that just like we talked about in Investor Day, and I think the slide is in the deck again here today, it doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t recover with price\/mix, the raw material headwinds coming. This is timing, right? It\u2019s over time.","Rod Lache","Yes. The Slide 7 on the right, I presume is year-over-year. The Slide 4 that was the word the PPI bending down. Just shows Goodyear kind of moving in an upward up into the right. Is it fair to assume that just look \u2013 that you guys made a reassessment of what the market looks like and you\u2019re starting to bend your curve down maybe to follow what the industry is doing.","Rich Kramer","Rod, I would say refer you to Slide 7 as well. We\u2019re not bending the curve down.","Laura Thompson","Yes. So look as Page 4. Where is the \u2013 look at the scale, right? 5%. Look at the Q4 chart right on Page 7.","Rod Lache","Right, right. But there were sequential declines last year. So we can follow-up on that last \u2013 offline. But you\u2019re thinking that you will recover despite maintaining the discipline apparently in your guidance. I want to probe also just the thesis that you laid out on last year on the tight supply-demand for 17-inch and greater tires. There was a slide, I can\u2019t remember that you probably remember what I\u2019m referring to, but generally, it showed something like here\u2019s five years of what we think supply is going to do worldwide and you had North America, Europe, Asia and you showed just five years of what we think demand is going to do.","And if I remember correctly, it was something like 200 million units of additional capacity that you saw over five years, so 40 million a year and you thought demand growth would be in line or better. So at this point, are you seeing more capacity than you thought or less demand than you thought? Because clearly, some players are turning more aggressive or having some additional availability.","Laura Thompson","Yes, I think the answer to your question directly is no, right? We continue to see this very strong demand. Nothing changes about that chart. I know, which one you\u2019re referring to. We do have short time periods in between. As we always said, nothing goes up, just in the straight line. So in any short period of time, incremental volume can have an impact. But nothing changes about the fact that the mix-up is happening, the industry needs those tires. We still do not see \u2013 we continue, I think, to see favorable demand for that greater than 17-inch over the next five years.","Rich Kramer","And Rod, I mean, I think your question is a fair one and clearly one that we\u2019re thinking through even in the context of Itay\u2019s question on capital allocation like in the long-term. And again, I have to come back and say and you\u2019ve been around long enough as well. Our industry, as I said, doesn\u2019t really move in a straight line. And what we\u2019re seeing is obviously the tumultuousness that you referred to, but it doesn\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re not changing our view of the long term. We\u2019re not changing our view of the profit pools for 17-inch and above. We\u2019re not changing our view of what the demands of the OEMs are going to be.","We\u2019re not coming from a different place on that at all. In fact, the OEMs are working on new models, new SUVs, new light trucks, new things like that coming out, which is exactly the place of the strengths that we have. So from our perspective, clearly, we\u2019ve got to work through the situation we have and we\u2019re not \u2013 we are not coming off our strategy to recover the value of our products, and those charts are intended to try to work that through. And again, you made reference to an offline discussion. Christina will certainly walk you through that. But because we\u2019re seeing some of the tumultuousness doesn\u2019t really change what we\u2019re doing. It\u2019s that our business.","And Rod, finally, I\u2019d say, our job, when we see a raw material headwind of as much as 30% at the beginning of the year. Our job is to go and, again, capture the value of our products, including all those input costs. That\u2019s what we need to do, and that\u2019s what our strategy is.","Rod Lache","One last thing if I could just interject. The \u2013 on Slide 4, if you were to disaggregate that industry PPI into 17-inch and greater versus broad line tires. Are you seeing a significant difference in that bend down in pricing?","Rich Kramer","Rod, that\u2019s a \u2013 I\u2019ll answer it this way. I will tell you, the market for 17-inch and above remains very strong. If you look what we showed our Q2 volumes went down, but that was more of a function of our position in the marketplace than any industry trend. And again, as we said in our comments, and I think Laura mentioned that trend has already reversed itself in June and that\u2019s what we expect to see over the balance of the year. So that market hasn\u2019t changed Rod.","Rod Lache","Okay. Thank you.","Rich Kramer","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Ryan Brinkman","Great. Thanks for taking my question. First one is just on Americas volume down 10%, RMA replacements were down just 1%. I realized that your number it includes OE and it\u2019s not just the U.S., LATAM\u2019s got to be soft. But still just a big difference, suggest that you did lose a decent amount of share. Can you talk about what you think the biggest drivers of that are? And if also I am curious, if the share loss that you think was less than the retail channel, than it was for our shipments.","Rich Kramer","Ryan, I think in terms of the volume decrease we have, I would say it\u2019s just simply a direct function of our position in the marketplace. And as we\u2019ve been talking about, I think it\u2019s really no more than that. As you see on Slide 4, where we showed sort of the difference of us in the marketplace, the simple answer is the end of result was the volume loss that we had. And on top of that, obviously, you have the market that we\u2019re dealing with right now that has, as I said, high inventories had a lot of pre-buy in the first quarter, you had slow sell out.","And all those things sort of as we mentioned wrapped up into the environment that we had. And as we struck to our strategy, we saw a volume loss. I think and as I said on my comments, I\u2019m very happy with the decisions we\u2019ve made. It costs us volume, our job is to go and get that back. And as we said, we see 2018 is a way to go do that. And as Laura said, we see those volume trends even improving, on a sequential basis, in Q3 and Q4.","Laura Thompson","And when you think about Q2, remember that really, really bad April, right? And then we started to see a much better recovery as we went through May and June.","Ryan Brinkman","Okay, great, thanks. And I see you are maintaining the outlook for full-year cost savings versus general inflation. Is there any thought that you\u2019re trying to cut a little bit deeper there into operating expense, just given the softer demand environment? What is the potential to maybe push a little harder there, without impacting RD in the year or something else that you judge critical?","Laura Thompson","Yes, so I think we\u2019re \u2013 as we said earlier, we always are looking and pushing, right? At this point, we feel very comfortable with the estimate we have, the $140 million up for the year. And as you think about that, okay, I think we\u2019re at $64 million or so $67 million through the first half. That will come equally. At this point, we see kind of for Q3 and Q4. But to your point, we always are looking, trust me, we will find every dollar we can, as we look through that. But at this point, we feel comfortable with the $140 million.","Ryan Brinkman","Okay. And then just lastly from me. How should we think about the guidance that impact all your share repurchase plans? How do you sort of way the fact that, on the one hand your cash generation now it\u2019s going to be less. But on the other of course, you can buyback the stock at a lower price. Thanks.","Laura Thompson","Sure, so we \u2013 so I would look at this way and say, we said, we\u2019re going to spend about $400 million for the full-year. That leaves us about $370 million for the back half of the year. We\u2019re going to get busy on that. We understand the stock is under pressure, we see it as under-valued absolutely. So we\u2019re going to get busy on those programs. Okay?","Ryan Brinkman","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.","Rich Kramer","Good morning, Adam.","Adam Jonas","Hey, good morning Rich and Laura. So just another way of, I guess, asking what the hell happened question in the second quarter, maybe from a end consumer standpoint, you obviously have a lot of data and a lot of physical downstream distribution and contacts et cetera. I mean, what\u2019s happening at that moment, where the rubber is making contact with the road. Our consumers coming in with bald tires, is it that you had subprime or let\u2019s say, folks that maybe could afford to buy a full sized SUV on some juice residual deal. But then when they add and replace a tire, skipper shock and they decided to run the tire. I mean, I\u2019m just curious \u2013 anything on the \u2013 very, very and consumer side that you might be picking upon?","Laura Thompson","Yes, I mean I think that, yes, we don\u2019t see anything different right in the underlying fundamentals of the industry that drive people to come in and buy tires to use upon, right. We don\u2019t, we see miles driven continue to notch up. We see gas prices, as low. Good unemployment, sometimes following a really stronger OE environment you can have these time periods, just kind of in between before customers lock in the door. Yes, we see in our retail environment, people coming in with very bald tires. But we also see the normal traffic, but overall retail I\u2019d say in the U.S. for us and for all others has just again been very soft, extremely soft through the month of May. Okay?","And I should say, really bad in first quarter, still down through April, notch better May and June. And June and July kind of give us a view that we think we\u2019ll end up flat for the year. But as you say, you get these quarters, several quarters in a row, where you have with a weak sell out, but it eventually catches back up.","Rich Kramer","And I\u2019d echo Laura\u2019s comments about it, it eventually catches up, which is what we would expect, because as we\u2019ve gone through down cycles, one of the things that I do is, I go visit customers around stores, you kind of look at the tire piles from the back, from tires that have been removed. And in down economies, post Great Recession, when you see tires comes off, you\u2019d see tire cords, you could just go out and feel and then look at treads. And see what tread depth was left if any, that\u2019s not happening at all.","We\u2019re not seeing any of that right now. We\u2019re just seeing sort of sell out has been sort of consistently running at the GDP levels, if you look like 1% to 2%. But we also know those replacements on the \u2013 what has been a very strong sorrow over the last years has become through and we\u2019re well positioned to take advantage of that. So we expected to come, but candidly, as I said in my remarks, we\u2019re a bit surprised that those underlying fundamental trend haven\u2019t driven sell out, as much as we would have expected.","Adam Jonas","All right, thanks. And just maybe a follow-up. there is this thesis out there, that changes in the business model, say, Auto 2.0 things like ridesharing firms that become mega-fleet managers could be in position to one day, if not now, be buying many, many millions of tires on a commercial buy for their drivers. Just like Uber and Lyft what not, start to try to take some cough out and use their data to try to provide a fleet management solution, and better, better economics to their drivers.","I guess the question is, are you, are you had a point, where you could have without singling out a specific ridesharing firm on this call. Are you having \u2013 your folks in the commercial side having those discussions with the ridesharing firms on how your products can meet their needs?","Rich Kramer","Adam, we are \u2013 one, I mean just to take a step back, your perspective on a shift to a customer changing overtime, more towards a fleet \u2013 a mega-fleet as you say is a trend that I think is ultimately going to happen, and to you point it\u2019s to a degree happening already, which is a very positive trend. And as you know, one of our strength is managing fleets, through not just a tire, but through the service model that we have focusing on up time, focusing on cost per mile, focusing on service. Those types of elements make that business a very good business for us.","So we do see that trend happening. And I would suggest to your point, we\u2019re on the front end of seeing that happening. And those are the type of dialogues, we\u2019re having with many, many of those players. As you know there is a wide range and a lot of clarity to fall out, is to how those things come together. In terms of what their business model looks like. But suffice it to say, the need for tires \u2013 the point of vehicle miles traveled going up and the need to provide a service to keep those vehicles going through some of those mega-fleets that are emerging are absolutely on our radar.","Adam Jonas","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Rich Kramer","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Emmanuel Rosner with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Emmanuel Rosner","Hi good morning everybody.","Rich Kramer","Hi, Emmanuel.","Laura Thompson","Good morning.","Emmanuel Rosner","Just wanted to apologize in advance I missed the beginning of the call. And so you may have explained and answered a lot of my question. Just wanted to get back on the \u2013 to Slide 6. I understand you\u2019re rational for holding the bar on pricing and how you make strategic sense. But how do you get [indiscernible] that the disciplined pricing will not hurting your volumes on an ongoing basis. Or in other words, how do you get conviction on these, back to 10% growth for the second half and for 2018?","Rich Kramer","Well Emmanuel, I\u2019ll start with the way I always do, because I think it\u2019s absolutely key and that goes back to the value proposition that we have in the marketplace. It\u2019s our products, it\u2019s the technology in them. It\u2019s the brand, it\u2019s the marketing, it\u2019s the service we bring to the dealers. And even in the second half for instance in North America, we have our new weather reading product coming out. All of those things are ultimately what matters and what will be attractive both to our distributors, our dealers, and to our consumers and those things that we have haven\u2019t changed at all. So that\u2019s the predicate of the conviction that we have, that we can continue forward in a very positive way. And on Slide 6 deliver those trends, those green bars after Q2 on that list.","So that\u2019s point number one. The current situation that we have is \u2013 as I mentioned, a few times and no need to apologize that you haven\u2019t listened to the front part of it, but we\u2019re going through a very \u2013 again a very difficult environment as opposed to a change in the industry, which just says we\u2019re working through those high raw materials, a lot of pre-buy, a week sellout of things you\u2019ve heard us talk about. And then the raw materials coming back down, so that\u2019s the environment that we\u2019ve been in. Now what gives us confidence on the second half is the outlook we\u2019ve put forward, changes some of the assumptions that we had before relative to our position in the marketplace.","Again Emmanuel, I would refer you to Slide 7 that you can see are our sequential view of where our price mix for tire is going, which shows a commitment to offset and cover those incremental raw materials. And as I think, Laura mentioned earlier as well. Our view of volume, we adjusted downward in the second half, we\u2019ve taken into consideration some of the weaker OE, trends that are going on out there. So we have confidence that the value proposition we have in the position that we have is an appropriate way to go into the second half. And more importantly, positions us well to exit out of 2017 with some positive tailwinds of lower raw material cost of good margins coming out based on where our price\/mix will be. And we\u2019ll focus on protecting those, as we get into 2018. So we see a lot of positive things even coming out of 2017.","Laura Thompson","Exactly. And so I think, Emmanuel like Page 6, which is the greater than 17-inch consumer replacement, as we said, we see it more of what\u2019s going on in the environment what occurred in the second quarter especially for April and because those fundamentals are trends in the industry are remain strong. We don\u2019t see that and continue to not see that as we move through the second half of the year. And then as Rich said, our expectation is now for volume for the full year, it down 3.5% and as we think about the second half of the year \u2013 think of the third quarter as down about 3%. So we very much lowered our expectation there. We see the fourth quarter more like up about 3% or so, a lot driven by OE in China. So again, just kind of lying in there, we feel we\u2019ve got realistic expectations as we look going forward.","Emmanuel Rosner","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then I guess looking forward to on your Slide 9 and the 2018 positive SOI driver. So I guess the overall message is certainly a lot of these headwinds are temporary. And we will get offset into next year. What are some of the other SOI drivers to think about that could be potential offset. I mean very clearly not everything will be positive going into 2018. But if I sum up, what you have in there, we\u2019re talking about a major jump in earnings according to your expectations?","Laura Thompson","You\u2019re right, there\u2019s always other things that come up. In 2020 plan, we talked about some incremental R&D expense, marketing. There\u2019s a little more depreciation that\u2019ll come in year-over-year, probably some incentive comp versus the prior year, those kinds of things. But we\u2019ll \u2013 these are, again, what we see as the positive drivers going forward. We\u2019ll continue to give you more and more detail about next year as it plays out for probably the back half here.","Emmanuel Rosner","Okay, great. And then just very quickly, when you look at sort of your updated SOI guidance, and I apologize if you went over that before. How do you see 3Q versus fourth quarter playing out?","Laura Thompson","So I think, our third quarter, we see, again, down significantly year-over-year, okay, similar to our second quarter in terms of percentages or so. We do see the fourth quarter starting to turn better. It\u2019s a lot of the other things we talked about, the price\/mix versus raws in the fourth quarter. The comp is much better year-over-year. Again, volumes in China there\u2019s other moving pieces as you go through it. But that\u2019s kind of how we see the second half kind of playing out.","Emmanuel Rosner","Great. Thank you very much.","Rich Kramer","Thanks, Emanuel.","Laura Thompson","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll today\u2019s last question from Ashik Kurian with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Rich Kramer","Good morning, Ashik. How are you?","Ashik Kurian","Okay. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just one on Slide 5. It\u2019s interesting that you showed the raw material cycle and this clearly been away short cycle. I\u2019m sure you must have than your price increases, but probably the biggest cycle in mind, and that\u2019s probably why you suffered, now with the market share losses, but the upshot is probably the dealers who are all sitting with higher inventory of your competitive tires. I\u2019m just wondering, how much of an impact does that have on the retail market share? I know someone asked this question, but I wasn\u2019t very clear on the answer. But are you seeing in terms of the retail market share loss that you\u2019re suffering and how long ago that last and could it be structural and how much does the dealer inventory determine the retail market share in the end?","Rich Kramer","I take \u2013 I mean, I\u2019d say a couple of things. One, at the start of the year, you\u2019re right, we were looking at 1.1 billion in raw materials. What I would say is what we saw not being able to forecast how long or how high, but we know when raw materials goes up, our job is to deal with those raw materials, and that\u2019s what we did. But I would also tell you, we\u2019re looking at 700 million of raw materials, which is still a 20% year-over-year increase. So the raw material costs are very real, and there\u2019s something that needed to be dealt with, and we did. And as I said, we\u2019re very comfortable having taken that decision.","In terms of what this means on a retail sellout in market share position, number one, as you know, the sellout numbers are harder to get in terms of share. The share we see in the industry is more sell-in and sell-out. But I would suggest you, you haven\u2019t gone through this in the past, dealers are very certainly very cognizant of what\u2019s happening in the industry in terms of doing pre-buys or candidly the opposite. It\u2019s the situation we\u2019re in reverse. And I would say when we see the sort of big pre-buys of these big movements by the dealers they\u2019re a bit more arbitrage on price from their perspective than they are indicative of changes in share positions in the industry.","So I don\u2019t really worry that that\u2019s the case and I do that because of the underlying things that we have going on, the strong OE pull and the segments that we want to play, the brand, the distribution that we have, the other services, the other things that we offer to our wide distribution network that really outlast and are more important to them than sort of an opportunity to buy low, if you will. Those things will ultimately come through. They always have, and I don\u2019t expect that to change at this point.","Ashik Kurian","Sorry to follow up on this. But I mean, my concern is, I mean, you flagged that on spot you\u2019re probably looking at a tailwind and raw materials in 2018. Now the current environment doesn\u2019t seem like one that you can keep all of it. So potentially tire makers will have to continue to give some of the prices back, and that\u2019s why I raised my question as to what is going to force the sell-in to pick up in the second half, when you continuing to forecast plus 5% year-over-year incremental pricing.","Rich Kramer","Yes, Ashik. You also remember we said sell-out should start to get better in the second \u2013 we\u2019re seeing it actually get better. So you\u2019ll see some of that inventory go through, we would say it takes about round about a quarter to get through given what we know. So I do think sell-out trends will ultimately be better and I certainly can\u2019t speak to what others are doing? But again, as we look at this we\u2019re still looking at almost $470 million raw materials to offset in the back half of the year. So our value proposition, and as we bake that into our view for the second half of the year, I think based on what we know, we\u2019re comfortable with that.","Ashik Kurian","Okay. Thank you.","Rich Kramer","Thanks, Ashik.","Laura Thompson","Thank you.","Rich Kramer","Okay. I think that was a last caller. Again, we appreciate everyone\u2019s attention today. Thank you very much.","Operator","And this will conclude today\u2019s program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."],"10227":["The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (NASDAQ:GT) Q1 2019 Earnings Conference Call April 26, 2019  9:30 AM ET","Company Participants","Nick Mitchell - Senior Director, IR","Rich Kramer - Chairman and CEO","Darren Wells - EVP and CFO","Conference Call Participants","Rod Lache - Wolfe Research","John Healy - Northcoast Research","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan","Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs","Anthony Deem - Longbow Research","Operator","Good morning. My name is Keith, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to Goodyear's First Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I will now hand the program over to Nick Mitchell, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Nick Mitchell","Thank you, Keith, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for Goodyear's first quarter 2019 earnings call. I'm joined here today by Rich Kramer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Darren Wells, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The supporting slide presentation for today's call can be found on our Web site at investor.goodyear.com. And a replay of this call will be available later today. Replay instructions were included in our earnings release issued earlier this morning.","If I could now draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statement on slide two, I would like to remind participants on today's call that our presentation includes some forward-looking statements about Goodyear's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments today. The most significant factors that could affect future results are outlined in Goodyear's filings with the SEC and in our earnings release.","The company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Our financial results are presented on a GAAP basis, and in some cases, on non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures discussed on the call are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent as part of our appendix to the slide presentation.","And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rich.","Rich Kramer","Great. Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. During today's call, I'll share some highlights of our first quarter operating performance and discuss the steps we are taking to address our cost structure and improve our supply of premium tires. I'll also spotlight several new mobility partnerships as well as the upcoming launch of our commercial ecommerce pilot in the U.S.","Darren will follow with a review of our financial performance as well as details on our recently announced European restructuring and the refinancing of our European credit facility. He will conclude with an update on how we are thinking about the business going forward. We entered the year with renewed focus on the elements of our business that we can control and influence including our operating execution, the efficiency of our manufacturing facilities, our cost structure, and product and business model innovation.","We made progress increasing our premium supply for the U.S. market allowing us to gain momentum. Our U.S. consumer replacement tire shipments increased 6% outpacing the performance of the USTMA members. This was led by strong growth in the high margin 17-inch and greater category. Our U.S. commercial truck replacement tire volume turned positive, reflecting improved manufacturing performance at our commercial truck tire plants as well as the strength of our fleet solutions\u2019 offering.","Both businesses grew share while increasing the value we capture in the marketplace. Our U.S. and EMEA commercial OE businesses delivered another quarter of impressive volume growth reflecting healthy trends in the trucking industry, including increased ton miles and higher utilization. EMEA's commercial replacement business also posted solid growth aided by the strength of our proactive solutions offering.","European consumer replacement industry demand waned throughout the quarter, reflecting weakness in the emerging markets and Germany. This negatively affected EMEA's consumer replacement volume. And as expected, our Asia-Pacific results were greatly influenced by the macro environment in China including lower vehicle production which continued from the second half of 2018. Our OE volume declined by nearly 15% in the quarter.","I would like to take a few moments to address some of the key areas driving and influencing our business, and the first is China. Looking at China overall, we started seeing indicators of stabilization in the quarter as government stimulus has shown signs of improving business confidence. Sales of new commercial trucks have improved as construction and infrastructure projects are increasing. And as I mentioned, while new car sales contracted for the ninth month in a row, the rate of decline moderated relative to the previous month as well as through the first quarter. We are also seeing some encouraging developments in the consumer replacement channel, most notably, industry sell in trends are improving aided by lower inventory levels following months of de-stocking activity by small- and medium-sized distributors.","Next, I would like to address some actions taken in the quarter regarding our manufacturing footprint. Recently, we took steps to improve the competitiveness of our manufacturing footprint and increased our premium tire capacity. Both of these actions will help us with our goal of having the right tire at the right place at the right time, and at the right cost. We announced plans to modernize our Hanau and Fulda manufacturing facilities in Germany. These investments will bolster the capabilities and the productivity of our German plants, strengthening our competitive position in the market.","The transformation will result in these plants having more automated production and being fully capable of producing consumer tire with rim diameters greater than or equal to 17 inches. These transformational investments, along with the planned expansion of our plant in Slovenia announced earlier this year will add nearly 4.5 million units of high value added capacity better positioning us to meet the growing demand in the higher-margin premium segments of the European market.","Our portfolio of industry-leading products is key to capturing this growing demand. Product innovation and vitality continued to be areas of focus for us in 2019. On the last call, I provided an overview of four new tires that we are launching in the U.S. this year, each of which were well-received at our Annual North America Customer Conference. Our product development team in EMEA also has tremendous momentum on this front with several new high value added products scheduled for launch this year including the Eagle F1 Asymmetric 5 and the Eagle F1 SuperSport consumer tires, the Vector 4Seasons Cargo for the all important cargo van segment, and the KMAX Gen-2 and FuelMax Gen-2 commercial tires for the drive and steer positions.","These tires feature our latest technology. The Eagle F1 Asymmetric 5 delivered excellent performance in this year's European magazine summer tire tests including earning first or second place finishes in four out of four tests. The Eagle F1 SuperSport will enhance Goodyear's position in the ultra, ultra high performance category. This tire delivers superior wet braking and dry handling performance versus the competition, both contributing to superior track times.","The Vector 4Seasons Cargo refreshes our offering in the all-important cargo van segment. This marks the first refresh in a number of years within this category. This product offers superior wet braking, snow handling, and mileage performance compared to its predecessor and our customers are waiting for it. The KMAX Gen-2 aimed at the regional haul service segment delivers enhanced all weather capability and trade robustness compared to its predecessor.","And lastly, the FuelMax Gen-2 is tuned for long haul service providers and offers superior all weather capability, noise reduction, and mileage potential versus the earlier generation. Each of these new product launches represent the power of our market-backed approach to product design and innovation. I am really excited about the prospects for each of these lines as we move throughout 2019 into 2020. Our product line is second to none. In addition to our industry leadership in products, which is the foundation of what we do, our progress in the area of emerging mobility continued in the quarter.","Turning to slide nine, I would like to spotlight our latest mobility partnerships. We expanded our portfolio of mobility and technology partners to include Envoy Technologies, Local Motors, and YourMechanic. Envoy Technologies provide turnkey easy car-sharing solutions that allow real estate owners and operators to offer mobility as an amenity.","Goodyear's proprietary predictive tire-servicing solution will enable Envoy's fleet managers to efficiently manage the service needs of the company's vehicles with the aim of minimizing the operational downtime of the fleet and maximizing the user experience. Local Motors is a ground mobility company focused on shaping the future for the better through open collaboration and co-creation. Goodyear has teamed with Local Motors to conduct tire testing with Olli, an eight-passenger Autonomous Shuttle. Local Motors also selected Goodyear tires for exclusive fitment on its Olli vehicles.","Expanding our fleet of test vehicles will allow us to continue advancing our knowledge of the best strategies and formats for transferring advanced vehicle and ride sharing data into value-added information to improve operating performance and benefit customers.","Tire innovation is at our core but these partnerships are demonstrating the increasing importance of data and fleet management as a service in solving our customer's problems better than anyone else. Another partner, YourMechanic offers mobile repair maintenance, inspection, and reconditioning services directly to millions of consumers and fleets across North America. The company added Goodyear.com to its platform for tire sales and services.","YourMechanic will further enhance Goodyear's Global Innovation Network that includes numerous customers, suppliers, and independent startup businesses, all in the name of making the tire buying process easier. These initiatives provide us with valuable opportunities to continue learning and innovating. The collective insights that we gain from our mobility partnerships, when combined with our remarkable set of core assets will ensure that Goodyear has a seat at the table to shape the mobility revolution as it unfolds.","Finally, selling tires online with our line partner dealers continues to unfold and grow. New technologies and changing consumer and customer needs are reshaping how tires are bought and sold. This dynamic is not only here to stay, but it's a trend that we think will only accelerate going forward as consumers increase their knowledge and comfort of buying tires online and having them installed at trusted partners like Goodyear.","Our B2C e-commerce site, TireHub, Goodyear mobile install and roll by Goodyear are examples of our response to changing consumer behavior as it relates to the tire buying process. In 2015, we were the first tire manufacturer to move online with the launch of our e-commerce platform goodyear.com. In June, we will launch our commercial e-commerce pilot marking another first for our company and industry. This new platform provides us with an opportunity to better meet the changing needs of commercial truck fleets and owner operators and increase the business and online competitiveness of Goodyear's commercial tire dealers. There has been a pull from the market for this platform, and we're pleased to initiate it with our partner dealers.","Each of these mobility partnerships as well as the upcoming launch of our commercial e-commerce pilot were made possible because our connected business model was able to provide an attractive solution to an unmet need or unresolved problem. This is the beauty of what we have with the connected business model. Nobody in the U.S. can do what we do. Nobody has all the required elements, our number one brand, our strong position in the market, the right fitments with original equipment manufacturers.","Our outstanding product portfolio, our unmatched align distribution, including TireHub and our third-party retail and wholesale distribution, and our industry leading e-commerce platform. And nobody has the ability to connect them the way we do. This is what creates competitive advantage in the marketplace. This is why OEMs, dealers, distributors, and consumers want to do business with us now and will continue to do business with us as the mobility revolution unfolds.","We can deliver them something that they can't get anywhere else. This is what allows us to separate ourselves in those segments of the market where we want to play and win. As we continue to strengthening our connected business model, I am confident we will be positioned to deliver results that meet and exceed our previous peak performance through the cycle. Now, I'll turn the call over to Darren.","Darren Wells","Thank you, Rich, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my remarks with a couple of reflections on the quarter. First, I think you'll find that the factors that shaped our first quarter performance, which are largely consistent with the drivers we discussed as part of our year-end conference call. We did see a couple of slight shifts as the U.S. replacement industry was stronger than we had planned, and the replacement industry in Europe was weaker.","Second, I'd say that overall, nothing we've seen during the first quarter has fundamentally changed the way we're thinking about full year 2019. Having said that, we continue to take action to build our long-term fundamentals, including the modernization and restructuring plans we've announced in Germany, which we expect to benefit our earnings next year.","Turning to slide 12, our first quarter sales were $3.6 billion down 6% from last year, reflecting the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation and lower volume, partially offset by improvements in price mix, unit volume contracted 3%, driven by an 8% decline in consumer Olli shipments. The global consumer Olli environment continued to be challenging during the quarter, particularly in our Asia Pacific region due to weak demand in China and India.","Light vehicle production also declined in Europe and the Americas. Replacement shipments were relatively stable, with weakness in EMEA and Asia Pacific, largely offset by growth in the Americas. Asia Pacific performance was driven by weak consumer replacement shipments in China. European consumer replacement demand was also soft, driven by difficult winter tire comparisons and a slow start to the summer selling season. Robust growth in the U.S. consumer replacement market drove the increase in the Americas.","Segment operating income for the quarter was $190 million, down about $90 million from a year ago and slightly better than we expected, primarily reflecting improvements in cost performance. Our results were influenced by certain significant items, most notably charges relating to the restructuring plan we announced in Germany. Adjusting to these items, earnings per share on a diluted basis was $0.19.","The step chart on slide 13 summarizes the change in segment operating income versus last year. The impact of lower volume was largely offset by improved overhead absorption from increased production in Q4. In the Americas, and Europe, Middle East Africa. Raw material costs increased $137 million reflecting higher commodity prices, transactional currency headwinds, and an increase in non-feedstock costs related to stricter enforcement of environmental regulations in China. We delivered $42 million of price mix improvements, as we benefited from our recent pricing actions and improving supply in the Americas.","Cost savings of $55 million more than offset $45 million of inflation. Inflationary headwinds were the strongest in EMEA, particularly in emerging markets there. The negative effects of foreign currency translation totaled $14 million. The other category includes benefits from lower advertising expense, and reduce startup costs at our new America's plan, which were partially offset by weaker results from other tire related businesses, including U.S. chemical operations.","Turning to the balance sheet on slide 14, net debt totaled $5.6 billion up from $5 billion a year-end, primarily reflecting the seasonal build of working capital. As a side note, in January, we adopted the new lease accounting standard, which requires substantially all leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. To this end, we recognize liabilities reflecting our operating lease obligations, and corresponding assets to account for the right of use of the underlying assets. This change does not have a significant impact on our net income, cash flow or book equity. Our liquidity profile remains strong, with approximately 3.5 billion in cash and available credit at the end of the quarter.","In March, we refinanced our principal revolving credit facility in Europe, extending its maturity to 2024. Given the favorable loan market conditions, we increased the size of the facility by \u20ac250 million and reduce the margin by 25 basis points. With this refinancing complete, we have no significant maturities until 2021.","Slide 15 summaries our cash flows. Net Cash used by operating activities was $364 million, which is in line with last year's first quarter usage, as lower restructuring payments help to offset lower earnings and higher working capital.","Turning to our segment results on slide 16, America's volume of $16.7 million units was stable versus 2018. Replacement shipments were very strong in the U.S. and Canada. This growth offset declines in our U.S. consumer Olli business and in several countries in Latin America that continue to experience economic volatility, including Brazil.","Segment operating income was $89 million down $38 million from last year. The decline was driven by increased raw material costs, reduced earnings from third-party chemical sales and unfavorable foreign currency translation. These factors were partially offset by better price mix, improved overhead absorption and lower startup costs associated with our new America's plan.","Last quarter, we reported supply constraints affecting our results in the Americas. These constraints were driven by a combination of stronger than expected demand trends in the second and third quarters of 2018 which reduced our safety stocks as well as lower production resulting from increasing manufacturing complexities and poor performance in a couple of our U.S. factories. Although we have more work to do, we've made progress on supply in the first quarter and we were able to reduce our order backlog.","Turning to slide 17, Europe, Middle East and Africa's unit sales totaled $14.4 million down about 2.5% from the prior year. The volume decline primarily reflects weakness in the consumer replacement business as shipments fell 4% driven by decreases in less than 17 interim sizes. Consumer OE shipments decreased 1%, these declines in the consumer business more than offset strength in the commercial shipments.","EMEA's strong commercial truck business reflects the benefits of favorable freight trends and the momentum of our fleet services offering. Segment operating income for EMEA was $54 million, a $24 million decrease from last year. The decline was mainly due to higher raw material costs inflation including higher transportation costs and lower volume partially offset by improvements in price mix.","Turning to slide 18, Asia-Pacific volume declined 9% to 6.9 million units reflecting the challenging industry environment in China where our combined consumer OEM replacement volume declined over 15%. Weak consumer OE volume in India was offset by double-digit increase in consumer replacement shipments there.","Segment operating income was $47 million, a $29 million decrease from last year. The decline was driven by higher raw material costs, lower volume in China and lower fixed costs absorption. These factors were partially offset by the benefit of cost controls on SAG. Despite the challenging external environment, we continue to build the strong foundation for long-term growth in the Asia-Pacific region including expanding our retail network and building our OE pipeline both of which will help us drive demand in the key growth markets of China and India as markets recover.","Turning to slide 19, we've reiterated the positives and negatives affecting our results in 2019. Both sides of the ledger remain as we showed them in February, we continue to expect raw material cost pressures of approximately $300 million for the year based on forecasted rates including an $80 million headwind in the second quarter. I will point out however that our OE volume outlook while still negative has improved slightly trending toward the more favorable end of the range.","On slide 20, we show the puts and takes for the second quarter for each of our regions. The Americas will continue to be challenged by higher raw material costs and weaker results in our other tire related business primarily our U.S. chemical operations given low butadiene prices. Improved overhead absorption is expected to offer a partial offset due to higher production volume in Q1. Once again EMEA's results will be influenced by weaker currency and higher inflation including increases in energy and transportation rates as well as general cost pressures in emerging markets.","EMEA's volume is also expected to decline principally due to lower consumer OE shipments resulting from strategic choices we made in previous years. Similar to the trends during the first quarter, Asia-Pacific's performance will be shaped by higher raw material costs and the impacts of weaker volume in China including higher unobserved overhead due to lower production levels in the first quarter.","On slide 22, we provide an updated industry outlook for the U.S. and Western Europe. We've adjusted our expectations for the U.S. commercial replacement industry to reflect the sharp decline in commercial tire imports during the first quarter. This volatility affects the reported commercial replacement sell in figures but is not a reflection of sell through trends in the market which remain constructive. We also increased our expectations for commercial OE industry shipments in Western Europe to reflect healthy truck production there.","We list other key financial assumptions for 2019 on slide 23. We increased our forecast for interest expense to approximately $350 million from the prior range of $325 million to $350 million as we've seen increases in certain emerging market interest rates. The other estimates are unchanged from the view we presented in February. The last point, I want to cover is the factory restructurings announced in Europe, which lay the path for a significant improvement in our results in EMEA. These plants pair our modernization investments with cost reductions in our Hanau and Fulda plants in Germany.","The equipment upgrades will take place over a period of approximately three years and require capital investments of approximately $120 million. And cash restructuring will total about a $125 million. The benefit of reduced headcount will ultimately improve segment operating income by $60 million to $70 million on an annualized basis. And the investment will enable improved margins as we shift 2.5 million units from less than 17 inch to 17 inch or greater in rim diameter. The plant is expected to be completed by the end of 2022. As is the case with these projects, our focus continues to be on the steps we can take to improve our momentum. And we remain confident our actions will not only support earnings recovery in the near-term but also enable new highs over the coming years.","Now, we will open up the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Today's first question will from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Rich Kramer","Good morning, Rod.","Rod Lache","Good morning, everybody. Guess my main question is just hoping you could just characterize pricing conditions in North America and wanted to ask you whether you think it's time to re-examine pricing just given the recent raw material price increases plus the fact that you really haven't fully recovered everything that you lost in terms of the spread over the past two years?","Darren Wells","Yes. So, Rod, it is an ongoing matter for us to look at what we need to do in order to recover the lost margins that we have experienced from the increased raw material costs over the last couple of years, and it is something we are confident we will be able to do over time. I think if we look at where we were in the first quarter, we were able to -- we achieved price mix of $42 million which compares to $35 million in Q4, and negative numbers for several quarters before that. So, I think we feel like we are making progress. In particular, it was good for us to see price mix in the Americas turn positive after having slightly negative in Q4. So, in the Americas, we've got good momentum on price, and we've got mix improving as we enter Q2. And this is at the same time when raw material -- year-over-year raw material cost increases are getting a little more moderate.","So, that's a good combination. I mean that's how we feel about the Americas. And just to hit on Europe and Asia-Pacific, I think where we have good momentum on pricing in the America, not as clear in EMEA and Asia-Pacific as price mix in Q1 for both of them was a little lower than Q4. So, there is some seasonality in it for the EMEA business. But I think it's fair to say the momentum there is not as good as it in the Americas. But overall, I think I mean we feel like we are making progress. We are still working towards that crossover point where we can start to recover the loss margins that we have experienced from rising raw materials. I didn't include the cyclical price versus raw materials chart in today's deck. It hasn't really changed very much as you can -- as you might imagine. But we will come back to that later in the year to do a progress check and to talk some more about that. But, that's obviously an ongoing point of focus for us.","Rod Lache","Well, maybe I could just ask this a little bit differently. What would be the key metrics or indicators that you would analyze to determine that the time is right to implement additional pricing?","Rich Kramer","Rod, I don't think -- I will jump in, I don't think they are a lot different than what we've done in the past. It's a combination of where our input -- the change in our input cost and we go as well as other market conditions that are relevant to each of the particular areas that we deal with. So, I don't think the things that we look at are going to -- going to be any different. It's going to be the environment, and it's also going to be \u2013 we\u2019ve said this consistently in the past and we believe this, and Darren just said it again that we believe we can recover over time not just on market conditions and input costs but also the value we are putting out in the marketplace, whether it's in new products that we put out and we highlighted again where our product portfolio is. That's an opportunity for us to continue to go back and look at what we can offer in the marketplace and the price at which we're offering it, so we look at our portfolio, we look at the services we're providing, and we look at the value we're bringing around all the programs, whether it be advertising, whether it be some of the distribution programs we have, whether it be some of the new products, all those type of things that we bring to market are all things that go into the mix of what we do.","Rod Lache","Okay. And just lastly, could you just remind us in North America, how big is your truck and bus radial tire business, and has there been any benefit to you since the U.S. obviously implemented some pretty significant tariffs starting February 15?","Rich Kramer","And so, Rod, when you're asking about the commercial truck tire business, you're just asking for the relative size of the business?","Rod Lache","Right, the size to you within the North America business and obviously it's a lot of tires imported from China in that segment, maybe it's more lower end, but I think the tariffs are like 40% or something like that on those imports. Is that something that you're seeing as a positive as a domestic manufacturer?","Rich Kramer","Yes, you\u2019re really just trying to get -- you're trying to get the tariff impact more than anything else Rod that's kind of where you're going with it.","Rod Lache","Well, presumably not much direct tariff impact for you but may be indirect.","Rich Kramer","Right, yes, so, Rod, I think the size of the business just use the overall size we use in North America for the total businesses relative to North America, as well as we look at it, so and I think you're right, I mean I'll kind of I'll jump to the end and maybe add a little bit more color, but our focus is typically on the OEs and the fleets, and that's between our product and product performance as well as our fleet solutions and proactive solutions, our brand technology and those type of things is what drives our business as opposed to the low end. But as we look at it, there is now, as you know a 4% standard tariff in place as we look at it, then there is a 10% section if I get a little technical, section 301 tariff that went into effect in the middle of 2018 and the increase to 25%, as you may remember was supposed to occur at the start of the year that's been delayed.","And then also, there was the ITC announcing anti-dumping and countervailing duties that went into effect in mid-February. And those amounts can differ by company, as you probably know, but the combined sort of effective rate for most manufacturers, call it, between 42% to 45% and those rates that are applied to the import price of those tires coming in. So as an example, a standard sort of commercial truck tire coming in from China on average is about import value by 120 bucks, so the importer of record would need to pay approximately an incremental call 70 bucks to cover all the duties. So that's sort of how to think about the tariffs coming into remember for us, nearly all our commercial truck tires that we sell in the U.S. are made in the U.S. and they're made to support that business model that we spoke of, so clearly has an impact there and made reference to that in his formal remarks about what it does to the industry, but our focus is going to continue to remain on where we add value to our customers in the OEs in the fleets.","Rod Lache","Okay, great. So, it sounds like you're seeing some benefit, I guess, in a nutshell, just given what's happening competitively there.","Rich Kramer","Yes, I think we're at point where the -- it's an industry that is in good shape and we've got a very competitive offering. So I think commercial structure -- truck business a strength for us right now.","Rod Lache","Okay, thank you.","Rich Kramer","Thanks, Rod.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Healy with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.","John Healy","Hi, thank you.","Rich Kramer","Good morning, John.","John Healy","Good morning, guys, wanted to ask a big picture question, when I think about everything that's going on. Operationally, I feel like there's 2 sides of the coin, you've got the U.S. business where you've made some pretty significant moves in terms of changing distribution and exciting launch in June with the e-commerce . On the commercial truck side and then if you go over to Europe and it seems like you guys are really digging in, on the operations in terms of being effective with your production -- and production capabilities. As you look at those two things, do you see things in Europe that you can bring to the U.S., maybe in 2020 on the production side and then do you see things in the U.S. on the distribution side, so that you can take the year up in 2020. And I guess the way I'm asking is, at some point over the next few years do you see yourself pivoting where you take the lessons learned and trying to implement those across back and forth and in the business look like in the U.S., what you're building that be the model in Europe and then vice versa on the production side.","Rich Kramer","Yes. So, John, I think it's reasonable to look at what we've done in terms of distribution in the U.S. and think that is going to be instructive for the way we want to improve approach aligned distribution in other parts of the world. And we - we are - and we are thinking about what it takes to establish that level of alignment in other markets where we operate. So I think it's fair. Those are changes that take place - tend to take place over extended periods of time. So your specific question was about 2020, the work that we've done in distribution in North America has taken place over many years. So there was no -- TireHub was a significant event, but there was a lot of work done over a long period of time that led up to that.","So I think directionally we are looking to develop that level of alignment in other markets, but those changes take some time to accomplish. In terms of production, certainly our European factories have had a longer have -- had a lot of experience with high levels of product complexity and skew proliferation. So I think inevitably, there are some lessons that can be shared. And I think we look at our manufacturing programs on a global basis. So our plant optimization program, including the efforts that we're undergoing to address any sort of constraints that we have on producing the type and variety of skews that we're now being asked to produce. Those are the learnings that we share globally. And to the extent we have factories that have greater levels of experience then we're going to leverage those learnings over share those around as well. So I think both the points you make a relevant points.","John Healy","Okay, fair enough. And then wanted to ask on about one of the comments in the slides I jumped out of me as you guys kind of building a strong OE pipeline for 2020 and beyond. Can you maybe talk to that's U.S., that's Europe, is it new partners maybe potentially how meaningful that can be relative to the performance we've seen in '18 and then the start '19.","Rich Kramer","Yes, I think John, how I would look at it is really on the continuum, and you've heard us talk about this in the past is having a selectivity strategy where we've been very thoughtful about the portfolio and where it was and where we wanted to take it. And I would tell you to think of what we're doing now is very much in line with that we have been -- we've been on that journey and will be, will continue to be on it to make sure we're getting on the right fitments and have the right people with the right partners going forward. And what you've seen is certainly a lot of decisions to move away from products and replacement pull that wasn't there to improve our business and to be able to get our cost structure in line to do that. As we look ahead, I would say that this is not region specific, I think it's company-specific.","I'm very pleased with the OE fitments in the win rates that we're having in the Americas, including Latin America in Europe as well as in Asia, and Asian particularly both China and India where we're having a very successful win rates and getting on the segments we want and that means not only a particular country platforms but global platforms. And it means AV's and it means a lot of unique tires and characteristics that those manufacturers want not for the vehicles that we're seeing on the road today but as they're thinking about where those platforms are going forward. So we are having -- I'm very pleased with the success, we're having on win rates and I'm even more pleased with the partnerships that we're having with those individual OEMs to work together on bringing those vehicles to market.","Darren Wells","So if -- John, if I could just add one thing because again you you're focused on the year that the benefits might begin. I do -- we did -- we had a question on the year-end conference call when we were talking about the 2 to 3 million units of OE volume that we expected to reduce this year, because of solar selections that we had made in our portfolio. And there have been a question about whether or not that we lost OE volume was going to be something that would go on for several years. And I think we want to keep making the point that while we're our OE volume is expected to decline this year and now probably closer to 2 million and 3 million units. We've won fitments that's going to start to bring that volume back and in a significant way beginning in 2020. So we don't see that OE decline in terms of our fitments as a long-term thing. It really is -- it's principally a 2019 thing will recover thereafter.","Rich Kramer","That's good point there. And our pipeline to get those tires out as full right now. So we're feeling good.","John Healy","Great, thank you, guys.","Rich Kramer","Yes.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Ryan Brinkman","Thanks for taking my question. Hi.","Rich Kramer","Sure.","Ryan Brinkman","Regarding the German plant modernization and restructuring program, should we think about this more as an LVAD to HVAC type conversion that is aimed at density mix or is it more of a cost reduction action? And what are your latest thoughts generally on cost saves versus general inflation. I think there has been some anticipation you might be set to pull additional levers to try to ramp cost savings back up to the level of recent years, where are you in that process is Germany part of it and when might we expect to learn more.","Rich Kramer","Okay. So, Ryan, let me -- I'm going to ask, answer your last question first. And regarding cost savings versus inflation and the -- I think we were pleased to see that in the first quarter, we were -- we had cost savings that exceeded inflation by 10 million and that was after a 4th quarter where if we exclude the one-time settlement we had on Brazil VAT, which was a benefit in call -- in terms of cost savings in the fourth quarter if we exclude that fourth quarter inflation and savings were about equal.","Now in the first quarter, we've gotten some net savings, which I think we pleased about it was part of what our delivered earnings a little bit better than we might have been expecting in Q1. The cost inflation issue though is still very much in front of us. So our cost savings programs are going to have to ramp up. We've kept a lot of attention in that area, but inflation is continuing to build. I think particularly in EMEA, particularly in emerging markets, we're feeling that. And it's going to be a struggle for us this year to deliver net savings, I mean that's kind of -- that's where we've been, hasn't really changed. We're one quarter end and we delivered a little bit more than we had originally expected. I think that's good.","We're going to stay focused, there is no question, but not - not at the level of net savings where we, that we really like to see if I come back to the German restructuring. I think the way you phrased your question is right on the mark, because you are separating the two different aspects of this project. And there are two aspects because first we are reducing some high cost capacity that's no longer capable of producing tires that are in highest demand and that's the element of it, you would think of as a restructuring and rather than taking, we are reducing capacity by between the two factories, we are in fact reducing high cost capacity, by the equivalent of about one factory.","So, it's half of each of two factories, but we're kind of taking out that level of high cost capacity. And then second, there is an investment in new equipment that's going to allow us to produce 2.5 million units of additional high value-added tires or 17 inch and above rim diameter tires. And that is similar to some other upgrade projects and expansion projects that we've done. So I think that's really the way I think about it is we're going to take out a significant cost a part of the high-cost footprint that's no longer capable and then we're going to add that 2.5 million units as a CapEx project and we're going to get benefits from each one of those.","The strict benefit from the restructuring from the approximately 1100 headcount reduction is the 60 million to 70 million, so we're going to get that benefit will get that over time. So over the next three years and then there will be the additional benefit, which is the added margin on the $2.5 million incremental high value units. So that's a mix up benefit that we're going to get over about that same timeframe. Now there're about 120 million of capital expenditures that go into that, so we've got $125 million of cash restructuring, $120 million of CapEx and what we get from that is $60 million to $70 million of cost savings plus the added margin on those $2.5 million of high value added tires.","Ryan Brinkman","I see, thanks for all that great color. And then just lastly from me, I think it's encouraging that you are gaining share in the U.S. consumer replacement market including after the price increases in the back half of 2018. Maybe you can talk about the role that TireHub if any may have played in improving share. I'm curious to know also though if you think that you took as much price in the back half of 2018 as did your average competitor or if maybe you elected to invest in a little bit more competitive price point to try to recover some of that share that was lost when maybe you were in retrospect being to the third of in raising price in 2017?","Rich Kramer","Yes, I mean I'll jump in. I would say our value proposition in the fourth quarter was what I thought, what we thought was appropriate for the markets at the time. So I think I would, I leave it at that in terms of how we went to market. We were very pleased in the fourth quarter coming out of the fourth quarter in terms of how we were set up in the market. And I think you saw that come into Q1. I think you rightly pointed out, we were I think as Darren mentioned in his remarks, we were 6% up in the quarter in the U.S. market. I think that's reflective of that value proposition, I talked about great products in the marketplace, new products in the marketplace and a strong demand out there.","And as we look at it from a overall, we saw market prices sort of trending higher in the quarter, year-over-year and sequentially and again as you said our revenue for Tire was up, our volume was up, our market share was up and that comes off of the situations that we had in 2017 as well as 2018 with TireHub. So I'm very pleased with the way that we've worked through that. And I might add that we don't see any sort of a broad evidence that any inventory is really building up in the channel remember sell outs been good, vehicle miles traveled is good, consumer confidence is good.","So the industry is pretty good and from our perspective, our inventories are certainly in relatively good shape at both the wholesale and retail level. So we feel pretty good about that. And in terms of TireHub, TireHub is doing what we intended to do right. This is we started at last year, we did that as part of our initiative overall to drive our line distribution with our line partners to support our delivery of tires in the marketplace to support the initiatives that we're putting out there. It's doing just that. We exceeded our transition plans last year. Yes we've had some bumps in the road but we continue to build momentum. We haven't lost the customer and we're executing against those customer deliveries. So, and as I mentioned, inventories are in good shape and we're actually operating with less inventory than our previous national distributor had. And we're doing that getting better visibility into the demand trends and consumer preferences that are out there. So I think I wouldn't attribute everything to certainly the TireHub based on our first quarter volume, I think that's a lot of things but TireHub certainly is doing what we intended it to do.","Darren Wells","The only thing I'd add to that Rich is the hold. There was certainly an effort early in 2018 to go back and get the volume and the market share that we had lost in 2017 when our pricing got out of phase with the rest of the industry. So I think that happened. But if I look at the fourth quarter and the first quarter, I would say that our pricing momentum there was strong and I think and we talked about this at the fourth quarter call, we had good pricing momentum in the Americas but we had negative mix, some of that related to the supply situation. There is still a bit of a bit of that in the first quarter. Right, so we're still looking to get to the point where we start to get some benefit from mix because the last couple of quarters mix in fact has been a bit of a drag and is hiding some of the benefits of the pricing that we've got.","Rich Kramer","And Darren, that's a great point and maybe I'd add one final comment is just to say we put TireHub, we started TireHub sort of the middle of 2018, a big decision for us to do particularly coming off of 2017 as we described and you're seeing that momentum now come back into 2019. I'd say it's just a view that we do that strategy, we have long-term is something we're committed to and we're executing against.","Ryan Brinkman","Very helpful, thank you.","Operator","We'll take the next question from Armintas Sinkevicius with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Armintas Sinkevicius","Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Question on raw materials, last quarter, you said that, the guidance was for $300 million of a headwind in '19 versus '18 based on forecasted rates, but it would be $150 million of a headwind based on spot rates. It looks like raw materials have been holding in fairly well, since then, but the raw materials guidance is still at minus $300 million. So just wondering about the puts and takes anything we might be missing there.","Rich Kramer","Sure","Armintas Sinkevicius","As to why we're not seeing a tailwind to raw materials versus prior commentary?","Rich Kramer","Good question. And as you point out, our forecast has not changed. And when we did our call in February, spot prices at that point would have implied if they stay where it was would have implied $150 million less cost than we were forecasting. As we expected, these feedstock costs have actually risen over the last 60 days. And that is true in natural rubber. Certainly, it's true in carbon black. Obviously, a little bit of the effect of oil prices rising over that period of time. At today's commodity and prices and also taking into account some further strengthening of the U.S. dollar. What today's spot prices would imply is about $50 million below the $300 million forecasts that we have. So the picture at spot price has gotten $100 billion worse than it was 60 days ago.","So I guess we're still at the point where we believe the $300 million cost increase is the right assumption for the year because we're still expecting that, yes, still expecting a little bit further increase, it's embedded in our forecast. If it doesn't happen, obviously that $50 million of good news would still be there. But, I think we're feeling like we've done the right thing, given that we've seen what we were expecting to see.","Armintas Sinkevicius","Okay, I appreciate it. Thank you for the clarification.","Rich Kramer","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","David Tamberrino","Great.","Darren Wells","Good morning, David.","David Tamberrino","Good morning, guys. Two questions for you. Just the back and forth a couple of questions, does it sound like or what I'm hearing, there's potentially less pricing action on the horizon, or are we in a wait and see mode, given how the market shaping up from a OE consumer replacement demand and supply in the market?","Darren Wells","Yes, so I think that what we're seeing right now is, in terms of price mix is good -- is really good momentum in the Americas. So I think has the right direction there. A little bit more of a mix picture in Europe, so in Europe we've seen for the summer season, we've seen some manufacturers raise price, we've seen other manufacturers' lower price, so kind of a mixed situation there. And obviously the situation in China is, as that improves, it may change, but right now very weak markets there. And that's having an impact. So I do think there are some regional differences there with the North American market probably being in the best position. So but I don't know, I think our intentions are to recover the cost of raws over time. And we've got ways to go before we achieve that. So it's a constant area focus for us.","David Tamberrino","Okay. And then my second one, which I feel like is probably the key question for you for this year, because, if I'm not mistaken, your guide or your directional commentary was for SOI to be down slightly, somewhat from 18 to 19 and I look at the free cash flow TTM, look at where you're at, for 2018 just trying to get a sense of if you think, staring that 2019, you're going to be able to achieve a positive free cash flow. And if not, just let me just assume you'll continue to fund the dividend from the bounce.","Darren Wells","Okay. I know it's up. So, David, I think that I continue to be comfortable that the level of earnings that we're running today, that we're in a position to fund, the investments we're making in the business, which are principally some restructuring in our CapEx plan and cover the dividend without increasing our leverage. And that's the balance that we are focused on. We are clearly focused on protecting the balance sheet. And we so we've taken actions to make sure that we're doing that, our leverage ratios are up and that is to some degree cyclical and related to where our earnings are. But we're very focused on making sure that we're not increasing our debt levels.","So, we've taken some discrete actions there, including discontinuing the share repurchases but we're also taking operational actions, including a lot of focus on working capital to look at opportunities to improve our balance sheet and then obviously is the cycle turns in earnings and cash flow improve. We'll be looking to take advantage of that to further improve the balance sheet.","David Tamberrino","Understood, but for this year, I mean, are you expecting positive free cash flow, OCF less CapEx?","Darren Wells","Yes, so I think we're uncomfortable that we're being able to cover our dividend payment, if that's the question.","David Tamberrino","With respect to Part A of the question, just wanted to get your sense, but okay. Thank you very much.","Darren Wells","Sure.","Operator","We'll take our final question today from Anthony Deem with Longbow. Please go ahead.","Darren Wells","Hi, Anthony.","Anthony Deem","Thanks for taking my questions. First one, fixed costs absorption, so $18 million positive in the quarter. You know, you've had lower volumes the past couple of quarters. So I'm just wondering is TireHub product original mix, maybe the Americas plant is having a meaningfully positive impact on your overhead absorption. And certainly, next quarter it looks like you're guiding to a positive outcome in the Americas segment. But you seem flattered down going the past couple of quarters. So just wonder if you could share anything potentially abnormal going on this line?","Darren Wells","And that's specific to overhead absorption?","Anthony Deem","Yes. Yes.","Darren Wells","Okay. So I think we -- it's a good question, because we do have in an environment where our volume has been down. We've got favorable overhead absorption, which I think is it makes it a very natural question or I think those we look at a lot of the volume decline has been Asia Pacific, and our production, the reduced production has principally been in Asia Pacific. And that's our overhead for tire is the lowest there. So we've had our hot, our production has been actually up in the Americas in EMEA notwithstanding the volume, and part of that's been trying to catch up with our supply situation in the Americas. And it's been up and it's been up the most in commercial truck. So it's been up in some areas that have the highest overhead absorption. So there's a bit of a mix among geographies, that's benefiting us there. The -- so I think that is, that's really what you're seeing. And I think we'll continue to see a bit of that. So that is, if that's the question, you asked the question also about the increased production in our new America's factory, and obviously, we're getting some benefit as that ramps up as well.","Anthony Deem","Okay, that's helpful. Thanks for the color, and so on the supply constraints update. So, it looks like you did 12% HVA growth in the U.S. this past quarter. And you took some share. So, I guess the question we're wondering is what could those numbers be without some of the supply constraints? Are you able to put a value or unit number towards that?","Darren Wells","Yes. So I think two benefits that we would get, if we were able to supply better. Certainly, we would have opportunity for those numbers to be higher, because we're not supplying all the high value tires that we would be able to supply. And to be clear, that's true in the consumer business. also true in the commercial truck business. And the 12%, you're referring to that's only consumer business point. But the same effect is true in the commercial truck business. So you would see that the other thing that it would help us with is it would help us supply all of our customers, where we do have some customers who have first claim on supply. And obviously, the OEs are the clearest example of that, but we have replacement customers who also have sort of a first call on our supply, and they're not always our highest margin customers. And that's been one of the challenges we have in achieving mix, is that we are selling more tires to some of our lower margin customers. And we've been able to supply some of our higher margin customers better if we can get supply situations a better spot.","Anthony Deem","I can fit in one more question here. So advertising R&D, sort of the other category and so I walk net benefit in the quarter, it looked like so, is it fair to assume I know you're not giving exclusive guidance, but I'm wondering if it's fair to assume, if these were main tailwinds from end of the year, perhaps this is just a savings lever that Goodyear is pulling? Thank you very much.","Rich Kramer","Yes. So, I think -- you know, the fact that we're very cost-focused I think shouldn't be a surprise. I will say that there are -- you know, when it comes to advertising there are some differences quarter-to-quarter. So I don't know that I would look at first quarter as a clear indicator for where we are going to be in the full-year. The timing of product launches and some of our marketing pushes can change, and if I in fact we start to see some recovery in some of our markets in the second-half, that would have an impact on the investment we'll be making in marketing, advertising, and SAG. So, I guess I don't read too much into one quarter, but I think it is fair to say that we are going to stay very, very focused on cost for the foreseeable future. Yes.","Darren Wells","And all I would add is you know, over time I think we've demonstrated a very good sort of decision-making and timing of CapEx and R&D as we go through the cycle. So, you would expect to do the same. We'll make good decisions, but we are no less committed to -- particularly you mentioned our R&D expense, that remains a priority for us, but I would say we manage it very well in terms of prioritizing and executing our projects, so\u2026","Rich Kramer","And I believe that was the last call. So, I just want to thank everyone for your attention today. Thanks very much.","Operator","And this will conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","I would now like to hand the program over to Christina Zamarro, Goodyear's Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Christina Zamarro - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Thank you, Keith and thank you everyone for joining us for Goodyear's first quarter 2017 earnings call. Joining me today are Rich Kramer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Laura Thompson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, there are a few items we need to cover. To begin, the supporting slide presentation for today's call can be found on our website at investor.goodyear.com, and a replay of this call will be available later today. Replay instructions were included in our earnings release issued earlier this morning.","If I could now draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statement on slide 2, I would like to remind participants on today's call that our presentation includes some forward-looking statements about Goodyear's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments today. The most significant factors that could affect future results are outlined in Goodyear's filings with the SEC and in our earnings release.

Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Thank you, Christina, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. This morning, I will review highlights from our first quarter results and provide an update on the market conditions in each of our regions. Laura will follow with the financial review of each of our businesses and an update to our outlook before we open the call to your questions.","In the first quarter, segment operating income was $385 million, which is in line with our most recent guidance, and a great achievement given the headwinds in the quarter. As we said in February, we expected a decline in unit volume in the first quarter which was driven by our planned exit of some of the smaller rim size tires in EMEA and expectations for reduced OE demand in both the U.S. and China. Since then, volumes have been weaker than expected, especially in replacement and sell-out in the U.S. during the first quarter was softer than anticipated.","In addition, we believe the timing of our price increases which came relatively early in the quarter had a negative effect on our volume. Even amidst these headwinds, we delivered segment operating margin of 10% and adjusted earnings per share of $0.74. These were simply excellent results for our teams who stuck to our strategy in an environment of rising raw material costs. We delivered cost savings, stayed focused on price and mix and did not diminish our value proposition for short-term volume increases. Our balanced plan to create value through sustainable revenue and profit growth is the objective of our strategy roadmap. It provides us with a constancy of purpose and informs the execution of our strategy despite market conditions that could tempt us to do otherwise. We are committed to the strategy roadmap and remain confident that we will continue to execute over the long-term.","Regarding the first quarter, I can't recall a time when it was more critical for us to have the discipline and commitment to the execution of our strategy, and we will need to do more of the same in the second quarter.","The Americas provided an example of this approach in the first quarter as our discipline and commitment to the execution of our strategy was critical. This was particularly true in the U.S. as domestic auto production declined and consumer replacement sell-out trends were somewhat weaker than we expected. Americas total unit volume declined 5%, driven by our U.S. consumer OE business. The Americas consumer OE unit volume declined by 13%, driven in part by lower U.S. auto production during the quarter. In addition, our OE performance this year is related to last year's very strong comparable where we saw first quarter 2016 U.S. consumer OE shipments up 11% while the market was up just 2%.","Overall, our OE volume performance this quarter is generally consistent with what we had expected at the time of our fourth quarter call. For the rest of the year, we continue to expect softness in U.S. OE production, particularly in the second quarter and third quarter.","It's important to keep in mind that the SAAR continues near last year's levels, the auto industry still has favorable macro tailwinds, and mix is shifting in a more favorable direction toward light trucks and SUVs. This mix-up plays to our strengths in OE where we have fitments on popular vehicles such as the Ford F-150 and drives pull-through in the high-margin replacement segment. We're committed to winning in OE, and we'll continue to collaborate with OEMs in ways that both deliver value for them and are consistent with our strategy.","For the company overall, the important takeaways in this quarter is that despite a decline in U.S. auto production, we are delivering on our plan with positive price\/mix versus raw materials performance. That's the strength and the power of the Goodyear brand.","Turning now to the U.S. consumer replacement industry. Sell-in demand remains solid and was up about 1%. We saw a growth in the 17-inch and larger segment of the industry at 8%, which is driving continued mix-up in our business.","Total industry sell-out during the quarter was softer than expected. We believe the weakness in sell-out is related to warmer weather trends in the Northeast and Midwest as well as a delay in tax refunds affecting the U.S. consumer.","You'll also recall that our price increase announced early in the year took effect February 1, which was the first in the U.S. market this year. This timing also played a role in this quarter's volume story, as our Americas consumer replacement volume declined 1%.","We continue to expect moderate U.S. industry growth in replacement in 2017, as many of the key economic indicators continued to be positive. According to the most recent data, U.S. vehicle miles traveled rose 2% in February and gasoline demand rose 1% year-over-year in March. In addition, employment levels and gasoline prices all remain favorable and provide a productive platform for growth throughout the remainder of the year.","Turning now to Brazil. I'm pleased to share that its first quarter was a very strong start to 2017 on all fronts. Brazil showed high-single-digit volume growth in consumer replacement, almost 8% volume growth in our commercial business, and our consumer OE showed slight but positive year-over-year growth for the first time since early 2012.","I'm very pleased with these results, and I'm encouraged that the countries beginning to show tangible signs of climbing out of its two-year recession. And while our business in Brazil is far from its historical earnings level, we're clearly headed in the right direction.","Across our markets in the Americas, our value proposition has allowed us to excel to improve price\/mix, operational excellence initiatives, and a commitment to executing our strategy. Shifting to Europe, our EMEA business unit delivered $98 million in segment operating income during the first quarter, up 23% versus the prior year. EMEA's volume performance in the 17-inch and greater segment of the replacement market outpaced the industry, which grew at 12%. We are executing on our plan to mix-up our product portfolio in EMEA.","Goodyear-branded summer tires, particularly the Goodyear EfficientGrip Performance and the Eagle F1 Asymmetric 3 claimed podium wins in several important magazine tests this year, which led Tyrepress recently naming Goodyear as the overall victor in the 2017 summer tire test season.","In addition, Dunlop presented the new Sport Maxx Race 2 at Geneva International Motor Show in March. This successor to the Sport Maxx Race has been developed together with Porsche to meet the demanding requirements for its new 911 GT3. With the first-generation Sport Maxx Race tires fitted on the previous models of the GT3, Dunlop continues its commitment to provide specialty tires for Porsche vehicles.","As we look ahead, we expect to continue to see declines in the smaller than 17-inch summer segment in EMEA, particularly in the second quarter. We've been strategically reducing our volume in this segment which has been influenced by increased competition, including a significant presence of low-cost imports. This reduction includes the previously announced footprint action in Philippsburg, Germany, which will be completed by the end of this year. Simultaneously, we are realigning our go-to-market model in EMEA, similar to the approach that we successfully implemented in the U.S.","Adjustments to our approach include refining our value proposition by focusing on the growing more profitable segments of the market. Re-energizing our efforts to collaborate with and support our OE partners, introducing new products from the market back, aligning our distribution, taking advantage of the value of the Goodyear brand and adjusting our high cost footprint. These actions are consistent with our strategy, and we are committed to their execution even in the face of inevitable hurdles along the way.","Finally in Asia-Pacific strong volume growth in our consumer replacement business offset weaknesses in consumer OE particularly in China. Similar to the U.S., auto inventories in China were higher during the quarter, which we believe is the result of a slower pace in the first quarter auto sales following a very strong pull ahead of demand in the fourth quarter of 2016.","We are expecting weaker volumes in our OE business throughout the first half as our OE customers who are mainly the large Western JVs adjust production to align this with near-term reduction in their demand. I think it's important to keep in mind that our first-half performance in consumer OE last year was also very strong, up about 20% year-over-year and was fueled by the tailwind from a tax incentives put in place at the end of 2015. We remain pleased with the performance of our OE business and we continue to believe that the auto market in China is healthy. As is the case with the industry overall, the OE segment in China will not grow in a straight line, but will continue to grow as the world's largest new car market for years to come.","Despite the near-term weakness in OE, our China consumer replacement business remained strong. We saw robust double-digit volume growth in the quarter, driven by strong replacement pull through as well as some pre-buy in advance of our price increase there. We continue to expand our retail presence in China and see enormous growth potential in tier 3 and tier 4 cities. These are lesser-known cities, but have populations of more than a million and are continuing to grow.","India also had an outstanding quarter with volume growth in both consumer OE and replacement in mid-single-digit range and one of the final positive notes on Asia-Pacific after several years of malaise, we are beginning to see an increase in demand for OTR tires. Although, off a very low base, the increased level of order activity is encouraging and we continue to remain optimistic about the long-term value proposition of our business in Asia-Pacific.","So, looking back at the quarter, I am satisfied with our results, more importantly, I'm pleased with the way we continue to execute our strategy in both strong markets and challenging ones. Our teams have made the commitment to winning with consumers and helping our customers build their businesses every day, while taking the long view of creating sustainable value.","Our 2017 plan remains on track. We continue to have confidence in our ability to deliver our SOI target of $2 billion this year and we remain committed to our long-term plan of $3 billion in SOI in 2020.","We are confident in our ability to deliver strong results across the entire company, because of our commitment to and execution of our strategy. It's what you've seen from us for several years, we will not chase volume for volume sake, we will compete for profitable growth in market segments with a value of the Goodyear brand, our innovative quality products, our pervasive distribution and service networks, and the best team in the industry provide us with a competitive advantage.","We are achieving real cost reduction, driven by our operational excellence initiatives to enhance the efficiency of our supply chain to help us get the right tire to the right customer, at the right cost. And we're not running our business for one good quarter or one good year, but to create sustainable value for the long term.","Now I'll turn the call over to Laura.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Thank you, Rich and good morning to everyone.","Turning to the income statement on slide 7, our unit volume was down 3.5% year-over-year, driven by declines in consumer OE. Our first quarter sales were $3.7 billion, up slightly from a year ago. Excluding currency, revenue per tire increased 2%. Our first quarter sales also reflect higher pricing in our third-party chemical business. These benefits more than offset the impact of lower tire volume.","Segment operating income was $385 million for the quarter, and our SOI margin was 10.4%. Our first quarter earnings per share on a diluted basis was $0.65, our results were influenced by certain significant items, and after adjusting for these items, our earnings per share was $0.74.","The step chart on slide 8 walks first quarter 2016 segment operating income to the first quarter of 2017. The negative impact of lower volume was $34 million; unabsorbed overhead was $37 million in the quarter. Improved price mix of $47 million more than offset increased raw material cost of $42 million for a net benefit of $5 million, which reflects the positive impact of our announced price increases during the quarter and improved mix. Raw material costs were up 4%, less than the 7% we expected, reflecting higher than planned inventory levels at the end of the quarter.","Cost-saving actions of $71 million, driven by our operational excellence initiatives and efficiencies in SAG, more than offset the $32 million negative impact of inflation, delivering a net benefit of $39 million in the quarter. Foreign currency exchange and other were a combined headwind of $7 million.","Turning to the balance sheet on slide 9, cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were about $1 billion. Total debt and net debt were down slightly from last year's levels. During the quarter, we refinanced our $700 million notes due 2022 with an annualized interest expense savings of approximately $15 million beginning in 2018. The bonds will be redeemed on May 15. The newly issued bonds will be due in 2027.","Free cash flow is shown on slide 10. For the quarter, we used $557 million in free cash flow driven by an increase in working capital of $596 million, which is consistent with the seasonality of the business. Additionally, cash flow from operating activities was a use of $286 million in cash, $86 million less than the prior year.","Turning to slide 11, the Americas reported quarterly segment operating income of $214 million in Q1 or about 11% to sales. This reflects a $46 million decrease versus 2016. Unfavorable factory overhead resulting from 2016 production adjustments and the impact of lower consumer volume were partially offset by cost savings and price mix. Unit sales in the first quarter were 17.2 million tires, down 4.6% versus 2016. The decrease is attributed to reductions in our U.S. and Canada consumer OE business, which was impacted by the timing of certain fitments and overall OEM production reductions.","Consumer replacement volume was down about 1% versus the prior year; however, we continue to see strong growth in HVA tires with a rim diameter of 17-inch or greater, especially those for SUV and light-truck applications. Our commercial OE unit volume was down 5% in the quarter, reflecting a sequential improvement from prior quarters. Commercial replacement volume was also down 5%, which we believe is primarily attributed to the relative timing of our February 1 price increase. Even still, we feel very good about the performance of commercial truck during the quarter and its potential in the second half of the year.","The core business continues to be strong, and we are focused on executing on our plan to realize positive price mix versus raw material performance in the quarters ahead, while continuing to capitalize on favorable industry trends.","Turning to slide 12. Europe, Middle East and Africa generated segment operating income of $98 million in the quarter, up 23% compared to the prior year. The increase in SOI was primarily driven by improved price mix in the consumer replacement business and continued focus on cost savings, which more than offset the impact of lower volumes and currency weakness throughout the region.","Unit volumes were $15.5 million in the first quarter, down 3.8% from the prior year. The volume decline was more than explained by our decision to reduce exposure at the lower end of the market in our summer consumer business, where sales of 16-inch and below rim size products decreased 12% year-over-year. Our 17-inch and greater consumer replacement volume grew 13%.","EMEA's OE unit volume was down 1%, primarily in our consumer business, due to choices we've made to drive our OE selectivity strategy and intensify our focus on the more profitable 17-inch and larger rim size fitments.","Our commercial truck business continues to deliver consistent results, growing market share based on the strength of our premium branded products. Volume at OE grew in the mid-single-digits range and replacement grew about 12%, reflecting pull ahead during the quarter. Our EMEA business delivered solid performance in the first quarter of 2017, and as Rich mentioned, there are many strategic actions underway in this business. We'll continue to keep you updated on our progress as we execute on our longer-term plan in EMEA.","Turning to slide 13, Asia-Pacific delivered first quarter segment operating income of $73 million, a $6 million decrease versus last year. Asia-Pacific's volume was 7.3 million units, flat from the same quarter last year. Demand in consumer replacement tires remained strong with year-over-year growth of 8%. However, it was offset by a decline in OE, primarily in China, as a result of decreased vehicle production versus last year. Net price mix versus raw material costs was positive, despite significantly higher raw material. The year-over-year decline in EBIT was primarily due to increased investments in the business, a decrease in government incentives for the expansion of our factory in China, and unfavorable foreign currency translation.","Our segment operating margin in the region decreased to 14.5% down from 16.2% a year ago. Despite the short-term headwinds from higher raw material costs and fluctuations in the China OE industry, we are confident about the region's growth opportunity.","Turning to slide 14, and as we described on our February call. We continue to expect first half SOI to be down about 10% compared to 2016. Growth will accelerate in the second half of the year, bringing the full year results to approximately $2 billion. Next, I'll cover the changes in our drivers on our outlook on slide 15. We now see full-year volume about flat with 2016, following weaker sellout in the first quarter in the U.S. and revisions to our OE production assumptions in the U.S. and China, particularly in the second quarter.","The volume reduction will generate slightly higher unabsorbed overhead in the second half, as we align production in our factories. The second quarter's unabsorbed overhead should be about what we saw in the first quarter.","Raw material spot rates, particularly natural rubber have eased over the last 60 days. At current spot rates, we expect our full-year raw material headwind to still be significant at about $750 million with the second quarter representing about a 23% increase year-over-year. As a result, our net price mix versus raw material assumption improves to a positive $25 million, which is driven by the impact of moderating raw material costs.","Another change is the decrease in the expected headwind from foreign exchange, which is reduced to $30 million for the year. In total, our SOI outlook remains unchanged at about $2 million for the year. Other financial assumptions are shown on slide 16. The only change on this page is a reduction in corporate other of $20 million, taking our full-year expectation to $140 million.","And finally, we repurchased $25 million worth of stock during the quarter, in line with the level you've seen from us from the same period in prior years. We continue to expect to generate strong free cash flow in 2017, and we'll execute on our capital allocation plan over time and as we generate the cash.","Now we'll open up the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we can take our first question from Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Good morning, Rod.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. A couple of questions, one is just to confirm, you're lowering your raw material cost inflation expectation from $1.1 billion to $750 million, is that correct?","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","That's right, Rod.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","From about 27% to about 19% full-year now.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And can you just talk about what's happening vis-\u00e0-vis pricing, because there is really a lot of confusion about the price increases, but also the promotional activity that we're hearing some of your peers talking about; at a high level, it looks like the companies that implemented price increases lost some share.","And you guys did allude to some \u2013 your perspective weakness in some of the key markets with high inventories in North America, weaker productions and caution on demand in Europe and China. So, what gives you the conviction that the price increases are sticking in that dynamic?","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","So, Rod, a good question. A lot of sort of moving parts in there and I guess the first thing that I would \u2013 I'd comment on because I \u2013 and I said it in my remarks on the call, because I think it's got to be the pillars of what we do and that's to have the discipline to stick to the strategy that we've had around putting a value proposition out in the marketplace. And I know you've heard me say it before and I'll \u2013 I guess I will repeat it again, because it's so important to us.","Our strategy is predicated on a value proposition that goes beyond just recovering our input costs, if you like. We have a value proposition around innovation, around brand, around promotion, around training, service, supply the digital customers we bring, national accounts so on and so forth, that's the competitive advantage that we predicate our strategy on, and that we're driving as we go forward. So this is important for us, particularly as we go through, as I've also said an industry that doesn't necessarily just move sequentially forward. So there is volatility in our industry and we're experiencing some of that right now.","Now, having said that, you know we have a proven track record on being able to offset our raw material costs with price mix. We've done that over time, we've done that time and time again I should say and we've done that over time because there's a lag between when this raw material prices come in and hit our P&L and when we recover them and then we add onto that those customers that are covered from our raw material indexes that have a lag as to when those things cover. So, as we have volatility in raw material prices, it takes us a while to recover those costs as we've often said. But our strategy says that we've got a proven track record to do it, and we're sticking to that with the discipline and as we have and as we will.","You mentioned earlier, the raw material price increase \u2013 the raw material headwind now about $750 million. It's real. Q1, we took $42 million of that, which obviously implies the balance of it comes in over the rest of the year. So we have our announced price increases out there to go cover that, and we're committed to doing that because that cost is very real for us as we move ahead. And as you talk about that, we have announced price increases out there, but we did not implement any incremental rebates out there. In fact, Rod, I would say, the reverse is true given that headwind, the raw material coming in ahead of us and you made reference to our volume numbers as well. Take OE out of that, our volume numbers weren't where we necessarily would've liked them, but at the end of the day we know that we're sticking to our strategy, and that's a bit of an outcome.","So, I would say we certainly didn't put in any rebates in there. Our volume certainly wouldn't indicate that. But having said that, you got to remember we're playing at a higher end of the market. At the low-end of the market, I would tell you the value proposition is different from what I described.","The value proposition at the low-end of the market really is where customers are more price-sensitive, and I think you see a different sort of equation there than you have with us. So, we're sticking to our strategy, we are \u2013 we continually reassess, we're going to move with agility and discipline, and that's how we're going to continue to drive forward, and there are consequences to that in the context of not just going for volume, candidly, if easy, right, but that's not the name of the game over the long-term. Sticking to our megatrends, and we're sticking to where we see this industry going over the long-term and so...","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Certainly.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Go ahead, Rod.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Hopefully that helps.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. It helps, but I guess just at a high level I appreciate what you're saying about Goodyear specific discipline, it sounds like you guys are committed to doing this. Do you sense that there's any change in the competitive dynamic that would make, just broadly, the industry price environment a little bit more challenging or not really?","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","I would say, Rod, overall no, but we also acknowledge you've got a period of raw materials going up and then raw materials coming down. We announced our price increases, we were early in the market to do that, right up front. So you got a lot of moving parts right now, and that's why you can't look at this as sort of a snapshot in the quarter and use it to say that's indicative of everything that's going to happen going forward.","As I said, the raw materials are coming. So, overall, I don't see what you're suggesting, but we \u2013 as you know, we look at this daily around the world to make sure we're sensing what's going on and taking the right steps as we deal with it.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And just lastly, if you can maybe help us. What does the $47 million of price\/mix that you showed in the quarter, what is that actually calibrate to, is that \u2013 should we just interpret that as maybe kind of half quarter of the February 1 price increase that your run rate is like $100 million a quarter, just off of that. So, $400 million for the year and to get the $750 million, you need \u2013 that's why you need the second price increase, but maybe just a little bit more color on that?","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","No. I think, Rod, I wouldn't do sort of an extension of that. I mean, when we look at our price\/mix, and we typically don't break it out, as you know, but I think what that's indicative us \u2013 indicative of is our focus on mixing up our business, taking steps. We haven't talked a lot about EMEA, but in EMEA, we're taking steps to assess our position in that low-end of the market that's highly competitive with a lot of imports and we're continuing to mix that business up as well, and that's how we're thinking about driving price\/mix and particularly mix in our business going forward.","And so, I think that's some of that in the quarter as well, but I don't think that you should do the math as an extension like that to make that assumption.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Thanks, Rod.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Thanks, Rod.","Operator","And we will take our next question from David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Hi, David.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. How are you doing? Congrats on the quarter. Looks pretty good so far. One question for me, as I look at Americas' OE volumes and that negative 12% in the quarter, I might have missed this in the comments when you went through the regions. But is there anything to be concerned of there? I know that there's been, I think, a couple of plants opening up in North America from competitors that were looking to take some OE share. So wondering if that segment is not getting or is getting more competitive or if there is something we should \u2013 something else that maybe is a destock from shipments in the fourth quarter or a loss...","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","...OE changeover\/refreshment if there's \u2013 just kind of talk to those numbers?","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Well. First off, I'd say, our business OE or otherwise has been competitive, is competitive, will always be competitive and that's the environment we're working in and we assume that will continue. But, David, our approach to our OE business has really been strategically focused as well. We don't pursue just volume for volume sake in OE just like we don't in replacement and I would say that that approach has really served us very well and we do that really to find the balance in the partnerships to serve those OEMs to meet their needs and to get on the fitments that we can deliver them the technology they need and try to exceed their expectations. But also then have a business model that has the mix \u2013 the right mix in the pool.","So we can get that first, second, and even third replacement and that strategy has been ultimately working. But as you know, OE productions, the fitments, demands, all that sort of thing changes from time to time and I think we're at one of those points right now. So you can't \u2013 I would suggest you can't take our OE business and again look at the performance in one quarter because it doesn't \u2013 it's not really indicative of what happens, you need to judge us over longer periods of time and I think as one of the charts we included in our material sort of indicates we are really pretty pleased with how our OE business is tracking, particularly in terms of mix with what's going on there. So that's...","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah. Sometimes, there is fitment changes and so on that comes into play \u2013 yeah, absolutely.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah. And in fact, maybe two other quick points \u2013 to Laura's point what we \u2013 when OE production changes happen, which they are, we are impacted maybe a little bit bigger because of that because of our share market with those OEMs. But I'd also point out, as I think many know that the shift is moving from sedans production coming out, retooling to bigger SUV, CUVs and light trucks and I would say that's a trend that bodes well for us. We like that. So we're seeing a little bit of that volatility right now, but I would say that, that's kind of due course and we're going to continue to try to create value for our OEMs and to create value for us going forward.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. But specifically on the quarter, that negative 12% and I might have missed this in your response, but was there anything that we should be circling, is that expected to repeat or is that just a couple of changes from your OE partners and really is more of a blip than a trend that we should be looking at for \u2013 despite a challenging North America production environment?","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","And again, David, I'm sorry, I should have also mentioned. I think you'll see it in the script it's also a comp from last year.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Right.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","We had a \u2013 we outperformed the market significantly last year and you're just seeing that, that sort of rollover right now.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah. I think the first quarter we're up about 11% \u2013 10% or 11% last year. So it's a tough comp, very tough.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Well, that's helpful. And then just following along the same lines as the questions from Rod. You brought down other raw material headwind, you brought up a couple of other positives within the FX, but you held the line on what your guidance is for the year, and I'm curious on that as what you're seeing within the market, why as you got \u2013 arguably plus $400 million or so.","Why you held the line on your $2 billion, and then secondly on the back of that, do you need any further price increases with what we've seen as a whipsaw effect in raw materials that \u2013 as they've been coming down or do you feel good with the two that you have announced so far in the market will be effective enough to offset the headwinds?","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah. So, maybe I'll start, David. I think, first of all, in answer to your first question on the added $25 million, while raws are going down, obviously, several hundred million. Our go-to-market strategy is based on that value proposition and we have shown over time that price equals raws but, right, we still are, it is a competitive market and as you know, markets are efficient, right? So, we just \u2013 it's early in the year, we have a lot of things, timings, different timings out there and moving parts as we go, but that's kind of how we see it at this point, okay?","And really, again, we have two announced price increases out there in the U.S., it is all about the value proposition and recovering as raws go up or down in the marketplace. So, we'll do what we need on that front as we go.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Understood. Thank you very much for the time.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Thanks. David.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Hi, Brett.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Good morning.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Lets' see. Couple questions here. First of all, the original price hike that you guys announced was pretty consistent with what we saw in the industry, but then you made a second price increase and I guess my question is simply, what was the purpose of the second price increase, was it that raws have increased more than you'd expected and therefore you needed some more incremental pricing or can you kind of just give us some understanding of that?","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah. And Brett, you're talking about particularly our North America business...","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Yeah.","Richard J. Kramer - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","...where we made that announcement. I suspect that's what you're ultimately referring to and I just say, I go back to what I said and what Laura said, it's the value of the products that we have. We have our input cost, we have the value proposition we're putting out in the marketplace. We put all that and analyze that together and ultimately that's the conclusion that we came to.","Raw material costs are clearly a part of that as we go. Remember, we started out with the $1 billion \u2013 $1.1 billion, as Rod said, down to $750 million, but we want to point out $750 million is still a 19% year-over-year increase in raw material costs and it's still coming, again not to be repetitive, $42 million in the first quarter. It means the balance is ultimately coming in the remaining three quarters of the year.","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Yeah. The second quarter will, as I said earlier \u2013 but the second quarter has a big hit from raw materials of \u2013 it's like over 20%, 23%, I think, year-over-year.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then switching gears, you maybe indicated this in the press release, or on the call already and I just haven't heard it, but you made some adjustments in your corporate expenses and obviously the full year and the first quarter came in later than we expected. Can you just \u2013 what's driving that?","Laura K. Thompson - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.","Okay, sure. So, no doubt and then maybe I'll talk about the full year as we see it. So it was about $22 million in the quarter. I think, as we go forward, we'd be back on track with something more like closer to $40 million \u2013 $35 million to $40 million kind of Q2 through Q4 each for that $140 million for the year. In the first quarter, it was driven by a lot of moving parts but driven by lower accruals related to incentive comp relative to our 2017 targets.

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to hand the program over the Damon Audia.","Damon J. Audia","Thank you, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Goodyear's second quarter conference call. Joining me today are Rich Kramer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Darren Wells, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, Rich and Darren will provide perspective on our results and outlook for the remainder of the year.","Before we get started, there are few items I need to cover. To begin, the supporting slide presentation for today's call can be found on our website at investor.goodyear.com. A replay of this call will be available later today. Replay instructions were included in our earnings release issued earlier this morning.","If I could now draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Today's presentation includes some forward-looking statements about Goodyear's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments today. The most significant factors that could affect future results are outlined in Goodyear's filings with the SEC and our earnings release. The company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","The financial results are presented on a GAAP basis and in some cases, on non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures discussed on the call are reconciled to U.S. GAAP equivalent as part of the appendix to the slide presentation.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Rich.","Richard J. Kramer","Thank you, Damon, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. This morning, I want to start our call with a comment on our team's outstanding performance over the past 3 months. This performance resulted in the highest second quarter segment operating income in Goodyear's 115-year history. Record second quarter segment operating income in both North America and Asia Pacific, and year-over-year volume growth, which gives us confidence as we go into the second half of the year.","In what remains a tough global economy, our team delivered in the quarter. As I review the performance of each of our businesses this morning, you will see evidence of the disciplined execution of our strategy roadmap. We're delivering market-rack innovation and award-winning products, meeting customer needs and differentiating ourselves from the competition. We're winning in profitable market segments, focusing on the areas that have the potential to deliver the best returns and profitable growth for Goodyear and for our customers.","We're making progress toward our goal of being the best supplier in the industry. We're delivering more value for our customers by driving more efficient and productive operations through our operational excellence initiatives. We're executing on our significant capital investments, driving higher profitability and delivering the returns we targeted. And most importantly, we're executing our plans with strong commitment and alignment by our team.","As pleased as I am with the quarter, you've heard me say many times that we're not running our business for 1 good quarter. Our long-term objective is to achieve sustainable consistent earnings and cash generation, while providing the most innovative products to our customers with increasing efficiency and reliability. Our results are clear validation that our strategy is working. We're making the right decisions in building our businesses and we're seeing consistent, repeatable improvements in our results.","Before going into more detail on the quarter, I'd like to share some observations based on what I heard from our customers during my recent travels to our many markets around the globe. Their candid feedback is always valuable and instructive, and this time was very consistent. I heard repeatedly that the value of the Goodyear brand is as strong as ever and continues to pull customers into their stores.","The Goodyear brand is a differentiator, that's what they tell me. They told me that our products have a value proposition that resonates with consumers. Consumers recognize the value of Goodyear products even as new tire brands enter the market. And in Europe specifically, I heard that our leadership in tire labeling is a competitive advantage and is making a difference at the counter. It's clear that, just as magazine test influences winter tires sales, high-label scores have a positive impact on purchase decisions for summer tires. I also heard from our customers that they want even more of our branded products, making reliable supply a critical factor in their ability to serve their markets. This came through loud and clear as the #1 area of focus. It's an area where we continue to make improvements to deliver the best customer service in the industry.","And in my visits with truck tire customers, I heard specific examples of how our solutions are driving value, as measured by lower cost per mile. These customers praised the performance of our products and our cradle-to-grave service model, which is driving value for them and competitive advantage for us.","Now whenever I travel to visit our customers, I'm reminded that this is where the game is won. This is where our market-rack approach begins in retail stores and fleet service centers, where tires are actually bought and sold. It's the best way to understand what we're doing well and equally, if not more important, what we can do even better. On balance. I'm pleased with what I've heard and I'm energized about the opportunities ahead for Goodyear to win.","Turning to our second quarter results, segment operating income was a record $428 million, the best second quarter performance in the company's history. 3 of our 4 regions showed increased volume, with North America being the outlier. We see volume stabilization as a positive sign, especially in Europe. Combined with the solid execution of our key how-to's and our strategy roadmap, higher volume and the decrease in raw material cost helped us deliver our strong performance in the quarter.","In North America, we delivered a record $204 million in segment operating income by driving our strategic initiatives. Our initiatives around efficiency helped reduce cost and increase cash, while we continue to introduce innovative products. For example, in June, we launched the new Eagle Sport All-Season, a performance tire that is already drawing accolades. One auto magazine said the engineering behind the new Eagle's performance is close to rocket science. While another one called it a potential game changer. Terrific handling and responsive grip in dry, wet and snow, led one reporter to claim that it will \"Likely become the tire of choice for many of us.\" Now those are the kind of reviews we want to see.","We're also excited about the launch of the new Wrangler All-Terrain Adventure with DuPont Kevlar. This tire for light trucks and SUVs delivers great off-road traction and toughness, as well as a quiet ride on the highway. It's another innovative product that renews the long time trust and quality of the Wrangler family of tires.","Clearly, we continue to set the pace for new product introductions in the industry. Another area of strength is our original equipment business, where we increased volumes in the quarter and continue to win fitments on new vehicles in targeted segments. We are the primary OE tire on America's top-selling vehicle, the Ford F-150 pickup, and on the 2014 Chevy Impala, which a leading consumer magazine recently rated the best sedan on the market. And looking ahead, we have a full pipeline of OE fitments, which reinforces our selectivity strategy.","When I became CEO in 2010, the most common question I was asked was, \"When will North America be profitable?\" The business has now posted 13 consecutive profitable quarters and 16 straight quarters of year-over-year segment operating income improvement. Our segment operating income margin in the second quarter was 9.3%, making it the fifth straight quarter with at least 5% earnings to sales. Those strong second quarters are partially due to the seasonality of our business. We believe our performance is another indication that North America is solidly on the path of sustainable value creation.","Finally, on North America. You will have seen that we reached a tentative agreement on a new label -- labor contract with the United Steelworkers. Though we will not discuss the details of the agreement until after it is ratified by the USW membership, we believe we will be able to sustain our competitive position and be ready to take advantage of opportunities when demand begins to accelerate.","Now turning to our Asia Pacific business. We delivered record earnings in the quarter with segment operating income of $91 million, a 28% increase over the same quarter a year ago and the second consecutive record-breaking quarter. Our business in China continues to grow faster than the industry and is focused on Premium segments, delivering a strong return on our investments in the region.","The third quarter rollout of innovative new tires, such as the Assurance Triple Max, the motor trend tire of the year in China, will further strengthen our brand across Asia. I can tell you, this tire is a hit with our OE and our replacement customers we're very pleased with this rollout. Now our entrance into the commercial truck tire business in China continues to gain strength. Truck tire production in our state-of-the-art Pulandian facility has given us a distinct advantage with fleets in the world's largest truck tire market, where demand for our best-in-class products continues to grow.","Looking ahead, our focus in this growth market remains on developing and expanding our truck tire distribution. We remain positive on Asia as a source of growth in both the consumer and commercial segments. We're also very pleased with our results in Latin America, as our business increase its operating income by more than 40% over last year's second quarter. We've always said that the Latin America region will have periods of volatility, driven by political and economic events. This is certainly one of those periods affecting Brazil, Venezuela and Argentina in particular.","As I've also said, our management team is well equipped to deal with these issues as evidenced by our second quarter results. The Latin America market remains a key growth market for us. We continue to invest in the region and introduce new products to support the growth of premium tires in our well-established distribution network. The modernization of our factory in Americana will enable us to make more high-technology tires to serve the region in the future.","Though our business in Europe, Middle East and Africa showed signs of recovery in the second quarter, we are still experiencing weak conditions in Europe. Headwinds in much of Europe continue to have a dampening effect on the automotive businesses directly affecting consumer demand.","With that said, we are seeing progress even amidst the sluggish economy. EMEA had higher volumes and year-over-year segment operating income improvement, reversing the trend of the past 5 quarters. Improved earnings reflect the strong performance of our summer tire portfolio, which stood apart from the competition in the important magazine tire tests.","This year, Goodyear and Dunlop tires claimed 27 wins in 39 summer tire tests published by the most respected automotive magazines in Europe. Our test winners included Goodyear EfficientGrip Performance and Eagle F1 Asymmetric 2 and Dunlop's Sport Blue Response and Sport Maxx RT. One influential publication described the Blue Response as a top class summer tire without any weaknesses. These outstanding test results further validate our strategy, the market-back innovation and these products differentiates our brands and creates value in our targeted market segments.","Another continuing bright spot is our commercial truck business in Europe, where we have a great product portfolio and a strong fleet service proposition. We're seeing consistent year-over-year growth and market share gains in both mature and emerging markets, especially in Russia, where we've been able to deliver value for fleets where it matters most, reducing their cost per kilometer.","In both consumer and commercial truck, we are seeing the benefit of our strong label grades, which demonstrates our ability to deliver top performance in both traction and fuel economy. In consumer tires, Goodyear has the highest rated label portfolio in the industry, with more BA-rated products than anyone else. This is a tremendous achievement and delivers on our promise to lead the industry in tire labeling.","Increasing our share in profitable market segments and taking advantage of growth opportunities in emerging markets are 2 aspects of our profit improvement plan in Europe. We're starting to see the results of the plans implementation and expect further progress with stabilized volumes.","Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we anticipate some volume growth in mature markets and we plan to capture our share of this growth concentrated in our targeted segments. Clearly, the global economy is taking longer to improve than most, including us, had anticipated. Now that said, we remain optimistic over the long term that volume will return to more normalized levels and that the trade will restock their inventory.","We continue to believe in our MegaTrends and the migration to high-value added tires, a trend that has not slowed down much, even in this downturn.","Tough decisions, disciplined behavior and commitment to our strategy are paying off. During the quarter, we delivered record earnings, our cadence of new product introductions remains vibrant, we had strong cash generation and our cost-reduction initiatives are taking hold. Though we take the long-term view, our success in the second quarter increases our optimism about the future. We now expect 2013 segment operating income of about $1.5 billion, which is the high end of our prior full year estimate. We also expect an acceleration of volume growth in the second half.","But remember, the tire industry is defined by volatility. A great quarter doesn't define success, and a lower quarter doesn't preclude it. Our long-term objective is to create a business that delivers sustainable, consistent earnings and cash generation, while providing the most innovative products to consumers and customers, with increasing efficiency and reliability. That's what we're all about. That's our destination. And our performance this quarter was a significant step on that journey.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Darren.","Darren R. Wells","Thanks, Rich. As Rich discussed, our strong second quarter performance is a reflection of successful execution, despite continued soft volumes in many of our key markets. This execution is particularly notable in 3 areas. First, in the continued management of price\/mix versus raw materials. We continue to succeed in winning business in more Premium segments of the market, driving favorable mix and gaining share in many of these segments. Second, in working capital management. Our team has consistently driven down our working capital percent of sales, while maintaining and improving our service levels, and supporting growth in our customers businesses. Finally, we've executed in cost efficiency. This performance ranges from improving our start-up costs in our new China factory, to driving down our SAG spend, to reflect the market conditions in EMEA, to ensuring we control factory costs in North America as we build a richer and richer mix of tires.","Overall, we're very pleased with our Q2 results and we're confident that our teams continued execution will position us to grow earnings and cash flows as the soft markets begin to recover.","Turning to the income statement on Slide 8. Our second quarter revenue decreased 5% to just under $5 billion. Although volumes improved, revenue per tire declined 2% compared with the prior year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This reflects the impact of substantially lower raw material cost on contractual pricings and OE, and on pricing a replacement. The remainder is explained by year-over-year declines in our third-party chemical sales and a 1% reduction due to currency translations.","We generated gross margin of 21.4% in the quarter, up 180 basis points from the prior year. Selling, administrative and general expense decreased $6 million to $691 million during the quarter. Excluding discrete items, our second quarter tax rate as a percent of foreign segment operating income was about 25%. For the full year, we now expect income tax expense as a percent of foreign segment operating income to be approximately 25% versus our prior guidance of 25% to 30%. Second quarter after-tax results were negatively impacted by certain significant items. A summary of significant items can be found in the appendix of today's presentations.","Turning to the segment operating income step chart on Slide 9. You can see the progression of operating income compared with the prior year. We reported $177 million of reduced raw material costs during the quarter, which were offset partially by price\/mix. Higher volumes, improved operating income by $11 million, while production cuts taken in Q1 resulted in $47 million of additional unabsorbed overhead during the quarter.","Cost savings of $106 million more than offset general inflation of $68 million. As I said, we're very excited about the successes we've achieved in delivering improved cost efficiency. This includes a focused effort in material substitution, in designing tires for lower weight and in how we work with our suppliers. These are complemented by some early successes in how we manage and prioritize improvement efforts on the factory floor. All of these areas have significant opportunities for the future.","Notwithstanding our enthusiasm about our execution on cost savings, I want to point out a couple of unique items that made Q2 and the first half better than the second half is likely to look. First, in the second quarter, there was no expense for profit-sharing in North America, given the contractual cap on profit-sharing had already been achieved. The provisions of the new agreement will determine what expense will apply going forward.","Second, in the second half last year, we benefited from a significant favorable adjustment to our product liability accruals in North America resulting from improved claim experience over time. This is unlikely to be as significant this year. So good progress on cost, but a couple of unique items in the second quarter and first half.","Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 10. At quarter end, our inventory stood at $3.1 billion, down 20% from the prior year and 3% below year-end 2012. This reflects the success we had in reducing our working capital, despite seasonal requirements and a weak selling environment. Our net debt totaled $4 billion. Compared with a year ago, our net debt increased $451 million, reflecting nearly $900 million in payments to reduce our unfunded pension obligation, offset in part by strong cash generation.","Turning to Slide 11. I want to provide a quick pension update. Slide 11 shows the impact of this year's actions to fully fund our U.S. salary plans on our contributions, expense and unfunded position going forward. In addition to our funding action, we have also seen increasing interest rates through June 30, which if they remained at these levels through year end, would decrease our unfunded amount by another $400 million. On the following slide we've expanded our pension sensitivity analysis to show the potential impact interest rates can have depending on where they end of the year.","Slide 13 shows free cash flow from operations. During the second quarter, we generated $357 million of free cash flow from operations, improving $138 million versus the prior year. Over the last 12 months, our free cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion, after investing $1.1 billion of CapEx. The significant cash flow positive has been our continued progress on reducing our seasonal working capital usage during the year. In addition to focusing on our working capital as a percent of sales at year end, we've set goals this year focused on reducing seasonal working capital during the course of the year, driving down our average working capital as a percent of sales.","In the second quarter, our 12-month average working capital as a percent of sales improved to 14% from 17% in 2012 and 19% in 2011. Through year end, our outlook has improved, so we now expect working capital to be neither a source nor a use, even after significant reductions in working capital in 2012.","Moving to individual business units. I'll start with North America. North America reported an all-time record in segment operating income of $204 million. While unit volumes were down 3% and results were impacted negatively by $40 million of higher unabsorbed overhead, the North America team delivered strong price\/mix versus raw materials and effectively controlled costs to deliver another great quarter.","Two other points on North America results. While price\/mix for the quarter was $76 million negative, partly attributable to our raw material cost past-through arrangements with our OE, fleet and OTR customers, mix remained favorable. Second, as I mentioned before, we did benefit from a reduction in profit-sharing expense of $13 million versus last year's second quarter. The steady delivery of improved results in North America has been remarkable in such a low-volume environment. And the fact that our return on sales is now significantly exceeding our 5% threshold, it means there is substantial economic value being created by this business, giving us the motivation and the right to want to grow this business. We're really excited about the opportunities we see in North America as industry volumes recover.","Europe, Middle East and Africa delivered segment operating income of $51 million in the quarter, which compares to $19 million in Q2 2012. Q2 is the first quarter of the year-over-year earnings growth after 5 quarters of declines, showing some stabilization as we implement our profit improvement plan. European industry volumes in the second quarter began to show signs of stabilization, although at low levels, with the consumer replacement industry increasing 4% and commercial replacement increasing 5%.","In the Consumer business, the growth is mainly driven by higher summer tire volumes, as the summer season was delayed in Q1 by late winter weather. This was offset partly by a slow start to preseason winter sales. In OE, we saw a minor increase in consumer and a 3% reduction in commercial truck. Our volumes were up 400,000 units year-over-year, which is the first increase in 6 quarters.","You recall we discussed in April, a 3-point profit improvement plan for EMEA. This plan included increasing our share in targeted segments, growing in emerging markets and improving our cost structure. We made progress in each area during Q2. EMEA performance in Q2 reflects progress made to improve our value proposition in our consumer tire business. Our summer sales have been successful and we continue to gain share in high-performance summer segments, driven by our magazine test winning products and our industry-leading label grades.","In addition, as in the first quarter, our Truck business continued to deliver strong year-over-year earnings improvement, driven by strong product and service propositions, and continued growth in our share in emerging markets. Although our cost performance was negatively impacted by low-production volumes, we saw solid steps forward in our process to close the Amiens factory in France, and in our efforts to drive an additional $75 million to $100 million in productivity over the next 3 years. These actions, along with our continued investment in industry-leading products and technology, will help us return our EMEA business to its historical margins.","In Latin America, total unit volumes increased 4%, representing the second consecutive quarter with year-over-year growth. Excluding the impact of exiting the bias truck business in certain countries, total unit volumes increased 9% with the growth driven largely by our Replacement business. Latin America sales increased over 5% versus the same period in 2012, driven by favorable volume and price mix, offset partially by $50 million of foreign exchange impact, mainly related to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar and the weakening of the Brazilian real.","Second quarter operating income was $82 million, or $24 million above the prior year level. The improvement was mainly driven by strong price mix of $52 million, lower raw material cost and increased volume. These benefits were offset partially by cost inflation and unfavorable foreign currency translation. The continued improvement in our Latin America business demonstrates our team's ability to manage the volatility in Venezuela after the February devaluation, and to make progress in transforming our business model in Brazil.","Our Asia Pacific business reported record segment operating income of $91 million for the quarter. The $91 million represents a $20 million increase year-over-year, reflecting our growing business in China and $9 million of lower start-up expenses associated with our new facility in Pulandian.","Unit volumes in Asia Pacific were 5% higher versus prior year, driven by the businesses in China and the ASEAN countries. While we remain confident in our ability to deliver strong return on investment in Asia, the second half will be challenged by the slowing economic growth in several markets and weakening currencies in key countries such as Australia and India.","Turning to Slide 15. You can see our 2013 industry outlook for North America and EMEA, which is unchanged from our call in April.","On Slide 16, we've updated our full year modeling assumptions for 2013 and added an outlook for the third quarter. Notably, full year volume assumptions are in line with prior guidance, reflecting a slow but steady volume recovery in developed consumer replacement markets. Our unabsorbed overhead outlook is consistent with these expectations, with no adverse impact in Q3 and unchanged guidance for the full year.","Turning to Slide 17, you'll see other key assumptions for 2013. We've refined our assumptions for a few items. In particular, we're now showing interest expense of $395 million to $415 million, due to improved cash flows year-to-date and interest rates remaining low. Given the improvements in our working capital, we now expect it to be neither a source nor a use of cash for the year. Also, we now expect our capital expenditures to be about $1.1 billion, the midpoint of our prior range.","Before we go to Q&A, I'd like to again highlight our strong performance in managing price\/mix versus raw materials, our strong cost performance and our continued delivery on cash flow. These successes give us confidence in delivering the high end of our prior earnings range and building momentum going into 2014.","With that, we'll open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll first move to Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.","Patrick Nolan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It's actually Pat Nolan on for Rod. A couple of questions. You've previously talked about that your goal was to freeze and then fund the remaining defined benefit pension you have in the U.S. Assuming you're successful in doing that, could you just discuss the sources of funds you'd consider using to fund the pension?","Darren R. Wells","Yes. So Pat, the pension strategy that we announced in February was a combination of prefunding and derisking plans once they're frozen. And obviously, we completed a transaction in Q1 that fully funded the U.S. plans that we'd previously frozen, and that was done with debt financing. So yes, I guess that demonstrate that debt financing is certainly an alternative. I mean the benefits of this strategy reduces the overall volatility of our pension plans, which have been a long-term drag on shareholder value, allows us to improve our cash flow and make it more predictable going forward, which opens up some increased flexibility for us. And ultimately, allow shareholders to benefit from the improving results in the underlying tire business. The step we've got next is to freeze the remaining plans. And I can't comment a whole lot about that further at this stage. But until that occurs, we're not in a position to consider further funding actions. You saw that we also had an increase in interest rates through the first half, that relative to the numbers on Slide 11, would reduce the unfunded amount by another $400 million. So if we take the position that we're in and consider that it's something that could occur over time, I think the sources could be a combination of things. And certainly, we're continuing to drive in areas like working capital to focus on generating cash in the business itself. So I think the timing of those actions is going to determine how much of it would be able to be from free cash flow from operations that we're generating internally versus other sources we might consider like the debt raise we did in Q1.","Patrick Nolan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's helpful. Can you also touch on your CapEx going forward? The guidance came down slightly for this year, but does CapEx trend down over the next several years as we get through the Chinese expansion and capacity?","Darren R. Wells","Yes. So Pat, we spent about $500 million through the first half, and that's essentially in line with the signal that we've given for the year of $1.1 billion. We'll continuously evaluate capital expenditure levels, thinking about industry outlook, thinking about technology requirements to keep our product line as innovative and strong as it is today, and then thinking through our capital allocation priorities. But you're right in pointing out that we have major projects in Chile and China that are going to be effectively completed this year. We haven't announced any other new projects of this size and scale, although we are focused on things like expanding and modernizing our facility in Americana, Brazil. But we continue to go through our planning process. Once we've gone through that process, we'll provide you some more information on future plans as we typically do.","Patrick Nolan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","If I could just sneak in one more. Your North American replacement volume down 5%, that appears to be a little bit below what the industry did in the quarter. Can you just discuss how you think you performed relative to the industry? Was there a mix factor, maybe the high end underperformed the overall market or was there a CV mix that impacted that?","Richard J. Kramer","No, Pat. I would tell you that we're pretty pleased with North America results overall, it's probably the best way to answer that question. In terms of replacement volumes, obviously, we saw, certainly, an improvement from where -- from an industry perspective, where Q1 was to Q2. So we're seeing some stabilization as we go forward. I would continue to tell you that we really have a very disciplined approach to managing volume, price and mix, certainly versus raw material as well. And our North American business, in its totality, I think is a very good example of that as we look forward. Also thinking our North America business, remember on the replacement side, there's a lot of different channels in the business that we sell to. And obviously, we don't go through those in particular, on the call. But when I look at it, broken down by the channels, we're certainly making progress in the places that we want to. So I'm very pleased with that. And really, as we look on to the second half of the year, we see an industry outlook that's better. I referenced a number of new products on the call, we're seeing a very good take-up of those products already in July. And also, we had some destocking in some of those channels in the past, which we don't really expect to see again. So overall, I think we're in a pretty good position.","Operator","Next, we'll move to Itay Michaeli with Citi Group.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just wanted to chat on raw materials here initially. I think, last quarter, the view was that as volume starts recovering in the second half of '13, that raw materials cost will probably start to go up. I think we've actually seen volume stabilize, but raw materials continue to go down. Can you talk about your latest outlook there, in terms of how much the recent move in raw materials may be impacting your financial results this year? Maybe how much it may impact it next year? Just your overall view as well, in terms of the price dynamics in response to the recent tailwind in raw materials?","Richard J. Kramer","Yes. Itay, you have a good memory. And I'm glad because that is our long-term view. I think, Darren, you can break it down a little bit more granular for him.","Darren R. Wells","Yes. I think we continue to see low raw materials prices today, reflecting both the macroeconomic weakness and continued weakness in tire industry volumes. Our long-term expectation is what it is, and that is as volumes recover, we'll see an upward trend in raw materials. In Q2, raw material costs were down $177 million or about 9%. And we continue to expect for the full year, that raws will be down about 10% for us or around $800 million. Now this outlook is consistent with the guidance from our Q1 call. And although you'd look and say, well, natural rubber that we buy is down 6% or 7% since April, and butadiene is down as well. On the other side, there are some materials like carbon black that are actually up from where they were in April. So it is a bit of a mixed bag over the last 3 months. And when we look at our international businesses, given the currency -- a number of currencies have weakened versus the U.S. dollar. In those businesses, we're actually seeing a lot less benefit from raw materials and in fact, can be some increases depending on where the currencies are. So that has -- that, in the international businesses, that changes the picture a bit because with weaker currencies and markets, I can mention Brazil and Australia and India, as 3 examples of that. That drives the cost of raw materials in local currency back up, even if they're relatively flat as we look at them in U.S. dollars. But I continue to see that -- as we see the volume start to increase, as we go into the third and fourth quarter, I think that's generally been the trigger of raw materials going up. I'll say that volume -- we look back to 2011, it took a couple of quarters from the time volumes started to head down, before raw materials started to go down. And so the timing won't necessarily be concurrent. In the past, it's been within a quarter or 2, raw materials start to react. And so I think something like that is a reasonable expectation. So it may take a bit of time, but the raw materials will react to volume.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Very helpful. And then just a question on volume in the U.S. It seems that, versus some of your competitors, you probably have greater exposure to the first replacement sale, maybe a car, it's 3 or 4 years old. And presumably that business maybe at a trough today, just given where the SAR was a few years ago, would you agree with that view? And then can you maybe tell us or compare how the profitability on a first replacement tire sale compares to your overall profitability in the North America replacement market?","Richard J. Kramer","Itay, I think that's a pretty accurate statement. And I think, really, part of our strategy being on first replacement and second replacement, and really linking that to our selectivity strategy from an OE perspective is really pretty much in line with what we've been talking about in the past. And as we've migrated away from private label, that private label is obviously where you're getting into probably beyond third, fourth and fifth replacement on OE vehicles -- or excuse me, on replacement vehicles. And that's a part of the market that really is in that sort of 4 for 99 market, where it's really tough to make money. So describing ourselves as linked to first and second replacement, is exactly how we are managing the business and the profitability there is frankly much, much better than it is at the low end of the market.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Absolutely. And then maybe one last quick housekeeping. Darren, it seemed like the incremental margin as implied by the year-over-year volume of $11 million on the slight increase in volume was fairly higher than usual. Is that just sort of a mix issue there?","Darren R. Wells","No. I mean, Itay, it's a good thing to point out because I think what you're seeing there is we've got some volume increases in some higher-margin segments and geographies. So we've got good growth in some areas in commercial truck, still some growth in large mining tires, which is helpful. And we see some strong growth in both Asia and Europe, where we've got some higher-margin tires. Where in places where we've had some weaker volume, we've actually been on the lower margin end of the spectrum. So maybe a little bit of the law of small numbers, but certainly something there that demonstrates our focus on our targeted market segments.","Operator","Next we'll move to Aditya Oberoi with Goldman Sachs.","Aditya Oberoi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I had a question on Europe. It seems from your commentary that you believe that demand is kind of stabilizing. Just curious, are you seeing the demand stabilizing just because dealers have started to put back inventory on their shelves? Or is it that the end demand or the sellout has started to improve?","Darren R. Wells","Yes. So I think that, clearly, we have seen a cycle of some destocking in the channels. So -- and we've separated into summer tires and winter tires, but we've seen, last year, a very weak summer season. This year, we've had certainly a better product lineup and better value proposition, so our sales in the second quarter were better. And that's helped as our dealers have sold those tires out into the market, that has kept summer inventories in better shape. I think for winter tires, and we're just starting into the winter tire selling season now. We do see that dealers have come off 2 weak winter seasons. And not surprisingly, early preseason sales in June were pretty slow. But inventories in the channel, because of the late winter weather we got in the first quarter, and because dealers have delayed their ordering a bit in Q2, have left the channels in better shape than they were a year ago. And we're starting to see some sales in July improving in winter. And I think that, that does partly reflect the fact that inventories are in better shape. Obviously, winter weather is going to be a key for us here in the second half, but I think we're real confident in our value proposition. So if you take that summer and winter together, you'd say, clearly, we look and say, part of the significant weakness that we saw in Europe during 2012 and early this year was some element of dealer destocking. And obviously, once that's done, it's done. But I think that there is also some stabilization in the sellout and that is ultimately what we need. We need to sell -- not only sell the tires in an industry, we need to sell them out to retail or out to consumers, I think we are seeing some better stability there.","Aditya Oberoi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. That's very helpful. And if I may, one more here. On North America margins, obviously, adjusting for some of the 1 x items you mentioned, it still seems a very strong quarter from a North American standpoint. How should we think about, like, are there any peak margins or margins that are the new target for Goodyear? Like I know, historically, you've targeted 5 and now we are already touching double-digit pretty close to that. So is there a new normal for North America that we should be thinking about?","Richard J. Kramer","Adi, we haven't put out any new guidance of what you would say the new normal for North America. We're very pleased with the progress we've made. As we've said in the past, we're creating value in a business that hasn't done so for a long period of time. That remains our focus. And I think that's how we're going to continue to manage the business going forward. If we have a new target for North America, we'll give that to you at another time. But right now, we're just focused on driving the value proposition that we've spoken of, hopefully, consistently over the last number of years and you're seeing the results of that right now.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Meanwhile, we'll move to Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Can you just talk a little bit more about the position with labeling in Europe? What are your current position as in terms of what percentage of your product actually have AAs and ABs and so forth? Where you are versus the competition? Also, are you seeing any change in customer behavior in your stores with people coming in and asking for specifically for a higher label tires?","Richard J. Kramer","So on the first part of the question, I think, Ravi, I would point you back to a slide that we have that shows our labeling portfolio versus unnamed competitors. And I think that's probably the best gauge that we would give you of how we stand. And what you'll see on that page is that we do have the best labeling portfolio in Europe for summer tires right now. So that's, I think, the best place for you to look there. In terms of customer behavior. As I mentioned earlier, I've been out visiting our customers, talking to consumers. And I would tell you that as we look at the consumers coming to the counter, I mentioned this in my remarks. Just as consumers coming into stores in Europe really value the magazine test for winter tires, it's almost a directory to say, which tires they want to buy and consequently, which tires the dealers want to stock. We're seeing a migration to that very similar in terms of labeled tires. As the consumer gets to the counter, and as the purchase decision has to be made, those label scores have a significant and increasing impact on purchase decision of the consumer. I would say that that's a trend that's probably still a bit nascent, that's going to expand. And we're seeing it more in the Germanic countries than in Northern Europe today, in Southern Europe, where I think the economies are a bit tougher. It's probably less relevant today. But ultimately, I think it will become a bit more pervasive. But I can tell you from direct discussions with our customers out in the field, it is -- I think, some of them have been surprised at some of the consumers coming in fairly well educated on label scores and consequently, making that a real element of their purchase decision.","Operator","Next, we'll move to Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Darren, you kind of talked a little about European margins and potential improvement there. I guess, what I'm wondering is, did you have a particular time frame in mind? And was there some specific actions that you were looking to make or take to see that improvement?","Darren R. Wells","Yes. So Brett, I think the way that we look at our European business, we're starting today with profitability over the last 12 months, a little over $200 million. And we've got in mind our 3-point improvement plan. And I think the 3 areas that we're focused on are those 3 areas. And the first one is achieving better share in targeted market segments. And I'll say that the big progress we made in Q2 is clearly in the high-performance summer segments. We were gaining share on those segments, that's exactly where our high-labeled portfolio, we were just talking about on the prior question, that's where it hits the market. And that's where the magazine test have really helped us. So those high-end summer fitments. Second thing, yes, we're continue to grow in emerging markets. And emerging markets that we can serve a lot better today, given the soft volumes in Western Europe. So that frees up supply that we can send into supplying emerging markets that we have underserved in the past. So I think both of those, you'll see coming through in terms of margin improvements in Europe. The third point, and one that we can't get around, is the fact that we do have to improve our cost structure in Europe, given the kind of volumes that we're running at and the closure of the Amiens, France facility is an element of that, which would, by itself, add $75 million to our earnings in Europe. In addition to that, over 3 years, so that's this year, next year and the year after, we're targeting another $75 million to $100 million of cost savings over and above inflation to deliver improved margins for Europe. So I think you take -- where were running today, add the $75 million for Amiens, add another $75 million to $100 million for the additional productivity that we're able to generate. And then add to that, the margins we're able to achieve through the mix from targeted market segments and the growth in emerging markets. And I think that's the -- as we look at the next 3 years for European business, that's the growth path that we're looking at.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then as we think about the margins, basically, for the overall business, I mean, North America as an example, what, 9% segment margin is very, very good margins relative to your target of 5%. So you certainly met that target and exceeded it. But you talked about raw materials potentially moving back up at some point in time here. And I guess what I'm wondering is, how do you think the industry is going to react from a pricing standpoint, as raw materials move back up? Do you anticipate that the industry is going to try to maintain those margins by raising prices or do you think that, that might result in some margin compression?","Richard J. Kramer","Brett, I think, obviously, we'll talk from our perspective. And I said this earlier in the call, and we have a very disciplined strategy that we've been executing in terms of balancing volume, price and mix versus raw materials. We have a good track record of doing that. And I think you should expect us to continue doing that moving forward.","Operator","It appears we have no further questions at this time.","Richard J. Kramer","Okay. Thank you, everyone.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect and have a great day."],"9916":["The Goodyear Tire & Rubber (NASDAQ:GT) Q3 2013 Earnings Call October 29, 2013  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Thomas Kaczynski - Vice President of Investor Relations","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President","Darren R. Wells - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President","Analysts","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Operator","Good morning, my name is Tony, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to hand the program over to Tom Kaczynski, Goodyear's Vice President of Investor Relations.","Thomas Kaczynski","Thank you, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Goodyear's third quarter 2013 conference call. Joining me today are Rich Kramer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Darren Wells, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Also with us today is Laura Thompson, who, on December 1, will take over responsibility as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","On today's call, Rich and Darren will discuss our results for the quarter, along with the outlook for the remainder of the year. There are also a few items I need to cover before we get started.","To begin, the supporting slide presentation for today's call can be found on our website at investor.goodyear.com, and a replay of this call will be available later today. Replay instructions were included in our earnings release issued early this morning.","If I could now draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation includes some forward-looking statements about Goodyear's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments today. The most significant factors that could affect future results are outlined in Goodyear's filings with the SEC and in an earnings release. The company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, or future events or otherwise.","The financial results presented are on a GAAP basis and in some cases, a non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures discussed on the call are reconciled to U.S. GAAP equivalent as part of the appendix to the slide presentation.","And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rich.","Richard J. Kramer","Great. Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. We've had an extremely active few months following our second quarter call in July. Since then, our new 4-year labor agreement with the United Steelworkers was ratified, setting us on a path to address our unfunded pension obligation. We held an Investor Day in New York, where we announced the reinstatement of a dividend and set new 3-year earnings targets, and we delivered a strong third quarter on the heels of a record results or a record second quarter.","But before discussing our third quarter performance, I'd like to review some of the recently announced changes that will be taking effect over the next few weeks. As you know, Darren Wells will soon be leading our Europe Middle East and Africa business. So after something like more than 40 consecutive quarterly investor calls, first as Treasurer and then as CFO, Darren will be moving on to a new challenge. Replacing Darren as CFO will be Laura Thompson, who is joining us on the call today. Laura has been a key leader on the finance team for many years, and most recently, with the head of finance of our North American business unit, where she helped drive its dramatic turnaround. I'm looking forward to Laura and Darren working together on a seamless transition. Laura is certainly excited about helping implement the strategies and capital allocation plan we shared in our September Investor Meeting. You'll have an opportunity to get to know Laura better over the coming weeks.","I'm also looking forward to having Darren leading the team in EMEA. Darren has spent significant time working in the region this year, helping set priorities and developing the playbook for delivering the profit improvement plan for that business. While there's been some improvement in the EMEA results over the past few quarters, our goal remains to return to historical levels of profitability and deliver the consistent value creation we know this business is capable of. While economic headwinds in the region remain, I'm confident in Darren's leadership to drive our strategies there.","As Arthur de Bok transitions to his new role, I would like to recognize his many accomplishments during his 12 years in EMEA, including several years of record earnings and numerous industry-leading product innovations. We thank him for his leadership with associates, customers and in the business.","Turning now to our third quarter results. I'm pleased that following our successful Investor Day in September, the team has delivered another strong quarter. This morning, I'll provide some highlights of the quarter, and then come back and further discuss a few areas of the Investor Meeting that I believe deserve more attention. Then, I'll turn the call over to Darren to go through the financials in detail and review our outlook for the remainder of the year.","As you saw in our release this morning, our third quarter segment operating income of $431 million reflected another period of strong year-over-year improvement. In our Investor Meeting, we talked about our focus on consistent growth in segment operating income, and Q3 certainly delivered this with 24% growth in segment operating income overall and year-over-year growth in every business unit.","Though we're certainly pleased with these results, I'll remind you that our emphasis remains on the long term execution of our strategy roadmap. Ultimate success will not be measured by the quarter of the year but by continued progress toward our destination of creating sustainable economic value. A good quarter or a more challenging one won't deter us from that.","As noted in our press release, we now expect to deliver record segment operating income of more than $1.5 billion in 2013, along with positive cash flow, excluding the pension prefunding of earlier this year. In our long-term context, these results indicate that we have improved our capability to be profitable throughout the economic cycle.","Though there were signs of volume stabilization in most of our businesses during the quarter, the tire industry remained at stubbornly low volume levels, particularly in mature markets. But consistent with our strategy, our growth came in our targeted market segments, where we leveraged the value of the Goodyear brand to deliver strong performance in price and mix. I'm very proud of what the team delivered, but especially pleased that they have done it with a commitment to our strategy roadmap and disciplined execution of our key how-to's.","I'll quickly offer a few comments about our individual businesses and then I'll come back to some follow-up items from our Investor Day. We continue to deliver record results in our North America business with another significant improvement from a year ago. You remember 2 years ago, we set out our North America earnings target at $450 million by 2013. We exceeded that target a year early, and now, through just 3 quarters of the original target year, we've already delivered $492 million. This is clearly a different business than it was 5 years ago. We've maintained our focus on cost control, we've been disciplined in our target market segment approach, and we have further increased the value of the Goodyear brand through high-value innovative products.","One of those products is the new Wrangler All-terrain Adventure, which we introduced last month. This innovative product is for light trucks and SUVs, a growing passenger segment for both Goodyear and the industry. It has already been well reviewed by the 4x4 enthusiast media and is being supported by a full marketing program, including national television, print and online advertising, and we're off to a great start.","Clearly, volume remains a focus for our North America business. Darren will elaborate on this a bit more, but our strategy will continue to target the most profitable segments of the market with an increasing focus on our go-to-market strategies. We see opportunities here and we're confident in our ability to serve our customers and meet increasing demand for our premium products. So great progress in our North America business, as we continue to execute our strategy and remain on the path to sustain profitability.","In our EMEA business, we saw continued strong demand for our industry-leading summer tires throughout the third quarter. As was the case with the start of the summer selling season, the winter tires selling season also started slowly, but has picked this month. We believe the fourth quarter will reflect solid demand, particularly for products such as our Dunlop Winter Response 2, which has been a leader in magazine test this year.","Looking longer term, we continue to make progress in our profit improvement plan in EMEA. That plan includes increasing share in our targeted market segments and winning in emerging markets. An example of progress in those areas is our performance with both summer tires and commercial truck tires.","Industry-leading label grades and magazine test results contributed to our success in the consumer business.","And as you heard in September, we have seen growth in our commercial truck tire business, particularly in the emerging markets. Our combination of premium branded products and fleet service support form a value proposition that is proving to be a real competitive advantage.","And while we see some improvement in the overall European economy, excess auto production capacity and slow growth economies will remain structural challenges. But these won't deter us from our goal of returning the region to its historical profit levels.","In Latin America, we continued to deliver strong earnings results by improving our business mix and managing the currency fluctuations that have recently become more of a factor than in the past several years. I'm particularly proud of the team in Latin America for having the courage to make strategic choices to exit certain low return businesses in our portfolio in favor of targeting profitable market segments.","By exiting some unprofitable OE fitments, we saw a drop in unit volumes in the quarter, but we freed up some capability to serve our replacement customers in targeted segments, facilitating future growth and success in the changing Latin America marketplace. And I'll come back to a refrain of mine that we're running our business for the long term, and this is true for Latin America as well.","We've invested in Latin America, enhancing our manufacturing capabilities to meet the increasing demand for more premium branded tires in the region and to support our industry-leading distribution network. We'll also introduce 15 new products in Latin America between now and 2015. Our mix-up is helping us improve earnings in the near term, but also will be critical to our long-term growth.","Our Asia-Pacific business has faced considerable uncertainty in recent months. While this region boast markets with some of the leading growth rates in the world, some of our markets there have become more challenging for currency and other reasons. The bright spot for us in Asia-Pacific continues to be China, where the economy is steadily improving. Our capable team there is performing very well, and production at our state-of-the-art factory in Pulandian is helping us gain share in targeted profitable consumer market segments and grow our commercial truck tire business.","Our consumer business in China is growing at around twice the pace of the industry. We've stayed in front by responding to the market quickly with high-value products sold through an expanding retail footprint. For example, growth in the China SUV market over the past 5 years has created an attractive market that's growing close to 35% a year. We're winning with HVA tires in this segment, which didn't even exist 4 years ago.","And during the quarter, we also introduced the Assurance TripleMax for the mid-tier passenger segment, which makes up more 25% of the replacement market in Asia-Pacific. The tire has already been named the 2013 Motor Trend Tire of the Year in China and is a great example of our strategy in practice. The Assurance TripleMax is already a hit with customers, and we look forward to further robust sales as it becomes available in more countries in the region.","So overall, I'm very pleased with the results of the quarter and the execution of our plan by the team. I believe our performance in the second half will set us up well for the targets we have for 2014 and beyond.","Now, I'd like to go to Slide 7 and revisit 3 areas discussed at our Investor Meeting that I believe were particularly important: First, our capital allocation plan; second, operational excellence, the work we're doing to improve our supply chain from procurement to customer delivery; and third, the question of what it takes to be competitively advantaged in the tire market going forward.","As you're aware, the capital allocation plan we announced last month, including the reinstatement of a dividend after more than 10 years, is a significant milestone for our company. Our first dividend payment will occur during the fourth quarter, a real symbol of the improvements we've made and the confidence we have in our results going forward.","While the dividend is an important symbol, we remain focused on the actions we need to take to both improve the balance sheet and keep our business competitive over the long term. Our capital allocation plan takes each of these into account, taking us onto a path to our targeted level of leverage, addressing our unfunded pension obligations and dedicating sufficient cash to invest in our business to better serve our customers. The dividend has received a lot of attention. But the careful balance among these areas will be what delivers shareholder value over the long term.","The second area I want to touch on is our work on operational excellence. As I said in our Investor Meeting, we used this term to refer to programs that deliver improved efficiency and effectiveness in our end-to-end supply chain. These efforts differ from past efficiency efforts in a couple of key respects: First, they're being implemented in a consistent way globally; and second, they're being implemented with extensive support from outside experts using approaches that have been successful elsewhere, but are being adapted for our operating environment. These program are changing our capabilities in procurement within the 4 walls of our factory and in our supply chain.","While these changes will certainly improve our cost efficiency, the real advantage will be the ability to provide better and more consistent service to our customers, while experiencing less waste and tying up less capital in inventory. And I can tell you that we're just getting started.","The third area I'll spend a moment on is how we think about Goodyear's competitive advantage in the context of the 7 MegaTrends we discussed last month. Now, I won't repeat the MegaTrends, but you remember that growth in high-value added tires is one of them. If the industry is growing at about 45 million units a year, the demand for high-value tires is growing disproportionately as many markets are converting very quickly.","During our Investor Day presentation, we illustrated this point with a slide showing the increase in OE demands for HVA tires on mid-tier vehicles in Latin America. It's a good snapshot of the trend that we see around the globe. This means that the industry is working to deliver an enormous number of additional complex tires, a real challenge.","Now in this context, we see our advantage in a number of areas. The first is our ability to design and develop innovative products. Our experience with OE customers and in developing tires for all applications for more than 100 years means we have technical capabilities few can match. And while others are making progress, we've seen no sign of any game changers in this area.","Our second advantage is our ability to industrialize and produce these complex products. Even if others could copy our designs, it's an arduous task to mass produce these products consistently and at targeted quality levels. This is an advantage for Goodyear, as our team can clearly handle such complexity.","Third, our established distribution channels are a distinct, competitive advantage. Simply, Goodyear products are available to customers wherever they want them and when they want them through tens of thousands of distribution points around the world. Our distribution channels have been developing for decades and our advantaged supply chain is working continuously to raise the game on customer service, and we're making great progress.","And finally, I made this point last month as well. Our biggest competitive advantage is our brand. The strength of the Goodyear brand is felt at every touch point. It attracts consumers, it helps our dealers build their businesses, and it enables us to effectively enter new and emerging markets as a well-known, well-respected global player. We fully understand the value of the Goodyear brand and what it means to us, to our customers and to consumers.","We spent a lot of time talking about our targets and destination, and rightly so. But the starting point of that journey is the Goodyear brand. It's the single most important asset in our drive to be competitively advantaged in everything we do. It's a crucial ingredient and a winning formula that includes introducing innovative branded products produced from the market back at a pace that leads the tire industry, selling those products to create value for our customers in highly profitable market segments, serving our customers by supplying those products with continually increasing efficiency and reliability, making the investments to support our business model that generate returns for our shareholders and executing with the most capable team.","The Goodyear strategy is not just a product to our factory or distributor, it's all of these pieces working in concert as one integrated strategy. That's the Goodyear strategy, and that's Goodyear's competitive advantage, and that's what will keep us on a path to creating sustainable value over the long term.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Darren, and then we'll get back to question and answers. Darren?","Darren R. Wells","Thanks, Rich. As rich said, we're very pleased with our results for Q3, and we're extremely confident that our team's continued execution will position us to exceed $1.5 billion from segment operating income this year and set us up for continued earnings growth in 2014.","Turning to the income statement on Slide 15. Our third quarter revenue decreased 5% to just over $5 billion. Volumes improved by 2%, slightly below the outlook we provided at the end of Q2.","A couple of important points here. First, we feel good that the volume growth we achieved was the right volume growth. That is, focused in the right segments and generating good returns. This disciplined approach ensures we have sustainable earnings growth.","Second, in Asia-Pacific, there's no question the environment has weakened essentially everywhere except China.","Third, our Latin America volume was down, reflecting the choices Rich described, especially at OE, to ensure we can better serve our key replacement customers.","Fourth, winter tire volumes in EMEA started slowly.","Finally, our North America business showed volume growth for the first time in 10 quarters, a change we were expecting and where our team delivered, driven by strength in our industry-leading Goodyear brand.","From a revenue perspective, foreign exchange and a lower revenue from third party chemical sales accounted for essentially all of the decline in net sales. Higher volume was offset by lower price mix, partially due to our raw material cost pass-through arrangements with our OE and other customers.","We generated gross margin of 21.1% in the quarter, up 310 basis points from the prior year. Selling, administrative and general expense increased by $34 million to $686 million during the quarter, partly due to increased value of compensation programs linked to the increase in our stock price.","Excluding discrete items, our third quarter tax rate as a percent of foreign segment operating income, was about 22%. For the full year, we expect income tax expense as a percent of foreign SOI to be approximately 25%.","Turning to the segment operating income step chart on Slide 16. You can see the improvement in operating income compared to the prior year. We reported $178 million of reduced raw material costs during the quarter, which were offset partially by lower price mix. Net price mix versus raw materials was $87 million positive for the quarter, as we continue the disciplined approach to managing our value proposition, amidst currency weakness and inflation in emerging markets.","Higher volumes improved operating income by $14 million, while increased production resulted in $18 million of lower unabsorbed overhead during the quarter. Cost savings of $69 million essentially offset general inflation of $72 million, consistent with the guidance we provided in July.","Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 17. At quarter end, our inventory stood at $2.9 billion, down 18% from the prior year and 9% below year-end 2012. Overall, working capital was down nearly $900 million or 22% from the prior year. As we talked about before, these reductions reflect the success we've had in reducing our seasonal working capital, driving lower average working capital as a percent to sales.","Our net debt totaled $4 billion at quarter end. Compared with the year ago, our net debt increased $318 million. This increase is more than explained by our issuing debt in the first quarter to prefund nearly $900 million of U.S. salary pension obligations.","Slide 18 shows free cash flow from operations. During the third quarter, we generated $19 million of free cash flow from operations, compared with $105 million in the prior year. This difference is essentially timing-related, as we generated significantly better cash flow in Q2 than a year ago. Year-to-date, free cash flow from operations remains over $600 million above last year.","For the full year, we expect working capital to be neither a source nor a use, even after significant reductions in working capital in 2012. And we could see some upside, depending on fourth quarter sales and collections.","Moving to Slide 19, on individual business units, I'll start with North America. North America reported another record in segment operating income, with SOI totaling $161 million in the third quarter, compared to $130 million in the prior year. This kept our return on sales above 7% for the quarter, with our year-to-date at 7.5%. Our strategy of targeting profitable market segments, mixing up in products through market-back innovation and pricing for the value of our tires helped these record results.","North America unit volumes increased for the first time in 10 quarters. The Consumer OE and replacement industries were each up approximately 8% in the quarter. You will recall, however, that much of the year-over-year replacement market growth is explained by the extreme reduction in dealer orders a year ago, ahead of the September 27, 2012 expiration of Chinese tire tariffs. This year's orders returned to normal levels but looked very robust versus last year. This year-over-year growth is primarily at the low end of the market and didn't have much impact on the part of the market where Goodyear's business is focused. You will see the opposite effect in Q4, which I'll discuss more in a minute.","North America realized the benefit from lower raw material cost of approximately $102 million, while price mix for the quarter was lower by $66 million, partially attributable to our raw material cost pass-through arrangements with our OE fleet and OE tier customers. Mix remain favorable. Our manufacturing cost benefited from lower profit sharing expense of $14 million and lower pension expense. These improvements were essentially offset by $20 million of one-time costs related to the new 4-year USW contract that was ratified in August. North America is consistently delivering strong financial results. And as industry volumes continue to recover, it has the opportunity to create substantial economic value going forward.","Europe, Middle East and Africa delivered segment operating income of $115 million in the quarter, which compares to $105 million in the same period last year. Q3 is the second consecutive quarter with year-over-year volume and earnings growth after a difficult start to the year.","European industry volumes in the third quarter continued to show signs of stabilization, although at low levels, with the consumer replacement industry increasing 4%, and commercial replacement increasing 5%. In the Consumer Replacement business, the growth was mainly driven by higher summer tire volumes, which were offset partially by a delay in preseason winter sales. Our volumes were up 400,000 units or 3% year-over-year.","EMEA performance in Q3 also reflects the continued strength in the commercial truck business reflecting strong price mix, as well as market share gains and growth in emerging markets.","In our consumer business, similar to what we experienced for the summer season, the winter selling season has been delayed. While this constrained performance in Q3, it means that dealer inventories remain relatively low and that any snow will trigger surge in dealer orders, something we've already seen in some parts of Europe in October. It also means that if the weather turns cold quickly, the industry will struggle to keep up with demand.","On the cost side, our factory utilization in EMEA improved in the third quarter, resulting in better cost performance. In addition, our team in France continued to make progress in the consultation process related to the closure of one of our factories in France. This process should be completed in time to close the facility in Q1 2014.","As you would expect, we are continuing in our efforts to drive additional cost productivity, as announced earlier this year, and we're encouraged by the growth in earnings and volumes that we've seen over the last 2 quarters in EMEA. And needless to say, I will now have a front row seat as we continue to work on our 3-point plan to return EMEA to its historical levels of profitability.","Net sales for Latin America in the third quarter were $527 million, compared to $520 million in the prior year. The net sales increased was driven by positive price mix and the strength of our replacement volumes. These were offset partially by lower OE volumes and a 14% unfavorable currency effect, mainly related to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar and the weakening of the Brazilian real.","Total unit volumes decreased 4% during the quarter, reflecting a 21% decline in OE volumes, offset partially by stronger replacement sales. As Rich mentioned, our reduction in OE sales is a consequence of our selectivity strategy, which ensures we get full value for HVA tires, products that are in great demand in Latin America. We are excited to maintain the momentum the business has demonstrated in 2013 with the upcoming launch of 3 great new consumer products in Q4.","Latin America's operating income was $89 million, or 17% of sales during the quarter, $40 million above the prior year level. The increase was driven by positive price mix, lower raw material cost and lower unabsorbed overhead. These benefits were partially offset by cost inflation and unfavorable foreign currency exchange.","While we see many of the positives in Latin America's results continuing in Q4, there was some timing of costs that benefited Q3 that will reverse in Q4. I would size this impact at $10 million to $15 million. This includes, among other things, the increased marketing spend in Q4 associated with the new product launches after very low levels of spend in Q3.","In Asia-Pacific, we saw a slowing economic growth in several markets, a declining mining industry and weakening currencies in key countries like Australia, India and Indonesia. Despite this, unit volumes of 5.6 million were 7.5% higher than a year ago, given strong growth in China and India. Asia Pacific reported segment operating income of $66 million for the quarter, a $2 million increase year-over-year. Positive price mix versus raw materials, higher volume and lower start-up expenses associated with our new facility in China were offset partially by unfavorable foreign exchange, higher manufacturing costs and reduced profits in our Australia retail business.","Turning to Slide 20. You can see our 2013 industry outlook for North America and EMEA, which remains essentially unchanged from our second quarter earnings call. You'll note for the fourth quarter, however, that North America will be down year-over-year, again, reflecting the aberration of a year ago, when fourth quarter dealer orders for low-end tires were high, post expiration of Chinese tire tariffs.","On Slide 21, we've updated our modeling assumptions for the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter volume expectations continue to reflect a slow but steady volume recovery in developed consumer replacement markets. Our unabsorbed overhead outlook is consistent with these expectations, with a positive impact in Q4 based on Q3 production.","Finally, on Slide 22, you see other key assumptions for 2013. We refined our assumptions for interest and pension expense. But otherwise, these items are unchanged.","So overall, we feel good delivering a strong quarter on the heels of our September investor meeting and believe we can do the same in Q4.","With that, we'll open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Itay Michaeli calling from Citi.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just on classification on the guidance, I think for last quarter, for the unabsorbed overhead up on a full year basis, I think you're calling for kind of negative $25 million to $50 million. I see directionally, in the fourth quarter, you're looking for positive. Can you kind of size up the full year range relative to the expectation last quarter?","Darren R. Wells","Yes. So, Itay, let me just address fourth quarter. I think that may be an easier way to do it. Our production was up in Q3, between 2.5 million and 3 million units. And so what you'll see is the benefit of that third quarter additional production rolling through in Q4.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Is that full year range, though, from last quarter still guided $25 million to $50 million? Or is that sort of kind of off the table at this point?","Darren R. Wells","Yes. No, I think the full year range hasn't changed a lot.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, perfect. And then just a point of clarification just on the OTR piece. I think last quarter, you were looking for up about $20 million in Q3. I think you might come in up $5 million. Can you just talk a little bit about that in the quarter and then just the different movements in that business?","Richard J. Kramer","Sorry, Itay, can you repeat your question? Because we just -- we missed a couple of words there.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Oh, sorry. But yes, just on the OTR piece. I think last quarter, the guidance, I believe, was about up $20 million impacting Q3. It looked like it came in at up $5 million. Just looking to get a sense of the walk and the delta there, perhaps talk about the chemicals business and some of impacts there, how we should think about that the next couple of quarters?","Richard J. Kramer","Yes. I think the -- yes, it's a fair point. We did have some headwinds there in the other tire-related businesses that related to our retail businesses, which are in the same category. Otherwise, not a big impact for us, one way or the other, in the chemical business. So net-net, the other tire-related came in a little less positive than we had expected. I think if you look at the guidelines that were given for the fourth quarter, I think the, yes, the $5 million is, again, similar to what we guided in Q3, yes. In fact we're expecting some of the same. There are some markets where our retail businesses have not been strong, and that's a headwind for us. As long as the chemical prices are -- in the marketplace are pretty steady, then there's not a lot of change one way or the other in the chemical earnings.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Absolutely. Then maybe a big picture question. Could just -- maybe Rich or Darren can update us on what you're seeing in the overall pricing environment and remind us sort of what you are baking into for your 2016 SOI growth projections for sort of price mix relative to raw materials, just kind of broadly?","Richard J. Kramer","Yes. Itay, from a price mix perspective, again, I'll just go, you -- take you back to how we think about it. And as we look at a world that has had a lot of movements over the course of the past few years, with raw materials increasing as much as 35% in some quarters and down, we're forecasting roundabout 10% for the year. At this point, we see a lot of volatility in there. And our philosophy remains that we've shown an ability to manage through those situations very effectively. We look at this overall in terms of the value proposition that we bring to the market, that's certainly partly priced. But it's also service level, it's also our brand, and it's also our customer relations that we have out there. And again, price is really part of that value proposition. And the way we look at it, we've got to ensure that could our value proposition ultimately and in the aggregate -- is really very competitive in the marketplace. And in some instances, we need to react to that in order to make sure that, that value proposition is fully competitive. Some cases with the rising raw materials, as you saw, so we had to react to that with price increases. As we've had to be competitive, we've had to react the other way as well. I think what we would still tell you very clearly is that we're pursuing a very disciplined strategy around price and mix. And I think our history bodes well for us to manage through those. And, Darren, you can talk to the projections going forward, which really are not the driver of what we're counting on to hit the targets we set out on our September meeting.","Darren R. Wells","Then I think, Itay, going back to the discussion in the September meeting, when we talked about the 10% to 15% earnings growth from 2014 through 2016, which, by the way, we're still very confident of, the view is that that's a balanced earnings growth, balancing between growth and cost savings. And as we're balancing between growth and cost savings, obviously, the work we're doing to target more premium segments in the market is something that's going to be helpful for us and means that the volume is more valuable than volume may have been for us historically. But the -- but we are focused on the volume and our cost efficiency, which effectively means that we're assuming that our work on price mix offsets raw material costs over that timeframe. And I think overall, we are expecting that the raw materials are going to be rising during that 3-year timeframe, given the increases we expect in global industry volumes.","Operator","Next, we'll move to Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. Just maybe a shorter-term question, a longer-term. Just following up on that last question, I sort of get the modeling assumptions for the medium term on pricing versus raw mats. But let -- if we kind of just look out to the -- like maybe next year's time horizon, as we're trying to figure it out, you guys have carried over a positive variance, price mix minus raws for the fourth quarter. How do you think about that for next year? Mix seems to be one of the sort of stable improvers here. But from a pricing perspective, obviously, there's increased competition on the lower end, on the -- raw materials have started to increase a little bit. So any kind of guidance for maybe the next 12 months would be helpful. And then I have a longer-term question.","Richard J. Kramer","Yes. So, Pat, as we think about this for the next year, I think that there will be some dependency here on how quickly we see raw materials turning the other way. We've seen -- we're seeing some signs here the last couple of months of some raw materials coming off the bottom and starting back up. What we're -- what we've been able to do historically over time certainly is manage price mix to offset or, in a lot of cases, more than offset raw material costs. And over the long run, I could still say that is our expectation, that we'll be able to do that. If we look at times when raw materials increase, when those increases have happened rapidly, I think there have been times when we haven't been able to keep pace. And so certainly, there are times when that's happened. Over the long run and if you take a look at the course of 4, 6, 8 quarters, we've generally been able to catch up. And in periods like we've seen a decline in raws, we've been able to benefit from that. I will say this: as you look at 2014, as raw materials increase, there'll be some lag before the raw material index agreements that we have with certain OE fleet and OTR customers kick in. So that makes it -- that gives us a little bit of a challenge. I think in the replacement market, we're able to react more quickly. And I certainly think your point on mix is well taken, is we continue to target more premium segments of the market. And that has continued to deliver positive mix for us. So to the extent the -- we're able to manage the equation properly, there have been instances where we've been able to bring the mix to the bottom line.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, yes, that's helpful color. On maybe sort of a longer-term on pricing, there's been a lot said recently about capacity additions in the industry and the potential to weigh on margins. Could you talk a little bit about your own capacity plans? Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of capacity additions in the industry and whether you're concerned about it at this stage in this cycle, given the volume outlook you have?","Richard J. Kramer","Pat, I would tell you, as we take a step back and look at this, I think first and foremost, we really don't see the supply of HVA tires outstripping demand in the foreseeable future. And I think you can go back again to the investor presentation that we went through in September and look at the growth that we see coming in those HVA tires, both in mature markets but also in growth markets or emerging markets as well. So I think that remains our view of the tire industry on a global basis for the future as we look at it. I'd also say, though, that maybe even more important than that is, as we think about our business, we think about it very holistically. And I have to say that just adding a factory or having a factory doesn't really make a -- make one competitive. And certainly, Goodyear can make that point, given the capacity that we've taken out. We never would have closed a factory if it was only about having factories and having volume. Our view very much is -- still remained in a holistic approach to adding values to the customers. You can have a factory, but with that factory, you got to make the tires, you got to make the right tires, which means you have to have the technical capability as well as the ability to industrialize those tires. In addition to that, you've got to manage the incremental complexity that comes along with these HVA tires. And I say that both within the 4 walls of the factory but also relative to the distribution and the channels that you're going to play in. And finally, you've got to have a line distribution in terms of how you're going to sell those HVA tires. It's not a question of just making tires and pushing them out into the marketplace. So our view is that just having a factory doesn't solve these problems. You've got to have a value proposition that gives you that competitive advantage going forward. And we feel very strong that is what the differentiator for Goodyear is in the marketplace. It is our advantage, the integrated whole of having innovative new products from the market back, selling those products in the targeted market segments that our customers want and where we can add value for them and for ourselves, doing it with increasing efficiency along the line of our operational excellence initiatives, as well as making the investments that we see in terms of growth CapEx to support this while getting the returns that our shareholders deserve and, of course, building the team that knows how to do that going forward. That's what it's about. It's not just about having a factory or incremental capacity in place. And relative to our view of capacity and what have you going forward, again, I'll call -- I'll refer you back to our September presentation, where I think Darren did a pretty nice job to walk through our future capital investments. And you can see that we do have incremental growth CapEx planned, particularly as we get out to '15 and beyond. And we haven't been specific with that at the moment. But I will tell you, as evidenced by our discussions then and, again, confirmed now, that we do have plans to make sure we're making investments in our business in line with our ability to win in targeted market segments. And that's worked for us and certainly, we believe that's the winning formula going forward.","Operator","And next, we'll move to Brett Hoselton calling from KeyBanc Capital.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Two questions here. First, just on volume front, third quarter underperformed your expectations a little bit. What were the 1 or 2 primary drivers of that shortfall, in your view?","Richard J. Kramer","Yes, yes, Brett, I would have to tell you, first of all, I'm actually -- I'm pleased with the way our business performed in the quarter. And I think our results show that I'm very happy with the way the business performed and the way the team executed. And I actually feel good about the volume we achieved because it was the right volume, it was focused in the right segments, we made progress, the right progress at the right brands, and we generated the returns that we wanted to. And again, I would tell you, we're following a very disciplined approach in line with our strategies, to focus on winning in the targeted market segments and creating that sustainable earnings growth over the long term. If you take a step back and you look at volume for the quarter, where we saw -- what we saw is really weaker volumes in Asia in particular. China was strong, but frankly, the industry was weak everywhere else. Our Latin America volumes were down. But again, as I think Darren and I both pointed out, that was due to some strategic choices that related to some timing relative to business decisions we had to make. I'm very comfortable with the choices we've made as they improve our profitability and allow us to serve our key replacement customers better in the region. Thirdly, in Europe, we got off to a slow start. I think the industry got off to a slow start relative to winter tires, primarily driven by weather. We see that trend reversing in October, and we think that, that will continue on into the fourth quarter. And relative to North America, we saw growth for the first time in 10 quarters. We called that, we expected it, and we delivered. And you also have to remember, we're looking at a flat year-over-year industry in North America. And maybe one more word on North America. I think it's worth also just taking a quick step back. We saw growth or the industry saw growth in North America in the third quarter really versus a weak comp last year because dealers held off buying tires as the Chinese tariffs fell off. So that growth we saw was versus a weak comp and more importantly, at the low end of the market. That's not where we play, I think as we've stressed continually here, and we've acted like that, getting out of that business long term. As we look at the mid and upper segments of the North America market, I'm actually very pleased with how we performed. We saw, in an industry, in that part of the market that was essentially flat again, not very robust growth. I'm very pleased with the share gains we've had in the targeted market segments, in the channels that we want with the customers we want and most importantly, with the Goodyear brand. So in a flat market in North America overall and having the performance we did, I would say I'm very pleased with the way the business performed.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And as I think about -- and this just kind of ties into one of your previous questions. As I think about your longer-term outlook, one of the underlying key assumptions is that your price mix is going to continue to outperform raw materials, or at least keep pace with the raw materials. I don't see -- you don't seem to see any degradation in that over the longer term. And then as I'm kind of thinking about your revenue per tire and I'm comparing it to where we're at today versus where we were at in 2009, revenue per tire is up about 38% in North America on average and for the entire company, up about 20%. Part of that is mix. Probably part of that is pricing and so forth. How do you feel the marketplace is going to react to price increases going forward? Or do you believe that you can continue to make substantial improvements in your mix going forward to drive that continued outperformance, price mix versus raw materials?","Richard J. Kramer","Brett, I'll speak to it from a macro perspective. I think Darren really addressed the price mix versus raw and -- raw question previously, that we've got a great track record to deal with it, both on the up and the down. But, Brett, I would tell you, we remain probably more optimistic than we ever have relative to the opportunities the market's going to present us with. If we go back to the MegaTrends that we reviewed, the market is mixing up. And we're, as I mentioned, gaining share in our targeted market segments in a flat market where those -- that HVA tire growth really hasn't kicked in yet as we still see pent-up demand out in the marketplace. So as we think about how we continue down a strong path of not only price but mix, it's really around how we can create a value proposition for our customers to do business with us. And again, I would go back to the innovative new products to meet the demands of the HVA trend going on. We have an excellent proven track record at that. We are, again, focused on those parts of the market where we can add value to customers. And frankly, that's what we're seeing. We're winning with customers who value the Goodyear brand and who are relying on us to help them deliver that going forward. And again, if we look at North America's results in particular, it's working. As I look at the operational excellence initiatives that we're putting in place, again, they're certainly about getting more efficient. But the real halo, the real benefit from it is being a better supplier to our customers, allowing them to meet the demands of the market with lower inventories and more reliable supply. That's a game-changer. And again, it's that the tire business isn't only about building a factory and pushing tire out to put in the dealers' inventory. It's the right tire, the right time and the right place. And that's value creation in the market. And that's what going to continue our business model going forward in a way that allows us to continue to grow this business profitably and sustainably in the future. That's how we think about it. It's not simply a question of price versus raws or solely just go up and down with industry demand. Certainly, we have to react to those things, but that's not what's driving us into the market.","Operator","And our final question will come from Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I was hoping maybe just to take a step back. Just talking about North America and Europe replacement markets, presumably, the HVA replacement market has been and probably will continue to, over time, outperform the LVA market. And I understand that there's a weird comp this quarter and probably next quarter as well in North America. But just directionally, it makes sense that HVA replacement would be outperforming. And Goodyear, at this point, as you guys have said, disproportionately HVA. I think you guys said 67% HVA North America, even higher than that in Europe. So wouldn't it make sense from your perspective that at some point, we'd see Goodyear's growth outperform the market? Yes or no? And when would you expect to start to see that translating into kind of relative performance and market share?","Richard J. Kramer","Yes. So yes, Rod, I think the, yes, the points that you raised are the right points as we do -- yes, those are segments of the market that are growing faster that the market overall. Those are the segments in the market where we are being successful, and that's true in North America. And certainly, it was true in the summer market in EMEA. The winter market has just been getting started, so there's more to come on that one. But I agree with all those points. But having said that and having looked at what we're going to achieve over the next 3 years, I think the balance for us is an expected growth rate that is essentially in line with the industry. And that's relatively low overall growth in mature markets, higher growth rates in emerging markets but all of it weighted toward high value added. And that does say, well, if we're growing faster in high value-added tires, there is some of the lower-end business that we're doing less volume in because we can't do it profitably. And that's something we have to manage from a cost perspective, and we are. And that's one of the things that has caused us to look at structural cost savings in Europe because we've needed to. So I think on balance, the expectation that we're going to be in that sort of 2% to 3% unit volume growth category over the course of the next 3 years, it's consistent with us growing in HVA. And obviously, our HVA unit volumes are growing faster. But it also recognizes that there are -- as we make that shift, there are some lower-end business that we walk away from.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Would you think -- I mean, North America and Europe are almost 80% of the company. Would you think that those businesses in the replacement market are growing at this point? I'm just trying to reconcile that against the flat replacement market, and past couple of quarters have been a little bit lighter.","Richard J. Kramer","Yes. So I think 2 things, Rod. I think if you look -- if you're thinking about splitting emerging markets from mature markets, I guess it's important to recognize that there are parts of the market in Europe that are emerging markets as well and fit in that higher growth category. For the mature markets themselves in the third quarter, we saw both North America and EMEA with significant growth in the replacement market. In North America, Rich has addressed the fact that, that was really more low end-related growth, so still operating at historically low levels in North America in the replacement market. So even though we may get sort of more than market growth rates in high-value added tires, it still amounts to very little overall growth. In Europe, Middle East and Africa, we did see about a 4% increase in the replacement market in the third quarter. Yes, I would say that we were happy with our results in the summer market. We held our share in the summer market, and summer volumes were actually -- performed fairly well year-over-year. The winter market is off to a slow start. And I think the challenges there are a little bit bigger. And the good news is that we did get -- so there was some snow in some markets in October, and we've seen our order volumes pick up in October. So the start of the fourth quarter in the winter season is a lot stronger for us than third quarter was.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And just lastly, you guys have done extremely well in terms of just being very disciplined in terms of pricing and mix. And at this point, there are companies that are putting out some fairly lofty expectations, like Michelin talking about 20% per year growth and HVA over the next 3 years, something like that. Is it reasonable to assume that from Goodyear's perspective, that your priority is to preserve pricing and maintain that discipline to protect profitability? Or are you looking at some objectives for growth in HVA that at some point, take priority?","Richard J. Kramer","Rod, I think, I mean, I think it's a good question. And frankly, I think it's the one that we revisit internally as a management team as well. And we laid out a strategy about how we wanted to manage the business and how we saw best to do it. And we said, and you've heard us repeat often, we don't have a strategy that's just volume for volume's sake. It's not how we're going to manage the business. It's not how we've been managing the business. And it is also very tempting just to take tires and move them into the marketplace. That's not the strategy we've done. That's the discipline you're talking about, and we're committed to doing that. And I think in low industry volume environments, that's when that strategy is challenged. And we've been very disciplined in how we're going to manage that going forward. That said, Rod, life -- the industry isn't simple. We've got to balance things off. And that's to say that volume and volume in the HVA markets in the right -- the HVA tires in the right market segments is something that we are very focused on. So it's to say we have to balance those 2 things off, that we want to grow in the right markets, we want to invest in the business to be able to do that going forward. Thus, you see the discussions about investment CapEx in '15 and beyond from our September meeting. But we will do it in a very, very disciplined way. And I think that's been our strategy, and our intention is to stick to it.","Everybody, thanks very much for listening again. We're very pleased with the results for the quarter, and we look forward to finishing the year strong. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude today's conference.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","I would now like to hand the program over to Christina Zamarro, Goodyear's Vice President, Investor Relations.","Christina Zamarro - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Keith, and thank you everyone for joining us for Goodyear's fourth quarter 2015 earnings call. Joining me today are Rich Kramer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Laura Thompson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, there are a few items we need to cover. To begin, the supporting slide presentation for today's call can be found on our website at investor.goodyear.com. And a replay of this call will be available later today. Replay instructions were included in our earnings release issued earlier this morning.","If I could now draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statement on slide two. I would like to remind participants on today's call that our presentation includes some forward-looking statements about Goodyear's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments today. The most significant factors that could affect future results are outlined in Goodyear's filings with the SEC and in our earnings release. The company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","Our financial results are presented on a GAAP basis and, in some cases, a non-GAAP basis.

This morning, I'll provide a review of our fourth quarter and full year results, and I'll then cover the highlights and provide context for each of our business units headed into 2016. I'll also provide some thoughts that look beyond this year before I turn the call over to Laura to review the financials in detail and review our outlook.","I'm extremely pleased with our outstanding results in 2015 as we delivered 18% growth in our full-year segment operating income, exceeding $2 billion for the first time in our 117-year history. Excluding the impact of currency on our results, our segment operating income grew 27%, which is a clear indication of the strength of our underlying business.","This is our third consecutive year of record segment operating income. What stands out as most gratifying, however, is that these results were achieved amidst a challenging global economic climate. This outstanding performance contributed to free cash flow from operations that reached $951 million for the year.","And as pleased as I am to report these results, I believe it's more important to view this as evidence of the soundness of our strategy, our ability to execute against that strategy, and outstanding performance by our teams across the globe who have consistently met our goals. Our consistent progress has resulted in steady segment operating income growth and positions us well for that growth to continue. As I've said many times, we are not measuring success by the quarter or the year but by continued progress toward our destination of creating sustainable economic value. That will not change.","Evidence of our progress can be found in our stock price performance as measured by our three-year total shareholder return. Goodyear is in the 94th percentile of the S&P 500 companies over that period. This is an outstanding achievement and demonstrates our focus on creating shareholder value. Our performance to-date has enabled us to win with our customers in a competitive marketplace and execute on our 2014 to 2016 capital allocation plan.","And today, we announced a $650 million increase to our share repurchase program. This announcement is very meaningful considering the position the company is in today versus where we were just five years ago. The consistent approach of executing against our strategy has allowed us to generate record earnings and strong cash flow. Not only have these results allowed us to continue to invest in our business for future growth, but they have allowed us to focus on strengthening our balance sheet, while simultaneously returning capital to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. The ability to deliver on this plan further validates our strategy.","Turning now to our business units. We had a record quarter in both North America and Asia Pacific. Our EMEA business showed a strong recovery versus a very weak fourth quarter last year. And our Latin American business continues to grapple with the weak economic environment in that region. Our global volumes grew nearly 7% in the quarter partly because of our acquisition of Nippon Goodyear in Japan in October. Demand for our premium HVA products continues to be strong. We are confident that our brands and our value proposition will enable growth over the long-term. Remember, we're not pursuing volume for volume's sake. Our team remains disciplined in our approach as we pursue profitable volume growth.","2015 also marked a very strong year for our operational excellence initiatives and cost savings programs, which made an important contribution to our earnings growth by delivering cost savings in excess of inflation. In each region, we succeeded through steady execution of our strategy, focused on increasing the value of the Goodyear brand for our customers and for Goodyear.","Our North America business continues to deliver excellent results and has strong momentum as we move into 2016. North America's fourth quarter segment operating income was up 16%, continuing the trend of strong growth in 2015. This performance was the result of all aspects of our aligned business model working together. We expect moderate industry growth in North America in 2016 as many of the key economic indicators continue to be positive. Employment levels, miles driven and low gasoline prices all remain favorable and provide a productive platform for growth in 2016.","We continue to expect strong demand in our OE and replacement businesses. While OE growth expectations in the U.S. market have moderated considerably for the coming year, our OE selectivity strategy continues to pay dividends as we see strong ongoing pull-through on first and second replacements. You'll recall that the SAAR recovery began in earnest in 2010. And since then, we've seen six strong years of growth in OE. As first replacement is typically around the three-year to four-year mark for a new vehicle, we can expect another several years of strong consumer replacement demand.","This is the specific result our OE strategy was intended to have in the replacement segment. It's working as we expected. And although OE growth may be moderating, overall increases in SUV and light truck are outpacing the industry. As you would expect, these platforms depend on the performance characteristics of Goodyear's premium high value-added tires such as the Goodyear Wrangler All-Terrain Adventure, the Wrangler DuraTrac, and the new Wrangler TrailRunner AT, which we recently announced.","These are types of platforms we targeted in our OE strategy. In 2015, our products were on the 75% of the 15 top-selling U.S. SUV and light truck platforms including the best-selling Ford F-150, underpinning our OE growth and driving a richer mix.","Even with North America continuing to turn in record results each quarter, we still see many opportunities in the year ahead, including delivery of more premium HVA tires for our customers and consumers. To respond to the increasing demand, we delivered 1.1 million more consumer tires to our customers in 2015 and we're increasing our capability for 2016 and beyond. Some of that volume will come following investments we've made in our existing footprint and from units we're bringing in from our global facilities. Still, more will be available with the start of production in our Americas plant in 2017.","And though our North America e-commerce installer program is still in its early stages, I am extremely pleased with our thoughtful rollout and our very, very positive results. We're connecting online shoppers who come to us through goodyear.com to a preferred dealer who is part of our installer program. Our early data indicates that we're driving new business to our network of aligned dealers. Nearly 70% of consumers who bought on goodyear.com were new to the installing dealer.","At our recent Annual North America Dealer Conference, our customers made it clear to us that online sales are a huge opportunity for our retailers to grow their businesses. Their positive comments about the platform, our products, and especially Goodyear's total value proposition in consumer and in commercial and off-the-road as well, energized our team in a way that we've never seen. In a larger context, the response from our customers at the conference was overwhelmingly positive to exciting new product introductions to our sales tools and training, to our marketing support and to our collaboration with them to execute our strategy and help them grow their businesses.","Our team and, more importantly, our customers came away from the meeting confident that Goodyear's total value proposition distinguishes us from competitors. Also, we believe that our customers left more aligned and more committed to Goodyear than ever before. We're clearly on the right path and we expect our positive momentum to continue in 2016.","In early December, we announced the consolidation of North America and Latin America into a new strategic business unit, the Americas, beginning this year. With this move, our customers and consumers will be served better by the combined business and we will be a stronger partner and supplier in both regions over the long-term.","These benefits will be achieved over time by integrating the businesses to improve product supply and customer service behind the proven leadership of Steve McClellan. All manufacturing plants in the combined region, including the new Americas plant, will be leveraged to serve all customers in Latin America and in North America.","Though North America and Latin America approached their markets differently, there are increasing similarities including the growth of HVA tires and we'll use the key learnings from our North America turnaround and success to navigate the challenges in Latin America. In the near term, our Latin America business continues to be challenged by the political and economic environment. This includes the recession in Brazil and ongoing challenges in Venezuela, which have led to its accounting deconsolidation this quarter. As such, we will continue to focus on our cost structure in the region as we anticipate the recessionary environment in Brazil to continue through 2016. Laura will have more on Venezuela in her remarks.","In EMEA, our business made solid improvements in the fourth quarter with segment operating income of $100 million and segment operating margin above 8%. Winter volumes in the fourth quarter started strong, but lost momentum as the weather in our key markets proved to be relatively mild as we expected. Winter weather has returned in some regions of Europe, but at this point, our dealers sell from existing inventories. Typically, late winter weather should support the 2016 selling season and inventories today are at more balanced levels versus last year. Even so, our optimism at this point must be tempered by dealer caution after several mild winters in a row.","We feel confident about our competitive position and our product portfolio heading into the summer selling season. Over the course of the year, we expect consumer industry growth to be about 2.5% for both OE and replacement. On the cost side, the team has made progress with the closing of our Amiens facility, and with some capacity actions announced in 2015 in the UK and Germany.","EMEA is an excellent business for us and we remain positive about its future. However, we realized that the region faces several challenges. Three there at the top of my list are the potential further weakening of the euro, the continued influx of Asian imports in Eastern European countries and the fluctuations of our business due to the effect of weather on the winter tire market. Our competitive advantage in this market is our ability to design and manufacture outstanding products that are recognized through tire labeling and magazine test scores.","European consumers value the technology and performance of Goodyear tires. That remains a strong foundation to build upon. That said, we also have to continue to look at our cost structure and work to strengthen our distribution network to further differentiate our value proposition. In short, we are positive on EMEAs long-term potential and we believe stronger margins are achievable in the competitive EMEA market.","In Asia Pacific, we achieved record fourth quarter segment operating income of $96 million, an increase of more than 20%, following strong volume growth of 38% in the quarter. Our unit volumes were up 12%, excluding the impact of the new Japanese replacement business. We saw strong growth in our China and India consumer businesses, but again saw continued deterioration in Australia due to ongoing challenges in that country and a currency that depreciated 17% in 2015.","China had a very strong fourth quarter with our volumes increasing 30% versus the prior year. The increase was primarily due to consumer OE, where sales surged 43% year-over-year, triggered by local tax incentives on small cars as well as our success gaining new Chinese OE accounts. Consumer replacement volume grew 10% driven by strong execution of our sell-through programs.","While we expect continued volatility in the next few months, we remain confident in the long-term market outlook in China with continued growth in the middle class fueling growth in the automotive sector. We are well positioned to benefit from this market growth given our award-winning product lines and strong position in OE creating aftermarket pull. Most recently, our EfficientGrip Performance tire won China Auto News' Golden Wheels Award for 2015 as Tire of the Year for Comfort.","With the acquisition of the Japanese business in the fourth quarter, I'm excited about the prospects for growth tied to this heavily weighted HVA market. We see significant opportunities to grow our Goodyear branded products in this key market.","In summary, we remain optimistic about the long-term growth opportunities within our business in Asia Pacific. We'll continue driving new product introductions, OE pull-through and expanding our retail network to support long-term growth in the region.","As we look at 2015, I'm very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results. Achieving these outcomes, even amidst global economic challenges, is perhaps the best indication of the strength of our strategy and the changes we've made to Goodyear's business over the past several years.","In 2013, when we set out our three-year plan, we established our target of 10% to 15% annual segment operating income growth, which would have pegged our earnings around $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion in 2016. Since then, the macroeconomic crisis in Venezuela has dramatically worsened with the decline in the price of oil. With its deconsolidation, we are committed to grow 10% to 15% in our remaining businesses in 2016 and to that same initial level of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion.","Over the past few years, we've been transparent with our level of earnings and cash balance in Venezuela. From talking with our investors, we understand that many have been discounting that value for some time. We believe that's the right way to think about it. In the year ahead, we expect relative strength in our mature markets and, like this year, continued volatility in emerging markets. We are confident in our 2016 plan and remain committed to our strategy of pursuing profitable volume and share in segments where the Goodyear brand is a differentiator. With the heightened concern about the state of the global economy today, we will continue to initiate adjustments to our cost base amidst changing markets. We also are working on plans for further actions on cost including capacity actions later this year.","Looking beyond 2016, we expect our growth will continue. We will share our next-stage plan via an Investor Day later this year, and we expect to provide more details on timing over the next few months. However, I can tell you, much of the story will remain familiar. We are as focused as ever on being the industry's innovation leader, being first with customers, being the leader in targeted market segments, and as a result, being a company that continuously drives sustainable value.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Laura.","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Rich, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will start with a review of our fourth quarter results including points from each of our four strategic business units. I'll then cover updates to our full-year outlook for 2016 including the changes related to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan business, before we open up the call for your question.","Our fourth quarter results include the impact of the October 1 dissolution of our global alliance with SRI, which included several joint ventures. You'll recall that dissolution impacts several areas across the businesses and, as shown in our June 5, 2015 Investor Presentation, the total net impact is expected to be accretive to net income and adjusted EPS.","Turning to slide seven, I'd like to highlight a few items on our income statement. In the quarter, we grew segment operating income by 33% to $476 million and our SOI margin increased 350 basis points to 11.7%. Unit volumes increased 2.6 million units or 7% in the quarter driven by strong growth in Asia Pacific and a recovery in EMEA tire sales in this year's fourth quarter. The net impact of the dissolution of the joint ventures on total volume was an increase of 1.2 million units with Asia Pacific's benefit more than offsetting North America's decrease in volume from the same overall transaction.","The decline in our net sales for the quarter is more than explained by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate was significantly lower than we expected. This was primarily the result of the recognition of $55 million in foreign tax credits and research and development tax credits, following U.S. legislative actions in December.","Our reported earnings per share on a diluted basis was a net loss of $1.42. The results were impacted by certain significant items, including a charge for the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary on December 31, 2015. A summary of these items is listed in the Appendix of today's presentation. After adjusting for these items, our earnings per share was $0.93, up $0.34 from last year.","Consistent with our approach in previous quarters, for year-over-year comparison purposes, we have provided a U.S. tax-adjusted EPS. For the quarter, the adjusted EPS on that basis is $0.83, which includes the $55 million tax credit. As a reminder, although we are incurring tax expense in the U.S. today, due to our significant U.S. deferred tax assets, we do not anticipate paying significant cash income taxes in the U.S. through 2020.","The step chart on slide eight walks fourth quarter 2014 segment operating income to fourth quarter 2015. Year-over-year, SOI increased $117 million. The net impact of volume growth and unabsorbed fixed cost was a benefit of $73 million. The benefits of lower raw material costs and improved price\/mix combined for a net benefit of $108 million during the quarter with continued strong performance in North America. On a full-year basis, our price\/mix versus raw materials benefit was $356 million. Excluding Venezuela, it was $77 million.","Our $80 million of cost savings was more than offset by the impact of inflation driven by hyper-inflation Venezuela. I'll note that fourth quarter cost savings included a $30 million favorable adjustment to our general and product liability reserve. On a full year basis, our net cost savings were $29 million year-over-year. Excluding Venezuela, our net cost savings were $227 million, reflecting the continued momentum of our operational excellence initiatives.","Foreign currency exchange was a headwind of $21 million in the quarter, reflecting the strengthening of the U.S. dollar particularly against the euro. Other, a negative $36 million, includes an $18 million impact from our other tire-related businesses for the quarter, including the divestiture of our U.S. motorcycle business as part of the joint venture dissolution.","Turning to slide nine, the balance sheet is presented on a pro forma basis reflecting the redemption of our euro notes that occurred on January 14, 2016. Cash and cash equivalents were $1.2 billion and reflect the derecognition of $320 million in Venezuela. Our total debt of $5.5 billion is down $910 million from the end of 2014 driven by debt repayments and currency translation on our overseas debt balances. In December, we repaid $400 million on our second lien term loan, leaving a balance remaining of $600 million.","Our global pension liability declined $72 million from last year's level driven by contributions to our international plant. I'll also note that we continue to execute on our pension strategy. During 2015, we completed programs to offer lump sums to certain former employees in the U.S. As a result, we recognized a non-cash pre-tax pension settlement charge of $137 million, which is included as a significant item on slide 21. This action had a small positive impact on our U.S. funded status, and it reduces our PBGC premium and overall liability risk going forward.","Slide 10 shows we generated $951 million of free cash flow from operations in 2015. Working capital was a use of $42 million, and our CapEx spend was $983 million. We also repurchased $100 million worth of our common stock during the fourth quarter or about 3 million shares, bringing the total, since the start of the program, to $413 million.","Moving now to the business units on slide 11, I'll start with North America. North America continues to deliver strong results with another record quarter and segment operating income of $266 million. Operating margin for the quarter was about 14%, reflecting the seventh consecutive quarter of margin exceeding 10%. North America's $37 million improvement in year-over-year earnings was driven by strong price\/mix net of raw material costs, reflecting the value of the Goodyear brand and our industry-leading products and services.","North America benefited from improved factory utilization in the third quarter, as well as from cost savings, including favorable general and product liability costs as I noted earlier, which more than offset higher marketing expense and the impact of the divestiture of our Dunlop branded Japanese OE and U.S. motorcycle businesses.","Excluding the impact of the joint venture dissolution, North America's consumer volume was essentially flat in the fourth quarter when compared with last year's very strong fourth quarter. You'll recall that our third quarter of 2014 had weak shipments as a result of the tariff pre-buy, which then benefited shipments in the fourth quarter of 2014 as distributors and retailers rebalanced inventory levels. North America continues to be challenged to fully satisfy market demand for our premium, high-value added tires. We are working diligently to leverage our global manufacturing footprint and continue to invest in the Americas to meet this demand.","In the commercial truck business, fourth quarter sales units declined 12% year-over-year. This decrease was primarily due to a decline in our commercial OE business, and also reflects some increased pressure in the replacement industry from an influx of low-end imported units. For the full year of 2015, North America earned record segment operating income of $1.1 billion, a year-over-year improvement of $305 million. We believe these results are further evidence that our strategy is delivering sustainable value.","Europe, Middle East and Africa generated segment operating income of $100 million in the quarter, which was $70 million higher than the prior year. The increase in SOI was primarily driven by volume improvement and our cost savings programs, which more than offset foreign currency translation and inflation headwind.","Despite another warm winter and continued pressure from Asian imports and Eastern Europe, our fourth quarter EMEA unit volume increased about 11% year-over-year. The volume increase was driven by European winter tire industry sell-in, which grew 5% year-over-year, and our strong performance in consumer replacement where year-over-year volumes increased by 13%. In commercial truck, we again saw strong performance in a stable industry environment. We saw double digit volume gains in commercial OE, and we continue to gain share in replacement.","Asia Pacific generated segment operating income of $96 million during the fourth quarter. This sets a new record for the region and is $16 million above the same period the year before. The main driver was positive volume, which was partially offset by continuing currency headwinds due to the weakening Chinese RMB. Our segment operating margin in the region increased to 17.2%. Our volume grew 38% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of our acquisition of the Japanese replacement tire business, our volume growth was 12%.","Outside of Japan, volume growth came from our two primary growth engines, China and India. Despite the slowing Chinese economy, we grew double digits in OE as well as in our replacement business. In India, strong market conditions and our ability to increase share have especially benefited or replacement business. While we anticipate slower growth and continuing currency headwinds for the region in the short term, we continue to view China and the rest of the region as a key long-term growth opportunity. We are investing in our teams, our products and our capabilities to drive that growth.","We had a challenging quarter in Latin America due to the persistent weak economic environment in Brazil and continued volatility in Venezuela. In the quarter, our volume decreased 11% versus 2014. The decline in volume was driven by three factors. First, our consumer OE business declined 29% due to a continuing recessionary environment driven by a 36% decline in the industry in Brazil. Second, our consumer replacement sales in the quarter were down 5%. This volume decline was influenced by some pull ahead of orders into the prior quarter due an announced price increases effective in October. And third, commercial replacement industry volumes declined 12% year-over-year primarily in Brazil.","Segment operating income in the fourth quarter was $14 million, which was down $6 million from the prior year. In the quarter, Latin America's results were negatively impacted by cost inflation and lower volume. For the quarter, operating income from our Venezuelan business was $22 million. This operating income excludes foreign currency exchange losses related to the Venezuelan bol\u00edvar, which were $5 million in the quarter.","The economic environment in Venezuela continues to be extremely challenging. We were unable to exchange bol\u00edvars for U.S. dollars during the fourth quarter, which we require to purchase imported raw materials for operations. These conditions, combined with our Venezuelan regulations, have increasingly limited our ability to make and execute operational decisions at our Venezuelan subsidiary. As a result, we concluded we do not meet the accounting criteria for control and we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiary on December 31. Despite this change, we continue to maintain operations in Venezuela and serve our customers there.","Our Latin America team is continuing to work proactively to mitigate our exposure and maximize market opportunities in an increasingly difficult environment. We continue to focus on cost and we will work to leverage the Americas consolidation to improve capabilities, to improve processes and to reduce costs.","Slide 12 shows our full-year modeling assumptions for 2016. We have included our 2015 results, excluding Venezuela, on the left-hand side of the chart for comparison purposes. Full-year SOI in Venezuela was $119 million. After adjusting for its deconsolidation, our 2015 SOI was $1.9 billion. We are committed to growing our SOI 10% to 15% year-over-year in our remaining operations and are targeting SOI of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion in 2016.","We see sales volume growth of approximately 3% for the year from our revised base of about 165 million units, which excludes Venezuela. This volume will come from incremental growth in all of our regions and also includes the full year benefit from the acquisition of Nippon Goodyear.","I'll note that similar to prior guidance, we expect a volume benefit of about $15 per tire in 2016. Our outlook for price\/mix net of raw material is a full year net benefit of approximately $75 million. For 2016, we expect raw materials to decrease about 5% year-over-year. This includes the negative impact of both the RMI index agreements with our OE customers in certain large commercial fleets as well as the impact from currency on raw material transactions in our international businesses.","Unabsorbed overhead for 2016 is expected to be a benefit of approximately $50 million, reflecting the benefit of higher overall volume. We expect cost savings versus general inflation to be a benefit of about $135 million in 2016 as operational excellence programs from our core business continue to deliver.","In line with the timing of some of our operational excellence initiatives and our cadence in 2015, our cost savings benefits will ramp up through the year. While we had outstanding performance of $227 million in net cost savings in 2015 excluding Venezuela, there are a few reasons for the change in 2016.","Our 2015 full year cost savings included a $35 million benefit from general and product liability reserve adjustments, including the $30 million I mentioned during the Q4 SOI walk. In addition, as we have deployed a few central initiatives regionally, we will increase our allocation of these costs to the SBUs in 2016. This will show as a headwind to cost savings with an offsetting reduction below SOI and other corporate costs, with no impact to EBIT.","Lastly, pension expense in SOI for 2016 is expected to be $30 million less than 2015 with the benefit from the change to the spot rate accounting method. These items are summarized in a slide included in the Appendix to today's presentation.","Moving on to foreign exchange, we expect translation to be a headwind of $45 million for the full year based on current spot rate. With the sale of North American motorcycle business, we will not have the associated operating income of about $30 million with the majority of that impact in the spring and summer months. Finally, we have a combined $35 million negative impact from startup costs associated with the Americas plant and projected increases in marketing investments.","Additional financial assumptions for 2016 are listed on slide 13. I'll cover a few key highlights from this slide. Following the refinancings and debt repayments in 2015, our interest expense is expected to be $350 million to $375 million, a significant reduction year-over-year. Our global pension expense is expected to decline from $135 million to a range of $65 million to $85 million following a change to the spot rate method of accounting for the calculation of annual interest cost. The expected benefit in SOI from this change is approximately $45 million in 2016. This benefit will be partially offset by about $20 million from actuarial losses experienced in 2015.","Additionally, our 2016 pension expense will not include expense from Venezuela, which had pension expense of $27 million in 2015. Working capital is expected to be a use of about $50 million, and our CapEx outlook is $1 billion to $1.1 billion. Finally, for 2016, we expect other corporate costs to be approximately $165 million.","In total, our target range for SOI is $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion. From this range and the other financial assumptions we've provided in today's presentation, you can see we are also targeting another year with significant cash flow generation. Our strong cash flow provides the ability to continue funding our 2014 through 2016 capital allocation plan.","Now, turning to slide 14, I'd like to cover the increase to our share repurchase program and other updates to our 2014 to 2016 capital allocation plan. Growth CapEx is $900 million following choices we've made, given weakness in some of our emerging markets. We slowed down investments in Brazil and China, while maintaining our investments in the new Americas plant. The dividend and share repurchase basket of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion reflects a $650 million increase in the authorization for share repurchases. We have spent $542 million through 2015. Given the seasonality of our cash flow, we would expect that the majority of our repurchases in 2016 will be completed in the second half of the year, in line with our cash flow generation.","As a final note, our debt repayment and pension funding basket is expected to be about $900 million in line with achieving our target ratio of 2.0 times to 2.1 times adjusted debt-to-EBITDAP ratio by the end of 2016.","Now, we'll open the call up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we can take our first question from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Ryan.","Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. Obviously, the margin in the quarter in North America is historically extremely high and I think a record for any 4Q, right? But with that said, as I look at the past couple of years, it does not appear that you have typically experienced a sequential deceleration in margin from 3Q to 4Q, at least to the same degree as this year. Can you talk in some more detail about the puts and takes there, whether due to Sumitomo or any other factor? And then also if you could share, or at least directionally speak to, the North America or now combined North and South America margin assumption that is embedded in the 2016 SOI guide.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Ryan, so the North America margin, on a sequential basis, if you look at it, we were about 16.3% last quarter down to about 13.9%, call it 16% to 14%. And if you look at that, I'd really highlight two things as impacting that. And the one was just higher advertising spend than we normally do. And I think, if you look at the NCAA College Football Playoff series coverage, hopefully many on the call were watching that, we had a lot of coverage on that. First time, we really had that expensive of coverage. Obviously, our spend went up, but as we look at it, it was well worth the cost of doing that, and that did hit our margin for the quarter.","And in addition to that, we did see a little bit of just product mix change as we saw our fourth quarter. Clearly, our consumer business margins continue to be very strong based on a lot of the things we talked about in terms of new products and our product mix and consumer. However, we did see a slowdown of the commercial business particularly the commercial OE business has slowed in Q4 and then you saw our assumptions for that even going out into 2016. So, I think it takes those two things. Those are really the drivers that hit the margin as we look at the comparative period.","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. And I'd say, Ryan, just in addition \u2013 and I know we're giving a lot of details here, but in addition, this year's fourth quarter didn't have about $7 million of earnings from that motorcycle business that we previously had in other \u2013 obviously, in other years and other fourth quarters.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And I think, as we look, we finished the year at 14.3% I think for North America, and we feel very strong about the success of that business and the direction that it's headed in. I mean, I remember talking to a number of you about when our North America business was going to get to breakeven, when it was going to get to a 5% operating margin, and now we're at a 14% operating margin. So, we may have variations from quarter-to-quarter, but certainly, we feel the underlying business is very strong.","Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. That helps a lot. My last question is just that I read recently the United Steelworkers were filing a petition for tariffs now on heavy truck tires imported from China, similar to the passenger car and light truck tires earlier. Can you talk about the likelihood that any tariffs might be imposed and what implications, if any, there might be to your business?","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Ryan, as we've done in the past and will do again, we really don't comment on that. Our view as a global company is we support free and fair trade. I think it's an underpinning of our businesses as we go. So, we really won't comment on that.","What I will say is having seen the tariffs come on in the U.S. before in the consumer business, I'll just remind everyone that if in fact it were to pass, remember what we saw in the past. We see a lot of pre-buy activity and then sharp declines in buying subsequent to that. So we see distortions in the industry and that potentially could happen in the truck business, if these things were to ultimately pass.","And additionally, what we would point out is, as we've seen in the past, those tires end up going to different places. So, we saw consumer tires go down to Latin America, a number of years back, when the real was very strong. More recently, we've seen consumer tires go over to Eastern Europe. So tires will move around and I just say that as sort of a reminder of everyone as they think about this.","Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's helpful too. Congrats on the quarter. Thanks.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Let's take our next question from Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everybody.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Rod.","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I had a couple of things. I was wondering if you can just give us a little bit more color on what drove the positive pricing year-over-year in the fourth quarter. I think that this might be the first time that we saw positive pricing since maybe late 2012. I might be wrong on that. But what's happening there?","And then, as we sort of think about going forward, net price versus raw materials, I would think that you're probably seeing gross raw materials of at least $275 million, you're assuming net benefit of maybe 75% of this. But at the same time, you're saying that you're experiencing some challenges in meeting demand in some of the higher-end tires. So, maybe just give us some color on the pricing dynamics and how Goodyear is affected?","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Rod, I think just from a broad perspective in terms of our price\/mix performance in the quarter and for the year, I would frankly go back to the track record that we've demonstrated over a number of years of managing a price\/mix versus raw materials very well in a variety of different environments. I know you recall, we went through about a three-year, four-year period where we had significantly increasing our raw material prices and where we've now had a number of years, including going on into 2016, of decreasing raw material prices. And we managed very well our price\/mix on the way up, dealing with those increased costs. It took us a while to catch up, if you remember. And I think we're demonstrating an ability to manage price\/mix versus raw materials on the way down.","And I think, if we can say what's underpinning that, I would suggest to you again this notion of how we've built a very aligned business model selling the Goodyear value proposition to our customers, not just built upon a product and a tire but also built around the marketing that we bring, even the new e-commerce platforms that we're bringing, the sales, tools and training. All those type of things, our customers, our dealers, our distributors are seeing the value of that and that is certainly competitively advantaging Goodyear. And our goal always was for that to turn up in the value we bring to the dealers and creating value for them and certainly creating value for us. So, I would say that's, in particular, what I would say is driving it.","Obviously, if we go around the world, we have a variety of different circumstances I can talk to as well, given devaluations of currencies and all that sort of thing, but maybe I'll stop there for a moment.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So, as you look at this, it's a pretty impressive accomplishment to have positive pricing in a deflationary raw material cost environment. So, I'm just wondering, do you feel like the current supply demand dynamics that you see would support that continuing into maybe the beginning of this year, in 2016?","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Rod, again, I think I'd have to answer that almost by region. I think on a macro basis, though, your point continues to be the right one that we've seen and that's the demand for those high complex tires still, we see, being ahead of supply. And as a consequence, that's a positive dynamic for our industry as we look ahead. The rest of the world, I'll also say, it's a tough place.","As we look at EMEA right now, very competitive environment, and with what has been the devaluation of the euro, I know we're seeing a little bit of reversal of that as the reason. But certainly that makes our raw materials more expensive. So we're really working on our value proposition, in Europe as well, aligning ourselves with our dealers, putting our new products out there and trying to create value for them and for us again with that. In Latin America, obviously, Brazil is in a very difficult situation. The real, I think, peaked at BRL 4.20 and that's certainly putting a lot of pressure on our raw material costs there as well and we're obviously being very active trying to make sure that we can recover that.","And in Asia, I think that we've always demonstrated very good capabilities to deliver price\/mix versus raw material. Remember that raw material hits us much quicker in Asia, but given where we play a lot in performance in SUV, our distribution in our business model there likes us to \u2013 allows us to perform very well there. And I think if you add all that up, we've got a lot of positives and certainly headwinds going into 2016, but if you look at the outlook that Laura highlighted...","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","... a word about another $75 million of positive price\/mix versus raws going into 2016. But look, we've got to continue to work hard and make sure we're delivering that value for our customers and, as I said, it's been working.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And just lastly, could you just clarify when Mexico comes online for you in North America and the magnitude of the volume benefit you get there? And also a clarification on your free cash flow. If we take your operating cash flow, the $1.687 billion minus your CapEx around $700 million, so when you present this, the table, could you just remind us what you're excluding from that is there \u2013 are you excluding restructuring cash or some pension contributions from that?","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, maybe I'll take the second one first, Rod. So, page 10 of the deck walks through the net income to the free cash flow. But the short answer to your question is the exclusion of the restructuring and the pension.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay?","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes.","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And then back real quickly to Mexico, we broke ground mid-year this year. We do expect to start producing consumer tires there early in 2017, second quarter-ish is where we're at. That will ramp up to full capacity by the end of 2019. So we'll have kind of a slow start to testings, work through and then that momentum will build. Certainly, not expecting a tremendous amount of tires in 2017 to be saleable. It is, like I said, when we get to 2019, beyond an annual rate of about 6 million consumer tires.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Rod.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, David.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Just a few from me. On the cost savings versus inflation, ex some of the one-time things there that are shifting from 2015 to 2016 with the general product liability, where do you feel like you are in the run rate here? Are we still early innings, middle innings or is it later stage? How much run rate do you really think you have in kind of generating that $176 million or $160 million underlying net cost savings going forward?","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good. Yeah, David, and this is one of my favorite subjects actually as we go. So, as you mentioned, page 16 is in the deck to try to walk through. There are puts and takes, 2015 versus 2016, but that underlying net cost savings performance is still there, the fundamentals remain very strong. So, we laid the foundation for a lot of these programs back several years. But really, to answer your question, it's a little bit of a mixed bag.","Short answer is, there is plenty of runway left on operational excellence initiatives. But this plan, this cost savings, the beauty of it is, in the early years, there were some initiatives that paid off quite quickly and others that needed to build momentum through our plans over time. One aspect of it \u2013 we have an even \u2013 on conversion savings, our plant optimization hasn't been fully rolled out in all of our plants yet and won't be quite finished even in 2016. So, again, a lot of give and take, but feel confident just like in prior years in our underlying net cost savings programs as we go into 2016 especially versus 2015.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Is it something we should expect more detail from later in the year at the Investor Day just as we think into the 2017-2018 timeframe if that $160 million is kind of on-repeat or if there starts to be diminishing marginal returns from the work streams you have?","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Exactly. So, to be fair, we will take about this much more in our Investor Day and give you a better handle on years beyond 2016 and how this investment will pay off.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. We'll be looking forward to that. The second question is in the Latin America segment, which obviously will be within Americas now. But taking a look at that, ex-Venezuela, it looks like it was negative SOI for the first time in the fourth quarter of 2015. What can be done in that region ex-Venezuela that can make it a positive contributor for 2016 SOI? Or are you contemplating for that to be in the underlying zero or maybe even a negative for 2016?","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","David, we haven't given obviously specific guidance for that particularly as we move to the Americas. But I think the question of Latin America, I think the number one thing I would point out, we've been there almost 100 years in Latin America, and we've gone through periods of volatility not unlike this before. And we have a lot of confidence, one, to work through it and, two, the confidence that the markets are going to come back. And I think that's the most important thing to say. We have staying power there and we believe that we'll come back.","In terms of things that we are doing right now, I would point toward a couple of things, in particular, if you look at our consumer replacement volume, it's a very big bright spot for us in a difficult environment. We have been mixing up our business to larger rim diameter tires. We did that with some of the investments that we've made in the region. And we're actually going out and expanding our distribution to grow our business there. This is happening in Brazil. It's happening in the Andean region. It's happening in Mexico. Our Brazil volumes started out very strong in consumer replacement. They weakened a little, but still very positive in 2015. Our volumes in places like Mexico, the Andean region were very strong double digits, and a lot of growth there.","So, as we're in a difficult environment, we're making sure that we're planting the seeds and growing our business for when that market ultimately comes back. And that is working extremely well as we expand into the region there.","Look, that said, I'll echo your comments. Brazil is in a very, very difficult position. The OE businesses \u2013 OE auto manufacturers \u2013 you've all read the same things. I won't go through the numbers, but clearly, they're in a very difficult situation there. That impacts us as well. I think Laura said, our OE business was down fairly significantly. We also had, as an industry, a lot of capacity that went into Brazil. That means, in a weaker demand environment, we actually have more supply. That's certainly not helping things as we go. So, I have to echo your comments that Latin America will be tough certainly through 2016.","But our belief is, hey, this is a long-term gain, reflective of a (59:26) long-term, and we're going to continue to make very cautious and thoughtful investments in this region as we go. And I think we have, again, a good track record of doing that and the belief that what Latin America represents to us is upside in terms of our ultimate segment operating income.","And I might say Venezuela obviously creates a headwind for us, but that's something we're going to deal with as well as we look to the future. So...","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Well, that's very helpful. Thank you both, Rich and Laura.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","Hey. Good morning, everybody.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Emmanuel. Good morning.","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","So, first one is actually about the North American volumes. It looks like they were down very slightly excluding the impact of the, I guess, deconsolidation. So, can you maybe walk us through the drivers of what's happening in North America?","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Emmanuel, I would say \u2013 before I go to the volume, I would just say I am extremely pleased with our North America businesses' performance in the fourth quarter as well as all of 2015 and certainly even the years moving up to that.","As I mentioned earlier, our margin for the year was 14.3%, segment operating income margin, a record for us in a mature market in North America. We would put that up against any business anywhere, so very strong, and that business is really benefiting from the aligned business model that I mentioned earlier that we built over the number of years and you're seeing that come through. So we're very, very pleased, and, as Laura mentioned, we feel there's opportunities to continue to grow this business, particularly with the incremental HVA supply coming on.","As we look to Q4, I think a couple of things. One, we had a pretty strong comp in Q4 of 2014, because if you remember, we had sort of a lot of customers buying in Q3 2014 as related to the tariffs at that moment in time. Our results in Q3, if you remember, versus the industry were a little bit low. Q4 in turn was actually pretty strong for us in 2014. So we had a pretty strong comp in that period.","Secondly, this question of mixing up around HVA tires, I think is very relevant. So while we are improving our mix and our margin, we talked about the SUV tires, the Performance tires, the Wrangler tires and the like, what's also happening is while we're getting a higher margin, those tires going through our factories means our factories run a little bit slower. So we're seeing a little bit less volume coming through those factories, where one doesn't equal one in terms of an LVA tire to an HVA tire, so some of that impact is coming through. So we know that, we've talked about that. So even though we had very robust margins, very strong demand and very positive outlook, you saw a little bit of that impact Q4 as well.","As we mentioned, we're getting more tires, we will again get more tires out of our North America factory in 2016 \u2013 factories, I should say. We're bringing more tires and taking advantage of some of the weakness around the globe to bring more of those tires in demand then. And again, as Laura just mentioned, we have our Americas factory coming online.","So, we'll continue to build up to providing more of those high-demand tires as well. And I have to say, having been on the side where we had too much capacity versus not necessarily enough of it, this is a better place to be than having factories with capacity to fill. So we're very comfortable with where we are and we need to \u2013 we're going to continue get more of those tires to our customers who are really asking for them right now.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","Great. Thanks for the color. And the \u2013 one on the price\/mix again, maybe a follow-up to Rod's question earlier. So, in the fourth quarter, you had a positive, which obviously an impressive accomplishment, if we look just at the price\/mix bucket and I take very well your point in terms of improving mix. Yet, the implied price\/mix bucket for your full year 2016 guidance seems to be a negative maybe to a tune of about $200 million or so. So how do see the environment both for pricing but also your own mix as you move into 2016?","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think we're very confident about our mix going into \u2013 our price\/mix versus raw material equation going into 2016. I think if you look at the guidance that we gave on page 12 of the slide, we're saying price\/mix versus raws in 2016 is about $75 million year-over-year improvement. And, Emmanuel, I would say, again, I feel very good about that in our business delivering that. When you look at the goals that we put ahead from 2015 to 2016, the 10% to 15%, getting $75 million of that improvement coming from price\/mix versus raw material, I think, is something that we feel is doable, but is a very strong contributor to that year-over-year increase. So, maybe a long way of saying $75 million price\/mix versus raw improvement, I'm very comfortable with in terms of the number that we're shooting for.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","And then maybe finally for Laura, in terms of the cash flow outlook for 2016, you did very well in 2015. And then your guidance for 2016 is pretty broad, saying that it's actually positive. Can you just walk us through some of the big moving pieces when we compare 2015 with 2016? The CapEx seems to be up only slightly.","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. And granted there's a couple of the items that are on page 13, some of the other assumptions. But as you walk through, D&A is about the same as what it would have been before. Global pension cash contributions are down year-over-year, pretty significantly frankly from a couple of different things. Interest expense down dramatically year-over-year. So a lot of good momentum as we go into 2016. Not a lot of changes versus 2015. We are projecting a small use of cash of about $50 million for working capital.","And then you'll also recall that with the dissolution of these joint ventures around the world effective October 1, 2015, that we no longer have this kind of minority interest either as part of it, okay? Now, again, feel good about our cash outflows as we go. We'll give you more color on these details as we move throughout the year.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","Great. Thank you so much.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Anthony Deem with KeyBanc.","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. Good morning, Anthony.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi. Good morning, Anthony.","Anthony J. Deem - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. I'd just like to double check the share repurchase expectation. So, your authorization increased to $1.1 billion as part of the three-year capital allocation plan. It looks like about $700 million left in that program after $400 million completed in the past couple of years. So, you mentioned the repurchase might be back-half loaded. So, should we essentially assume $650 million to $700 million, model that into the back half of 2016 for share repurchase?","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, what I'd say is as we look at 2016 and as was always the case, our repurchases are dependent on our performance and hitting our financial targets that we provide. We have a big seasonal use of cash earlier in the year. And given that, we would expect the majority of the repurchase to come in the second half of 2016 or very early in 2017. And we would, at this point, say about $500 million worth, again, second half of 2016, very early 2017 kind of timeframe.","Anthony J. Deem - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then, just lastly, we saw higher-than-expected other operating expenses below the segment income line in fourth quarter, at least certainly relative to our model. Looking at it, maybe over 2% of sales, which is well beyond the typical 1% we see in our other operating expense line. So, I'm just wondering is there anything out of the ordinary in the quarter in those expenses and maybe can you give any guidance for next year on other operating expenses below the segment income line.","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Sure. So, I'll answer your last question first. So, corporate other for 2016 on a full-year basis would be about $165 million. And you're correct. Corporate other expense in 2015 was higher, higher than we expected. And there's a couple of different things going on. But one of them was really this piece we talked about related to cost savings. For \u2013 just to be very, very simple here, for better kind of efficiency and standardization around the globe, there are certain programs that we develop kind of on a corporate side or within one place, one way.","And then as we feel confident in those programs, we begin to roll those out to the SBUs. So, in 2015, that expense was in corporate other, causing it to be higher than you expected, but that will get moved out into SOI, again, no change to EBIT, and put in to the regions in 2016. Okay? So, that's one kind of change year-over-year. And then no doubt, in addition to that, the strong performance we had in our financials in 2015 then led to an increase in incentive comp as well, and that is booked in corporate other.","Anthony J. Deem - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. You're welcome.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Anthony.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's Q&A session.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the program over to Christina Zamarro, Goodyear\u2019s Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Christina Zamarro","Thank you, Keith, and thank you all for joining us for Goodyear\u2019s First Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Rich Kramer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Laura Thompsom, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started there are a few items we need to cover. The supporting slide presentation for today\u2019s call can be found on our website at investor.goodyear.com, and a replay of this call will be available later today. Replay instructions were included in our earnings release issued earlier this morning.","If I could now draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statement on slide two, I would like to remind participants on today\u2019s call that our presentation includes some forward-looking statements about Goodyear\u2019s future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments today. The most significant factors that could affect future results are outlined in Goodyear\u2019s filings with the SEC and in our earnings release.

And with that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rich.","Richard Kramer","Thank you, Christina, and good morning everyone. This morning I will review a few of our highlights including our first quarter results, our record performance in North America and a few significant announcements we made recently. Laura will follow with a financial review of each of our businesses and a detailed outlook before we open the call for your questions.","Our first quarter performance delivered record segment operating income of $391 million with an operating margin of 10% despite the significant foreign exchange headwinds we encountered during the quarter. Segment operating income in the quarter grew 5%, which when adjusted for foreign exchange would have been 16%. It\u2019s a clear indication of the strength of our underlying business.","During the quarter we also grew our volume in three of our four businesses, increasing global volume 2% with our Consumer business leading the way, growing at 3%. I\u2019m very pleased with the execution of our strategy by our teams in each of our four business units to start the year, with North America leading the way.","By any measure North America achieved one of its best quarters ever, including: record first quarter segment operating income of $198 million; the 23rd consecutive quarter of year-over-year earnings growth; segment operating margin of 10.7%, also a first quarter record; the fourth consecutive quarter of at least 10% segment operating margin; a unit volume increase of nearly 2%, with share gains in our key Consumer Replacement segment; and improved price mix versus raw materials compared to a year ago.","In addition to these excellent results during the quarter, we also introduced our new Kelly Edge line of tires, joining the Goodyear Assurance All Season in the profitable Consumer Replacement mid-tier segment. Last year Assurance All Season became the fastest new product to reach 1 million units sold. We launched new Commercial Truck Tire products as well, including the Fuel Max LHS, making our commercial lineup the most fuel efficient in the industry.","And we\u2019re piloting our e-commerce platform for Goodyear Consumer Replacement tire sales online. More than 3,000 locations have already signed up for the program, which is focused on making the tire buying process easier with our industry-leading dealer network. This is another form of both Goodyear\u2019s innovation and Goodyear\u2019s industry leadership.","Our North America business continues to execute our strategy, sustaining and growing its profitability by responding to the needs of customers and consumers. Our team is delivering results while building capabilities and our performance is indicative of their success and their momentum.","Now turning to Latin America, we improved profitability as we increased our volume by almost 10% during the quarter, building on the momentum that we established in 2014. We saw double-digit growth in Consumer Replacement in virtually every country in the region as demand for a high value-added Goodyear product remained strong. We now have a completely refreshed product portfolio across Latin America, supported by the best distribution network in the region. Those two assets and our team\u2019s focus on winning in key market segments have allowed us to capitalize on growth opportunities even in volatile markets in the region.","With currency, economic and political instability at levels not seen for years, we expect the Latin America region to remain volatile for the foreseeable future. But we also remain extremely optimistic about the region\u2019s long-term prospects.","Looking at the Americas in tandem, the common denominator we see in these markets is the robust demand for HVA tires, demand which in some cases exceeds our supply, and that demand will continue to grow. In fact between now and 2019, we expect total industry demand for consumer tires to grow 10 million units per year in the Americas. However, that\u2019s a result of industry demand for HVA tires growing at 18 million units per year, while demand for low value-added products will decline by 8 million units per year over that same period. Now that equates to an additional 90 million tires of HVA industry demand by 2019.","To meet the growing demand for Goodyear brands HVA tires and to support our customers\u2019 growth plans, we recently announced our new Americas plant to be located in Mexico. It\u2019s our first new plant in the Americas in 25 years. The plant, which will supply six million tires per year when it comes online in 2017, will serve both the North America and Latin America regions.","The new factory will be additive to our existing initiatives to supply more HVA tires, including building incremental capacity through our prior CapEx investments, converting LVA capacity to HVA capacity, and using operational excellence to improve output through efficiency gains.","Included as part of our announced existing capital allocation plan, our new factory will be managed in line with our key how to of enabling investments to achieve the required returns to drive increased profitability and shareholder value while growing our business and industry competitiveness. And having recently met with many customers in Latin America and North America, their excitement and commitment to Goodyear is palpable. They view the investments as a tangible sign of Goodyear\u2019s commitment to growth. It was a clear demonstration to me of the value of being a Goodyear partner.","Shifting or attention to Europe, the impact of a weak euro accounted for nearly all of our year-over-year decrease in segment operating income. On the positive side, our core Goodyear brand premium tires in both consumer and commercial performed well in a difficult environment in the quarter. Our volumes were negatively affected by the growing presence of low cost Asian imports, particularly in Eastern Europe. This is a trend we do not see abating in the near term, and we will continue to develop action plans to address it.","Note that the situation we are encountering in Eastern Europe is not a new one to Goodyear. We\u2019ve seen this before in North America and Latin America, where our recent results demonstrate our ability to successfully develop and execute strategies to drive our profitable growth, and I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll do the same in Europe. We will focus on innovative tire technologies, such as our EfficientGrip performance tire that earned a AA rating for wet grip and fuel efficiency, the highest grade afforded by EU standards. We\u2019ll also focus on brand building, customer service and reliability, and our well established distribution network in the region will also serve as a competitive advantage.","Looking ahead, we continue to see Europe as a slow growth competitive market but one where we will not deviate from our strategy of winning in targeted market segments where we can drive the value of the Goodyear brand.","Finally in Asia Pacific where we achieve a 15% operating margin, we increased our volume 9% in the quarter as we continued to see strong growth driven mainly by our Consumer businesses in both China and India. In particular, we saw very strong consumer OE growth in China as local manufacturers, both domestic and foreign, continued to develop their robust production and expansion plans, both regionally and globally.","And related to that and consistent with our strategy of winning in China, we opened a development center in Pulandian, China during the quarter. As our customers in the country continue to innovate and grow at a pace unequaled in the world, establishing a development center will improve our speed to market, providing the superior service our customers need and expect. The development center is an investment in our future and will support our growth strategy in Asia and particularly in China.","So in summary our first quarter performance across all of our regions provided a strong start to the year, and gives us confidence about the remainder of 2015. Equally important, during the first quarter we took further steps to build capabilities and drive sustainable growth and competitive advantage in the years to come.","While we\u2019re pleased with our results, we\u2019re looking beyond the first quarter and the next quarter. As you\u2019ve heard me say before, we\u2019re running our business for the long term. The strategies we have in place around the world are working and, as evidenced by our North America business, are delivering long-term sustainable value.","Even so, cyclicality in the tire industry is a given. We\u2019re now experiencing just that in certain emerging markets that not so long ago had optimistic growth forecasts. We accept that cyclicality and are committed to managing through it. For the remainder of this year we\u2019ll continue to leverage our strengths where the markets are healthy and take a disciplined but flexible approach to be positioned for recovery in weaker markets while remaining true to our strategy.","The growing demand for our industry-leading HVA products, the successful execution of our strategy and the capability of our teams \u2013 that we will continue to grow profitably, increasing our earnings and value for shareholders not only in the near-term but in the long-term as well. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Laura.","Laura Thompson","Thank you, Rich, and good morning everyone. Today I will cover our first quarter results and provide more detail on key income drivers in the quarter. I\u2019ll also provide an update regarding our full-year outlook for 2015 before we open the call up for your questions.","Turning to slide eight, I want to highlight a few items on the income statement. Unit volumes increased 2% in the quarter, with solid growth in three of our four business units. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies reduced sales by almost $400 million year-over-year. Gross margin improved 2.5 points to 23.8%, and our SOI margin was 9.7% for the quarter.","Our earnings per share on a diluted basis was $0.82. Our results were influenced by certain significant items, most notably the recognition of deferred income associated with the termination of a licensing agreement related to our former engineered products business. After adjusting for these items, our earnings per share was $0.54. Additionally in the first quarter, income tax expense increased following the release of our U.S. valuation allowance at year end 2014. As mentioned previously, we do not anticipate paying significant cash income taxes in the U.S. for approximately five years. As such, we have also provided an adjusted EPS, excluding this incremental noncash tax expense for comparison purposes. For the quarter, the adjusted EPS on that basis is $0.65, up $0.09 versus last year on a comparable basis.","The step chart on slide nine walks first quarter 2014 segment operating income to first quarter 2015; volume growth in the quarter created $23 million of increased year-over-year SOI. This was more than offset by the negative impact of higher unabsorbed fixed overhead cost, which were primarily related to the fourth quarter warm weather driven production levels in Europe. The combination of these two factors generated a net unfavorable impact of $6 million.","Lower raw material cost of $46 million more than offset reduced price mix of $29 million for a net benefit of $17 million during the quarter. Cost savings actions of $68 million, driven by our operational excellence initiatives, more than offset the $62 million negative impact of inflation, which was driven in part by Venezuela.","Foreign currency exchange was a headwind of $40 million, reflecting the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, particularly against the euro.","Turning to the balance sheet on slide 10, cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $1.6 billion, with a decline from year-end reflecting the normal working capital seasonality in our business and a $200 million repayment on our U.S. term loan earlier in the year. This cash balance includes $295 million of cash in Venezuela at the end of the quarter.","Free cash flow from operations is shown on slide 11. For the quarter we used $414 million of cash, improving about $100 million from the prior year, reflecting the increase in earnings. Over the last 12 months our free cash flow performance has been strong at nearly $1.1 billion.","Moving now to the business units on slide 12, I\u2019ll start with North America. As Rich mentioned earlier, North America had another great quarter with record quarterly segment operating income of $198 million, which is the 23rd consecutive quarter of year-over-year earnings growth and a clear example of a business creating sustainable value. In addition to the 27% increase in segment operating income, North America also achieved an operating margin of 10.7%, an impressive milestone of four consecutive quarters above 10%.","North America\u2019s earnings were driven by strong price mix versus raw materials as we continue to focus on selling innovative, industry-leading tires that increase the value of the Goodyear brand. The demand for our products has allowed us to continue to improve our product mix while capturing the decline in raw material cost. Volume was up almost 2% driven by strong replacement demand for Goodyear-branded consumer tires, including new products such as the Assurance All Season and the Wrangler All-Terrain Adventure, as the volatility associated with the speculative buying of Chinese tires last year continued to work through the industry channels this year.","As we have discussed in prior quarters, we continue to see strong demand for our premium branded consumer tires. We\u2019re leveraging our global manufacturing footprint and investing in North America to meet the increased demand.","Our North America Commercial Truck volume also performed well in the first quarter. Total truck volume was up 6%. We are experiencing strong demand for our industry-leading fleet solutions and fuel efficient tires such as the Fuel Max LHS steer tire.","North America\u2019s results are evidence that our strategy of targeting profitable market segments is working. That includes mixing up end products through market-backed innovation, pricing for the value of our tires, and controlling our costs. Growth in North America is an attractive investment.","Europe, Middle East, and Africa delivered segment operating income of $73 million in the quarter, a decrease of about 34% over last year\u2019s $110 million. The impacts of foreign currency translation and fourth quarter warm weather production cuts reduced earnings in the quarter by $55 million, more than explaining all of the year-over-year decline. Volumes decreased about 2% year-over-year. The volume decline was due to two factors. First, the discontinuation of our farm tire operations last year; and second, increased competition concentrated within our Economy segment in Central and Eastern Europe. This is where we have seen additional pressure, driven by an increase in Asian imports. These headwinds offset our volume and share increases year-over-year into HVA, Performance and SUV segments in the region.","In Commercial Truck, we continue to experience a stable industry environment and we have gained share in Replacement with the launch of our industry-leading new products such as Pay Max [ph] and Fuel Max. While our European business will continue to be challenged by foreign currency headwinds throughout 2015, our product portfolio is strong, and our team is taking steps to return our business there to higher levels of U.S. dollar profitability as the year progresses.","In Asia Pacific our first quarter volume of 5.7 million units was about 9% higher than a year ago and was driven by strong consumer share growth in two of our largest and fastest growing markets: China and India. Our Asia Pacific business reported operating income of $67 million for the first quarter. The increase is mainly driven by volume growth partially offset by higher conversion costs and lower price mix versus raw material cost. Overall volume in our Consumer businesses grew 14%, with particular strength in OE, although our Australian operations continues to see challenges related to the weak macroeconomic conditions in that country.","In Latin America our volume increased about 10%. We saw strong growth in Consumer Replacement which more than offset the ongoing OE weakness in Brazil. Segment operating income was $53 million for the quarter, $11 million more than the prior year. Latin America benefited from price mix versus raw material costs and higher sales volumes during the quarter, which were partially offset by higher conversion costs and the impact of weaker currencies throughout the region.","Overall the increase in income was driven by improvements in our Venezuelan business, which was up $28 million year-over-year. You may recall that in the first quarter of 2014 our Venezuelan operations were negatively affected by labor negotiations that concluded in April of 2014. In addition, the Commercial Truck industry in Latin America was severely impacted by the recession-like conditions in the region, with double-digit declines in both OE and Replacement in Brazil.","While Latin America is our most volatile region, our leaders are experienced in managing through these periods of uncertainty. In response to the rapid devaluation of the real, our team is acting quickly to enable us to realize our overall value proposition and drive earnings growth.","On slides 13 and 14 we have updated our full year modeling assumptions for 2015. You\u2019ll notice that most of the items are unchanged from the planning assumptions we outlined on our February call. There are a couple of exceptions, namely incremental headwinds and foreign exchange based on current spot rates and an improved outlook for Venezuela based on first quarter results. Although we continue to see our full year volume growth in the 1% to 2% range, the second quarter comparable is tougher given last year\u2019s 3% growth, which was the strongest quarter of the year. We continue to expect that the majority of our growth will be in the second half of the year.","We now expect raw material costs to be 8% lower than last year before cost savings actions due to slight increases in underlying raw material costs since February for carbon black and natural rubber. This also includes the negative impact of currency on raw material transactions in our International businesses; however we continue to see our full-year price mix versus raw materials benefit at around $200 million, unchanged from our February outlook. For the second quarter, we expect price mix versus raw to be between $20 million to $50 million, as the majority of our year-over-year raw materials benefit will occur in the second half.","Regarding foreign currency translation, the dollar has continued to strengthen against major currencies. As a result, our foreign currency headwinds have increased and we now see a full-year impact of segment operating income of approximately $200 million, based on current spot rate.","As per our outlook on Venezuela, we earned about $20 million in income from Venezuela during the first quarter. This was the outcome of experienced team on the ground, working tirelessly to gain access to U.S. dollars to produce tires and fulfill the strong local demand. Unit volume in Venezuela was up approximately 200,000 units during the quarter, reflecting both the strong demand and last year\u2019s labor-related product slowdown.","We had anticipated our earnings in Venezuela to be about zero for the full year, given the situation we faced at year end. However in the first quarter, we were able to access sufficient U.S. dollars to pay for our imported raw materials. We are committed to our team and to our operations in Venezuela, where we\u2019ve had a presence for more than 70 years. However, continuing to expect or predict earnings from Venezuela remains difficult.","We\u2019ve included $20 million of earnings from Venezuela in the first quarter as part of our updated segment operating income outlook for the year. While we can\u2019t predict exactly what will happen in future quarters, our belief is that it will become harder to generate income in Venezuela in the near future. Additional financial assumptions for 2015 are listed on slide 14, and each is consistent with what we\u2019ve provided on our February year-end call.","In summary, as we look at 2015, our financial outlook has a few moving pieces but in total is unchanged as we continue to target 10% to 15% SOI growth for the year. We continue to execute on a balanced capital allocation plan and as part of that plan, we have an existing $450 million share repurchase authorization, and we\u2019ve repurchased $233 million so far under our 2014 to 2016 plan. We are committed to repurchasing additional shares in 2015 and 2016. Our CapEx outlook remains unchanged as our new plant in Mexico was previously included in our outlook.","Now we\u2019ll open the line up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we can take our first question from David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Richard Kramer","Hi, David.","David Tamberrino","Hey. Good morning. Congrats on the quarter.","Richard Kramer","Thank you.","David Tamberrino","Just curious, in North America, more specifically in the U.S., how the pricing environment has been trending through the first quarter and the first month of April here just given the implemented tariffs on China import tires as well as the increased pricing by some manufacturers at the low end?","Richard Kramer","You know David, I would say that we continue to be very pleased with our approach in the market right now. Obviously we\u2019re not going to speak specifically to pricing, but if you look at our quarter not only did we, I think Laura made this comment particularly in her remarks, not only did we get improved mix in the quarter but we also had an ability to not give back all the raw material costs as well.","So I think as we look at our performance in the quarter and the value proposition that we\u2019re putting in the marketplace today in terms of our new products, in terms of the supply, what we see is the balanced equation that we put into the marketplace or the value proposition we put into the marketplace is one that we\u2019re getting rewarded for regardless of the situation relative to tariffs in the marketplace. So we view is that \u2013 we have a very positive outlook in terms of our price mix versus raw materials for North America.","David Tamberrino","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just on European volumes, I mean that came in better than expected and I know you noted some headwinds that offset share gains in HVA and Premium, can you maybe expand on that share gain and really kind of talk to how much of that was potentially sell-in for summer tires? And then how that summer tire sell-out in Europe has trended following the Easter holiday?","Richard Kramer","David, I think the first quarter is always really not the most indicative of what\u2019s going to happen in the summer markets. As you know Q2 and Q3 tend to be heavier on summer and heavier on winter, so they\u2019re a bit more indicative of let\u2019s say trends that we expect for the year. But you\u2019re right to point out and we were very pleased with our performance in sort of our key branded targeted market segments, particularly around Performance and SUV. And I was very happy with the volumes that we had in the quarter. Also we had headwinds, as you mentioned as well, in Eastern Europe where we\u2019re seeing more volumes coming in of low cost Asian or Chinese tires, which is I think what we said in the past is indicative of sort of the location of that product just relocates around the world when you have tariffs going on in another part of the world. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re experiencing there right now.","You know, in terms of summer season and winter season going forward, when we look at how the channels are right now, I think probably more winter inventory was sold out than we might have thought when we talked to you the last time, but as we sit here and we look at what were three essentially warm winters over the past few years, we\u2019re certainly, again, working on a balanced equation to figure out how to handle the balance of the year. But we still feel like we\u2019re on plan for our European business at this point.","David Tamberrino","Understood. And just following up on that, I mean but with a couple of warm winters this past couple of years and not necessarily seeing the replacement or just the change out of tires, does that mean or does that indicate that you\u2019re potentially set up to see a pretty good summer tire selling season in Europe?","Richard Kramer","You know, David, we haven\u2019t made any forecast particularly on summer or winter specifically. I think what probably gives us more optimism in Europe is the fact that we\u2019re seeing a little bit of lift from a local economy perspective as we see the European economy get slightly better because of more competitive currency. It certainly hurts us in other ways, but just sort of the economy that\u2019s indigenous to those consumers over there, we see a little bit of a lift. So that gives us a little bit more optimism on the summer markets. But Europe, as I said, we continue to see it as being a slow growth economy going forward, so a little bit better but we don\u2019t see any big uptick in summer tires.","David Tamberrino","Thanks for taking my questions.","Richard Kramer","Thank you.","Operator","And we can take our next question from Itay Michaeli with Citi. Please go ahead.","Itay Michaeli","Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and congrats.","Richard Kramer","Good morning. Thanks, Itay.","Laura Thompson","Yes, good morning.","Itay Michaeli","Thanks for all the detail today. Obviously a lot going on, and reassuring to see the confirmation of the full year SOI range. Curious maybe it\u2019s not an easy question this early in the year but maybe do you have a bias at this point toward the low or higher end of the range? Or maybe you can talk about some of the scenarios that would lead to kind of lower end versus higher end? Clearly Venezuela seems to be going a little bit better than expected, but maybe just talk to that as we kind of look at 2015.","Richard Kramer","You know, Itay, I think it might be the obvious comment but I think as we look at the quarter we\u2019re actually very, very pleased with the results. And it\u2019s not a way that we would continually choose to look at the quarter. But in my remarks I think I said the underlying strength of our business would stay on sort of the currency-adjusted basis the business is at about 16% improvement year-over-year. So it says that we\u2019re doing all the right things.","If you say what are those headwinds relative to high or low end for the range out for the full year, clearly currency is going to be the biggest one that we ultimately have to deal with, and the other one is some of the headwinds that the emerging market economies are seeing. We\u2019ve got to work our way through those. But I think they\u2019re really external things that we\u2019re going to have to work through that probably will impact us.","Itay Michaeli","Great. And maybe one internal question; it looks like cost savings versus inflation, you\u2019re still at about $160 million for the full year. I think Q1 was a little bit kind of slightly positive. Maybe talk about some of the initiatives and the cadence of how we should think about that relationship for the rest of the year.","Laura Thompson","Sure. I\u2019ll take that one. So I think the $6 million net in the first quarter we\u2019re still forecasting and confident in the $160 million for the full year. We have a couple things going on as we look at it by quarter, right? So first of all in the first quarter last year, especially in places like Venezuela where our labor slowdown was causing us to have less cost I guess I\u2019d say in the factory, kind of as we look at it year-over-year caused our inflation number to be very high when you look at the just the first quarter. So as we go forward we see that $6 million building and expect really the biggest part of that $160 million to be in both Q3 and Q4.","And a lot of that is driven by operational excellence initiatives, right? These are ones that we\u2019ve talked about for quite a while, laid the foundation for those in several plants a few years back, and as that continues to roll out around the world, again very confident in the results. Like I said not just an initiative for the day but something we\u2019ve really planned on, worked through and have methodically put through our plant. So all that said, kind of really gives us confidence not a problem as we look at that $160 million for the full year.","Itay Michaeli","Great. Thanks for that detail. And two quick last one. One, the CapEx I know will start to ramp up with the new plant but does seem to be running a little bit lower than the full-year plan. So maybe if you could comment on that? And then secondly, any update at all on the Sumitomo arbitration dispute?","Laura Thompson","Yes. So for CapEx we still expect the $1.1 billion for the full year. Nothing to read into a little slower spend in the first quarter, it\u2019s just really timing of large equipment purchases and so on. So the $1.1 billion we feel is a very good number for 2015 as we go. And then really as for SRI and the arbitration process, there\u2019s nothing to comment on related to that. Our arbitration processes can be quite lengthy. And we\u2019ll work through that and our \u2013 where they\u2019re kept very confidential.","Itay Michaeli","Great. Very helpful. Thanks so much and congrats again.","Richard Kramer","Thank you, Itay.","Laura Thompson","Thank you.","Operator","And we can take our next question from Ryan Brinkman. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Ryan Brinkman","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. In the past you\u2019ve called out softer demand for raw material in terms of OTR tires as limiting the benefit that you would have otherwise gotten from lower commodities, was that a factor in 1Q as well? And then can you remind us of the cadence of year-over-year OTR compares as the year progresses, was 1Q your toughest compare?","Richard Kramer","Yes. I would tell you, Ryan, we\u2019re very pleased with the way the OTR business has performed in the quarter, and we would expect that for the year as well. You know you\u2019re right again to point out that last year we had that drop, if you will, as commodity prices went down, but I\u2019m very pleased with our business team showing the flexibility to switch some of our products that we\u2019re selling from the large, big 63-inch tires to some of the smaller tires that are still in demand in various parts around the world. They\u2019re doing a great job at it. And really as we sort of forecasted last year, we don\u2019t see the big impact, the negative impact that we had last year. In fact we\u2019re pretty much on our plan.","Laura Thompson","Yes, exactly. So OTR in the first quarter again wasn\u2019t a significant positive or negative and we don\u2019t expect that at this point through the remaining three quarters.","Ryan Brinkman","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then can you maybe go into a little greater detail about what\u2019s driving the volume strength in North America? I think most investors we spoke to were braced for a decline there just given the hangover from tariff, pre-buy, even the RMA figures that everyone\u2019s seeing. And then just more generally, how should we think about the market share in the U.S. going forward? How do you expect that to be impacted by the tariff and then longer-term by the rising percent of tires being HVA highlighted on slide five?","Richard Kramer","So Ryan, I would tell you the performance both from a profitability standpoint and from a volume standpoint and I would say competitive standpoint in the market is really the result of the access that the team\u2019s put in place over the past number of years. So I wouldn\u2019t have you think about volume in the sense of just one quarter.","Clearly we had a very good volume quarter in the context of demand for our HVA tires, but what we\u2019ve done is built a business model there that\u2019s driving mix. It\u2019s now driving volume and driving a positive price mix at the same time at a time where we have more demand for HVA products than we can fill, and I\u2019d also say at a time where we have a very, very good book of OE business that\u2019s driving more consumers into the Replacement market to get those tires. That hasn\u2019t happened in one quarter or one year, it\u2019s a strategy we put in place, and in fact it\u2019s working very well. And I think you see that in the results.","In terms of the way to look at the industry, I guess the thought that I would leave you with is we have and will continue to play our game in terms of volume. If you look at what\u2019s happened, and it\u2019s maybe a little bit lengthy response, but the industry volumes have been really skewed really going back to Q1 of last year, and we could argue before that, with the impacts of the tariffs. You have these big selling periods that are followed by significant reduced industry purchases for selling, and dealers have loaded up, and when you comp those a year later you have sort of big share gains and big share losses.","Think about Goodyear in Q3 last year. We trailed the industry. This quarter, Q1 of this year, we\u2019re ahead of the industry and that\u2019s because, you\u2019ve got to follow me here, but in Q4 of 2013 as the tariffs rolled off, you had a big sell in into the channel. Q1 of 2014 dealers weren\u2019t buying tires and we had a big dislocation again. So as we look at this, the way you have to look at us is not necessarily relative to how purchase pre-buys or restocking of low end tires impacts the industry but rather how Goodyear is driving its business. We focus on sell out, we focus on miles driven, we focus on our brand, and that\u2019s how we\u2019ve been playing the game and that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to continue to play the game.","And if I could forecast a little bit, you\u2019re going to see Q3 of this year an odd industry dynamic because remember last year we had a big sell in. Q1 next year you\u2019re going to see the opposite again of what\u2019s happened this year, more than likely. So I\u2019d say we focus on Goodyear, we focus on our customers, and we focus on delivering, and that\u2019s what\u2019s you\u2019re seeing in our results.","Ryan Brinkman","Great. That\u2019s super helpful. Last question\u2019s a quick one. Another volume question; Latin America up 10%, a lot better than the industry, what\u2019s driving the share gains there? Are they sustainable? And how to think about Chinese tires finding their way there as well as Eastern Europe? Are the Chinese more light vehicle heavy whereas you\u2019re more commercial vehicle in LATAM, how to think about that?","Richard Kramer","So I\u2019m glad you brought up Latin America. Really I\u2019m thrilled with the volume performance that we\u2019ve had in Latin America this quarter and really builds on the momentum that we put in place last year around putting new products in place. I think we had 12 new product introductions last year. We\u2019ve engaged our dealers in a more aggressive way. We\u2019ve had double-digit volume increases now in virtually every country in Latin America in the quarter followed on by significant volume increases last year as well. So as we look at the business model we\u2019re putting in place and then add on top of that the announcement of a factory for the Americas in Latin America, I would say it is sustainable and it is something that has a lot of momentum right now despite what are obviously difficult economies in Brazil and Venezuela and in Argentina, but we\u2019re committed to the long term.","And in terms of Chinese tires or low end tires, we did see a lot of those come into Latin America the last time we had tariffs in the U.S., but certainly with the decreasing \u2013 the devaluations of the currency in Latin America right now there is less imports in there, which certainly is a benefit to us; a benefit to all manufacturer \u2013 all local manufacturers in the region.","Ryan Brinkman","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we can take our next question from Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Richard Kramer","Good morning, Rod.","Rod Lache","Good morning, everybody.","Laura Thompson","Good morning.","Rod Lache","A couple things; I was hoping you can kind of give us a feel for the price mix versus raw material variance, the net of those two kind of on a regional basis, sounds like North America was really good. When you look at the other regions, was that a drag or was that kind of neutral at this point?","Richard Kramer","You know, Rod, we typically don\u2019t break it down in a great deal by region, but I think certainly North America was very good. And maybe a way to answer it, answer it in a little bit more color as we look at Latin America, for instance, we have a situation in Brazil where we struggled a bit more because as we\u2019re seeing there, the decrease in raw materials is actually turning into a bit of a headwind given the decrease of the currency there. So what we\u2019re seeing in Latin America is not a strong price mix versus raw materials, or at least in Brazil I should say, because of our ability to recover that raw material cost in the decreasing currency environment.","So we\u2019ve got that going on there. We expect that we\u2019ll be able to deal with that but again, you know this from following us, it\u2019s hard to recover that type of cost or that type of pricing for those raw materials in a given quarter. So we\u2019ll manage through that as we go forward.","Laura Thompson","Yes. And no doubt, maybe to give a little color for you, you can probably look at it and say listen, Europe and Asia more flat price mix versus raw. Latin America positive, but really the driver is North America.","Rod Lache","Great. And it looks like your updated raw material guidance with calibrates around 480 million on a gross basis for the full year. You had $48 million in Q1. Is that something that we should thinking about kind of steadily increases quarter to quarter? Or is there a little bit of unusual cadence there?","Laura Thompson","Yes, that\u2019s a good question. So we had about $30 million in the fourth quarter. This is $46 million here in the first quarter. We do expect that as it moves through the P&L that that benefit will increase as we go through the remaining quarters.","Rod Lache","Okay. And lastly, I\u2019m a bit surprised by the percentage of the market on slide five that you\u2019re allocating to HVA tires just because I think that some other definitions might be somewhat different. Have you changed the definition of what an HVA tire is to get it over 52% of the market at this point?","Richard Kramer","No, Rod. We I think put a definition out back in I think it was 2010, something like that, and that\u2019s the one we\u2019re sticking with, understanding the point that it\u2019s a word we\u2019ve tried to define. And someone might choose to define it different, but that\u2019s how we\u2019ve defined it and we continue to stick to that.","Rod Lache","Okay. All right. Great. Thank you.","Richard Kramer","Thanks, Rod.","Operator","And we can take our next question from Robert Higginbotham with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Robert Higginbotham","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Richard Kramer","Good morning, Robert.","Laura Thompson","Good morning, Robert.","Robert Higginbotham","My first question is around pricing versus raw mats. You talked about your gross raw mats savings maybe being a little bit less for the year than you talked in the prior quarter. So I\u2019m first wondering kind of what are the offsets that you see in price mix that still gets you to that same annual net guidance. And just to make sure I heard some of your quarterly comments right, did I hear that 2Q net price versus raw mat you expect it to be in the $20 million to $15 million range and that that would be the biggest of the year? I\u2019m trying to reconcile that with that $200 million expectation.","Laura Thompson","Let\u2019s see, so for the first quarter we had the $17 million. We think again its quite diverse markets around the world but we\u2019re expecting $20 million to $50 million in the second quarter. And then the rest will get you to the $200 million for the full year.","Robert Higginbotham","Okay. I just thought you heard you say that 2Q would be your biggest of the year. Maybe I misunderstood.","Laura Thompson","Oh, no, no. All we did was give a range for Q2 of between $20 million and $50 million, but it\u2019s not the biggest of the year.","Robert Higginbotham","Got it. And then so on the first part of that though to that extent that your gross raw mat savings will be a little less than you had previously expected, what are the offsets you\u2019re seeing in price mix whether it\u2019s the pricing environment, your mix of product, et cetera?","Laura Thompson","Yes, you know, unfortunately there\u2019s no succinct answer to that, right, just a lot of different moving pieces. The 8% versus 10% as we in February talked about raw materials being down year-over-year, as the dollar strengthened it\u2019s really reducing our raw material benefit, and about two-thirds of that is U.S. dollar denominated. But as we move through the year, we\u2019ll get some of that back as we go, but really the offsets in price mix, but again all these diverse markets all over the world, product mix even within consumer replacement and so. Again in total, feel good about the $200 million of full year.","Robert Higginbotham","Got it. And then somewhat of a housekeeping item on the quarter; one of the big variances versus our model was the other category in your SOI bridge. Could you give us a little bit more color on what was in that? Some of that I believe is Amiens, maybe $15 million to $20 million or so, but what was the other big chunk of that bucket?","Laura Thompson","Yes. So of course as others always are there\u2019s just a large list of things that go in there, but I\u2019d probably say the two biggest items in there, as you mentioned, are Amiens. That was is about $8 million in the first quarter. We still expect $20 million for the full year, but as you think about our exit of the farm tire business is what kind of changes which quarters that $20 million shows up in. But a big piece of the $41 million of other was related to Amiens. And the other maybe $12 million to $13 million I would just categorize as kind of structural changes we made in some of our pension plans, you know, not just in the U.S. as well as in places like the U.K. that have given us a benefit also as part of that $41 million.","Robert Higginbotham","All right. And one last question. What\u2019s your updated view on capacity growth around the globe, both HVA and non-HVA, LVA product?","Richard Kramer","I don\u2019t think we have any real changes, Robert, in terms of our view. I will tell you as we\u2019ve gone through and made the announcement for our Americas factory last week, we had a very lengthy assessment internally, as you might imagine, going through both an assessment of supply demand global on HVA. And LVA, as you know, we tend to be, we have to be very frugal with our cash and very analytical about the investments that we make. And as we looked at it, we looked at the industry demand by tire type, we looked at what our competitors were doing from a capacity standpoint, we looked at when that capacity\u2019s coming on line and we still concluded that the demand for HVA tires was there for the industry and certainly as we looked at our customers asking us for more of Goodyear-branded HVA product, we\u2019re very comfortable with the decision we\u2019ve made. And I think very \u2013 had a very thoughtful process to get to the conclusion we came to, to invest in that new factory.","Robert Higginbotham","Okay. Thank you.","Richard Kramer","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Emmanuel Rosner with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Emmanuel Rosner","Hi, good morning, everybody.","Richard Kramer","Hello, Emmanuel. How are you?","Emmanuel Rosner","Good. How are you?","Richard Kramer","Good. Thanks.","Emmanuel Rosner","So my first question is on the volume growth. You are off to a very strong start to 2015, probably at the high end of what you were saying for the full year. And I guess my question is around how sustainable do you view this solid growth as we go through the year? Is it really mostly a function of easier comp and then maybe catch up from selling fewer tires in the past few quarters because of the Chinese pre-buy? Or have we really just turned a corner in terms of your refocusing away from less attractive business and now we can really see some real strong underlying trends in your numbers?","Richard Kramer","Well, you know, Emmanuel, I would say again that we\u2019re on the strategy that we\u2019ve put forward. Our strategy, as you know, is always not to pursue volume for volumes sake and our strategy has been to focus on selling in our targeted market segments where we can get value for the Goodyear brand. And I can confirm to you that, that won\u2019t change in terms of how we\u2019re looking at our volume growth over the period. And I would say that our 1% to 2% volume forecast, we\u2019re very comfortable with it at the moment.","I would say in North America clearly in the quarter there is an impact relative to Goodyear\u2019s performance versus the industry and just the sways of pre-buys, but if you look at it around the world, the comments I made in Latin America, we\u2019re gaining a tremendous amount of traction there. Asia we had very good growth in both the Consumer Replacement and the Consumer OE business there. And again back to North America, I think the demand for our products remains very, very strong. You\u2019ve seen that in the quarter, and we only see that increasing.","So certainly I would say that the progress that we\u2019ve seen is something that we\u2019ve been working toward and we expect to deliver. Could it be at the higher end of the range? Could it be above 2%? Look, that\u2019s not something we\u2019re willing to forecast at this point. What we\u2019re doing is focusing on the plan that we put in place, and we\u2019re very comfortable with the guidance that we\u2019ve given.","Emmanuel Rosner","Okay. And then second question on the pricing piece of your SOI walk. I was a little bit surprised by the, I guess, small magnitude of the price decline. I\u2019m talking about price mix on the growth basis. We\u2019ve been used to anywhere between $70 million to $100 million per quarter in each past of the two years, and right now we\u2019re really talking about a really small price decline or I guess price mix decline. Is it really a function of better pricing trends or is it really more the mix?","Laura Thompson","Yes, you know, one thing that while we talked earlier that OTR for us in 2015 won\u2019t be a negative year-over-year, last year OTR was a big driver, a negative driver, in mix, if you\u2019ll recall. And I think actually I can\u2019t remember second or third quarter was quite a large number, almost $100 million for the full year. So I think that\u2019s one of the things that is different as you look at 2015. That\u2019s a big diver of why it\u2019s different this quarter.","Emmanuel Rosner","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then maybe final one on the European margins; obviously there\u2019s some currency headwinds but the margins took a little step back. Do you still believe that you can get back to the historical margin levels by next year or is it more complicated with the current currency levels?","Laura Thompson","Yes, you know what, while there is currency the other thing that is a big driver of that in the first quarter is the weather, right? So the warm weather in the fourth quarter that caused us production cuts hit the P&L in the first quarter. So that is really the big driver for Europe in terms of their margin. Now again as Rich mentioned, we feel very good about what we\u2019ve done in our targeted market segments there. So I think as we move forward, none of the overhead that\u2019s hitting the P&L in the first quarter should not be anywhere near as severe.","Emmanuel Rosner","Perfect. Thank you very much.","Laura Thompson","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today\u2019s Q&A portion of our program. I\u2019ll turn it back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.","Richard Kramer","I just want to thank everyone for joining us today. We appreciate it.","Laura Thompson","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","And this does conclude today\u2019s program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect. And have a great day."],"10373":["The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (NASDAQ:GT) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call February 11, 2020  9:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Nick Mitchell - Senior Director, Investor Relations","Rich Kramer - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Darren Wells - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan","John Healy - Northcoast Research","Rod Lache - Wolfe Research","James Picariello - KeyBanc","Itay Michaeli - Citi","Operator","Good morning. My name is Keith and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to Goodyear's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I will now hand the program over to Nick Mitchell, Senior Director Investor Relations.","Nick Mitchell","Thank you, Keith and thank you everyone for joining us for Goodyear's fourth quarter 2019 earnings call. I'm joined here today by Rich Kramer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Darren Wells, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","The supporting slide presentation for today's call can be found on our website at investor.goodyear.com and a replay of this call will be available later today. Replay instructions were included in our earnings release issued earlier this morning.","If I could draw -- now draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2 I would like to remind participants on today's call that our presentation includes some forward-looking statements about Goodyear's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments today. The most significant factors that could affect future results are outlined in Goodyear's filings with the SEC and in our earnings release.","The company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise. Our financial results are presented on a GAAP basis and in some cases a non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures discussed on the call are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent as part of the appendix to the slide presentation.","And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rich.","Rich Kramer","Great. Thank you, Nick and good morning everyone. During today's call, I'll share some highlights of our fourth quarter performance and discuss the market environment in each of our regions as we look ahead. Darren will follow with a review of our financial performance as well as cover some of the puts-and-takes as it relates to our first quarter and full year 2020 outlook.","Notwithstanding a challenging environment, I was very pleased with the progress we made on multiple fronts during the quarter. First, we continued to see a positive trend in price versus raw materials, reflecting the actions we've taken to capture more value in the marketplace, especially in the United States.","Second, the working capital initiatives we implemented earlier in the year helped drive more than a 40% increase in our cash flow from operations during the quarter. This performance was ahead of our expectations.","Third, in Americas, our U.S. consumer replacement business gained share during the fourth quarter capping off a year of outperformance. Unit volume increased 2% driven by growth in the high-margin premium segments of the market. Shipments of large-rim diameter tires increased 8% significantly outpacing the industry. This benefit stems from our consistent investments we've made in our product portfolio.","Over the past three years, we've launched 10 major product lines to bolster our product offerings including the Eagle Exhilarate, the Assurance MaxLife, and the Assurance WeatherReady. And not only is the vitality of our products strong, these lines are among the industry's best with both consumers and trade magazines praising the innovation that we're bringing to the market.","In 2019, the Eagle Exhilarate earned the coveted number one rating in the ultra high-performance all-season tire category from a leading consumer magazine. The Assurance MaxLife is ranked number one in its category in the key consumer rankings reflecting its long-wear reliability and value. And the WeatherReady with its soybean oil-based tread compound illustrates our commitment to developing top-performing products while having a positive impact on the environment.","Consumers only purchase tires once every three to four years. So, for those entering the market in 2020, we have a lot of top new product offerings for those consumers. And we expect to build off the momentum we have with the planned launch of two important products this year, the Assurance ComfortDrive and the WinterCommand Ultra. We unveiled both at our North America dealer conference earlier this month and the feedback was overwhelmingly positive.","The ComfortDrive is a premium tire for the commuter-touring category which accounts for approximately 50% of the U.S. market. This line offers premium comfort noise cancellation and superior wet performance. The WinterCommand Ultra offers premium ice and snow performance positioning our dealers to win in the winter category.","Fourth, our U.S. commercial replacement business also continued to outperform the market. Shipments increased 1% significantly outpacing a 16% decline in industry demand. This speaks volumes about the value commercial truck operators see in our fleet solutions our product offerings and our people.","In fact, our commercial truck tire portfolio has never been stronger. The Endurance LHS our premium high-mileage long-haul steer tire continues to drive impressive results with fleet customers. We're also seeing favorable response to the Goodyear Marathon RTD and UltraGrip RTD that we launched in the second half of last year to service the rapidly growing regional trucking segment.","Fifth, in Latin America, our consumer replacement business continued to grow. Replacement volume increased 4% driven by double-digit growth in Brazil and we grew our commercial truck tire volume despite a difficult economic environment in the region.","Sixth, we continue to see better results in China relative to earlier in the year with our consumer OE and replacement shipments both increasing during the quarter. And finally, we continue to grow our future OE portfolio winning more than our targeted number of fitments with particular strength in Europe and Asia.","Having recently been with our customers at our Annual North America Customer Conference, our 100-year anniversary in Brazil and multiple customer events in Europe, I can confidently say their attitudes in support of Goodyear, our products and our leadership have never been stronger.","So, while I feel really good about these positives, we have to be realistic about the challenges we see in the industry environment, as well as the issues we have in distribution affecting our European consumer replacement business. So let me address both.","During the quarter, while U.S. market conditions remained largely stable, outside the U.S. we faced a challenging industry environment, including recessionary demand trends in several of our key international markets. Our business in Europe, Middle East and Africa faced a more challenging environment during the quarter than we anticipated contributing to a 4% decline in total volume.","OE volume continued to be negatively impacted by lower light vehicle production and the downturn in the commercial truck cycle. Demand in the European consumer replacement segment remained lethargic. Industry shipments declined 3% in the EU, well below the more normalized rate of 1% to 2% growth. We'd expect to see in the region.","This weakness was most pronounced in the winter category, which declined 6%, reflecting warm temperatures this season. The recessionary conditions in Germany are most certainly negatively impacting its auto industry and our industry as well.","In China, we continue to face a very challenging OE environment and the timing of a significant recovery continues to be pushed out with some forecasters expecting a third year of decline, with a significant deterioration in the first quarter.","I also want to take a moment to acknowledge the dynamic situation, our employees and partners in China and the Asia Pacific region are navigating, as health officials respond to the coronavirus. Our primary focus remains on the well-being of our associates.","Our manufacturing plant in Pulandian restarted operations on a limited basis yesterday and it's clear that production and demand will be affected during the first quarter. As the situation develops, we will update you as to our near-term business impacts.","While the challenging industry environment clearly affected our results this year, I'm not happy with how our EMEA business performed in 2019. We are capable of delivering significantly higher segment operating income margins even in challenging conditions.","In 2019, we launched a major modernization and restructuring program in Germany, which will generate significant savings over the next few years. In addition, we remain focused on cost control and the appropriate level of investment in EMEA going forward. However, our lack of progress in distribution has resulted in unstable volume and reduced our value proposition in the marketplace, despite a leading product portfolio.","This year, we're proactively strengthening our distribution in the region. We're focusing our efforts on developing a select number of full-service distributors that have the talent and logistics capabilities required to support our brands in the marketplace. This is a strategy that has worked for us in the past. As you may recall our shift to align distribution in the U.S. played a pivotal role in the margin expansion in our Americas business. I'm confident we will be successful in Europe.","In addition to addressing distribution challenges in Europe, there are a number of other actions we're taking to drive our future results. We are capitalizing on the shift to electric powertrains. Our industry-leading innovation is helping to significantly increase our OE win rates. In 2019, we grew our OE pipeline at a faster-than-anticipated pace with 25% of the fitments won planned for electric were hybrid vehicles.","We're also investing to enhance our product development capabilities. In January, we became the first tire manufacturer to purchase a dynamic driving simulator. This state-of-the-art simulator will allow us to work more collaboratively with automobile manufacturers and simulate a wide range of driving conditions helping us generate breakthroughs in tire development, while reducing development time and cost.","And we're not just investing in our products, the investments that we're making in our digital capabilities and e-commerce platforms, continues to help us connect with consumers. In fact, our research suggests that more than one-third of the tires purchased through the Goodyear tire and service network followed a visit to goodyear.com.","We see the results in our retail stores, including Roll by Goodyear and in aligned retailers as well. And we're also increasing our service offerings. With ton mileage for heavy and medium-duty trucks expected to remain strong and the shift to e-commerce creating more complexity than ever for logistics companies, it's imperative that we continue investing in our business to ensure we can help fleets reduce both downtime and costs.","We're investing in our distribution and service capabilities to help us achieve these goals. During the fourth quarter, we acquired Raben Tire one of the largest tire and service companies in the Midwest. This move strengthens the combined nationwide capabilities of our Goodyear commercial truck service centers, which means, enhanced service levels for our fleet customers. We're also expanding our fleet solutions.","On last year's fourth quarter earnings call, I discussed our Tire Optix tool that we launched in 2018 to help fleets efficiently monitor tire inflation and tread depth. In 2019, Tire Optix inspected nearly two million tires. This year, we're launching Goodyear CheckPoint, an in-ground device that scans passing tires to measure pressure tread depth and load, valuable data that help service crews manage tire maintenance.","And at our dealer conference, we introduced TPMS Plus, which leverages on-vehicle sensors to monitor tire conditions in real time. Our Goodyear fleetHQ assists in routing the driver to the closest dealer in the Goodyear service network or dispatches roadside assistance. All these initiatives are designed to minimize downtime and support increased safety for our fleet customers to drive operating efficiencies in their businesses. Our fleet services offerings is fully operational, with millions of service calls already performed and only getting stronger with digital technology advancements.","As we execute on these priorities, it's also important that we continue adapting our business model for the secular trends in the auto industry, including shared and autonomous mobility. Ultimately, these trends will be responsible for determining the winners of tomorrow and will have an increasingly important impact on the future of our industry.","As we enter the new decade, it's clear, that the inflection point in new mobility is here. The change driven by the electrification of vehicles, shared mobility and the commercialization of autonomous vehicles are resulting in a restructuring of the legacy auto industry and significant R&D investments. At Goodyear, we have proactively embraced this change, leaning forward and adapting our business in meaningful ways. This will ensure that we can continue supplying the right products and tools to help consumer and commercial fleets on the road.","At the Consumer Electronics Show, we introduced our intelligent tire, which is now operational in pilot fleet programs. This technology, allows us to continuously monitor tire temperature, tire wear and tire pressure with more to come. By using the power of cloud computing and Goodyear proprietary predictive algorithms, we can turn the data we capture into valuable insights and real-time performance enhancements to maximize fleet uptime, a perfect solution for driverless vehicles.","We also unveiled AndGo, a digital servicing platform designed to enhance fleet performance and safety that is backed by our trusted brand, national service network and software solutions. AndGo is currently available in select markets in California and will expand to additional markets in the middle of this year.","Advancements in new mobility present the single most significant opportunity in the last 50 years for Tier one tire companies like Goodyear to create competitive advantage and further distinguish ourselves from low-end opening price point tire companies. Why do we conclude that? Well, first, the tire is not going anywhere. Driver or no driver, car ownership or shared mobility, the tires, the tire industry and Goodyear will be there.","Second, requirements like tire technology and connectivity are proving to be more integral to the performance, the safety and the ride of the vehicle. This will only become more evident with time as autonomous vehicle driver systems are perfected. Tire technology is rapidly advancing to meet the needs of electric vehicles, including range, ride and handling and durability improvements. Intelligent tires will be integrated into autonomous driving systems. Fit-for-purpose tires to complement fit-for-purpose vehicles are coming. And at the same time, material and design changes will create more sustainable products along the way.","Finally, the trend of shared mobility is creating significant growth opportunities in consumer and commercial fleet services and new and growing profit pools. These dynamics play to our strength, which is why we're embracing the transition to new mobility and committed to leading the way forward in our industry.","Now, I'm going to turn the call over to Darren.","Darren Wells","Thanks, Rich. I have to agree with Rich's level of excitement, about the impact, our investments in technology and service offerings are going to have on our business as market evolves. In addition, there are a number of actions I'll cover today that will support improved results over the next two to three years, as we work on those longer-term programs and as we move through the recessionary environment we're seeing right now across much of the world.","Turning to the fourth quarter, while several of the positive developments from the third quarter continued to benefit our business, our results fell short of our expectations. As I reflect on our performance, three factors stand out is impacting our results relative to our thinking last time we spoke. First, our OE business faced significantly -- significant incremental headwinds, reflecting continued year-over-year declines in light vehicle production as well as the downturn in the U.S. and European commercial truck cycles.","Light vehicle production declined 5%, including the impact of the OE strike in the U.S., which was a deterioration from the third quarter. And the downturn in commercial truck builds in EMEA and the Americas accelerated in the period, further reducing demand for high-margin commercial truck tires.","Second, demand for consumer replacement tires remained at recessionary levels in Europe. Industry shipments fell 3% in the EU driven by declines in the winter category. Shipments of winter tires declined 6%. We gained share in this important category during the period. However, our volume and price\/mix performances were significantly impacted by the loss of winter tire business.","Third as always recessionary industry conditions are resulting in increased competitive pressures. These conditions are making it difficult for us to capture the full value of our products and geographies where demand is the weakest, including OE markets in Europe and China where customers have been particularly aggressive in demanding price reductions on legacy fitments.","Despite these near-term challenges our OE pipeline remains strong and we continue to expect significant volume growth in this channel through 2022, driven by improving win rates including on high-value electric vehicle fitments. As we've discussed before, the weight and torque associated with electric powertrains makes tire design much more complicated. This reduces the number of capable suppliers and has resulted in our win rate on EV fitments being significantly higher.","In the consumer replacement business, we continue to improve our performance in the Americas. We increased share and benefited from actions we've taken to recover the impact of higher raw material costs in recent years. These achievements helped us deliver significantly higher earnings and margins in our replacement business in the Americas compared to the prior year.","Turning to Slide 10. Our fourth quarter sales were $3.7 billion down 4% from last year driven by lower volume and unfavorable foreign currency translation. These effects were partially offset by improvements in price\/mix primarily in EMEA and the Americas.","Unit volume decreased 2%. The decline was more than explained by lower OE shipments reflecting lower global vehicle production and the continued impact of strategic actions we've taken to renew our OE portfolio.","Replacement shipments increased slightly with continued strength in the Americas more than offsetting ongoing softness in EMEA and weakness in Asia Pacific particularly in Japan.","Segment operating income for the quarter was $242 million down $65 million from a year ago. About half of this decline came from a decrease in favorable indirect tax settlements in Brazil and the impact of the OE strike in the U.S.. Our results were influenced by certain significant items. And after adjusting for these items, earnings per share on a diluted basis were $0.19.","The step chart on Slide 11 summarizes the change in segment operating income versus last year. The negative impact from volume was $19 million. In addition production cuts taken during the third quarter including those related to the OE strike in the U.S. resulted in lower overhead absorption and a negative impact of $26 million.","While these production cuts negatively affected our earnings they were the appropriate response as they contributed to our favorable working capital performance in 2019. Raw material costs increased $19 million driven by the unfavorable transactional impact of foreign currency and higher non-feedstock costs.","We saw less benefit than we expected from lower feedstock costs given slower inventory turns reflecting softer-than-planned demand. Price\/mix was favorable by $32 million reflecting the continued benefit from our pricing actions particularly in the Americas.","Price\/mix benefits were reduced by lower-than-expected winter tire shipments in Europe and continuing customer and channel mix challenges in the Americas. Inflation of $46 million more than offset cost savings of $45 million, it's important to recall that last year's costs were net $21 million lower as a result of indirect tax settlements in Brazil.","Excluding this impact, cost savings this year would have been $66 million and would have exceeded inflation by approximately $20 million. The negative effect of foreign currency translation totaled $9 million. The $23 million decline in the other category was driven by higher incentive compensation and R&D costs, partly offset by lower start-up costs and a favorable impact of our equity interest in tire hub which improved by $4 million year-over-year.","Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 12, net debt totaled $4.8 billion down $207 million from a year ago reflecting strong cash flow and improved working capital management. Our liquidity profile remains strong with approximately $4.5 billion in cash and available credit at the end of the quarter. This is an improvement of over $500 million from the previous year reflecting our strong free cash flow performance during the fourth quarter and the increase in the size of our European revolving credit facility last March.","Slide 14 summarizes our cash flows. We generated $1.3 billion from operating activities, an increase of $406 million compared to the previous year. This improvement was driven by strong working capital performance, reflecting initiatives we implemented over the course of the year.","Capital expenditures for Q4 were $209 million. We slowed down our capital spending plan significantly in the second half to reflect weakening market conditions. For the full year we generated free cash flow of $437 million, allowing us to cover our dividend and decrease our net debt.","Turning to our segment results beginning on Slide 15. Americas' volume decreased 2% to $18.7 million. The decline was more than explained by lower shipments in our consumer OE business, primarily in the U.S. More than half of the decline in the U.S. resulted from the OE strike with the remainder largely a function of actions we've taken in previous quarters to reduce our exposure to older fitments, especially those on passenger cars which continued to decline as a percent of new car sales. Shipments of replacement tires increased 2% driven by solid growth in the U.S. and Brazil.","Segment operating income was $152 million, down $27 million from last year. The decline was more than explained by a decrease in indirect tax settlements in Brazil and the impact of the OE strike. These factors were partially offset by improved price\/mix net of higher raw material costs and the benefit of net cost savings.","Throughout 2019, we took several actions to strengthen the competitiveness of our manufacturing footprint in the Americas and curtailed production of tires for declining less profitable segments of the market. Last February, we transitioned our manufacturing facility in Gadsden, Alabama to a five-day production schedule in response to declining demand for small-rim diameter tires that are produced at the factory.","During the fourth quarter, we offered voluntary buyouts to certain associates in the plant. Combined these actions have allowed us to reduce our labor costs. However, they resulted in near-term manufacturing inefficiencies for two reasons. First, we're transitioning certain SKUs from our Gadsden facility to other plants in our U.S. footprint, which necessitates short-term development and ramp-up costs.","Second, the Gadsden facility is operating at low volumes. This will result in a write-off in Q1 of about $15 million of overhead related to Q1 production. These transitional manufacturing costs are expected to offset savings from our recent restructuring in the near term.","Turning to slide 16. Europe, Middle East and Africa's unit sales were down approximately 4% driven by a decline in our OE business. Our consumer replacement shipments fell 2% reflecting weak industry conditions in Europe. Shipments of high-margin winter tires declined 5%. While this performance was slightly better than the market, the absolute decline in winter shipments adversely affected both volume and mix.","Segment operating income was $38 million. The decrease versus last year was driven by lower volume, wage inflation and higher unabsorbed overhead reflecting production cuts in Q3.","Turning to slide 17. Asia Pacific tire units totaled $7.9 million effectively flat with last year, as growth in OE was offset by softness in our replacement business. OE shipments increased 4% driven by some recovery in China. Replacement shipments declined by 3% more than explained by a decline in consumer replacement industry volume in Japan. Excluding Japan shipments of consumer replacement tires increased 5% driven by growth in China.","Segment operating income was $52 million, $2 million lower than in the previous year. This variance primarily reflects lower price\/mix and unfavorable foreign currency translation.","Turning to slide 18. I'd like to share some information regarding the restructuring of our distribution in Europe. On our last call, we indicated the volume situation in Europe has been exacerbated by poor performance in our distribution channels. This reflects a lack of alignment the results from distribution lacking focus on our brands. This is similar to the situation we faced here in North America a few years ago.","As you can see on the slide, the majority of our volume in Europe flows directly from our warehouses to align channels, including traditional franchise retail, car dealers and certain B2C e-commerce channels. However, about 12 million tires are sold to wholesale distributors or large retail chains that are not as focused on the health or growth of our brands.","With our aligned distribution initiative, we are signing agreements with full-service distributors covering each geography that will have increased focus on our brands. This will require us to shift many of the nine million units that are currently sold through online channels to full-service distributors.","As a result, we expect to experience some sell-in volume loss during the transition. In 2020, this could negatively affect volume by as much as 1.5 million units. Over time, we expect to fully recover this volume and strengthen our position and improve the stability of our business. In the U.S. this improvement delivered added net revenue per tire of $2 to $4 a unit across our entire replacement business and we see no reason why the benefit would not be similar in Europe.","Turning to slide 19. You will see several of the key factors that we anticipate impacting our first quarter results when compared to the previous year, including unabsorbed overhead from the production cuts we took in Q4, which reduced our Q4 production by about one million units year-over-year.","We continue to expect recessionary OE demand in several geographies including Europe, China and India. More importantly, we see little evidence that suggests the global OE environment will improve in the near term. In fact third-party estimates of global light vehicle production continued to be revised lower, with forecasts pointing to a 6% decline in the first quarter including a 13% decline in China. And from our vantage point, the risk to full year auto production estimates are building.","In total we anticipate our consumer OE volume declining by about two million units this year with approximately three quarters of the decline occurring in Asia Pacific.","At this point, our thinking excludes any impact of the coronavirus. Given the dynamic nature of circumstances, the duration of the business disruption and related financial impacts can't really be estimated yet.","Slide 20, again, reflects on several of the positive factors that give us optimism as we look at the next two to three years. In July, we talked about the first three items; our planned restructuring actions, the growth we expect in our OE business given our recent win rate and continued recovery of price versus raw materials.","We would now add two other items; first, improving mix, which was about $80 million negative for us in 2019, but began to recover in Q4; and second, the benefits of the restructuring of our distribution in Europe. We'll continue to keep you up-to-date as these plans and expectations play out.","Turning to slide 21, we've included our current financial assumptions for 2020. We are forecasting raw material costs to be approximately flat excluding the impact of transactional foreign currency as higher non-feedstock costs are expected to offset the benefit of lower commodity costs. While we will benefit from replacement price increases late last year, we expect the benefit of these increases to be largely offset by lower OE prices. We plan capital expenditures of about $800 million effectively in line with depreciation.","At this point, we're expecting $50 million to $100 million use of cash for working capital to reflect some timing differences versus 2019. However, we gained good traction with working capital initiatives that we implemented last year and similar to last year I hope to improve on this view as the year progresses.","Restructuring cash outlays are expected to total $125 million to $150 million. The increase in restructuring payments reflects the actions we are taking both in EMEA and in the U.S.","We expect our book and cash tax rates to be very sensitive to small changes in income in 2020. Given our distribution initiative and tax framework in EMEA, our global tax rates will likely be volatile. Cash taxes are expected to range between $130 million and $140 million for the year. But book tax levels will depend to a great degree on geographic profitability in EMEA, which is hard to predict with precision. We will update you on our thinking as the year progresses, but the book tax rate in Q4 was close to 50% and could be even higher at times during 2020.","And finally you will find a few other reference slides in our deck. Slides 25 through 27 provide an updated breakdown of our raw material costs by major commodity as well as providing some continued analysis of the price versus raw material cycle.","Slide 28 provides an updated breakdown of our consumer business between large-rim and smaller-rim diameter tires for 2019.","Slide 29 provides our current expectations for industry shipment growth for the U.S. and Western Europe. And slide 24 contains updated modeling assumptions that will be useful as you develop your forecast.","There are a few significant changes I would point out in our modeling assumptions page. Our volume sensitivities have been adjusted to reflect recent share and market data, particularly the near-term decline we discussed in consumer OE.","Our assumption for profit margins per tire for the OE business have been adjusted down to reflect recent trends including increased price pressure. We've refined our estimates of the impact of pricing on the replacement business to exclude some revenue to, which replacement pricing does not apply. The biggest change was in Europe.","And finally, the impact of raw materials percentage price changes has been reduced slightly given recent lower prices and lower volumes.","Now, we'll open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Ryan Brinkman","Great. Thanks for taking my question.","Rich Kramer","Good morning, Ryan.","Ryan Brinkman","Good morning. You mentioned on slide 19 that in the first quarter of 2020 depressed OE demand and restructurings and distribution changes are expected to more than offset the impact of improved pricing environment. I'm not sure if those comments are year-over-year. And so the implication is first quarter SOI, should then be below last year's level. I don't know if that's the case?","And then secondly, what magnitude of price\/mix gains could be reasonably expected for 2020? And do you think those gains are enough to be able to offset these other headwinds to drive higher SOI in the remaining quarters of the year beyond 1Q absent the unknown impact of coronavirus?","Darren Wells","So Ryan let me take a shot at 2020, because I think you're -- the view on slide 19 to be clear that is a year-over-year view. So that -- the pluses and minuses there are meant to indicate how we feel like the first quarter might evolve versus a year ago. So, obviously, a lot of minuses on the page.","As we look at 2020 segment operating income. I think we look at volume as something that clearly is going to create some pressure. We're operating in an environment where we're expecting the industry to be largely flat, and for us to have a couple of unique factors impacting our volume.","One of those is risk of up to 1.5 million units for their distribution transition that we're going through in Europe, and so we expect that to be a hit for us. We also are -- in our OE volume -- we're expecting our OE volume to be down a couple of million units in a relatively flat industry and most of that drop coming in Asia Pacific. And there's a specific issue that we encountered in China that has resulted in us losing some OE business there.","So, that is part of what's driving a couple of million unit drop in OE volume for us for the year, and that's before we take into account any impact of the coronavirus. So, we've got a couple of things there that are driving volume down in addition to an industry that's not very robust.","With regard to pricing, I think the point we made there is we will get some benefit, carryover benefit from pricing actions that we took in the second half of 2019. However, that's going to be largely offset by price decreases that we've encountered at OE. So, between the impact of raw material indices and just pure price reductions that have been demanded by the OEs and have been become part of the market. I think both those things are going to offset to a great degree the pricing that we would get in replacement during 2020.","Mix is a little less certain. And after mix being a negative for us for the first three quarters of 2019. In the fourth quarter, it was still slightly negative, but essentially flat. I think we're moving in the right direction. It's improving. I think we're hoping that we can drive some positive mix in the year. So, if we take price and mix together not getting a lot of benefit there, and fortunately raw materials we see as flat.","The only point I'll make on raw material cost is that this -- our forecast for raw material costs being flat excluding the impact of currency does assume that there is some recovery in the price of butadiene and carbon black. If we don't see prices of butadiene and carbon black recover and get back to something on average similar to 2019 then there would be about an $80 million benefit. And so that -- a couple of different views you could take on raw materials. We're taking the assumption right now that it's flat similar to the industry being flat.","We have some opportunity for net cost savings. And that has been sort of $10 million a quarter or so for us in 2019 so get a little bit of benefit there. Restructuring cost savings, quite honestly, are largely going to come in 2021 for the programs that we have in Europe and the U.S. So -- and we've got some slight currency headwinds. So, you take it all together, I think the view for the first quarter and for the full year is that we need the environment to improve to see higher SOI in 2020.","Ryan Brinkman","Okay, great. Thanks. And then just lastly for me. It looks like you are planning to spend some more cash restructuring this year than in some prior years. You've expressed some dissatisfaction with your performance level in EMEA. Is it fair to assume that restructuring efforts will be concentrated there then?","And I thought I heard you in your prepared remarks say too that you're focused on having the right level of investment in Europe going forward. Are you contemplating any potential changes to the scope of your operations there, or should we just expect a more traditional restructuring?","Darren Wells","Yeah. I think the restructuring actions that we've taken have fallen in the category of trying to reduce our less capable higher cost manufacturing capacity and also to reduce the -- our level of salaried headcount. And both of those have been part of the plans that we've had in Europe and continue to be.","The biggest issue that we face business-wise in Europe right now, I think is the alignment with our distribution channels. And therefore, that's where we're putting a lot of time and attention. But as we move through 2020 into 2021, we should see some benefit in recovering volume on our distribution channels, and we'll start to see some of the cost benefit from the two factory downsizings that we announced last year for our factories in Germany.","Clearly in Europe and in fact in the company overall, we'll continue to look at additional restructuring opportunities, just given the softness in the markets we're in and the part of the cycle that we're in.","Ryan Brinkman","Okay, great. Thank you.","Darren Wells","That\u2019s okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Healy with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.","John Healy","Thank you. Darren, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the European distribution efforts. Just hoping to understand maybe a little bit more granular kind of how those new channels might look compared to what you did in 2019, and additionally how that 1.5 million unit volume might flow through the year. Should it be first half weighted or second half weighted?","Darren Wells","Yes. Well, so John let me take the second question first. I think the \u2013 I mean the European business is characterized by a couple of seasonal sell-in periods. And so I think that effectively what that means is that the volume impact is going to be spread pretty evenly throughout the year, as we move through the need to reposition inventory, trade inventory toward our aligned distributors.","And I think the way you can envision this is we're \u2013 the number of aligned distributors we have is directionally sort of half the number that we've been working with. And we're asking and working with each of them to increase their capacity both in warehousing and in transportation in order to be able to handle higher volume in our brands and that will take them some time to do. And so they'll work through the increases in those capacities.","At the same time, the distributors that either we have not chosen to work with as full-service distributors or who have themselves chosen, not to want to put the additional resource into our brands, they're going to gradually be destocking. And I think that destocking process probably takes a bit longer than the inventory growth in the aligned distributors takes. And that is going to reduce the sell-in volume that we experienced during the year and it may in fact impact sell-in volume more than it impacts sellout volume. And certainly that's our expectation.","So in some ways similar to the expectations that we had had for TireHub, although in the TireHub transition, we certainly had a better outcome than we expected. And obviously, we'll work on improving on the outlook here as well. But that process started for us in January. So it is ongoing right now.","We're doing it in a market that's already a bit soft. So I think there's a number of things that are going to be playing into this program. Importantly though, I think we're looking at this as an opportunity to reposition our volume and to put us in a position where we can get full value in the marketplace for our brands and reduce unneeded multiple touches in distribution so that \u2013 which is obviously cost that we don't want to pay for and consumers don't want to pay for. So I think there's really good opportunity there for us to drive our earnings in Europe in 2021, 2022 and beyond.","John Healy","Sounds good. And then a question for you Rich. As it relates to the coronavirus, I understand that it's impacting production in China for you guys but was \u2013 wanted to get your big-picture thoughts if you think that this has an impact on the U.S. replacement market. I know a lot of import tires come in from the region. And as you look out to the spring, do you think the industry as a whole is in a position where potentially there can be tire shortages? And do you think the company is positioned to benefit from that potentially with most of its U.S. production in the U.S. or in Mexico?","Rich Kramer","Yes. I think it's a bit hard to predict given all the variables that would have to happen to have that play out. I think the two things that I would consider in thinking about that and that's the channel inventories are pretty much in good shape, so there's not a lot of excess tires out there at the moment. So any disruption that were to happen I think, people aren't sitting on long inventories at the moment. But again it's really hard to have to predict what would have to happen for all those things to fall in place to happen. So it's too early to say that.","I'd also just say that that situation would largely impact the low end of the market again and that's not exactly as you know where we play. So I think that the focus that we have and will continue to have is really winning in the markets in the segments of the market where we know we have a value proposition that works. So a long way of saying, don't really know what will happen but we don't see that as really a big opportunity or a big impact for us as we look forward.","John Healy","Understood. Thank you, guys.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Rich Kramer","Good morning, Rod.","Rod Lache","Good morning. I had a couple of questions. Just first could you just give us a little bit more insight into what's behind these additional pricing concessions on OE? Like you said, it goes beyond the contractual pass-throughs on raw materials. And obviously, OEs always demand pricing. But until recently you're pretty disciplined on that?","Rich Kramer","Yes, Rod. I think maybe I'll take a step back a little bit as we think about the OE business, which we love and will continue to love going forward. If you look over the last 10 years a situation you're very familiar with and most people on the call are, we've seen a technical requirements for the tires that we've been supplying increase dramatically, whether that be in rim size or rolling resistance or ride and handling or whatever else it might be.","We and other tire companies obviously put the investments in place to supply that. And we had certainly an added a margin opportunity for the advanced fitments that we were supplying there. And as a result, our OE profitability increased fairly substantially and that probably peaked two to three years ago. And since then, what have we seen? I think the first thing is probably what you put in the normal bucket, which is just the normal down cycle or cyclicality that the OE industry is going through. And when that happens, obviously that has an impact through the supply chain.","The second thing and probably a bit more unique is the increased focus and investment that's going into EVs and simultaneously the increased focus on cost reductions that are going into sort of the legacy internal combustion engine fitments that they still have to make. So you have those things coming in. And as you put those together, you've got some margin compression that I think is hitting the supply chain including us as we look ahead. So their focus on cost down cycle in the industry a few more tires available out there because of that I think is what's behind that.","But having said that, look, we've been through these things before. And as we look ahead, I'm frankly more excited about where we're going in our OE business because we're getting out of the sort of traditional supply of the 15- and 16-inch tires that are still needed out there and so on and so forth. And our focus goes to the EVs and tires with even higher technical demands around waste work and noise. And we're finding out that few people a few other companies can actually do this. This is what we're told in the marketplace.","So our win rate on these is substantial. I mean in the last 18 to 24 months our win rate on the EVs we're bidding on is sort of two out of three. So I'm -- I appreciate having gone through this. I think now a couple of times before with the OEs that over time I'm confident the benefits from these future fitments is certainly going to balance off the compression on some of the traditional fitments that we have now. But in the near term, we'll have to work through some of the price pressure that I think you understand well.","Rod Lache","Okay. And just thinking about the bridge, it sounds like you're expecting a 1.5 million unit decline in replacement which using your sensitivity to volume and overhead that's about $30 million. The OE 2 million unit decline is about $40 million negative and you've got the $15 million Gadsden impact. It seems like that would be offset by -- if you use spot prices for raw materials that's $80 million positive and you said $10 million a quarter or $40 million on the cost. What happened to some of the other idiosyncratic positives that you've talked about before like the actual savings from the Gadsden headcount or the German headcount reduction and plant closure or the TireHub losses declining? And I think you've also mentioned before that some of that seven million of new OE fitment starts to come in?","Darren Wells","Yes. So I think Rod on the last point that you made, the OE fitments for us we're going to -- I mean, we effectively bought them out in 2020 and we start to rebuild the portfolio in 2021. Yes, so the -- when we've talked about the increase that we expected, which is sort of 7 million units off of last year's base that's targeting out like 2022. So it's 2021, 2022 where the regrowth in OE is taking place. So that's where we start to recover that volume.","The restructuring actions in Germany and Gadsden are still sort of in process right now. So the headcount reductions are going to take us a good part of this year to execute. So the savings from those aren't going to be fully ramped up until next year. And 2020 is going to be the year that we get the transitional cost impact from changes we have to go through to move products around as well as in the case of Gadsden running a factory that is a relatively high-cost location running one shift. So there is -- even without the headcount, there's a lot of associated costs for the factory that create a drag.","So I think what we're looking at -- and we have to recognize that -- so 2020 isn't going to get a lot of benefit. I think we're continuing to look at and will target additional actions during the year to do what we can to accelerate it and to try to increase the savings that we're getting. But in fact the benefits we're going to get are largely going to be in 2021.","Rod Lache","Okay. And is TireHub a year-over-year positive? And can you also just lastly clarify, what corporate overhead was in the quarter? Did you have some kind of catch-up here for incentive comp?","Darren Wells","Yes. I think that is the story on the corporate overhead Rod. I think the delivery on cash flow in the second half of the year did result in an increase in our compensation accruals. So I think that's -- there's not too much more of a story to it than that.","Rod Lache","What's the number, the corporate overhead number in the quarter that you guys put up?","Darren Wells","Yes. So I think for about $50 million for the quarter.","Rod Lache","Okay. And TireHub?","Darren Wells","Yes. So TireHub, we've continued to improve there. So in the quarter, it was a $4 million improvement from a year ago. So a year ago, our equity loss in TireHub was about $9 million. In the fourth quarter, it was about $5 million, so that's $4 million better. I think as we go through the first half next year, we had $25 million of equity losses in the first half of 2019. If we're running at $5 million a quarter which is kind of where we've been in the last couple of quarters then we'd have $10 million or $15 million benefit there and then hopefully some continued benefit as well. But the focus on TireHub right now is making sure they're making the investments to be able to continue to expand their distribution coverage. So that's I think not really pushing for profitability as much as we are for the service and coverage.","Rich Kramer","And it continues to go very well.","Darren Wells","Right. No it's a very good asset for us.","Rod Lache","Okay. Thank you. ","Darren Wells","Yeah.","Operator","We'll take our next question from James Picariello with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. ","James Picariello","Good morning, guys. So just regarding the European wholesale channel exits, you're going to get -- you're exiting the 1.5 million units there. Have you quantified or can you quantify the associated overhead absorption costs for this year?","Darren Wells","Yes. Yes so I think the unabsorbed overhead in Europe depending on where tires are made is $8 to $12 a unit. So if you average around $10 a unit then there's around $15 million worth of unabsorbed overhead for us to deal with as a result of that. And there is some of that that because of the lag for inventory might bleed over to the beginning of 2021.","But on the other hand, we cut about 1 million units from our production schedule in the fourth quarter and that was sort of split between the U.S. and EMEA. So EMEA had some of that coming into this year. So I think that $15 million may not be too bad a guide for the overall impact there.","James Picariello","Okay. And then the $65 million-plus in savings over the 2 year to 3 year outlook would that be in addition to the headwind that you're experiencing in 2020, or would that be captured in the $65 million?","Darren Wells","Yes. So it is not. So we'll -- two benefits after 2020.","James Picariello","Yeah.","Darren Wells","The first benefit is recovering the volume. The second benefit is the $2 to $4 of additional net revenue per tire that we would expect. So those are two benefits. Part of which is recovering what we lose in 2020 but part of which is upside relative to history.","James Picariello","Got it. Yes. Just within raw materials in the past you kind of separated out feedstock versus non-feedstock costs. Are there any of the latter the non-feedstock factors playing in for 2020?","Darren Wells","Yes. So James for 2020 we've got non-feedstock cost increases embedded in our forecast of about $50 million. And therefore we've got feedstock decreases of about the same amount. And the two kind of offset each other. And that's what's embedded in our flat guidance.","James Picariello","Any color at all on what the non-feedstock increases relate to maybe regionally commodity-specific anything at all?","Darren Wells","Yes. Generally speaking it is a matter of either resourcing commodities where we have lost suppliers. And certainly there's a lot of instances in China where in petrochemicals we've got suppliers that just aren't making the material anymore and we have had to shift back to suppliers outside China.","In other cases, we've got suppliers that have had to make incremental investments in order to meet environmental standards. And the cost of those incremental investments are being passed through. And so it's not -- strictly speaking it's not feedstocks, but its increased investment that they've had to make in order to deal with the new regulations. So I mean those are very common examples for us behind us.","And the amount of non-feedstock increases is declining so less of an impact this year than last year. So I think we're working our way through that. And obviously we're focused on trying to find ways to mitigate those but that is the view that we've got sitting here today.","James Picariello","Got it. That's helpful. And just last one on mix. I believe backing into the fourth quarter maybe it was still a $5 million headwind within the EBIT bridge. One is that right? And then two just how are you thinking about mix for this year? I believe the headwind -- a major headwind or a good portion of that headwind in 2019 was related to your consumer alignment mix in North America. Does that finally abate in 2020?","Darren Wells","Yes. So I think in the impact -- the negative impact in our consumer replacement business in North America, I think, we do see that abating because there's a number of actions that have been taken to address some of the factors that were causing that negative impact. So we've addressed it with some commercial discussions with customers in order to at least get rid of some of the duplicative distribution costs that we were experiencing.","So I think that's good. I think the -- what we will see in 2020 is loss of commercial truck tire volume, as the commercial truck cycle and particularly OE build starts to hit. And some -- we expect some loss in our off-highway business, as well as that cycle. And the cycle for mining tires, has started to turn negative.","So we've got a couple of other factors working against us. So I think that, while we're, as you said, we're sort of $4 million or $5 million negative, in the fourth quarter. I think we're hoping to see something, at least in the positive direction, in 2020. And I think, we're confident. We'll see something in the positive direction, in the consumer replacement business.","Rich Kramer","Right.","Darren Wells","I think the question is in some of the other businesses. And we'll try. And provide some color for that, as we go through the year.","James Picariello","Thanks.","Darren Wells","Yeah.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Itay Michaeli with Citi. Please go ahead.","Itay Michaeli","Hi. Great thanks. Good morning. Just two questions, I apologize if I missed that. The first on slide 20, just continuing the mix conversation, in terms of the expected positive contribution over the next two or three years, hoping you could elaborate more on that.","And maybe kind of talk about, the individual buckets of product, customer and channel? And, kind of how you're thinking about different scenarios for mix over the next couple of years?","Darren Wells","Yeah. So I think, the -- Itay, the starting point here is that our product mix, continues to improve, and so we're continuing to get more growth and invest in more growth in higher-rim size more complex tires. And I think, as we start to ship OE tires for electric vehicles that will help as well.","So I think the core of product mix has been a positive, will remain a positive. We will -- we have started to address some of the channel and customer-related mix issues, in the replacement business. So I think that will improve.","And then, as we see the cycle improve we work through, whatever weakness we experienced this year in the off-highway and commercial truck businesses. Then those business line mix drivers of revenue per tire will start to recover. And we'll see some benefit there.","And then in the OE business itself, as we work -- start to bring in some of the new fitments that we've won in 2021 and 2022. And particularly, the electric vehicle shipments but not only those, we're bringing in some fitments that have revenue per tire, that are fairly strong.","So our electric vehicle fitments, those tires are harder to make. And as a result, bring revenue that's sort of directionally 15%-or-so higher, than a traditional internal combustion engine fitment.","So we've got a number of things there that, we may be cycling through in 2020. But we see some upside, as we get beyond 2020. And we get rid of some of the things that have been a drag. And let the core product mix come through in the results.","Itay Michaeli","That's helpful. And then just on the consumer OE price reductions that you referred to are you seeing this as sort of a new annual normal this kind of part of the contracts that you've signed for the seven million units, or is this more of a kind of more onetime-ish type of a headwind, just in response to market conditions?","Rich Kramer","Yeah. Itay, I would say, it's really the latter. I mean, as we go through, what we're seeing is, again the combination of a down cycle and a transition to EVs. And again the story you all know well, in terms of moving to the different powertrains and what's going through.","So, I think that, with any cycle this pressure kind of comes in. We know that, we know how to work our way through it. I think the transition that the OEMs are going through I think that is -- that's temporal as we move ahead.","I mean we've seen this for example even happen in China. Darren mentioned the units that we're coming off of in China. We actually had a really a good fourth quarter there. We substantially outperformed the industry where we saw a very challenging environment. As you know industry was down. Production was down about -- new car production was down about 8%. And our customers were impacted even a little bit more significantly there that being the Ford and the GMs that were down 15% and 13% in particular.","So, those type of headwinds I think are there from the cyclicality side. And then we also -- what happened to as Darren mentioned to this earlier, we were recently informed by one of our major customers that one of their high-volume vehicle is going to be discontinued early and that they were actually taking us off, switching us off a vehicle that was in its last year production which is a bit odd. So, those type of things I think are sort of the temporal things that we see going on at the moment.","It doesn't at all deter our view of where ROE fitments are where the OE business is going. We're focused on continuing to grow it. As I mentioned earlier, the reception that we're getting from the OEMs on the new vehicles that are coming out as Darren mentioned in 2021, 2022 timeframe is very strong. And that's before we move into the sort of the requirements of even more sophisticated tires as we think about certain levels of intelligence being put into them.","So, yes, we're going to have some headwinds in 2020 but it really -- some of those shipments were going to come off anyway so that's kind of normal course. And out over the long term we see a very robust environment. And actually -- frankly since I've been doing this I'm more excited about what's happening with the OEMs and the directions that they're taking than I have been since I've been around. So, I feel pretty good frankly.","Itay Michaeli","That's very helpful. Thanks for all that. And maybe just lastly for Darren just going back to the puts-and-takes on Slide 21 on working capital and restructuring are you expecting free cash flow to be able to comfortably cover the dividend again in 2020?","Darren Wells","Yes. So, I guess, Itay the thing I would say is that we feel like that this dividend -- the dividend we have is appropriate for us through the cycle. And for 2020 even if our earnings are under some pressure, we believe our cash flow is going to enable us to cover both our planned CapEx, our restructuring payments, and our dividend without a meaningful increase in our net debt.","We've got several actions that we've taken to protect our balance sheet and we are very cognizant of that. But I think that we're in a position here where we can cover it without any meaningful increase in net debt.","Itay Michaeli","That's very helpful. Thanks so much.","Darren Wells","Thank you.","Operator","It appears we have no further questions. I'll return the floor to our presenters for closing remarks.","Darren Wells","We just like to thank everyone for joining us today. Appreciate it.

Joining me today are Rich Kramer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Laura Thompson Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Before we get started, there are a few items we need to cover. To begin the supporting slide presentation for today's call can be found on our website at Investor.goodyear.com. And a replay of this call will be available later today. Replay instructions were included in our earnings release issued earlier this morning.","If I could now draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statement on slide two. I would like to remind participants on today's call that our presentation includes some forward-looking statements about Goodyear's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments today. The most significant factors that could affect future results are outlined in Goodyear's filings with the SEC and in our earnings release. The company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","Our financial results are presented on a GAAP basis and, in some cases, a non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures discussed on the call are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent as part of the appendix to the slide presentation.","And, with that, I will now turn the call over to Rich.","Richard Kramer","Thank you, Christine and good morning, everyone. This morning I will review our record third quarter results including our continued success in North America and provide examples of how we are executing our strategy in both robust and challenging markets. As always, Laura will follow with the financial review of our businesses before we take your questions.","I am extremely pleased with our third quarter's record results including the sequential improvement from our record second quarter results. Our consistently strong financial performance in both the volatile global economy and tire industry is a testament to our strategy and more importantly our execution.","We delivered outstanding earnings growth in the quarter, a record 599 million in segment operating income. When excluding the impact of currency on our results, our segment operating income grew 25% which is a clear indication that we executed against our strategy.","Also we delivered segment operating margin of more than 14%, the highest in more than 15 years, despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges in some of our key international markets. Each of our global businesses had segment operating margin of 11% or higher. By executing on a strategy roadmap, we are doing the right things to deliver strong quarterly results now while building capabilities for profitable growth.","Our strong performance in North America continued in the third quarter. The business grew its segment operating margin to more than 16% and achieved a 54% year-over-year increase in earnings driven by strong demand for our high value-added products. Its 323 million in segment operating income is a record for any quarter.","Demand for our tires, particularly our premium HVA products remain strong in North America as overall volume increased about 3% in the quarter. The consistent strength of our North American business is the result of our unwavering commitment to a strategy built on the alignment and integration of our industry leading products developed from the market back, our aligned distribution network, our operational excellence initiatives and the power of the Goodyear brand.","Together they create a value proposition that differentiates us from the competition. When we execute at the intersection of these attributes, we win with consumers, we help our customers win in their markets and we create competitive advantage that is reflected in our results.","As we progress with the execution of our strategy, we will take advantage of our brand strength with further high profile initiatives to support our more driven campaign. We will continue to build on our NASCAR and ESPN relationships and leverage our new fleet of Goodyear Blimps as I'm sure you seen with our increased presence on college football this season. The results of our ads have been terrific and have exceeded our expectations.","Also, we continue to rollout our e-commerce platform enabling consumers to research and buy tires online and have them installed through our network of aligned retailers. With more than 4,000 installers now signed up, we continued to expand our reach with this program which is aimed at making the tire buying process easier and creating value for Goodyear, for our participating distributors and of course for our consumers.","Since we initiated our e-commerce strategy earlier this year, others have taken similar steps which certainly confirms our strategy. We remain very confident in our approach which links the Goodyear brand, the number one search brand in the U. S., are participating Goodyear dealers and are aligned distribution all to benefit the consumer. We believe the combination of these attributes will be very hard to match.","Regarding industry demand, we expected to continue to mix up toward premium products. We welcome this trend as meeting the needs of the most discerning customers placed to our strengths.","In the near term, we are working to overcome our capacity constraints as backorders remain for our premium products we continue to strengthen our supply through our operational excellence initiatives to get more tires out of our factories through investments in our North American plants, and through sourcing products from our global footprint.","Additionally, the recent weakness in emerging market tire demand provides us with an opportunity to further leverage our international footprint to meet the strong demand for our products in the U. S.","Overall, this was another terrific quarter for North America's journey towards sustainable performance and value creation. Our goal is to maximize our ability to win at the intersection of innovation demand creation and supply, all to better serve our customers and consumers. We've made tremendous progress, but I know we can do even better.","In our EMEA business, the effect of the strong U.S. dollar and soft winter tire sales explain the vast majority of the year-over-year decline in the regions results. We anticipated a week industry environment and it was even weaker than expected as winter tire inventory remain high. Given three consecutive warm winters, there was little motivation for the channel to stock up on winter tires during the traditional selling season. On the positive side, our product portfolio remains robust putting us in a strong position when consumers begin to switch to winter tires.","Our industry leading innovative new products continue to be recognized in influential magazine tests. The new Goodyear Vector 4Season are all season tire was the winner in an extensive test by a leaning German automotive magazine and was the only tire of the 10 that were tested to achieve the top exemplary rating. The Vector 4Season was the clear winner.","The Goodyear UltraGrip performance winter tire took first place in three magazine tests during the quarter and the Dunlop Winter Sport 5 claimed the top spot in two tests. The results of these test influence consumer buying behavior and we're very pleased with the independent validation of our innovative winter products.","Beyond the recognition for our winter tires, another positive was a 6% increase in our original equipment volume as the OE industry gained momentum in the third quarter. And in our commercial truck tire business we continued to deliver strong results with numerous key competitive fleet wins as our fleet service value proposition including our top-performing Goodyear KMAX tire lineup is demonstrating competitive advantage. We will remain focused on building our value proposition and supporting our business over the long-term with investments to deliver more premium products across the region.","You may have seen our announcement in the quarter related to our plan modernization of our factory in South Africa converting to the latest technology to further improve the plants high value-added consumer car tire production.","Looking ahead, we will work to strengthen our distribution and customer service to help further differentiate our value proposition while also continuing to reduce our cost to run rate of initiatives targeting increase profitability for EMEA business. We expect EMEA to be in a low growth environment and to have a weak euro for the near future and our focus is on executing in that environment.","Market conditions in our Latin America business continue to be extremely challenging. The high level of volatility in the region is not new and our leadership team continues to execute on our strategy and take advantage of pockets of opportunity.","For example, even as our consumer OE in commercial truck businesses remained weak in the region, particularly in Brazil, our consumer placement volume grew 22%. This was the foundation of our 8% overall volume growth. I'm pleased with our team\u2019s ability to execute our strategy under these adverse conditions.","We will continue to focus on our cost structure in the region as we anticipate the economic slowdown in Brazil to continue through 2016 and possibly beyond. We also are very focused on reacting quickly to the fast-moving swings and inflation and evaluations to ensure we are proactively managing our value proposition, our cost, and our balance sheet position. As you've heard me say before, this region will continue to be volatile but we are very well-versed in executing in this environment.","In Asia-Pacific, our segment operating margin grew to more than 15% despite flat volume growth overall in the quarter. We faced a weakening market environment in China in the third quarter as economic slowdown, stock market decline and tighter liquidity negatively affected consumers, retailers and distributor purchases.","We had strong growth in our consumer business in India but also had continued deterioration in Australia due to ongoing macroeconomic challenges in that country. In China, new car sales declined significantly in the past months and credit in the distribution channel tightened as well. Despite these adverse market conditions, we grew our unit sales by 4% in the quarter based on our strong market position and are winning product lineup.","More recently, the industry began to stabilize in September and we are encouraged by the announced reduction in sales tax related to new vehicle purchase starting this month. While we expect continued volatility in China, we remain positive on the long-term market outlook and project the countries growing middle-class will drive improvement in the automotive sector.","We are well positioned to benefit from this market growth as the Goodyear brand was recently ranked highest for consumer satisfaction in the luxury and SUV segments. Our EfficientGrip Performance tire won several important awards in the quarter including Motor Trend Magazine's Tire of the Year in the comfort category for the second year in a row. Also, we continue to win key OE fitments with both global and domestic automakers creating aftermarket costs.","To meet our growth in the region, we are committed to increasing our capacity over the long-term in our factory in Pulandian, China. With are announced and planned projects we expect to increase our capacity by up to 5 million additional consumer HVA tires by 2020. We are very optimistic about the long-term value proposition of our business and Asia-Pacific. Our new product introductions only pull-through an increasing points of distribution will be supported by our increased capacity and give us confidence that we will continue to be successful in one of our most important markets.","Looking back at the third quarter, I'm very pleased with our record results. More importantly, I am very happy with the way we continue to execute our strategy whether in strong markets or challenging once. Our teams have made the commitment to winning with consumers and helping our customers build their businesses every day while taking a long view of creating sustainable value.","Given our results to three quarters, the strong demand for our high value-added products, and our balance of investment in cost reduction, I'm confident in our ability to deliver our targeted earnings growth in 2015 and 2016. With our strong year-to-date performance, we now see full year segment operating income tracking to $2 billion which would be more than double what we achieved just five years ago.","Our North America business continues to be the cornerstone of our earnings generation. Our international businesses, however, are operating in very difficult, low growth environments driven by low commodity prices, weakening economies and weakening currencies versus the U.S. dollar. We do not anticipate that changing in 2016.","Still, we are maintaining flexibility to deliver on our long-term strategy while being prudent and proactive with our cost in the near-term. In all businesses, we are delivering innovative new products and investing where appropriate for future growth.","Now, I will turn the call over to Laura","Laura Thompson","Thank you, Rich and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will start with a review of our third-quarter results including points from each of our four strategic business units. I will then cover updates to our full-year Outlook for 2015 before we open the call up for your questions.","Turning to slide eight, I'd like to highlight a few items on our income statement. In the quarter, we grew segment operating income by 15%. Our strong performance in a challenging international environment was driven by a combination of volume growth and margin expansion.","Segment operating income was $599 million and our SOI margin expanded to 14.3%. Unit volumes increased 1% in the quarter driven by solid growth in Latin America and North America, partially offset by a decline in EMEA and Asia was essentially flat.","The decline in our net sales for the quarter is fully explained by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and reduced sales in other tire related businesses, primarily due to the effect of lower commodity prices impacting our third-party chemical sales in North America. Strong performance on price mix versus raw materials improved our gross margin by 3.8 points to 28.3%.","Our earnings per share on a diluted basis was $0.99. The results were influenced by certain significant items which are listed in the appendix of today's presentation. After adjusting for these items, our earnings per share was also $0.99 as the adjustments collectively offset each other.","As a result of the release of our U.S. tax valuation allowances at year end 2014, our U.S. tax expense increased significantly year-over-year. Consistent with our approach in the previous quarters for year-over-year comparison purposes, we have provided an adjusted EPS excluding this incremental non-cash tax expense. For the quarter, the adjusted EPS on that basis is $1.29 up $0.42 since last year.","As a reminder, although we are incurring tax expense and the U.S. today due to our significant U.S. deferred tax assets, we do not anticipate paying significant cash income taxes in the U.S. for approximately five years.","The step chart on slide nine, locks third quarter 2014 segment operating income to the third quarter 2015. Our segment operating income was up 15% year-over-year and excluding the impact of foreign-exchange translation, grew 25%. The positive impact of volume growth was partially offset by lower unabsorbed fixed overhead cost of $3 million. We were able to realize the benefit of lower raw material cost while holding price mix essentially flat, for a net benefit of $130 million during the quarter.","While year-on-year prices declined slightly in part due to our raw material index agreement, that reduction was almost entirely offset by positive mix. Excluding Venezuela, our net price mix versus raw material benefit in the quarter was $44 million. The $86 million impact of Venezuela was higher than we anticipated as we were able to offset higher than expected inflation. Our $76 million of cost savings was completely offset by the impact of inflation including hyperinflation in Venezuela.","If we exclude the impact of Venezuela, our cost savings net of inflation would have been $55 million during the quarter. This is more reflective of our progress on operational excellence initiatives throughout the rest of the company. It is important to note that our performance excluding Venezuela is in line with our net cost savings in recent years. The impact of Venezuela is embedded in each element of our SOI walk as always. But in aggregate Venezuela accounted for $39 million of our SOI in the quarter; and $12 million of the year on year growth and SOI.","Foreign currency exchange was a headwind of $49 million, reflecting the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar particularly, against the euro and the Canadian dollar. The translation impact of the Brazilian real was muted due to weak business results from the continuing recession in Brazil.","Turning to the balance sheet on slide 10, cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $1.7 billion and is consistent with the prior quarter and the third quarter last year. This cash balance includes $292 million of cash in Venezuela at the end the third quarter.","Our total debt and our net debt are both down slightly from the second quarter balances. Net debt is lower than the third quarter last year by $801 million following our strong free cash flow performance over the last 12 months.","Slide 11 shows we generated $190 million of free cash flow from operations in the quarter. Our normal seasonal build and working capital with a use of $231 million down significantly from last year's level driven by lower raw material cost. Looking over the last 12 months, our free cash flow performance has been strong exceeding $1.2 billion.","Moving now to the business units on slide 12. North America continues to post impressive results recording the 25th consecutive quarter of year-over-year earnings growth with segment operating income of $323 million.","North America's $113 million improvement in earnings was driven primarily by strong price mix net of raw material cost, increased volume from our consumer business and an improved cost driven by our operational excellence initiatives.","Partially offsetting these benefits, the weaker Canadian dollar negatively impacted North America's SOI by $12 million. The demand for our industry-leading consumer tires is strong as we realized consumer volume gains of 4%.","During the quarter, we increased our share in OE which continues to enhance our profitability with increased sales of our premium HVA products such as the Wrangler All-Terrain Adventure and Assurance Fuel Max on some of the OEMs most popular vehicles.","Demand in our replacement business remained solid and we continue to see benefits from our new product launches such as the Kelly Edge. However, in many instances strong demand is outpacing our ability to supply our premiums Goodyear branded tires.","Through September, North America has delivered segment operating income of $842 million or about 14% of sales and we are on track to exceed $1 billion this year. We believe these results are continued evidence that our strategy is sound and our teams execution has been outstanding.","Europe, Middle East and Africa generated segment operating income of $154 million in the quarter which was $27 million less than the prior year. This decline was primarily driven by currency weakness as foreign currency translation reduced earnings by $24 million.","Overall, our EMEA unit volumes decreased about 2% year-over-year. The European winter tire industry selling during the quarter decreased more than 7% year-over-year, although, we did see year-over-year share increases and the winter HVA performance and SUV segment.","Summer industry volumes were up 4% during the quarter which helped offset some of the decline as well as weakness in parts of Europe, where we have been experiencing an increase in competition from Chinese imports.","Our EMEA business has continued to deliver solid underlying performance in 2015. While we have seen cold weather and even snow in some countries in October, we continue to take a cautious approach on volume expectations for the remainder of the year, but the strength of our winter product portfolio has us well position to drive future business and win in our targeted market segment.","Asia-Pacific generated segment operating income of $72 million in the quarter, a decrease of 10% versus last year's $80 million. The main drivers were foreign currency headwinds, due to the stronger U.S. dollar and higher SAG expense, partially offset by favorable price mix versus raw material cost. The segment operating margin in the region increased to 15.7%.","Despite recent economic headwinds in China, our team has been performing well and growing our volume. Our OE business delivered double-digit volume growth in the quarter despite the weakness in the industry. And replacement, we did see an impact from de-stocking in our distributor channel and we also made some choices based on customer credit both related to the tighter liquidity environment.","Asia remains a key growth opportunity for the company and we are confident about the region\u2019s long-term growth trajectory. We are prepared for short-term volatility and remain committed to mid- and long-term growth.","In Latin America, segment operating income was $50 million for the quarter. Latin America benefited from higher volume and positive price mix which more than offset the impact of inflation on raw material and conversion costs.","Our volume increased 8% driven by 18% growth in our replacement business with double-digit growth in most countries in the region including Brazil, Mexico and the Andean countries as a result of our strong product line up. The OE business declined 21% due to the continuing recessionary environment in Brazil.","As I mentioned earlier, for the quarter, operating income from our Venezuelan business was $39 million. This operating income excludes foreign currency exchange losses related to the Venezuelan Bolivar, which were $8 million in the quarter. While economic conditions and currency controlled in Venezuela remain challenging, we have received US$15 million in the quarter to purchase raw materials to support continued operations.","Our Latin American team is continuing to work proactively to maximize market opportunities in an increasingly difficult environment, while at the same time, taking actions to address the cost structure to be in a position to better weather the storm.","Slide 13 shows our updated full year modeling assumptions for 2015. You will notice that volume and unabsorbed overhead are unchanged from our July call. The first update is an increase in our outlook for price mix net of raw materials. We now expect a full year net benefit of approximately $370 million, which reflects an increase related to our third quarter performance. We continue to expect raw materials to be down about 7% versus 2014 before cost saving actions. This includes the negative impact of currency on raw materials transaction in our international businesses.","With rapidly increasing inflation in Venezuela in the second half of the year, we revised our net cost savings in 2015 to be neutral.","Outside of Venezuela, our businesses are delivering on our operational excellence initiatives. The savings excluding Venezuela are on plan and are delivering as expected. Our segment operating income drivers include about $20 million of earnings in Venezuela in the fourth quarter. As we have sufficient U.S. dollars to enable us to produce through the end of the year. We are taking a cautious view on Q4 as Venezuela heads in to its December election, which could amplify the already volatile environment. Based on current stat rates we now expect translation to be headwind of $160 million for the full year.","Finally, with our year to date strength in our other tire related businesses, we have included a $20 million benefit in our outlook. In summary, as we look ahead and based on our current assumptions, we are tracking above our 10% to 15% segment operating income target for 2015 to $2 billion. Additional financial assumptions for 2015 are listed on slide 14 and reflect updates related to our year-to-date trend. The significant changes are reduction in our CapEx outlook to $1 billion to $1.1 billion and the likely need for 50 million to 75 million of working capital to support the business.","Turning to 2016, we continue to target 10% to 15% SOI growth. We have strong positive momentum in many parts of our business and challenges in others. We will way all of these factors including raw materials and foreign exchange and provide our specific thoughts during our yearend earnings call.","Finally, we continue to execute on our capital allocation plan. And as part of that plan, we have an existing $450 million share repurchase authorization. Including the $30 million for repurchases during the third quarter, which essentially offset dilution, we have repurchased $313 million under our 2014 to 2016 plan. We also recently announced an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.07 per share effective with our December dividend payments.","Now we will open the line up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And at this time if you would like to ask a question. [Operating Instruction] And we can take our first question from Itay Michaeli with Citi. Please go ahead.","Itay Michaeli","Great. Thank you, good morning. Good morning and congrats.","Laura Thompson","Good morning, thanks.","Itay Michaeli","I may have missed this but just on the price mix versus Raws being revised at $40 million. Can you maybe talk a little bit about what pumped that revisions, is that mostly on the mix size, because I think Laura you mentioned the raw material Outlook is consistent still for the year. And to that you have an early look given the lack of roughly maybe where raw materials may be in the early part of 2016?","Laura Thompson","Yes sure Itay a couple of things. So first I\u2019ll start with the second question first. Related to 2016, really based on where we sit today current spot rates and currency rates as well. We do see I guess at this point low single digits excuse me low single digits positive as we go into the 2016 versus the 2015 on raw materials. The changes that we made in the Outlook are a couple of things. It primarily relates to where we are at year-to-date and including our Outlook for Venezuela.","Itay Michaeli","Excellent, great. And if I may just sneak in one on cash flow, it does seem that the EBIT with CapEx year-to-date you probably have a significant increase just to get to the low end of the range. And I think you should have a working capital benefit in the fourth quarter. I was wondering about capital allocation and maybe an acceleration and some of the buyback activity in the fourth quarter as cash flow should see some tailwinds it looks like\u2026","Laura Thompson","Yes, so Italy as we think about remember for us -- historically just the way our business flows, essentially all of our cash flow is generated in the fourth quarter. So when you think about our three-year plan -- our capital allocation plan that is it about 2014, 2015 and 16, we're really only about one year through our three-year plan in that sense.","Now I get it the fourth quarter is coming and soon we will have two years into that plan. We have we said that any increases to that shareholder return program, you will remember our capital allocation plan has a range on it right now. It is 0.6 to 1.25 billion and again we feel good about results and where we are at, but as we generate that that cash in the fourth quarter, we will look to take another look at where we are at in our authorization.","We have $313 million of the share repurchases of that $450 million through the third quarter and we are very committed to that shareholder return program, okay. Now we did also increase the dividend in the fourth quarter so you see us continuing to make product us as we deliver the results.","Itay Michaeli","Terrific, that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks so much.","Richard Kramer","Thank you Itay.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs","Richard Kramer","Good morning, David.","David Tamberrino","Good morning and congrats on the quarter. My first question is really just around the 2.0 billion SOI tracking number that you put out. Really in relation to kind of last year, we're still tracking similarly to the top end or above of that 10% to 15 % those three quarters now. Just wondering what really gave you the confidence to come out and put out that number of $2 billion, which is 17% year-over-year increase and above that 15%. Is it order levels, what you seeing in that channel that gave you the confidence?","Richard Kramer","David I think it\u2019s just confidence in the strategy that we have been executing, the changes that we've made to the business model is what you are seeing in the results that we\u2019re delivering. And also you're seeing that particularly in the strength of our North American business.","And I think when we look at what we see in that business, the improvements that we are making there and we look also at some of the other elements around the world, that gave us the confidence to make that statement to say that we are tracking to that range.","David Tamberrino","Okay. That\u2019s fair. And winter tire inventories in Europe obviously we\u2019ve seen the selling has been poor, I think it was on top of a pretty high single digit selling last year. Where do you think the inventories are now as it relates to potentially cold winter here. Do think that easy comp from last year is going to set up for a particularly strong quarter in the event that we do see a little bit more been normalized winter in Europe?","Richard Kramer","David it's a good question. If I just maybe take a step back for one second, the winter market is important to the industry there. It's roundabout 30% of the tires we sell. It\u2019s typically high-end tires and it's a very good mix so forth. So it's very important to us and as you know we are leaders in winter technology. The situation that we're seeing is coming off of three warm winters in a row.","As Laura mentioned, and I think as we said in the past, we have kind of planned for that sort of pre-winter even though we've seen some snow at this point. And part of what goes into our thinking is, excuse me is pretty much in line with what you're saying. You could almost call it the sort of the animal spirits of the winter or the channel in Europe right now particularly in Germany, they do have higher inventory in the channel right now.","And on top of that, you've had these three warm winters, so there is little motivation to go stock up and go long on tires. The industry is typically round 100 million units or something like that if you do the math. We would say that that with higher inventory in the channel that's obviously still a question as to whether we can even reach that level. It\u2019s clearly been much higher than that as we go back to the light winters of 2011. It was actually much higher than what I am saying.","So as we look at it, we are going to continue to sort of stay in a cautious view. We think, we are very well prepared for it. I went through on my remarks, our winter line up our UltraGrip performance tire, our Dunlop winter sport five, our Vector 4Season for those that want to move to Offseason, that\u2019s a small market. But we have top-tier winning podium products and all of those categories right now so were ready -- I think what would give us a boost, what would give the industry a boost frankly is cold weather and snow as we head into November here.","David Tamberrino","Okay. So just to summarize that it sounds as is there is upside to the $2 billion if there is in fact a colder and normalized winter in Europe?","Richard Kramer","I think unequivocally we could say that and it's kind of, as we look at the winter, it's kind of like interest rates. We think they are going to go up and they don't. We think its\u2019 going to snow and it hasn't. So if we got to wait for the event to happen, and then we will see what happens? But clearly, if it snows, there's absolutely a virtuous effect in that.","Laura Thompson","Yes.","David Tamberrino","Understood. And then maybe just one more for me. For the online sales channel, we've seen a little bit of a small arms race here as Michelin has bought a few in Europe, they have also rolled out and on-demand service in the U.S. And then Bridgestone more recently bought some distribution channels both brick-and-mortar as well as online over this past weekend. How do you see that online e-commerce distribution channel evolving over the coming couple of years really for the global Big Three?","Richard Kramer","One -- number one, I think it's really confirmation of the strategy that we rolled out earlier in the year. And I think that's important. That\u2019s what we saw coming. It's why we did what we did. And I would tell you we took a long time in getting there, building up what you've heard me say, our brand, and building up search our brand where the number one search tire brand, tire manufacturer in the U.S. rivaling some other big online tire sellers right now and doing that as a manufacturer. We are significantly ahead of others let\u2019s just say. And we did that very consciously to create the demand in the market place. Then we pulled together, signing up our partners dealers and also putting the distribution capabilities in place.","And then marrying the technology to be able to make that work, so customer has a good experience as are doing this really to make the tire buying process easier for the consumer. What I said, I said very simply, but it's a very complex problem. And it's one of those things that sort of bolt ons don't necessarily make the process have that much less friction in it because you have to hook up all kinds of things in the back.","So this is not an easy thing to do to get you know the SKU explosion to get the right tire to the right place at the right time when consumers are going online to buy their tires. This is not an easy process, and it's why were being very methodical and having a good success as we go at this point.","Having said that, I do think -- like most other products and particularly around millennial being the consumers with $1 trillion of buying power or some 80 million millennials out there that this will be an absolute way to buy tires and expected way to buy tires because that is how that group does commerce to a large degree.","So having a formula that works out there and being able to marry it with the brand and importantly, the distribution both retailers and aligned distributors to get the tires there is going to be what wins.","And that's how we are thinking about it sort of building it from the bottom up to be able to deliver in that value promise. So far we feel very good about it. But there's no question it will be a way that consumers want to shop. And Goodyear and its partner dealers are getting ready for that.","David Tamberrino","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I will turn it over. Thank you.","Richard Kramer","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We can go next to Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Pat Nolan","Good morning everyone. It\u2019s actually Pat Nolan for Rod.","Laura Thompson","Yes, good morning, Pat.","Richard Kramer","Hey Pat.","Pat Nolan","Two quick questions on North America. First on the supply issues you alluded to in Q3, is that something you see being near term, in other words will you be able to perform in line with the industry over the next couple of quarters or do think the supply issues constrain your EBITD there?","And secondly, maybe Rich if you could expand on your view on the sustainability of this North American margin performance I mean, it's a multiple of what the historic level has been. Maybe if you could just expand on how sustainable you think these margins are?","Richard Kramer","Sure. So the first question on the way to catch up on supply -- I would tell you, this is a point that we\u2019ve been making relative to supplying those high-end HVA complex tires. I think the larger end diameter S view tires in particular or performance tires. And those are tires that remain high in demand, the capacity for those tires on a broad basis still I would say is behind the demand for those tires.","And that is something that we are working to continue to make more of and doing by getting more tires out of our existing factories, investing in our North American factories, and also, using our sort of lower demands around the world to import some of those tires in. So in the near term that is how we are trying to catch up and continue to be a better supplier.","Over the long-term, that's also why we embarked on the Americas plan that we talked on in the past. So that\u2019s something that will take some time to put in place. It also is going to be a function of the demand that is out there as well. We think the demand will be there and we are going to work -- we are working feverishly to do that keeping our factories running full to be able to supply those tires.","I would also say though -- just to put it in perspective that part of the market continues to grow. The other parts of the market as we said are always subject to these imports coming in. Remember we had these big gyrations because buying ahead of tariffs and the like and you have to remember as that drives the market or has an impact on the market, it had it impacts is less as we are focused on other segments of the market and not so much what is happening in the lower in.","The question on that the sustainability of North America's market. Excuse me, margins. I would say as we look at the business to date we remain, the industry today, we remain very optimistic and positive on what is still available for us to go achieve. I just mentioned the demand for HVA tires out there and made a few remarks earlier about the opportunities related to growing through digital.","And as we look at our business, the tire business is really one of execution. Right tire, right place, right time and creating the right demand and having a brand that bring consumers to the stores and to our participating dealers. By doing those things right and as I said working and executing at the intersection of innovation of demand creation and supply, we see continued opportunity to continue to grow our business.","So as we look at the earnings power of North America and we look at the industry conditions out there, I still remain very confident in the ability and the earnings ability of our North American businesses.","Laura Thompson","And when you add on the continued operational excellence initiatives, that drive the cost that\u2019s not fully rolled out through all of our factories even in North America, through all the work stations. And then I probably say maybe to the earlier question, we live it every day. But don't forget about how complex these tires are.","Right, the complexity that\u2019s part of the equation. I would say that we are seeing probably demand higher than our expectations for the really highly complex tires. The performance and the SUV tires as well. And that continues to really put pressure on supply as we go.","Pat Nolan","That\u2019s very helpful. If I could just sneak in just one housekeeping item. What are you incorporating in the guidance as far as Venezuela profitability in Q4?","Laura Thompson","About $20 million of SOI","Pat Nolan","Thanks very much. I\u2019ll get back in the queue.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. This is actually Samik on for Ryan. And I apologize if I missed a part of the call, so if these questions have already been answered. But just wanted to touch firstly on the guidance on the raw material price mix spread here. I remember earlier you were guiding to 3Q probably looking like more like the peak benefit in the year on that front and now it looks like you sort of looking at 4Q being a similar benefit.","Now when I\u2019m -- I guess with sort of the lag that you see in sport prices flowing through the P&L, how should we think about 1Q, does it look like it's going to frail [ph] off or does it look similarly strong for Q4?","Laura Thompson","I guess I would say for raw materials year-over-year in 2016, we do see overall low single digits improvement. I think as we look at it today, based on current spot rates and the currency rates that that would be a little better than that in the first half of the year versus the second half of the year. But we will like I said we will keep watching this and give you a full update on the fourth quarter call.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Got it. And just my last question on the North America segment, I see on the global SOI walk you had a small headwind from price mix. But could you help me with what that was for North America and how is pricing environment in North America?","Laura Thompson","Yes. I mean the price mix for North America continues to be strong right? The new product line up, the high demand for the very complex tires very positive results in North America. I think is mix is very strong. A very significant positive for us in the quarter. And we expect based on our demand that to continue.","Now when it comes to price for North America, the only thing is, is our OE contracts right? Those have our RMIs included in them and some of the commercial fleets as well. And that comes into play in the pricing equation in North America. But things are strong and the results\u2026","Richard Kramer","I would echo Laura's comments on mix. I think as we look at the results we're very pleased with the whole price mix equation for North American business.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. And just a follow-up on that front. Since the tariff kicked in, in early August has there been any change on that front? Has there been like a greater benefit to mix and pricing coming through after that?","Richard Kramer","You meant from the tariffs coming? The tariffs coming in.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes.","Richard Kramer","I would say that that's really by in large part of the market that\u2019s not where we have a significant presence. So our situation really revolves around our value proposition, the new products we are bring to market in our ability to do that our new Wrangler All-Terrain Adventure, our Wrangler DuraTrac, the whole Kelly Edge power line up all these things are really what\u2019s driving our increases in my the marketplace.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Thank you.","Richard Kramer","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take a follow up from David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","David Tamberrino","Hi thank you. Just a few more for me. I think Latin America is, one of the concerns here is specifically Venezuela, it sounds as if you guys have continued to be able to transact at one of the favorable sick add rates. How much longer do you think that continues and you'll be able to get U.S. dollars to buy raw materials down there because, just thinking about the core of the year in Venezuela has been a meaningful contributor to earnings and I guess a thought going forward is how much longer can that continue in your view?","Richard Kramer","Yes David just a quick comment on Latin America in general. Very difficult environment down there particularly in Brazil, I know your question\u2019s on Venezuela. But I will just take the opportunity that our teams have been executing well down there, in light of consumer OE business and truck business there that\u2019s down, 20% plus and you see from our numbers we grew volume above 20% in consumer replacement volume above 20% in virtually all of our key countries down there.","So the team is executing well there in what is a very difficult environment around currency and inflation and evaluation in general excluding Venezuela. So we are pleased with how we're doing but we clearly see the headwinds going on there. And Venezuela is clearly one of them and I will have Laura address your questions in particular.","Laura Thompson","Yes, sure, David. So when you think about it for us, and for tires. Tires are being treated as a priority good. Right now there's very few forms of transportation in the country. And we continue to, to have access to U.S. dollars to buy those raw materials as I mentioned. We just received $15 million in the third quarter. Now line of sight is limited. Each company facts and circumstances are very different. But we continue to, to make and sell tires and they are in high demand. We certainly have a tremendous amount of disclosure related to Venezuela and all of our cues and case. For us we continue to operate the business under normal course and really predicting kind of the future is very difficult for Venezuela. ","David Tamberrino","Okay that's fair. And I guess, may be on that topic when you think about the hyperinflation down there, how conservative have you been in your updated outlook and kind of SOI walk for inflation? Could it be something that gets again for the fourth quarter comes in a little bit higher and ends up really eating into and making the cost savings minus inflation are negative or do think you've been accurate on your estimates for 4Q?","Laura Thompson","Yes, I mean for us that about $20 million in the fourth quarter takes into consideration the December elections and that historically -- and I think everyone would expect that to create even more volatility as we go then was in the third quarter. So for us, we see it as a balance estimate for the fourth quarter.","Richard Kramer","Yes and David I would say from your question on cost savings, I mean, we still if you exclude Venezuela, which we've tried to do pretty much on our sort of forecast for cost savings is not actually exceeding it. So if you strip Venezuela out and it certainly does sort of complicate things, but when you take it away, I would say we're executing very well against those cost savings if that was an underlying question -- we feel pretty good about the core business.","Laura Thompson","Yes. And we have been able to work through the inflation increases even if we have some impact further in our cost savings versus inflation. It tends to be offset in the price mix versus raw for Venezuela.","David Tamberrino","Okay. And that is helpful. And then just lastly, in your analogy earlier you were talking about the potential rising interest rates that revolving were kind of waiting to see here. Is there kind of any update when you think about your balance sheet and the structure in terms of timing may be coming to the market and looking at refinancing some of that higher coupon debt that's out there. I know a couple of them become callable or one has become callable in a more in the next year?","Laura Thompson","So we all always are monitoring our capital structure and we take a very proactive approach to managing our interest expense. And we will continue to do that. Now we obviously can talk about or comment when we would be in the market or not. But that is our history and you have seen it recently right? In May we amended and restated our European revolving credit facility and I think a 75 basis point reduction, June we amended the U.S. second term loan and lower that by about a 100 basis points. So that's kind of been our MO of the past.","Operator","And it appears we have no further questions, so I will return the call to Goodyear for closing comments. ","Richard Kramer","I just want to thank everyone for joining us today. We had a great quarter and we felt very good about finishing off the year. So thank you very much. ","Laura Thompson","Yes. Thank you. ","Operator","And this does conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."],"10068":["Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.

My name is Keith, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","I would now like to hand the program over to Christina Zamarro, Goodyear's Vice President, Investor Relations.","Christina Zamarro - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Keith. And thank you, everyone, for joining us for Goodyear's second quarter 2015 earnings call. Joining me today are Rich Kramer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Laura Thompson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, there are a few items we need to cover. To begin, the supporting slide presentation for today's call can be found on our website at investor.goodyear.com, and a replay of this call will be available later today. Replay instructions were included in our earnings release issued earlier this morning.","If I could now draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statement on slide two, I would like to remind participants on today's call that our presentation includes some forward-looking statements about Goodyear's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments today. The most significant factors that could affect future results are outlined in Goodyear's filings with the SEC and in our earnings release. The company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","Our financial results are presented on a GAAP basis and, in some cases, a non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures discussed on the call are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent as part of the appendix to the slide presentation.","And, with that, I will now turn the call over to Rich.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Christina. And good morning, everyone. This morning, I will review highlights from our outstanding second quarter, provide an update on how the macroeconomics in our regions are affecting our business, and give my perspective on our business for the remainder of the year. Laura will follow with a financial review of each of our businesses and an update to our outlook before we open the call to your questions.","In the second quarter, we delivered segment operating income of $556 million, a record for any quarter in the company's history and a 21% improvement versus last year. Also, if we exclude the impact of foreign currency translation, our operating performance improved by 28% in the quarter. These were simply excellent results for our team. Combining this quarter with our record first quarter results, our segment operating income for the first half of the year was $947 million, the highest first half ever for Goodyear. By comparison, that's higher than our full year segment operating income in 2010.","In addition, we delivered segment operating margin of more than 13% in the second quarter despite significant foreign currency headwinds and regional macroeconomic challenges. Leading the way, our North American business delivered record segment operating income and nearly a 16% segment operating margin. It's highest in my 15 years at Goodyear and likely longer than that. In addition, three of our four global businesses delivered operating margins of greater than 10% in tougher-than-expected economic environments.","Taken in total, our record second quarter performance reflects the strength and disciplined execution of our strategy. We believe that strength comes largely from the integration of the key how to's on our strategy roadmap; innovation excellence, sales and marketing excellence, and operational excellence supported by an aligned and collaborative team. While each is a significant element in our plan, their value multiplies when they're integrated. Our current results reflect that value and we've only just begun to tap into its full potential.","I'd like to spend the next few minutes providing my perspective on each of our SBUs, as well as my thoughts on the industry outlook for each for the remainder of the year. North America delivered $321 million of segment operating income, a record for any quarter. This performance was driven by positive price mix and raw material costs, demonstrating the earnings power of our value proposition in a strong market.","During the quarter, demand in our Replacement business remained solid and we began to see the benefits of our new product launches, such as the Kelly Edge. Early demand for these tires has exceeded our expectations as our market-back innovation has allowed us to bring HVA attributes to the mid-tier segments.","Similarly, we've increased our share in OE, which continues to deliver profitable results by selling HVA products, such as the Wrangler All-Terrain Adventure and the Assurance Fuel Max on some of the most popular vehicles in line with our strategy. The results are paying dividends not only in our OE performance, but also in The Goodyear brand replacement pull-through, as consumers visit our line dealers. The enhancements to our product mix have been an important enabler of North America's improved value proposition.","During the first half, we also began to roll out our new e-commerce platform for Consumer Replacement tires. We developed our online sales strategy to reduce friction or in other words to make the tire buying process easier for consumers. The program is still in the early stages, but it has met or exceeded our initial expectations, while providing many key learnings needed to implement it successfully over the long term, as consumers change their buying habits. We remain confident that this program, with our industry-leading dealer network and more than 4,000 locations enrolled to-date, will drive profitability through the value chain.","Our Commercial Truck Tire business also had a strong second quarter based on the robust demand for our industry-leading products. In June, we unveiled a new commercial tire product, the Endurance WHA for waste haul fleets, which will be available later this year. Our total portfolio of Commercial Truck Tire offerings has never been better. And combined with our fleet service model, that's the gold standard of the industry that makes Goodyear a clear industry leader in the commercial truck business.","Across all of our segments in North America, our value proposition has allowed us to excel in a market where drivers of demand have remained very strong. New passenger vehicle sales are at the highest in a decade, miles driven for the first five months of the year was an all-time record and we project miles driven for the full year to be a record as well, and year-to-date truck tonnage has increased 3% over the same period last year. All are leading indicators for good tire markets, and we believe the underlying fundamentals will remain favorable for some time. We've consistently said that it was a question of when not if industry fundamentals would improve, and they have.","As I look at the success of our North American business and the industry fundamentals, our challenge continues to be meeting growing demand for our HVA tires. As we've outlined, in the short term, we are investing in our factories locally and leveraging our global footprints to deliver more of the tires that our customers want. In fact, we broke ground yesterday in San Luis Potos\u00ed, Mexico for our previously announced new manufacturing plant, which will help satisfy demand and allow us to grow over the long term.","Shifting to Europe, our EMEA business unit delivered $108 million in segment operating income during the second quarter, down about 8% versus the prior year, which was more than explained by the weak euro. Excluding the impact of currency, EMEA grew 14% year-over-year. EMEA's performance was led by the successful execution of our strategy of growing in targeted market segments along with the strength in summer tire sales in Western Europe.","Goodyear-branded summer tires, particularly The Goodyear EfficientGrip Performance and EfficientGrip SUV tires claimed the top spots in several important magazine tests, which helped facilitate strong demand and growth in those segments during the summer season. Industry sell-in for summer tires was strong during the quarter and helped offset the difficult year-over-year comparisons for winter tire sell-in. You'll remember that last year winter tire sell-in started earlier in the second quarter. As we predicted last quarter, we did not see the same early sell-in this year.","Heading into the second half of the year, we're taking a measured approach to winter tire sales based on the warmer than usual weather Europe has had over the past three years, the higher levels of inventory currently in the channels, and a wait-and-see approach by the dealers.","Customers may be reluctant to build large inventories of winter tires and sell into retail channels maybe delayed. Clearly, the unpredictable winter weather will affect buying patterns, which remain difficult to gauge. Regardless, we're confident our award-winning winter products will position us to win in the marketplace.","In our Commercial segment, our recent share growth has been fueled by our outstanding products and increased demand from fleets. For example, last month, Goodyear was honored with the Luxembourg Green Product award for its FuelMax S truck tire. The tire features IntelliMax Groove technology, which was cited as a major breakthrough in the tire industry for fuel efficiency and operating cost reduction. It is this type of innovation that continues to enhance our value proposition and win with fleets around Europe.","Like our success in North America, EMEA's end-to-end fleet service solutions of strong product lineup is driving our year-to-date success and winning new customers. Emerging markets in Eastern Europe continue to struggle with an influx of low-cost Asian imports. This is a trend we saw in previous quarters and one that we believe will continue in the second half of the year.","Given the macroeconomic conditions in Europe, we have and will continue to take actions to better align our cost. In June, we announced the planned closure of our mixing and retread operation in Wolverhampton, England, and some other changes within our EMEA footprint. These actions will help facilitate a more competitive cost structure.","With the economic uncertainties in Europe surrounding currency, the situation in Greece and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, we believe these are the appropriate and the prudent steps to manage our business. We do not foresee the economic situation improving during the second half of the year and expect the euro to continue to depreciate versus the U.S. dollar.","Through the remainder of the year, we will stay focused on strengthening our value proposition, reducing our cost and winning in our targeted market segments where the value of our brands differentiates us from the competition.","Latin America continues to be a very volatile region as well. Our business there delivered segment operating income of $43 million, down year-over-year because of the recessionary conditions in Brazil. I'm pleased, however, with how our team has executed in this environment. There was double-digit growth in Consumer Replacement volumes in many of our Latin America growth markets including Mexico, Argentina and the Andean countries. However, this performance was more than offset by the weakness in Consumer OE, particularly in Brazil, which remains in a recession. New vehicle sales declined 24% in the second quarter and are down 21% year-to-date versus 2014.","Venezuela's fluid economic and political situation continues to create challenges and volatility in our Latin America business. However, we are pleased our team has been very successful and continuing to operate profitably in the country, while servicing the strong demand for our replacement products. Laura will elaborate on Venezuela in her comments in a moment.","As I said last quarter, with currency, economic and political instability at levels not seen for years, we expect the Latin America region to remain volatile, but we also remain optimistic about the region's long-term prospects.","Finally, in Asia Pacific, strong volume growth in China and India contributed to segment operating income of $84 million and operating margin of more than 17% in the second quarter. In India, our strategy has been a success as OE and Consumer Replacement volumes and share both increased, driven by new vehicle launches and strong branded retail performance. During the quarter, we launched the Assurance TripleMax tire for the mid-tire passenger segment in India. This is a product that has been very successful in other countries in the region over the past 18 months and we anticipate it will be in high demand here as well.","In China, we continued to have strong year-over-year growth in our Consumer Replacement and Consumer OE businesses, but at a pace slower than anticipated. The slower growth is largely due to a combination of weaker new car sales, domestic stock market volatility and lagging consumer confidence. While the macroeconomic environment in China is expected to soften relative to the first half, we are driving initiatives to support our growth goals.","For example, we recently expanded our relationship with Wal-Mart in China and Goodyear also is now the exclusive tire brand available through Sam's Club stores and online. Going forward, we are focused on driving incremental replacement tire sales in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities taking advantage of additional opportunities to grow our customer base.","As we said in the past, China's growth may not be in a straight line, but it's the world's largest auto market. We expect continued growth over the balance of the year, but with stronger headwinds than in the first half. We remain confident in our long-term growth in China.","Looking back at our global businesses in the second quarter and over the first half, I'm very pleased with the execution of our strategy, the focus on our targeted segments and our teams' commitment to maximizing value through the integration of our key how to's.","Our 14% segment operating income growth in the first half gives us confidence that we will reach our 10% to 15% growth target despite challenges in the global economy. Our commitment to those objectives is unwavering, but we will be flexible in how we arrive at our strategic destination of creating sustainable value. Many of our markets are considerably more volatile than they were when we developed our plan. We will have additional bumps in the road, but we're not running our business for one good quarter or one good year. By running our business for the long term, we won't be distracted by the now familiar fluctuations in the marketplace with the expected headwinds in our industry.","Our strategy is solid, it's working and it delivered in the quarter, as evidenced by 21% year-over-year segment operating income growth and by a 13% operating margin. We believe it will continue to drive strong results.","I'll now turn the call over to Laura.","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Rich, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will start with a review of our second quarter results, and I'll then cover updates to our full-year outlook for 2015, before we open the call up for your questions.","Turning to slide 7, I would like to highlight a few items on the income statement. We are very pleased with our second quarter performance, showing both volume growth and strong improvement in our segment operating income. Unit volumes increased 1% in the quarter, driven by solid growth in North America and Asia-Pacific, partially offset by declines in EMEA and Latin America.","Looking at our net sales for the quarter, the impact of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar reduced sales by $401 million year-over-year. In addition, other tire-related sales were lower by $81 million. The decline in other tire-related sales was driven by lower third-party chemical sales in North America, reflecting lower commodity costs. Gross margin improved 3.3 points to 27.4%, improving segment operating income to a record $556 million with a SOI margin of 13.3% for the quarter.","Our earnings per share on a diluted basis was $0.70. Our results were influenced by certain significant items, which are listed in the appendix of today's presentation. After adjusting for these items, our earnings per share was $0.84.","As a result of the release of our U.S. tax valuation allowance at year-end 2014, our U.S. tax expense increased significantly year-over-year. Consistent with our approach in the first quarter for year-over-year comparison purposes, we have provided an adjusted EPS excluding this incremental non-cash tax expense. For the quarter, the adjusted EPS on that basis is $1.13, up $0.33 versus last year. As a reminder, although we are incurring tax expense in the U.S. today, we do not anticipate paying significant cash income taxes in the U.S. for approximately five years.","The step chart on slide 8 walks second quarter 2014 segment operating income to second quarter 2015. The positive impact of volume growth and lower unabsorbed fixed overhead cost was $8 million. Lower raw material cost of $108 million, more than offset reduced price mix of $7 million for a net benefit of $101 million during the quarter. While this performance is well ahead of our previous guidance for the second quarter of $25 million to $50 million, about half of the net price mix versus raw materials in the quarter was a benefit from our Venezuelan operation. Excluding Venezuela, our price mix and raw material performance came in at the high end of our guidance range.","Cost saving actions of $101 million more than offset the $71 million impact of inflation, which was driven primarily by Latin America. The highly inflationary environment in Venezuela significantly impacted our net savings in the quarter. Excluding Venezuela, our cost savings net of inflation would have almost doubled. Foreign currency exchange was a headwind of $35 million, reflecting the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, particularly against the euro.","Turning to the balance sheet on slide nine, cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $1.6 billion and essentially unchanged versus the prior quarter and the second quarter of last year. This cash balance includes $304 million of cash in Venezuela.","Our total debt and our net debt are effectively flat with our first quarter balances as well. Net debt is lower than the second quarter last year by $660 million, following our strong free cash flow performance in 2014.","Slide 10 shows we generated $377 million of free cash flow from operations in the quarter. Working capital was a source of cash and more than explains the $63 million improvement in free cash flow compared to the prior year. Looking over the last 12 months, our free cash flow performance has been strong exceeding $1.1 billion.","Moving now to the business units on slide 11, I'll start with North America. North America had another great quarter with an all-time record segment operating income of $321 million. This is the 24 consecutive quarter of year-over-year earnings growth and with a segment operating margin of 15.8%, the fifth quarter in a row of earnings exceeding 10% to sales.","North America's $113 million year-over-year increase in earnings was driven by positive price mix in raw material costs demonstrating our strong value proposition. North America's unit volume increase was driven by growth in both OE and the replacement channels. Our commercial truck volume was also strong in the second quarter, driven by strong OE demand for our fuel efficient tires such as the Fuel Max LHS steer and LHD drive tires. Remember, fuel is among the top two largest expenditures for fleet, and as such, identifying the most fuel efficient tire is a critical factor impacting fleet profitability.","Through the first half of 2015, North America has generated SOI of $519 million equal to 13% of sales. This earnings power demonstrates the strength of our strategy and overall value proposition. Europe, Middle East and Africa delivered segment operating income of $108 million in the quarter, a decrease of about 8% over last year's $117 million. The impact of foreign currency translation reduced earnings by $25 million, more than explaining all of the year-over-year decline.","Our unit volumes decreased about 2% year-over-year and the volume decline was due to two factors. First, a continuation of increased competition concentrated within our economy segment in Central and Eastern Europe. This area is where we have seen additional pressure driven by an increase in Asian imports. And second, the discontinuation of our farm tire operations last year. Together, these headwinds offset volume increases we saw year-over-year in the HVA performance and SUV segment in the region.","As Rich mentioned, strong summer tire sales during the quarter in Western Europe helped offset decline we saw in winter tire selling year-over-year. However, with our previously announced price increases in Europe taking effect in July, we see some of the volume benefit in the quarter as pull ahead of third quarter demand. In commercial truck, we continue to experience a stable industry environment and we have gained share in replacement based on the strength of our premium branded products.","Our EMEA business has delivered solid underlying performance in the first half of 2015. While there will continue to be challenges with foreign currency headwinds as Rich mentioned, we are very confident in our winter product portfolio and we've taken a cautious approach on volume expectations for the back half of the year, given some summer demand pull ahead and winter inventory remaining in the channels from last year's very warm winter. Even as we plan for a green winter, there is still some risk due to the unpredictable nature of the weather and a potential repeat of last year's warm temperature through the fourth quarter.","Asia-Pacific generated segment operating income of $84 million in the quarter, an increase of 11% over last year's $76 million. The main contributors to the earnings growth were increased volume and favorable price mix versus raw material costs, partially offset by higher SAG expenses and the negative impact of foreign currency translation.","Volume of 6 million units was 5% higher than a year ago and was primarily driven by two of our largest and fastest-growing markets with double-digit growth in India and China. In China, our volume growth in the quarter was driven by our OE business, where we have been successful in winning new business and gaining share, in addition to participating in the overall industry growth.","We are also proud to report that in June we launched the EfficientGrip Performance tire for Chinese luxury consumers, offering best-in-class quiet and comfort. As Rich touched on, although China's economic growth has recently moderated from the levels seen in the first half of the year, we are still excited about the long-term growth opportunities we see for our business in Asia.","In addition, on slide 16, in the appendix of today's presentation, we have provided some further details on our operations in China. In India, we enjoyed double-digit volume growth versus the prior year in both the Consumer Replacement and Consumer OE businesses.","In Latin America, our volume decreased about 4%. We again saw double-digit growth in Consumer Replacement volumes in Mexico, Argentina and the Andean countries. However, this performance was more than offset by weakness in Brazil, especially in the OE and commercial replacement segments, which are feeling the effects of a significant recession.","We also saw year-over-year volume declines in Venezuela, as we have been operating at lower levels of production than last year. Segment operating income was $43 million for the quarter, $16 million less than the prior year. Latin America benefited from positive price mix, which is more than offset by the impact of inflation on raw material and conversion costs, as well as lower volume.","For the quarter, operating income from our Venezuelan business was $36 million, although the impact of Venezuela on our net income for the quarter was $24 million, which included $12 million of foreign currency exchange losses due to a weakening in Venezuela's (28:43).","While the macroeconomic conditions and currency controls remain challenging, the team has been able to obtain sufficient U.S. dollars to purchase raw materials to support our operations, albeit at a lower than optimal level. I'll discuss our latest thinking as it relates to Venezuela as part of our full-year outlook in a moment.","Our Latin America team is continuing to work proactively to maximize market opportunities, while at the same time taking actions to address the cost structure to better match the lower volumes in this recessionary environment.","Slide 12 shows our updated full-year modeling assumptions for 2015. You'll notice that volume, overhead absorption, currency and Amiens closure-related savings, are all unchanged from our April call. We continue to see our full-year volume growth in the 1% to 2% range, with strength in North America, a cautious view on EMEA's second half volumes, an increasingly challenging environment in Brazil, and lower growth expectations for China. The updates to our outlook are due to Venezuela. The two changes to our 2015 SOI drivers are in the price mix versus raw materials and net cost savings outlook lines. As we were able to continue profitable operations in Venezuela throughout the first half and at this time we have enough visibility to expect access to U.S. dollars for raw material purchases, they will enable us to remain at current production levels through the third quarter. As a result, we have updated our outlook to reflect the effect of Venezuela results to the various SOI drivers rather than including Venezuela as a separate line item.","Overall, Venezuela will meaningfully increase our price mix versus raw material expectations and decrease our net cost saving guidance. Both of these changes are a reflection of the highly inflationary environment in the country. Taken together, these changes, incorporating Venezuela, are a $70 million improvement versus our April outlook.","We now expect a full-year net benefit of approximately $330 million for price mix net of raw material changes. Raw material costs are expected to be 7% lower than last year before cost savings actions due to slight increases in underlying raw material costs since April, particularly for natural rubber in the second quarter. This also includes the negative impact of currency on raw material transactions in our international businesses.","The other significant change in the outlook relates to the net cost savings where including Venezuela significantly increases the overall inflation headwind. As a result, we have reduced the net cost savings to approximately $70 million for the year. I want to be clear, this reflects simply the higher inflation related to including Venezuela results throughout the outlook. Our operational excellence programs are on plan and delivering as expected. Additional financial assumptions for 2015 are listed on slide 13 and each is consistent with what we provided on our April call.","In summary, as we look at 2015, our financial outlook has a few moving pieces, but in total has increased $70 million reflecting the operating income improvement from our Venezuela operations. Excluding Venezuela, our full-year outlook is unchanged.","Our strong performance over the first six months gives us confidence that we will reach our SOI growth target of 10% to 15% in 2015. In addition, we continue to execute our capital allocation plan and as part of that plan, we have an existing $450 million share repurchase authorization and including the $50 million in repurchases during the second quarter, we've now repurchased $283 million under our 2014 through 2016 plan.","Now, we'll open the line up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We can take our first question from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. Congrats on the quarter.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Ryan. Good morning.","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Ryan. Good morning.","Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. So just I'm trying to think about how to model North America for the balance of the year after the strong 2Q? I think it's important to understand what's happening with price to mix \u2013 price mix to raws. So the first question is, can you break that out for North America now like I think, you will in your Q?","And then, secondly, can you comment even directionally on how you expect North America price mix to track in 3Q or 2H compared to 2Q or 1H? An agenda with sort of on again, off again preliminary tariffs in the first half being replaced with now permanent duties in the back half that pricing independent of raws pass through could be stronger, do you agree with that directionally?","And then regarding raws, should this too potentially get better at least in 3Q, given your FIFO accounting and the fact that prices seem to have bottomed about kind of one and a half quarters prior to 3Q, which I think is roughly consistent with your traditional lag between spot prices and impact to the P&L?","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, yeah, Ryan, we'll try to tag team. You had a lot of questions there.","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah,","Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Go ahead.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I guess, first thing is, we don't break out the difference between price mix and we're not going to start doing that as we go ahead. But I think as you look at where we're at, obviously we're very pleased with the results of the business. And as you think about Q2 and first half and then roll into the second half, I think the first thing that I would say is, what we're seeing is our goal of creating a business that can deliver sustainable value, sustainable results over the long term and the decisions that we've taken in the past around our fixed costs, around efficiency, around business choices, around our new product portfolio, around innovation, around putting a focus on the consumer and driving our strategy \u2013 those three elements of our strategy with the right team, you're seeing that take route and really delivering in this quarter, and I would suggest it's been delivering over the last number of quarters, number of years. So, as we think about second half, I think that underlying business model certainly will continue.","We also got the benefit now, as you know, we've got lower gas prices; we've got better unemployment; we see miles driven being up, I think 15 reported periods in a row, that means more tread rubbers is being burned on the roads. We see a stronger OE business in the U.S., sort of the $17 million SAR and the work we did on our \u2013 getting on the right fitments is certain paying dividends as well.","So as we look into second half, I think some of that momentum will certainly still be there. As we look at what we said earlier in the year, we said that we would have a strong second half as well in North America. We are also releasing some new tires again, part of the Kelly Edge power line. We have new tires going into Walmart. We have new Assurance tire coming out. So certainly, that's going to help our momentum as well as we move ahead.","I will tell you, we still have \u2013 as I mentioned in my remarks, we see still have some supply constraints on some of the HVA tires that our customers want and we're still trying to work on that as we get into the second half and beyond getting more tires out of the factories that we have and more out of the import plant that we have as well. So all that momentum I think does carry into the second half as we go. And in terms of where raw materials will be, I would point you back toward the assumption page that Laura can talk to here. We really haven't changed much where we're, I think we said \u2013 it was an 8%...","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. We said so.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","...reduction for the year.","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Exactly. So on raw materials, while we expect it to be 7% for the full year, there is a slight improvement to that in the second half over the first half of the year. And then real quick, just back, no doubt as we think about North America and the price mix versus raws guidance, nothing has changed in the sense that we still based on our results in North America, expect price mix versus raws to be weighted more towards the back half of the year versus what we saw in the first half of the year, if that helps for the model?","Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","No. It definitely helps. Thank you. Just one follow-up though. On the price mix to raws, did you not beat the 2Q guidance? Was it for $20 million to $50 million comes in $107 million, so that's a $57 million improvement. And then it seems that slide 12 is saying there is actually no change though to the full year except for Venezuela. So why not an improvement to the full year, is it because the spot prices kind of ticked up a little bit through the quarter or what \u2013 how to think about that?","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. So, no doubt. For price mix \u2013 I'm sorry, so for price mix for the second quarter our guide was $25 million to $50 million. When we back out Venezuela in the actual results for the second quarter, you will see that about half of that is Venezuela, and therefore we're at the very high end or so, right, of our $25 million to $50 million range as we go.","Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. You're right, that makes perfect sense. And just final question just basically on slide 22, looks like one of the biggest improvements there was to commercial replacement in North America, which I think is disproportionally profitable for you, right? So, you talked about in your prepared remarks some of the freight industries that you look at and we can see too (39:32). But, can you talk about maybe what you think is driving the underlying improvement in freight or what not and the sustainability of that? Thank you.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Ryan, I think it's just the general economic lift that we're seeing in a broad sense. I mean, I know our U.S. economy is not hitting on all cylinders but it certainly improved, and I think there's certainly some pent-up demand out there that's going over the roads. In addition, the OE business is very strong as well as truck builds. I know you guys do or your colleagues follow the trucking industry, you know what the boards look like in terms of new truck build. So, there is a market, I think a favorable market out there in terms of freight and in terms of demand for trucks and consequently demand for tires.","We also have built our business around not just, and I think this is really the most important thing I can say, it's not just about tires, it's about the whole fleet services solutions that we bring. And I think particularly, in an environment, where there's more trucks on the road, being a full-service fleet provider, meaning new tires, retreads and ability to get truckers up and running when they have issues on the road and providing tires that have the fuel economy that really Laura mentioned in her remarks, can save trucking companies money on fuel. It's that whole value proposition I would suggest you that drives our business results. And that's important because that model will also be beneficial to us when the industry is not as strong as it is right now. So that really is, I would tell you the underlying strength that we have. And I would say very proudly, I think we have the best business model in North America by far.","Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. Congrats again.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Rod.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. Congratulations.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Couple things. First, on the guidance, you're guiding the 10% to 15% SOI growth, I presume that's off the $1.7 billion last year. So that's like a $170 million to $256 million. All those items that you provided the price versus raws, the costs FX in EMEA and that's about $220 million. And if you had volume growth of 1% to 2%, that might be $25 million to $50 million. So all together you've got about $245 million to $270 million based on that. So what do we need to think about to net down to that $170 million to $256 million?","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I mean, Rod, we're trying to give guidance as best we see what's happening in the world today. I mentioned in my remarks that when we put our plan together, clearly a lot of things have changed and our job is to try to deliver the results that we set. So as we look at what's happening over the course of the second half of the year, we've got risk on currency in Europe with the euro; we've got the winter markets that we still have to work our way through. Does it snow, when does it snow in Europe? We get the recession in Brazil to deal within a bit of a slowdown in China. So, there are a lot of different things that we have to work our way through. What our guidance is intended to do is to be less of a point estimate, but to give you a view of how we see what we need to deliver over the course of the second half.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That makes sense. And also just kind of a housekeeping thing. Typically, the difference between SOI and operating income, your corporate overhead is $35 million to $40 million, this quarter it was $56 million. Is that an unusually high number or is that a run rate that we should be thinking about going forward?","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Right. So, it is a run rate I'd say using going forward. We were a little higher in this quarter. We had our intercompany profit elimination as we moved tires around the world, some corporate incentive plans and so on moving around. But, similar to 2014, each quarter there are ups and downs in it, but on average we're still projecting to come out between $30 million and $35 million a quarter.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. And then just two other things kind of market share questions. So, in North America, the RMA was up 4.8%, your replacement volume was up, it was up 1%. But, presumably, the Asian imports would be doing less well. So maybe could you talk a little bit about what's happening here market share-wise? Is the new Kelly product expected to kind of fill a gap that's outperforming? And then in Europe you explained the market share issue there with Eastern Europe and Western Europe, but it's a bit surprising that you're implementing a price increase even though raw material costs are down. So, in Europe, is it basically just staying disciplined on pricing and just foregoing that volume growth?","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, Rod, from a North America's perceptive, I think the market is up because you had non-Chinese imports come in mostly at the low end of the market again and that's not as you know a place where we play, so that's really what drove that market.","As I've said in the past, we're sticking to our strategy, we're not just pursuing volume for volume sake, we're pursuing those parts of the market where we can create value for ourselves and for our customers, and that's what we're doing. A lot of that bump comes at the low end. And exactly as you said, I think you hit it exactly right with the Kelly Edge, with the Douglas Power line and the Kelly Power line with another Assurance tire we're putting in, we're taking that HVA technology as we said in one of our megatrends a number of years ago, bringing that down into the mid-tier where we can get value for the Kelly name and for The Goodyear name as we move ahead. And that was our strategy, it is our strategy, and that bump really comes in places that doesn't affect us as significantly as the numbers might suggest.","And from a Europe perspective, I think when you look at our volume year-over-year, two things to keep in mind. One, we had a significant sell-in in winter tires in Q2 last year, so that made it a tough comp because we didn't see that so and again this year. And also you're seeing the reduction in our farm business, which I think accounted for about a third of our volume loss in \u2013 in volume change year-over-year, because we're completely out of the farm business now, so that was sort of a one-time impact that you see there. So those two things really say what volume is. It doesn't have a \u2013 we don't view it as a significant impact, a significant concern as we look at Q2 volumes.","And your comment on \u2013 obviously, Rod, maybe to just to add to that one other quick thing. Winter in Q3 and Q4 is obviously something we're paying very close attention to, because that is a significant item to the industry and to Goodyear.","And finally, in terms of raw materials price, the price increase you mentioned that we had in Europe, remember, our raw materials particularly natural rubber, but other raw materials are dollar based. So with the weakening euro, our raw material costs are going up, and I think that's the logic of what you've seen there, so.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take the next question from Itay Michaeli with Citi. Please go ahead.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone and congrats.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Itay. Thank you.","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","So maybe I'll turn to China and thanks for the detail on slide 16. Can you just remind us what you're assuming for China in the full year guidance maybe volume-wise and how to think about sensitivities there if that market were to get materially worse?","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, Itay, I think it's a good question and maybe I'll just start, I'll take a step back by saying, we have what we feel is an excellent business in China. We've been there a long time since 1994 actually, and our business model there is largely focused in the premium\/HVA part of the market. We have low LVA-type tires that we make and sell over there. So we have a very good business mix. And we supply that by and large with one of our most technologically advanced and really best-performing factories in Polandian (48:20), where we have capacity of about 11 million consumer tires and about 0.5 million truck tires there. So we've been there a long time, we've seen the bumps in the road and where we get that.","As we look at our business, we still think China will be a growth market over the long term. Today, it's about \u2013 the industry is about a 50-50 split between OE and replacement. And remember that's really different than the rest of the world, there are mature markets. When we describe our company, we say about 30% OE, 70% replacement. China is a little bit different as that market matures and as cars get put on the road. So as you think about our business there, it's a little bit different mix and obviously there's a little bit different margin change, 50-50 versus 30-70 in terms of how we think about the rest of the world as well. So, that's sort of a picture of our business. Our focus there, Itay, continues to be on growing our branded business and expanding our distribution. We had a very good second quarter both in OE and a strong quarter in replacement as well.","As I mentioned, we're going to continue to focus on growing our business in places like Wal-Mart and Sam's Club, where we're the exclusive tire and just recently in Sam's Club as well. And we see opportunities beyond sort of the Tier 1, Tier 2 cities. We play into Tier 2 and Tier 3 and see a lot of growth opportunities for us there. That's sort of the next phase as we move ahead. So we still feel very optimistic about the long term. But listen, all the things that everyone's been following, we've seen a lot of the OEMs take down their forecasts on the industry and on growth, and we see the same thing there.","So, we saw growth in the first half. We see that certainly changing in the second half and be about flat as we look to the year, is what we see there. So we'll have some headwinds there. But we also have a plant, as I said, that has high technology. We import some from that today. And you would be right to think that we're going to think about how we use that capacity in other ways both in the Asia region as well as possibly in other parts of the world as well. So, clear bump in the road, a clear headwind that we have to deal with. And I'll just say, we can and we will and we're going to remain \u2013 we do remain very optimistic about our prospects in China over the long term.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","That's very helpful, Rich. And then maybe just a second question on just the full year SOI guidance of 10% to 15%. I mean, it sounds like that your second half outlook with respect to the European winter situation, China we just talked about, is fairly conservative and you clearly are trying to embed some of these potential risks in your guidance. So with that, is there any bias in the SOI range at this point, high-end, midpoint, low-end, given some of these risks? And if not, maybe just talk about what some of the few things that can go right versus wrong in the second half of the year in your modeling?","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I don't think there is a bias in there. There's a lot of volatility in global markets. And as I mentioned, I think you've seen this as well in a lot of the companies you are covering is the world changed versus all of our planning cycles a while ago and we've got to react to it, and that's what we're doing. So there is really no bias in there, other than sort of putting the gloves on every day and figuring out what we need to do to deliver the results.","In terms of headwinds, I won't repeat them. I think you actually touched on and, again, those are the things that we have to deal with. In terms of things going right, I would tell you we're focused on executing our strategy, our key how to's, and getting value for our brands, and making more of the right products and delivering them both in \u2013 well, really in all our markets. I was going to say in Europe and North America in particular where we have still demand for those HVA products. But Itay, that's our focus to make those customers that we have who want more of our product happier customers by getting it to them. And if we do that, that's going to have goodness all around.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Terrific. Thanks so much. Congrats, again.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs.","David J. Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning and congrats on the quarter. Just a couple of questions on our end, as we look at regional margins, I think it's probably hitting on Brinkman's questions from earlier, but North America was quite strong at about 16%. Wondering your thoughts into the back half, is that sustainable or do you see some slight compression sequentially in the third quarter because of the aforementioned increases in spot prices of raw materials?","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, David, I think I'd just \u2013 I think I'd refer you back to Laura's comments where she said that we had originally \u2013 in our original planning assumptions that second half of the year, we'd see stronger results because of the price mix equation. But also I'd just kind of remind you that the way raw material flows, remember, we're about six months from \u2013 I think about six months from date of purchase till the time it hits into our P&L, particularly for our raw materials. So lower spot prices today will turn up in our P&L down the road \u2013 sort of six months down the road. So I'd just remind you we have that lag in our \u2013 particularly in our North American business, Europe as well. Asia, obviously, is a little bit different as their proximity to the source of those raw materials, they see that flow-through much, much quicker.","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No doubt.","David J. Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Understood. I think that's fair. And then just moving on to EMEA. As I look at last year third quarter, you had pretty strong 11% margins. You've kind of gotten back on the margin expansion path here and with price increases being announced, it seems as if you'd probably see expansion in that region again. I mean, are we thinking correctly on that or is there something that we're missing?","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","David, I would say we still take a very measured and cautious view of Europe and that's for a couple of reasons. One, as we look at the economy, there's still a lot of volatility. We said, I don't know, how many \u2013 it's probably for a number of years now that we saw sort of Europe continuing to muddle along and we still see that happening with injections into the economy to get it going again. We see the pressure on the euro. We see the Russia-Ukraine situation potentially popping its head up at some point. We certainly can't prognosticate there and we saw what happened with Greece. So there's still a lot of volatility going on and that's always underneath us to think about what has to happen. And frankly, it's why we're focused on our cost structure as well.","You may recall, we announced a restructuring plan in the UK to take out about 400 head count and close our mixing and retread operations there. And you'll see us focusing on our cost structure representative of that uncertainty in the market. So I think that's one thing that remains in our thinking.","And secondly, the winter markets are determinative and what's determinative in the winter markets is the weather. So that will have an impact for us as we look to the second half of the year. And maybe to frame it for you, again, I think we're coming off of what three warm winters in a row, green or yellow. So what you see is you've got sort of a wait-and-see attitude from dealers who typically don't go long on inventory coming out of a warmer winter. You've got some inventory in the channel as it is, and there's just a little uncertainty under there.","So we've taken a very measured approach, a balanced approach. We plan for a \"green\" winter and not a white winter and we're doing that very consciously to manage our business and manage our factories and manage our inventories. So those things I think are going to come into play into the back half of the year. So that's really how we think about it. Laura, I don't know if you'd add anything to that?","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, no, exactly.","David J. Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's fair. Pretty detailed as well. Just lastly, on the balance sheet, it looks like you have your 8.25% notes with a call date coming up, is there any potential update there you might be reviewing that? Obviously, you re-priced your second-lien not too long ago.","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, exactly. No doubt. In May and June both, we took some actions out in the market. In May, we amended and restated that European revolving credit facility and actually upsized it as well. And then, mid-June, right, we amended the second-lien term loan, which did lower our borrowing cost by about 100 basis points. So we were always monitoring our capital structure. We really can't say whether or when we plan to be in the market. But as you know, we have a long track record of being opportunistic in reducing our interest expense.","David J. Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Helpful. Thanks, again. Congrats on the quarter.","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. Thank you.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, David.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning, Rich, Laura, Christina.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Brett. How are you?","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, good morning.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I'm very well. First of all, you obviously didn't change your price mix versus raw materials with the exception of Venezuela. But I was hoping you could just broadly talk about pricing trends in the different regions: North America, Europe, Asia and South America. What are you seeing? I mean, again, you haven't really changed your guidance per se, but are you seeing any acceleration, de-acceleration, any differences relative to your expectations in terms of direction?","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, Brett, as you can appreciate, we can't speak on or comment on pricing specifically. And as you know, we think about our pricing, not just the price itself, but the value we try to bring to the market. The brand that we bring, which brings customers to dealer stores, the products, the innovation we have in them, the customer service that we bring, the promotions that we put out in the market, all those things go into how we think about our price versus just the raw material or a cost input.","So while I can't speak specifically on price, maybe I can just give you a little bit of flavor of some of the things happening in our regions. And I will start with EMEA, and really I'll be a bit repetitive here and say, I think it was Rod who mentioned that we had a price increase in the second quarter and that really was reflective of the fact that our raw materials are dollar-based. And as the euro weakens, it makes our costs go up, and I think that's a headwind that we have to deal with as we think about Europe.","As we go to Asia, also there, as raw material prices change, they move quicker through our P&L, as I just mentioned a while ago. So as we see those raw material fluctuations, I would just point out that that region gets hit quicker and it has to react quicker, and that's what that team does there. And also remember in places like Australia and India and other places like that, they too have the currency pressure while sourcing materials in U.S. dollars as well.","And also, we see a bit in Asia and particularly in China more of China-based products staying home versus being exported. So we see some of that capacity coming into the market in China as well, but I'd also tell you, most of that's on the low end. And as I previously mentioned, we particularly play in the premium segments or the HVA segments in China.","And in Latin America, I'd say the biggest thing to be aware of there is, is simply the slower OE production. As I mentioned, new car production was down about 20% \u2013 over 20%, so that overcapacity is certainly in the market there and any situation where supply is ahead of demand has an impact. But also I would say with the real devaluing, what's happened is domestic manufacturers certainly of which we are one, have an advantage now, the opposite of what we had before as a weaker real means less imports being purchased by our customers there and that certainly helps us in terms of our market there. And I think our changes in and what we've done in places like Brazil in terms of new products and engaging our dealers, all that has resulted in big market share gains for us in Brazil and volume increases in Brazil in 2015.","And in the North America, I think we probably covered that with some of the other calls. So that's just a \u2013 maybe some color on what's happening in the market. And I'll just say, our goal is to continue to capture the value of our brands for our customers and ourselves, and that's what we're focused on.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Changing gears, how do we think about your increased emphasis, let's say on the Kelly brand relative to your longstanding strategy of kind of moving towards higher value-added, higher margin tires and so forth. I mean, is this kind of an opportunistic move relative to the recent tariff introduction, or should we think about it differently?","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think, Brett, I'd make two points to you. One, if you go back to when we introduced the MegaTrends, I mean, we don't go back and talk about those as such. But if you remember, we said that the trend would be the HVA or bigger rim diameter, a more complex constructed tires, better rolling resistance, so on and so forth would migrate to the mid-tier and that's exactly what's happening and you see that on new car fitments. So that was I think something we knew we called that was going to happen, we saw happening and it is, and it says that mid-tier is a place to be with HVA tires.","Secondly, as we look at the market, we had to get our business model in line to get out of some of the private label business, which we did, and we moved upmarket where we could get value for the brand. And then we wanted to \u2013 we are and we said we wanted to play in that mid-tier section particularly mid-tier commuter touring because that is the single largest part of the auto market and the tire market, if you will. So, playing in there with Goodyear brand in some cases and the Kelly brand in other cases, really sets us up very well to get the value of our brand to put the technology in there, and to do that as an alternative for dealers and consumers who in most cases would rather have that Kelly or Goodyear tire than an imported tire, and that was I think a strategy we had planned and the strategy we're executing.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you very much, Rich.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks. Okay.","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Emmanuel Rosner with CLSA.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi, good morning everybody.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Emmanuel.","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","So just first a quick housekeeping question. So, on your outlook slide, so the net effect of all the changes related to Venezuela is a positive $70 million for the full year? How much of that happened in Q2? How much of the $70 million is something that helped your SOI this quarter?","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. So it's about half. So you're correct, in the $70 million and you'd say about of the half of that is Venezuela's second quarter.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","And the breakup of that is about $50 million plus on the price versus raw, and then a little negative on the cost saving?","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Correct.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. All right. That's great for the housekeeping. And then sort of like, looking longer term, I know it's obviously too early to speak about in detail about 2016, but at the same time, I'm obviously impressed that as part of your reiterated outlook today, you're mentioning the 10% to 15% SOI both for 2015 as well as 2016. So just directionally, a lot of the \u2013 your SOI growth sort of in recent quarters and periods has come from positive price net of raw materials, which obviously is not your long-term strategy, it's more like neutral. So when you sort of like look at going into 2016, what sort of a driver should we expect that will sort of yield 10% to 15% SOI growth?","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Emmanuel, I think what we talk about internally and it's what I'll tell you very openly as well, we have to be focused on a balanced plan of growth, of volume growth, of revenue growth and of cost reduction and efficiencies in our business. And I think, there are times when some of those will have a higher weighting than the others. But as we think about our long-term strategic goal on our roadmap of creating sustainable value over the long-term, we have to have a balanced plan of revenue growth, of volume growth and of cost management and efficiency to drive that 10% to 15%.","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Right. And as we move through the year and especially on our fourth quarter call, we'll walk through kind of the same formats and give you a lot more detail as we see it. As you can imagine, things continue to change by the day as they have.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","Definitely. Thanks for the color.","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you. You're welcome.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just one housekeeping question on the FX guidance, which you've kept pretty flat, but now points to heavier-weighted second half versus first half. I would have thought that comps get easier in the second half versus the first half. So can you just talk about any moving parts that kind of shifted that, if at all?","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. No, the comps don't get easier in the second half as we go. Right now, we've got the euro in our assumptions at about $1.09 as we go, but the comps do not get any easier as we go. We're only about half way through the year, right? These are very volatile, so we're really not changing our guidance at this time.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Ravi, I don't think there is anything to read into there, other than FX is a big headwind to the moving target?","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, very uncertain.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","There's nothing (1:07:36)","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. And just to summarize some of your comments on this call. When you look at the North American market today and just look at the volatility around orders related to the tires and such, what's your feeling on the state of the market today, especially that the state of the channel in terms of the channel being filled versus not?","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Ravi, I guess, maybe the way we look at it is \u2013 first of all, we look at market back from what's happening in terms of the consumers buying tire. And I think what we still see is around a 1% to 2% sell-out, and that's the \u2013 for us that's the key number versus just the sell-in number and that number has actually been pretty consistent. I think from a sell-in standpoint, the numbers are muted and have been on a comparative basis as you've had big periods of buy-aheads and then big periods of not buying, and that can kind of make the sell-in numbers which those share numbers are based on a little bit more difficult to read.","I would tell you and I've said this consistently, we're on our plan, we're not going to get thrown off our game because there was a big sell-in ahead, let's say, by a buy-ahead for a tariff coming in where we look like we've lost share on a sell-in basis, and then have it reversed the next quarter where we look like we're up because dealers have stopped buying those imported tires because of the tariff. We're not going to get thrown by a big up and big down. We're on our way to play on an industry that is growing sell-out 1% to 2% and it's been driving it on our strategy, and I think that's the best answer I can give you.","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. And just on lastly on Europe, you said you aren't planning for a white winter, which is I think the right strategy given what's happened the last couple of years. But how quickly can you adapt if the winter quickly turns yellow to white?","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think, Ravi, we can adapt to a certain extent. But even in winters where we had white winters, there will be in effect land grab for winter tires. And I think, even planning for a white winter if it would happen, there would be a land grab for winter tires, because there hasn't been one in the while and there is \u2013 I would tell you, there's pent-up demand out there for it.","Our view though is, we have to approach this in a very measured way. We have to have balance, both in terms of our inventory and customer service and we'll strike the right balance to the extent that we can supply more tires we're going to go ahead and do that. But we're not going to stake our plan on white winter at this point.","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Right.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks.","Operator","And it appears we have no further questions. So I will return the floor to our presenters for any closing remarks.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, thank you. I'd like to wrap up our call by reiterating how pleased we are with our second quarter and first half results, particularly amid global economic challenges. We expect those challenges to continue in many of our markets but we are confident in our strategy and teams, we're confident in our products and brand, and confident in our ability to reach our growth target and deliver sustainable value.","So, thanks everyone for joining us, and we'll talk with you again next quarter.

My name is Tony, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","I would now like to hand the program over to Christina Zamarro, Goodyear's Vice President of Investor Relations.","Christina Zamarro - Vice President - Investor Relations","Thank you, Tony, and thank you everyone for joining us for Goodyear's second quarter 2016 earnings call. Joining me today are Rich Kramer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Laura Thompson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, there are few items we need to cover. To begin, the supporting slide presentation for today's call can be found on our website at investor.goodyear.com. And a replay of this call will be available later today. Replay instructions were included in our earnings release issued earlier this morning.","If I could now draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statement on slide two. I would like to remind participants on today's call that our presentation includes some forward-looking statements about Goodyear's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments today.","The most significant factors that could affect future results are outlined in Goodyear's filings with the SEC and in our earnings release. The company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","Our financial results are presented on a GAAP basis, and in some cases, a non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures discussed on our call are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent as part of the Appendix to the slide presentation.","And, with that, I'll turn the call over to Rich.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Christina, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will review highlights from our second quarter, provide an update on the industry and the key markets in each of our regions, and give my perspective on our business for the remainder of the year. Laura will follow with a financial review of each of our businesses and an update to our outlook before we open the call for your questions.","In the second quarter, we delivered segment operating income of $531 million, reflecting strong performance across the company. That's a second quarter record in our core segment operating income, which I'll remind you, excludes Venezuela from our 2015 base. Our operating performance helped drive a nearly 40% increase in our adjusted EPS of $1.16.","Our second quarter was anchored by a 37% increase in operating income in our EMEA business unit. Our Asia Pacific business also continued its strong performance with a nearly 10% increase in earnings. Combining this quarter with our record first quarter, our segment operating income for the first half of the year was $950 million, the highest first half ever for Goodyear.","In addition, we delivered overall segment operating margin of 13.7% in the second quarter, an increase over last year. The Americas provided more than half of our SOI and its underlying operations continue to remain solid. Furthermore, all three of our global businesses are in segment operating margins of more than 11.5%.","Taken in total, our segment operating performance reflects the unwavering execution of our strategy, which has proved its strength even in volatile market conditions. Our consistent progress has resulted in steady earnings growth and positions us well for that growth to continue. I'd like to spend the next few minutes providing my perspective on each of our SBUs as well as my thoughts on the industry outlook for the remainder of the year.","The Americas, which as a reminder, now includes both our North America and Latin America businesses delivered $291 million of operating income. As expected, its earnings were less than last year because of a few discrete items in the quarter. Laura will provide more detail on those items in her remarks.","Nonetheless, the Americas' underlying business performance remains strong and continues to demonstrate the earnings power of the value proposition in our core business. Demand remain robust for our premium HVA tires and particularly in light truck and SUV. These segments take advantage of our strengths and continue to drive growth in mix in our U.S. business.","We continue to see strong demand for our Wrangler DuraTrac and our Wrangler All-Terrain Adventure products. In addition, our fitments for passenger cars also performed very well in the quarter specifically our Eagle RS-A, the Eagle F1 Asymmetric All-Season and the Assurance ComforTred.","In broader industry terms, the underlying fundamentals in the U.S. such as miles driven, gasoline prices and fuel consumption remain favorable. Americans used an average of almost 9.8 million barrels of gasoline a day in the four weeks ending July 1, the highest level since the Energy Information Administration started collecting weekly consumption data 35 years ago.","Also, while the SAAR is moderated from its peak levels, SUV and light truck vehicle growth has increased 6% over the last 12 months. The OEs depend on the technology and the performance characteristics of Goodyear's high-value-added products for SUV and light truck fitments. And these are the type of platforms we target with our OE strategy; and it's working.","The U.S. replacement industry data on the whole however reflected softer volumes in the second quarter compared to a year ago. As we've outlined on slide six, this decline was primarily as a result of a higher than normal level of imports in the second quarter of last year. You'll recall imports were abnormally low in the first quarter of 2015 following the announcement of the U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports. The situation was exacerbated by a port strike making product flow difficult for many importers.","As a result, the second quarter of 2015 saw about 15 million more imported tires than the first quarter. And separately, we've seen some destocking at the dealer and distributor level for some broader market products this quarter. Our view is that this excess inventory was concentrated towards the lower end of the market in the economy and mid-tier segments.","If we take a step back from the quarter, the year-to-date industry sell-in for consumer replacement is up 1%. What's important to note is that within that growth is an increase in rim sizes of 17-inch or greater of 9%. Since the SAAR recovery began in 2010, we've seen several years of growth in OE with the mix shift to those premium tires. Rim size of 17-inch or greater grew from 49% of the OE market in 2009 to 73% in 2013. We're seeing the benefit of that mix shift in the replacement market as well.","Tire sizes of 17-inch and greater grew 10% and 7% in the first and second quarter respectively. And we're outperforming in this portion of the market. The Goodyear brand nearly doubled the industry in growth in 17-inch and greater rim sizes in the second quarter. This is exactly what our OE strategy was designed to do.","As you know, we've been investing in our U.S. plants to increase our capability to supply more premium HVA tires. Some of that investment has been in CapEx, and some in engineering and shifts in production within our existing footprint. We're continuing to increase our capability to grow in this profitable segment.","Looking ahead, we expect that the overall U.S. industry will remain weak in July as a result of the highest import comparable from all of 2015. In the intermediate to longer term, we continue to feel very confident about the fundamentals in the U.S. and continue to expect strong demand for our HVA products.","Turning now to Brazil, economic conditions there remain challenging during the quarter. Industry shipments and consumer replacement were down about 2% and OE continued its steep decline. Despite the macroeconomic headwinds, Brazil's profit contribution was once again positive in the quarter. We feel very good about our ability to drive growth in mix in HVA segments in Brazil over the long-term, and while the economic recovery isn't around the corner, we believe that we're well-positioned in the marketplace when it does occur. And we do believe that it will occur.","Now, shifting to Europe, our EMEA business unit delivered $148 million in operating income during the second quarter. That's a 37% increase, driven by strong volume in both consumer OE and replacement. Industry sell-in remained healthy during the second quarter, especially in OE, which was driven by higher production levels in Western Europe. New passenger car registration grew for the 34th month in a row in June, posting growth of more than 9% in the first half of the year.","European auto companies' preference for premium, large rim diameter HVA tires, including Goodyear's high performance lines are driving mix up in OE and later on in replacement across the region. And we're delivering award-winning products to meet that demand. We recently launched the new Eagle F1 Asymmetric 3, ultra-high performance tire, an industry-leading product for Europe's growing OE market. The new member of the Eagle family was tested by leading organizations and outperformed other brands in both dry and wet conditions, as well as in durability, leading to demand pull from our premium OE customers across the region.","In EMEA consumer replacement, we saw a strong growth in our SUV and light truck segments as Goodyear-branded summer tires, particularly EfficientGrip SUV tires claimed the top spot in several important magazine tests.","As we look to the second half of the year, we are again taking a measured approach to winter tire sales based on the warmer weather we've seen in the region over the past several years. Although, the winter inventory situation is more balanced heading into the selling season versus last year. Our plan is based on a green winter, and weather aside, our products are positioned to win in the marketplace. The strength of our winter tire portfolio combined with an attractive value proposition for our customers, has us well-positioned to make the most of winter industry demand.","Finally, as you know, we've been focused on our cost initiatives in the EMEA and improvements in this area also contributed to the regions earnings in the quarter. With the economic uncertainties surrounding Brexit and its impact in Europe in the intermediate and longer term, we will remain both agile and diligent on cost actions in this changing market.","In Asia Pacific, we achieved record segment operating income of $92 million with volume growth of 21%. Our unit volumes were up 4% excluding the impact of our newly reacquired Japanese replacement business. As we've seen in prior quarters, volume growth was robust in our China consumer business, but there was further deterioration in Australia due to ongoing challenges in the country.","China had a strong second quarter with Consumer Tire volume growth of 8% and double-digit growth in the SUV and light truck segments. We've had success in both OEM replacement in winning new Chinese OE accounts in a strong execution of sell-through programs building upon our expanding service and retail network there.","Consistent with our strategy, we grew in Asia Pacific with the right mix of products. As an example, Asia Pacific scored product wins with its Sport Maxx high-performance tire which was awarded Best-in-Class in the 2016 MOTOR Magazine Tyre Test. Sport Maxx outperformed its competition in all five of the tested performance attributes beating the competing tires by the biggest margin in eight years.","Designed for a wide range of high-performance vehicles, our innovative products are driving demand in the region. We remain very optimistic about the long-term value proposition of our business in Asia Pacific. Our new product introductions, growing OE relationships and increasing points of distribution give us confidence that we will continue to be successful and grow in this important market.","Looking back at our global businesses in the second quarter, and over the first half, I'm very pleased with our record results which were driven by strong demand in premium HVA products across our regions. The Goodyear brand and our value propositions continues to be a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Goodyear's value proposition has many elements, including a trusted iconic global brand, industry-leading products, diverse distribution channels capable of responding to customer requirements, strong customer relationships, particularly at the OEMs and an unwavering focus on the consumer.","Our teams have made the commitment to winning with consumers and helping our customers build their businesses everyday while taking the long view of creating sustainable value. Our first half results demonstrate that, and we are focused on execution across our markets by pursuing profitable volume and share in segments where the Goodyear brand is a differentiator. We are committed to our target of 10% to 15% annual growth, or $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion of segment operating income in 2016. We look forward to discussing emerging trends in our industry and our strategic plans for the future as part of our Investor Day on September 15.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Laura.","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Rich, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our second quarter results and provide more detail on key income drivers in the quarter. I'll also provide an update regarding our full year outlook for 2016 before we open the call up for your questions.","Turning to the income statement on slide eight, you will see our results for the second quarter. Consistent with our presentation in April, we have provided call-outs that highlight the effect of deconsolidating Venezuela. Looking at the income statement items as reported for the second quarter, the sales comparison to prior-year was negatively impacted by the deconsolidation of Venezuela, which had $115 million of net sales in the second quarter of 2015. Similarly, other tire related revenues were lower by $86 million, driven by the 2015 sale of the North American motorcycle business.","Additionally, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies reduced sales by $84 million year-over-year. Our gross margins were stable at 27.5% and segment operating margin increased 50 basis points in the quarter. Excluding the impact of Venezuela, SOI margin increased 1 full point.","Our earnings per share on a diluted basis was $0.75. Our results were influenced by certain significant items. Adjusting for these items, our earnings per share with $1.16. I'll note that our segment operating income in the quarter was impacted by a $24 million unfavorable out-of-period adjustment related to the elimination of intercompany profit in the Americas region. The correction is related primarily to 2012 to 2015 prior period financials with the majority attributable to 2012. This amount is included as a significant item in the adjusted net income.","Turning to the step chart on slide nine, which walks second quarter 2015 segment operating income to second quarter 2016. After adjusting for the $36 million impact of Venezuela, our 2015 core SOI was $514 million. The benefit of higher volume in the second quarter and higher production levels in the first quarter drove an overall improvement of $21 million. Lower raw material cost of $49 million more than offset reduced price mix of $44 million for a net benefit of $5 million during the quarter.","Cost savings actions of $66 million driven by our operational excellence initiatives more than offset the negative impact of inflation, delivering a net benefit of $33 million. Foreign currency exchange was a headwind of $10 million reflecting the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, particularly against the Argentine peso, the Canadian dollar and the Brazilian real.","Other was lower by $8 million and includes a $14-million impact of the divestiture of our North American motorcycle business which was partially offset by lower incentive compensation of $10 million. In summary, we achieved another record quarter with growth in core SOI of 3%. Excluding the impact of the out-of-period adjustment, our core SOI was $555 million and growth was 8%.","Turning to the balance sheet on slide 10. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $1.1 billion. Net debt is up versus year-end which reflects the normal working capital seasonality in our business. Versus the prior-year period, the increase includes the impact of Venezuela's deconsolidation.","Free cash flow from operations is shown on slide 11. For the quarter, we generated $99 million of cash. Working capital was a use of $75 million of cash and in line with the typical seasonality of our business. Additionally, cash flow from operating activities was $261 million for the three months ended June 30.","Now, let's move to the business units on slide 12. The Americas generated segment operating income of $291 million in the second quarter, or 13.9% of sales. The year-over-year decline in SOI is more than explained by several noteworthy items that totaled $79 million: First, the $36 million impact of the deconsolidation of Venezuela. Second, the $24 million out-of-period adjustment, primarily related to 2012. And third, a $19 million impact from the sale of GDTNA business last year.","The Americas also saw higher conversion costs in the quarter, due to additional engineering activities and a shift in production to increase our supply of HVA tires. Despite these headwinds, our core business in the Americas continues to be strong. The execution of our strategy enables us to continue to realize positive price mix performance. Customers are demanding more of our HVA tires, particularly premium, SUV and light truck tires.","Unit sales in the second quarter were 18.8 million, or down 6% versus 2015. In OE, our unit volume decreased by 900,000 units. The sale of GDTNA, which included sales of Dunlop-branded tires to Japanese OEMs in the U.S. explains almost half of the decline. And we also saw OE declines in both Brazil and in the U.S. Excluding the impact of Venezuela, our replacement volume was flat.","In summary, and despite several notable headwinds within the Americas region, the underlying performance is solid. The quarter also offers proof of our margin sustainability. Excluding the out-of-period adjustment, the Americas achieved SOI margins that was higher than last year. We accomplished this margin improvement in markets that were softer and with significantly lower raw material tailwinds. This performance is validation of the strength of our strategy, product and the Goodyear brand in the marketplace.","Turning to slide 13, Europe, Middle East and Africa continued to deliver positive results with segment operating income of $148 million in the quarter, up 37% compared to prior year. This was the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year earnings growth driven by higher production and sales volumes throughout the region, as well as our continued focus on cost savings initiatives.","Volume was up more than 4% compared to last year, and was driven by growth in both consumer OE and replacement channels. Strong demand for Goodyear products resulted in an 8% increase in consumer OE units, and consumer replacement volumes were up almost 3% in the quarter. Winter industry demand also increased more than 10% year-on-year in the quarter, evidence of channel inventories being more normalized this year.","Our commercial truck business also continues to deliver consistent results with volumes up almost 4% in the quarter. Our EMEA business delivered very strong performance in the second quarter of 2016. We remain confident in our team, our product portfolio, and in our ability to deliver sustainable revenue and profit growth.","Turning to slide 14, Asia Pacific delivered record second quarter segment operating income of $92 million, an $8 million improvement versus last year. The main drivers continued to be strong volume growth and the benefit of lower raw material costs which were partially offset by lower price mix and increased SAG expenses related to our recently acquired replacement business in Japan. Our segment operating margin in the region increased to 17.4% up from 17.1% a year ago.","Asia Pacific's volume was 7.3 million tire units representing a 21% growth versus last year. Excluding the impact of our acquisition of the Japanese replacement tire business, the remaining volume growth is primarily attributable to our 8% consumer tire growth in China, one of our largest and fastest growing markets in the region. Additionally, the ASEAN countries saw 6.5% growth across our business, which was partially offset by lower volume in Australia. We are well-positioned in Asia Pacific and continue to be excited about the long-term growth and opportunities there.","Turning now to slide 15, I'll cover our full year modeling assumptions for 2016. In summary, our full year outlook and SOI income drivers remain unchanged from our April call. We continue to target $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion in SOI in 2016. With moderating raw material costs since April, we now expect raw material cost to be about 4% lower than last year before cost savings action.","We continue to see our full year price mix versus raw material benefit at around $75 million, unchanged from our earlier outlook. We expect third quarter raw materials to be down about 4% based on current spot rates. The remaining price mix, net of raw materials benefit, should flow evenly across the back half of the year.","In cost savings versus inflation, we continue to expect a benefit of $135 million for the full year. The remaining net cost savings are expected to be more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter. Regarding foreign currency translation, we continue to expect a headwind of approximately $45 million. While current spot rates would imply a slightly more favorable outcome, currencies remain volatile. The divested North American motorcycle business will have a negative $10-million impact year-over-year for the third quarter.","Additional financial assumptions for 2016 are listed on slide 16. Our income tax rate has been lowered to about 28% of global pre-tax operating profit following our experience to date. Cash taxes remain at 10% to 15% of global pre-tax operating profit.","And finally, we repurchased $100 million of shares during the second quarter. We've repurchased $563 million so far under our existing $1.1 billion share repurchase authorization, and we remain committed to repurchasing additional shares through 2016 and early 2017.","Now, we'll open the line up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our first question from David Tamberrino from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, folks.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","How are you, David?","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning, Rich, Laura, Christina. Thanks for taking our questions here. Just a couple for us. I think the first one would be, in Europe, the strength and sustainability of the margin improvement that you're seeing within the region, a little bit surprising to us. I think it was about a 300-basis point increase in SOI margin year-over-year. As we progress through the remainder of 2016, are you expecting to continue those operational efficiencies to continue and really see double-digit margins in both the third quarter and the fourth quarter?","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, David, good question, I'm glad you focused on it, because we were pretty pleased with the way Europe delivered in the quarter. And I might take just two seconds to give you a view on how we think about Europe overall. We still view it as really a fantastic market despite some of the ongoing, let's say, unsolved economic issues that still linger over there. Remember, the market is growing there, particularly in 17-inch and above, particularly that when you compare it to 16-inch and below, where you're not seeing nearly as much growth, and sometimes it can even be viewed as flat depending on the market. We see the market as still demanding excellent technology driven by the OEMs. We really love the car park that still sits in Europe there. So, we look at it as a great market and add to it then the seasonal market as you bring in winter tires, and the winter tire, the winter-summer switch, really a robust market for us.","The biggest headwind we still see there as we've talked about in the past is the ongoing sort of movement of low-end Asian tires particularly in through Eastern Europe that is has and probably will continue to cause a headwind. And again, it's an example of when tariffs go up in one region, those tires typically move to somewhere else. You may remember in the past, they went down to South America, as those economies slowed and currencies depreciated, tariffs are back in the U.S., now they are in Eastern Europe. So, that's a continued headwind for us over there.","But our goal is to continue to drive mix, continue to align our distribution consistent with our strategy over there. Our focus will be on new products, and leveraging our brands, and to the point you made continuing to focus on our cost actions over there. So, I would say that we've made an improvement in Europe. We would expect those cost improvements to stick with us. I would say we're only on the front-end of fixing our European business over the long-term. Our goal is to do some of the same things we've done in North America and Europe as well, and we feel very good about that. But that's probably not a direct straight line either.","So, as we fight off the low cost tires coming into the East that actually has a negative impact on our mix in Europe, that hide some of the positive impacts we're getting on the 17-inch and above. So, I guess, overall, I would say, we would expect strong results in Europe as we look to 2016 and out into 2017. I would expect that you'll still see some significant cost actions there as we move ahead, as we look at our production over there, and Jean-Claude Kihn and the team over there are very focused on cost, day-to-day cost, as well as structural cost to reduce the fixed cost to that business going forward. So, I feel good. And I would say we're on the front-end of what we expect.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's very helpful. Maybe just to follow-up from there, I mean, post the British referendum, have you seen any changes in demand patterns by your dealers and distribution points within the UK, or is it still too early to call?","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I would say it's too early. I would also say that before we went to the Euro, a number of years back now, obviously, the European market had a very sophisticated way, or not sophisticated as you might say, but they were very adept at dealing with a currency arbitrage on tires. We would expect to see a little of that as this sort of seeds in, but given that production in UK has been diminished greatly from the period that I am talking about, I don't think we see any significant disruption coming there. We like our business in the UK, and we certainly think we can manage through this.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's very helpful. And then, just a last one from me and I'll pass it over. On the cadence for price mix less raw materials, obviously, we've seen oil somewhat creep up sequentially, but still be down year-over-year.","As we think about the go forward, if raw materials do continue to hold the levels where they are and end up increasing year-over-year, how do you expect the P&L to flow for price mix less raws as raw materials increase and then possible prices are passed on to consumers, because the reason I ask is, one of the larger questions or push back that I'll get from investors is really just on the industry being able to be price disciplined. And if there's going to be a quarter or two quarters or after a year or two quarters or three quarters of a year where the tire manufacturers are essentially caught with increasing raw material cost without adding in or passing on those price increases?","And as you look at 2Q results with only a price mix less raw materials of positive $5 million versus first quarter of about $38 million, and you start to question, what's going to change in the back half of the year that's going to maintain net positive price mix over raw materials if in the event that we had the second quarter really being eaten away in a favorable raw material environment?","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. So, hey David, maybe I'll walk you through a couple of things to answer your question. So, first of all, the one short answer is price mix versus raws, obviously a big piece of that is mix. And there are some things we're doing in the business that result in a much stronger mix as we get into the second half of the year. So, that's one piece of it.","Now, similar to my opening remarks, as we look at the remaining price mix net of raws benefit, we do see it slowing evenly across the back half of the year. So, when you look at the third quarter and the fourth quarter, to get to our full year guide of the $75 million year-over-year. We see about a 4% decrease in raws in the third quarter, getting to more like down 1% or 2% in the fourth quarter. So, about 4% in the third quarter, maybe down 1% or so in the fourth quarter.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And I might just add to Laura's comments, I think in terms of the markets out there, as we look at high end \u2013 the value we're getting in the market for high end tires versus the value that the market is putting out for low-end tires is certainly based on the supply-demand equation as well. So, we feel pretty good about that environment. The demand for those tires is really good.","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Very strong.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And that gives us confidence as we look to the back half of the year heading out into 2017. David, the other thing I would just add more is sort of a historical macro comment. We have weathered both significant price increase, raw material increases, and certainly, giving those raw material price increases back, or having those raw material prices increases decrease. And I think our track record is very good at managing both the pluses and the minuses, the increases and the decreases as we manage our business. And as we said, you can have timing differences to catch-up, if you have significant movements in raw materials. But I think our track record speaks for itself, and certainly, we would plan to execute consistent with that track record.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Appreciate the thorough response. Again, very helpful and congrats on the quarter.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we'll move to Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Have you learned anything more since the last call about the prospect of U.S. tariffs on Chinese commercial truck tires? I think the proposed countervailing duties are running about 20% on average, and then there is the potential for maybe anti-dumping duties on top of that. So, when are you expecting more clarity on this? Have you run any scenarios yourselves? And I do think it has the potential to have a material impact to 2017 profits?","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Ryan, I mean, we sort of follow the same things that are out there in the public domain. And I think that's about what we would just repeat to you in terms of where the processes are. There's certain dates that the government has given on the various steps that they are going to go through. We've dealt with tariffs before on consumer tires. We saw some of the impacts of those. I mentioned that a bit earlier in terms of how products flow and the like, but our view has always been were for free and fair trade as we import and we export around the world. So, we will watch this and we will manage our business accordingly. We did that last time, and we would expect to do the same thing with our truck tires here. And as Laura went through our projections, I think we'll stick with those and you don't see it highlighting anything related to that.","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Exactly. I think in what we can be assured of is if this goes into place as it appears it might, we'll have a lot of distortion in the industry numbers, right, ahead of that as it goes pre-buys and all that, that we'll have to work through that we kind of know for sure.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, no, that's a great point, Laura. Yeah.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. Very helpful. Then just last question. It's another one on Brexit. Obviously, a lot of uncertainty. I think we got a good grasp on currency translation. So, anything special to think about relative to currency transaction. I mean, I was just looking on your website, it looks like you have one out of 20 plants in the EMEA region, maybe is in the UK. But I don't know about the relative sizes of these plants. Is it fair to say you're a net importer of tires into the UK? Are you able to somehow \u2013 do you think it's not going to have a material impact because you can offset this what, because of how you're moving tires around, or because of price increases, or does this have the potential to be material? I think you were saying earlier, maybe no?","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, you're exactly right. The short answer is, we do see it as immaterial. So, we do not manufacture any tires in the UK any longer. In fact, we did some small amount of mixing, maybe a year or so ago, that we announced that we're shutting down. So, we do not manufacture any there. Roughly for us, the UK is maybe about 2.5% of our sales. It's primarily consumer tires, and directly, we import all of the tires into that region. So again, not within \u2013 within the UK, not a tremendous exposure certainly like everybody, the larger question is still the whole impact on the Eurozone and growth there over time kind of yet to be determined.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I appreciate it. Thanks.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Ryan.","Operator","Great. Thank you. And next we'll move to Itay Michaeli with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Itay.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. Good morning, everyone. Maybe just starting off with cash flow, balance sheet. Laura, maybe you could just kind of just bridge us on how to think about the free cash flow second half of the year. And particularly, perhaps the bridge to get to the (40:05) 2.1 times gross leverage target you set out before the end of the year?","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, sure. So, as we look at the balance sheet, right, and our capital allocation plan, we still have \u2013 let me, just kind of the numbers here in front of me, we still have based on achieving our targets this year, some debt repayment to come into play, potentially about $450 million, as we end the year and early next year, so we'll continue on that path, part of the capital allocation plan. You saw us make a debt payment last year. And again, as achieve our target, that's really the biggest movement I think on the balance sheet for the rest of the year.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. And maybe shifting back to mix, you talked about the strength in light truck segments and SUV. I think you've previously disclosed that your Goodyear products are represented on about 75% of the top 15 SUVs and light trucks in the U.S. So, how do we think about kind of the replacement opportunity in these segments in terms of your market share and in terms of the potential incremental mix opportunities in the replacement market in the next two years given the shift that we've seen in the OE market towards these light trucks?","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Itay, I think I would say in brief we feel really good about it. And I would say what we're seeing today is the benefit of the team that now Americas had Steve McClellan and his team put together a number of years ago were looking at what was coming in the market, having what we called our OE selectivity strategy which is really about being targeted and saying what are the fitments that we see coming out there, how do we bring our innovation and technology to those fitments working with the OEMs. And then looking at what the replacement cycle is with the target as you know on the early replacements.","As we look at, I think it was slide six in our deck, you can see that the mix is moving up 17-inch above from 49% up to 73% in total. And what it says is, most of those, maybe I shouldn't say most, that's maybe too specific, I don't have the number here. But those tires \u2013 those vehicles, I should say out there with a high SAAR that we see still haven't come to first replacement yet. So, we feel really good about those vehicles, those light trucks and SUVs which, as you know, are the top-selling vehicles in the U.S. are going to be coming in for replacements as we look to the future.","So not only do we feel good today and in the past relative to these, we feel pretty good about where that market is going to be in the future. So, that's a gift that's going to keep moving for us as we move ahead. And I would say very intentionally, our goal, as you also know is that we got to keep making those tires.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. That's very helpful, Rich. Thanks so much.","Operator","Great. And thank you. Next, we'll move to Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Brett.","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So, first kind of a follow on from a capital allocation standpoint. What are you going to do with the cash after you get our debt down to the level that you'd like to achieve? In other words, I don't see you as a company that's going to go on and do a lot of M&A, you're kind of doing more divestitures and acquisitions at this point in time, and it seems as though the reallocation towards share repurchase may be in order here?","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So you know, Brett, it's good. And this is a lot about what we're going to talk about at our Investor Day, okay? But there is no doubt, right, that just as I walked through on the debt repayment and certainly the pension actions, as we look forward, we do expect the cash requirements for deleveraging to go down, to diminish certainly, okay, as we get to that leverage target. We've taken the pension actions and the debt repayment actions then, so we would have more cash available for other purposes. And that's really where we're going to lay all that out for you on September 15, as part of our Investor Day.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And along those lines, another three-year plan is in order?","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, we're working through that. You know what I mean, it's not for sure that it's three years. We've certainly have a view three, a view five, all that. That's what we're working through at this point, Brett, but it will be a long-term view.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Very good. And then, switching gears here. As far as Europe is concern, as I kind of look at European sales, there right now, we've kind of got it running around 60 million units, but back in the good old days, before global warming, we used to do 70 million to 80 million tires. My question is, if we had a white winter, is there any reason why you can't get back to that 70 million to 80 million tire range that you used to be at, let's say, three years or four years ago?","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Brett, I think, you have a couple of things going on there. One, I mean, you are correct with a white winter, we, as well as the industry would no doubt sell more tires. I think from a high, we're down, I think, well over 20% from where a white winter would have industry volume. So, definitely, that would be an increase to our volume. And our share in there, our tires, our products in there performed very well. So, that certainly would help us in a significant way.","I'll also remind you, because we haven't had one of these in a while, there is a sell-in season that's going on now for winter tires. And we feel again pretty good about that because the channels are not as full as they've been in the past. But you'll also have a situation where you're making those tires early. So, as we said, we're planning for a green winter. We're not planning for a white winter. That's for inventory and cost purposes. But we are keeping the ability and the flexibility to try to make more of those tires should we get into a white winter and be able to catch-up those. So, that's part of our strategy.","I would say the second thing, just in general, on EMEA volumes, what you're also seeing there is sort of an intentional mix shift towards us not just going volume for volume, but looking at how we concentrate on HVA tires in both the OE and the replacement markets as well as in certain geographic markets. And by also doing that and making investments to do that, we are also then not pursuing aggressively, not volume for volume sake, some low-end tires that are just not a place where the Goodyear-Dunlop brands can add value and where our value proposition doesn't play well.","We see in Europe just like we used to see in the U.S. and still do in some cases sort of a four tires for $99. You see those same type of offerings in certain parts of Europe. That's not where we're going to play. It's not where we can deliver the value that our investors would expect from us. So, that's playing into it as well.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you, Rich. Thank you, Laura.","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. You're welcome.","Operator","Great. And next we'll move to Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Patrick Nolan - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. It's actually Pat Nolan for Rod.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Pat.","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Pat.","Patrick Nolan - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Two questions. First, just a follow-up on the price mix versus raws. So, it looks like you're getting a little bit bigger benefit from raws than you were previously expecting. It still sounds like you're going to get positive price mix. I think, if I'm correct, I think the previous plan assumed that you needed to get some price towards the back end of this year. Is that no longer the case that you need to put through price to achieve the goal for the year?","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Pat, I think as we look around the world, the answer to that question is obviously a complicated one, because markets are different. I would say, as we look to some markets like Brazil or Latin America, where we have significant currency devaluations and we've seen raw materials, not just natural rubber, dollar-based raw materials go up, we are continuing to manage as you'd expect. We've announced price increases in Brazil, for example, from Q3 2015 all through to Q1 2016, because of the devaluation that we've seen in the currency there. So, there is a market we will continue to be very active trying to get the value for our products in the marketplace.","Other markets obviously have different stories. I won't go through everywhere like that. But I would say that the world around excess capacity, again, I'll use Brazil as an example, where the OE business was down again about 20% in the quarter, we've got to be very vigilant in managing price mix versus raw materials. So, it's very hard to answer that question in one way, I would say definitely, we are going to continue down the path to do that.","Patrick Nolan - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Maybe just to drill down on that. So, it sounds like the inventory issues seem to be more concentrated in the low end, particularly in North America. Do you think \u2013 can the industry put through some upward movement in price based on what we've seen raws do over the past year?","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we can't comment on what the industry can do Pat, that's a tough one for us.","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I can tell you our view is, we have a value proposition out there around products, around innovation, around brand, around promotion, around advertising, around bringing solutions to customers in both consumer and commercial, and that value proposition is what we try to win in the marketplace with.","Patrick Nolan - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And Rich, I was curious if you give us your perspective on the North American volumes. I mean, if you look at the RMA member volumes based on your slide, down slightly year-to-date. But all the trends as you guys have highlighted, whether it's miles driven, gasoline usage, all these trends point to what should be an improving demand dynamic. What do you think is restraining that volume growth for the industry?","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. I'd tell you, it's a very good question as we think through this, Pat. I think there's a couple of things that are happening as we sort of dissect this. And if we think about it, what we're still seeing, and what we have seen for a while is sort of that consistent sell-out. Remember sell-out tends to follow GDP over time. There can be dislocations, but sell-out and GDP tend to be a pretty correlative thing over a period of time.","What we're seeing right now, again, as Laura alluded to it is, really how tariffs have disrupted some of the RMA figures that are out there. So, if I could walk you through a couple of things very quickly, and you can I think refer back to slide five, it is in our deck. But remember, in the second half of 2014, you had a really big pre-buy ahead of the tariffs coming into the market. What that did was in Q1 2015, you remember we said this last quarter, we had a pretty easy comp, because if you think about just behaviorally, the channel stopped buying as they bought a lot of in the second half of 2014. What they did in the second quarter of 2015, was start to restock again. And as they did that, our Q2 2015 to Q2 2016 comp became tougher.","So, you see on a gross basis, a little growth happening, but it's really, again, all because of imports coming in and the volumes at the low end of the market. And I think, Laura also made the comment, or I made the comment that, you're going to see that continue in the month of July, because it's actually highest comp in the year where you saw a lot of restocking going on in the channel.","So, I have you think about, if I could maybe put that part a little more succinctly, tariffs really do distort the industry as we go. Those tariffs really impact the low end of the market, which is not where we play, it's not where we focus, we're focusing on that 17-inch and above. And 17-inch and above, as we showed you, we saw in Q1 and Q2, that market grew 10% and 7% using the USA numbers of the industry. So, I think, you are actually seeing good growth in that part of the market where you don't see it distorted by the tariffs. So that's one element of it.","The second element of it, I would say, we look at it vehicle miles traveled, gasoline usage to SAAR, everything is pretty good. But you have to remember we kind of say all vehicle miles traveled aren't created equal. So, you have a lot of new cars on the road. I think I mentioned this earlier, that really haven't come in for that first replacement yet. So, you got a lot of new cars that are continuing to drive those vehicle miles traveled.","And you also have to remember, RMA numbers are based on sell-in not sell-out where vehicle miles traveled would be rubber burning on the road which would be more akin to a sell-out number, not a sell-in number. So, when you have all those distortions happening with the channel on sell-in because of tariffs, you see this sort of at the moment dislocation between sell-in and sell-out, or said another way that the RMA is reporting of what's actually happening out in the marketplace.","So, we would think those two things are going to come together as we get some consistency in terms of comps over time. And we'd say, we're really very pleased at what's happening because the market of 17-inch and above, or HVA, we use that 17-inch and above to sort of highlight this in the slide, the HVA markets are really moving in a very positive way. And as I said earlier, that's something we feel really good about, particularly as we look out to the future, because those haven't hit the replacement market yet. Our issue is, we just got to keep making more of those tires. So, long story, but hopefully that helps.","Patrick Nolan - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","No, it's helpful color. I'll get back in the queue. Thank you very much.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we'll move to Emmanuel Rosner with CLSA. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Emmanuel.","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Emmanuel.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","So, first just quick housekeeping questions on your adjusted income statement. There seem to be a $20 million other income in the quarter. And I was curious if you just know off hand what this relates to and sort of what kind of run rate we should be expecting for that?","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, in the quarter, right, we had about $20 million in that other income and expense line. It includes $44 million of redemption premium related to those $900 million of senior notes that we did, I believe, in June. It's offset slightly by that $4 million recovery of the asbestos past costs that we had in the quarter as well. And then the $10 million in kind of our change in assumptions related to the insurance recoveries for asbestos. So, all of that kind of built in to that Q2 of about $20 million. Now, both the $44 million and the $4 million on asbestos for the recovery of past costs have been adjusted out of the net income in our presentation of the adjusted net income.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","Right. So, the adjusted $20 million income excluding all these sort of like unusual, is that something that's \u2013 I mean this other income adjusted, is that something that's sustainable?","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think you have \u2013 like I said, the unusual ones are the $44 million and the $4 million.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","Yes.","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, I think, as you think about other income going forward, normalize it for that.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","Yes. Okay. Understood. And I guess sort of, looking sort of at your global SOI growth in the quarter on a organic basis sort of trying to exclude Venezuela for example. It seems like it was about up 8% year-over-year, so a little bit of maybe a deceleration versus Q1. How do you think about that sort of like going forward in the context of your full year guidance of still 10% and 15%? And in particular, what sort of factors would enable you to reach sort of the higher end of the guidance?","Richard J. Kramer - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, Emmanuel; as we said, we're sticking to our guidance and we feel good about that. But I can tell you that the one thing about the tire industry is it doesn't move in a straight line. So, while we feel good about where we're going for the year, we had some \u2013 as I think Laura mentioned, some incremental cost headwind coming in particularly in the Americas in the second quarter. That's reflected in the numbers.","Hey, look, those things can happen as we move ahead. We got to manage through those, that's what we're hired to do here, and we feel confident about doing that. I don't think the 8% in the second quarter \u2013 8% adjusted as you just said would give us any different view, nor would I suggest to give you any different view about how we feel. That said, the markets are \u2013 this is a tough economy, Latin America still hasn't recovered. That's tough now, upside later. So, we're working hard every day to deliver these numbers.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","And can you sort of just go back over these cost headwinds; I mean, I'm not talking about the sort of like unusuals, but sort of like, on a clean underlying basis, ex-items, what sort of like extra spendings sort of happening in the Americas currently?","Laura K. Thompson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, I think, all the details would be in the 10-Q as we go, but as I walked it through in my script, so certainly, you go through taking Venezuela of $36 million out of the prior year, right? We had the divestiture in North America, the motorcycle business, GDTNA, that's about $19 million out of the second quarter of last year.","And then again, as we talked about and guided to frankly for the second quarter, we did have in the Americas a cost headwind of just about $30 million. And we called that out so, you could model for that for the second quarter. But going forward, all the cost is just built into the guidance, right? The cost savings versus inflation, okay? So, that's kind of when you look at the second quarter, that's really the extra that hit in the second quarter, and it isn't there for the full year on our 10% to 15%, or $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion.","Now, the $29 million, as we said back in the first quarter, is really some extra labor, it's engineering expense, it's really everything we've done to shift more and more to those more complex HVA tires, and that does add costs. But, the margin with that the benefit from that more than offsets it.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Laura K.

My name is Keith and I\u2019ll be your conference operator today. At this time, I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to hand the program over to Christina Zamarro, Goodyear's Vice President, Investor Relations.","Christina Zamarro","Thank you, Keith, and thank you all for joining us for Goodyear\u2019s 2014 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me today are Rich Kramer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Laura Thompson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, there are a few items we need to cover. The supporting slide presentation for today's call can be found on our website at investor.goodyear.com, and a replay of this call will be available later today. Replay instructions were included in our earnings release issued earlier this morning.","If I could now draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statements on slide two. I would like to remind participants on today\u2019s call that our presentation includes some forward-looking statements about Goodyear\u2019s future performance; actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments today.","The most significant factors that could affect future results are outlined in Goodyear's filings with the SEC and in our earnings release. The company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.","Our financial results are presented on a GAAP basis and in some cases, a non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures discussed on the call are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent as part of the appendix to the slide presentation.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rich.","Rich Kramer","Thank you, Christina, and good morning, everyone. Today, I\u2019ll discuss our fourth quarter and full-year results and touch on some of the highlights that helped us deliver full-year record segment operating income in 2014. I\u2019ll also address our outlook for 2015. Laura will follow with the review of each of our businesses and a detailed outlook before we open the call four your questions.","I\u2019m extremely pleased with what our teams in all our regions accomplished over the past year, particularly in light of ongoing global economic volatility, which increased dramatically in the fourth quarter and was amplified by the strengthening U.S. dollar.","In North America, our team delivered record earnings for the year. With steady execution of our strategy, North America continued to win with consumers. For example, our Assurance All-Season tire launched in 2014 will reach 1 million sold faster than any previous new product. Likewise, our commercial truck business had a strong year as fleets continue to embrace our outstanding products and business solutions model.","Our Europe, Middle East and Africa business had year-over-year segment operating income growth of $140 million. Our product leadership in the region was confirmed by regular wins and podium finishes in the important magazine tests, in addition to setting the pace in European tire labeling.","Latin America featured a steady roll out of new high value-added Goodyear products that were a hit with our customers. In Brazil and Mexico, we grew share by delivering a double-digit increase in consumer replacement volume, as we\u2019ve completely revamped our portfolio to take advantage of the mega trend shift to HVA products.","In the Asia-Pacific region, our volume growth in China and India contributed to record earnings in the fourth quarter. Our products won several awards and we are expanding our distribution to make the most of the opportunities in this growing market.","And 2014 mark the continuation of our operational excellence initiative, which made an important contribution to our earnings growth by delivering cost savings in excess of inflation.","In each region, we succeeded through the disciplined execution of our strategy focused on increasing the value of the Goodyear brand. As you read in our press release, our segment operating income of $1.7 billion was a full-year record. It represents an 8% improvement over last year\u2019s record performance, a significant accomplishment by any measure, but especially gratifying in the midst of challenging global economic conditions in a number of our key markets.","In addition, we generated $1 billion of free cash flow from operations, marking the second straight year we have reached that level of cash generation. As pleased as I\u2019m to report these results, I\u2019ll remind you that our strategy is built for the long-term and our destination is to create sustainable value for our associates, for our customers, and for our shareholders alike.","We believe in the soundness of our strategy and are committed to it even when economic and industry fluctuations demand that we be flexible in our execution. A great example of our strategy in action is our North America business.","North America delivered $229 million in fourth segment operating income, the best performance of any quarter in its history. It was a fitting way to complete a year in which the business reached $803 million of segment operating income, a full-year record. North America is clearly on a path of sustainable performance, as it continues to strengthen its earnings and margins, as a result of our market-back strategy.","Three weeks ago, our annual North America Dealer Conference had the highest attendance in its history. I came away from that meeting more energized than ever, as our customers were more enthusiastic, more optimistic, and more confident than I\u2019ve ever seen.","Many of them, both consumer and commercial truck tire dealers, had very strong years themselves, reflecting the strength of the Goodyear brand in the marketplace and the value of being an aligned Goodyear dealer. I believe we have the best dealer network in the industry because they do more than just sell tires. They capture the value of everything Goodyear has to offer.","As always, new products were one of the main sources of interest and enthusiasm at the conference. This year, we introduced a completely new line of tires for the Kelly brand to complement our line up of Goodyear passenger and light truck tires. The new Kelly tires are our response to our customers need for a branded as the favorable option to Asian imports or private label tires.","Our Kelly line up reinvigorates a well-know brand that our dealers can sell on its value not price alone. The number of orders we\u2019ve taken in advance of the Kelly launch this spring has exceeds our expectation, evidence that these tires will be a hit with our customers.","Now the biggest news from our Dealer Conference, which you may have heard about already, was the announcement of our plan to start selling Goodyear consumer replacement tires online in North America at Goodyear.com. This is how consumers are shopping for many goods and services already, and that\u2019s how we believe they will increasingly shop for tires. This new buying option will allow consumers to purchase tires online and have them installed locally at an authorized Goodyear retailer of their choice.","Beyond just making industry-leading innovative tires, we are focused on making the tire buying process easier for consumers and creating profitable incremental sales opportunities for our aligned dealers. The program, which will be activated later this year, is a major step for Goodyear and for our network partner dealers.","As consumer demographics continue to shift and 80 million millennials come into the marketplace, we have to meet their expectations around buying and shopping experiences. By taking the initiative and embracing this digital format to simply the tire buying process, we believe we will be the industry leader in this space. It\u2019s another Goodyear innovation that goes beyond just tires and a tangible example of our focus on our customers and consumers from the market-back rather than from the factory out.","I\u2019m happy to say that the response from our dealers were pivotable to the success of this program has been overwhelmingly positive. Our collaboration creates synergies to allow both of our businesses to grow, as consumers buying habits evolve.","Think about how much our North America business has progressed. We\u2019ve grown our segment operating income organically from a $300 million loss in 2009 to an $800 million profit in 2014; $1 billion plus rebound in five years. That\u2019s a reflection of a sound strategy and winning execution, and we see continued opportunity ahead.","Returning to our Asia-Pacific business, we delivered a record fourth quarter as we continue to take advantage of growth opportunities across the region. This was despite ongoing economic headwinds in Australia, where we\u2019re still feeling the significant effects of the mining industry slowdown.","Our state-of-the-art factory in Pulandian in China is delivering as planned, producing industry-leading products and providing cost efficiencies to help increase our brand strength and support our growth in the region.","Innovative products remain a pillar of our strategy. And in China, the Goodyear Wrangler was named all-terrain tire of the year and Goodyear Excellence Run On Flat was cited as the Editor\u2019s Choice of the year by a major Chinese automotive magazine.","Now even with these successes, a variety of industry and economic headwinds over the course of the year and the quarter change the playing field in 2014 and will continue to have an impact in 2015. Continued economic and political instability across Europe has affected our business in the region, slowing growth in both Western Europe and emerging markets in the region. In short, Europe continues to muddle along not yet setting itself on a course to a stable recovery.","Venezuela continues to be the most challenging market in Latin America. The economic environment remains difficult and the political situation continues to be unsteady, both clearly affected by the recent decline in oil prices. It\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult to forecast sales, pricing, and supply in Venezuela with any degree of certainty.","Our Brazil original equipment business continues to weaken, as auto production has yet to rebound from an extremely weak 2014 and the country\u2019s economy remains in or near recession. And slower than predicted global economic growth and reduced industry sales volumes particularly outside the U.S. are combining with low raw material cost to create increasingly competitive environments.","But the most significant headwind from 2014 that will carryover and continue to have an impact into the year ahead is unfavorable foreign currency translation due to the continuing strength of the U.S. dollar. The effective translation of our foreign results obscures the progress and growth in our business. At current spot rates, this is a headwind of $180 million in 2015.","While foreign currency headwinds will have a negative effect on segment operating income, our underlying business and operations are more robust than ever. Lead by our momentum in North America, we remain committed to our target of 2015 segment operating income growth of 10% to 15% above last year\u2019s record.","So while the headwinds I mentioned are significant and will call for flexibility in our operations, we remain committed to our strategy and long-term goals. The environment is more difficult now than when we set our targets in 2013, but we know that the global tire industry is cyclical and we are prepared to address it.","In the year ahead, we\u2019ll continue to leverage our strengths where the markets are healthy and take a discipline but flexible approach to be positioned for a recovery in weaker markets. We expect global volume growth of 1% to 2% in a tough market, but are confident that our commitment to pursuing profitable volume will continue to deliver strong results.","We believe the best way to reach our long-term objectives is through continued disciplined execution of the key how-tos of our strategy road map. Taken together, these elements will help us reduce the inherent stress or friction in our business and allow us to make it easier for customers to sell Goodyear tires and for consumers to buy Goodyear tires.","We will continue to innovate to meet the needs of our customers and consumers. Investment in our business will be driven from the market-back and geared toward providing the high value products that differentiate Goodyear in the marketplace.","We\u2019ve seen the tangible results from our operational excellence initiatives and will continue our journey to become more efficient in our supply chain, reducing cost, and building the capabilities necessary to serve our customers better.","And as we have done with operational excellence, we are committed to building a global platform of sales and marketing excellence to take full advantage of our brand and our value proposition and drive profitable growth. We are just getting started in this area as we pivot to growth.","The value of our brand is never been stronger even as economic conditions remain unpredictable. Our focus will stay on winning in the market segments where consumers are willing to pay for the value of our brand, our products, our services, and the total Goodyear experience.","To meet the increasing demand of our products, we expect our new state-of-the-art manufacturing plant for Latin America and North America to come online in 2017. This vital new facility will provide us with more of the high value tires consumers are demanding in those regions. We also are optimizing our global manufacturing footprint to ensure our ability to deliver the right tires at the right cost.","Growth CapEx is required to drive our earnings. However, because of the current slower volume growth in some markets, we are adjusting our CapEx investments in the near-term, which Laura will describe later. As always, we will take a thoughtful approach to investment with an eye on projects that have the highest potential return.","In summary, I believe we are better prepared than ever to handle the volatility in our business. We are mindful of external conditions that affect our business, but we remain committed to profitable growth. We\u2019ve executed our strategy and made investments in our business to gain a competitive advantage.","To increase our competitive advantage in the cyclical tire business, we are increasing our focus on speed and efficiency to better drive our business and improve customer service. There are opportunities across our business to further streamline our operations and improve our processes to better serve our customers and consumers. We will discuss these opportunities in more detail as we move through the year.","Looking back on the full-year, I\u2019m extremely proud of our teams and our achievements. Our results are evidence that we have the right strategy in place and are delivering record profitability through a volatile period of the economic cycle.","We are creating sustainable long-term value and we will continue to do so through a balance of growth investments and actions to reduce costs. We are planning for the current volatility to stay with us for an extended period of time, but we remain committed to our long-term goals and are confident in our ability to reach them.","Our team has worked through the challenging circumstance before and has delivered strong results. That gives me great confidence that we will able to do it again. The tire industry does not grow in a straight line and we won\u2019t be distracted by short-term swings in the market.","In light of the progress we\u2019ve made by executing our strategy, I\u2019m pleased with the state of our business as we look ahead to 2015. The power of our brand and the execution of our strategy, strengthens our belief that we will continue to increase our earnings and value for shareholders not only when the times are good, but when they are challenging as well. This is what our strategy was built to do.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Laura.","Laura Thompson","Thank you, Rich, and good morning, everyone. Today, I\u2019ll cover our fourth quarter results and provide more detail on key items in the quarter. I\u2019ll also provide specifics regarding our outlook for 2015 before opening the call up for your questions.","Turning to slide eight, I would like to highlight a few key items. In the fourth quarter, both our units sold and our net sales were significantly affected by a year-over-year decline in winter tires sold in EMEA, given the unseasonably warm weather in Europe during the quarter.","While our winter tire sales through the third quarter were strong, dealer replenishment in the fourth quarter was severely impacted by very weak sell out, which had double-digit declines in some key markets.","Our EPS on a diluted basics for the quarter was $7.68. Our results were influenced by certain significant items, notably the release of our U.S. tax valuation allowance of $2.2 billion, which was originally established in 2002. After significant items, our adjusted EPS was $0.59. More details can be found in the appendix of today\u2019s presentation on slide 26.","The step chart on slide nine walks fourth quarter 2013 segment operating income to fourth quarter 2014. Lower volumes in EMEA in the quarter and unabsorbed fixed cost due to lower production levels year-over-year reduced income by $53 million for the quarter. Milder winter weather in Europe versus last year drove reduced price mix of $81 million partially offset by lower raw material cost of $30 million.","Driven by our operating excellence initiative, strong cost savings across all of our business units for the quarter of $105 million more than offset the $77 million negative impact of inflation.","For the full-year, we achieved more than $500 million in cost savings, including $55 million from the closure of our Amiens, France facility, and the exit of the farm tire business. Foreign currency exchange with a headwind of $17 million reflecting the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar against almost all other currencies.","Turning to the balance sheet on slide 10, cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year were $2.2 billion, down from $3 billion at the end of 2013. This reduction reflects fully funding the U.S. hourly pension plan in January of 2014, leaving our global unfunded pension obligation at the end of 2014 at $714 million.","This obligation is primarily related to our international pension plans and is in line with our previous guidance. Our U.S. pension de-risking strategy is working. While our discount rate in the U.S. declined thereby increasing our liability, our return on asset successfully offset this change.","Separately, at the end of 2014, we made an adjustment to our U.S. pension liabilities to reflect future mortality improvements in our actuarial assumptions. The result was an increase of $285 million in our pension liability. Despite this increase and based on current assumptions, we expect no required contribution for our U.S. plans for the foreseeable future.","Our total debt balance was up $145 million at year-end. However, on February 3, 2015, we repaid $200 million on our U.S. term loan.","Free cash flow from operations is shown on slide 11. For the full year 2014, we generated nearly $1 billion of free cash flow from operations, with working capital neither a source nor a use of cash in 2014. The walk from net income also reflects the non-cash impact of the release of our U.S. tax valuation allowance of $2.2 billion and the provision for deferred income taxes line.","As a final comment on this slide, the other line of $464 million includes various non-cash items reflected in net income. The most notable of these items is the $200 million in net Venezuela currency losses in 2014.","The strength of our cash generation in the first year of our three-year plan, gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our balanced capital allocation plan. We completed $150 million of share repurchases during the fourth quarter as part of that plan, bringing our full year share repurchases to $233 million, an 8.9 million shares.","Moving now to the business units on slide 12. North America reported quarterly record segment operating income of $229 million and achieved an operating margin of 10.9%, the third quarter in a row at or above 10%. North America benefited from lower raw material costs and lower conversion cost primarily driven by reduced pension expense during the quarter.","North America\u2019s volume was down 1% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Similar to the third quarter, our volume was impacted by tariff pre-buy activity and challenges in fully meeting the strong demand for our premium HVA tires.","As for the pre-buy activity, the U.S. consumer replacement industry continue to face disruption from the anticipation of a tariff on consumer tires imported from China. These imports in the fourth quarter remained very strong through November until the announcement of the preliminary countervailing duty rates.","In December, the level of imports declined by almost half on a year-over-year basis. As a result of the speculative buying during the second half of 2014, channel inventories remain at high levels, which we expect will impact our volumes in the first half of 2015.","We also continue to see strong demand for our premium tires, our back orders for these HVA products remain high. As we outlined on our third quarter call, we are leveraging our global footprint for additional supply and are continuing to invest in our North America production facilities to enable us to meet the increased demand for our premium branded tires in 2015.","Our North America commercial truck replacement business also continue to perform well in the fourth quarter. Our industry-leading fuel-efficient drive tire and fleet business solutions strategy leveraged the robust industry conditions for significant year-over-year growth.","To help continue this growth in 2015, we announced our new Fuel Max LHS steer tire at our Dealer Conference. This new tire will now allow us to offer the number one fuel-efficient drive and steer tire combination in North America. These types of market-back innovative products will continue to allow us to be the leader in premium truck tires in North America.","Europe, Middle East and Africa generated segment operating income of $30 million in the fourth quarter and a margin of 2.3%. Unseasonably warm temperatures resulted in an 11% decline in the European winter tire industry sell-in in the fourth quarter. This had a direct impact on our volume and in turn our results in EMEA. The overall volume decline impacted EMEA\u2019s SOI by approximately $40 million.","The combination of warm weather, decline in raw material costs, weak sell-out, and an increased level of imports mainly in the Eastern countries drove increased competition in the quarter. Separately, price mix was negatively impacted by raw material index agreements with OE customers.","Earlier this year, it finally began to snow across much of Europe and while we don\u2019t anticipate dealers will replenish snow tire inventories during the first quarter, such seasonal weather may benefit sell-out and improve inventory levels heading into our normal sell-in season during the third quarter of 2015.","In commercial truck, we saw the industry stabilize in the fourth quarter after a weak third quarter. Our new products such as the KMAX and Fuel Max. coupled with our service proposition, have enabled us to win new fleet business and gain share in our premium brands.","In Latin America, our volume increased about 8%. We continue to see strong growth in consumer replacement, which more than offset the continued weakness in the Brazilian OE market. Segment operating income was $20 million for the quarter, $32 million less than the prior year.","The decrease in the Latin American results was largely influenced by three items. First, $28 million in higher conversion costs due to inflation and lower production volumes. Second, $14 million from increased reserves for a value added tax claim. This item is listed on the fourth quarter adjusted EPS block on slide 26. And third, $11 million in foreign currency translation. Partially offsetting these three items were the benefits of $15 million from price mix versus raw material cost, and $11 million from higher sales volumes during the quarter.","On the strength of our new product introductions this year in Brazil and improvements in our distribution network, we are gaining share on increased volumes in the consumer replacement business. Given the weaker real, imports are now significantly more expensive locally. This may facilitate additional opportunities to grow in Brazil in 2015 even if the OE environment remains challenging.","In Asia-Pacific, our fourth quarter volume of $6 million units was 7% higher than a year-ago, given our strong double-digit growth in China. Our Asia-Pacific business reported segment operating income of $80 million for the fourth quarter, representing a 19% increase over the prior year.","The impact of higher volumes and strong cost savings performance, net of general inflation, was offset partially by unfavorable foreign currency exchange. The SOI margin in the region increased to 15.7%, up significantly from last year\u2019s 12.5%","While we see slower growth for the region in the short-term versus our original expectations, we continue to view China and the rest of the region as a key long-term growth opportunity. We are investing in our teams, our products, and our capabilities to drive that growth.","On slide 13, we have provided our full-year modeling assumptions for 2015. You will notice that many of these items are unchanged from the planning assumptions we outlined on our third quarter call. There are a few notable exceptions, namely, an improving price mix versus raw material picture, offset by incremental headwinds in foreign exchange and a deteriorating environment in Venezuela.","Our expectation for price mix versus raw material costs has improved, largely on the heels of further declines in raw materials and the increased likelihood of a tariff on Chinese tires in the U.S.","For the full-year, we expect raw materials to be down about 10%, helping drive a 2015 price mix versus raw material benefit of about $200 million year-over-year. This benefit includes the expectation that OTR will have a relatively neutral impact for 2015 compared to 2014. For a detailed explanation of our raw material benefit calculation, see appendix slide 21.","The U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen. As Rich noticed, we now see a headwind of approximately $180 million from foreign currency translation in 2015. Given the nature of our business and the size of our operations, we have exposure to several key currencies, notably the euro and the Brazilian real, which are not only a headwind, but a source of uncertainty as well. To assist you in modeling, we have provided a sensitivity analysis for some of our key currencies on slide 22 in the appendix of today\u2019s presentation.","With respect to Venezuela, based on the protracted challenges and significant economic uncertainty, we are assuming our earnings in Venezuela to be zero in 2015. For reference, in 2014, Venezuela\u2019s operating income was $47 million.","For now, our plant continues to operate and we continue to sell tires as we evaluate all options regarding the future direction of our business there. While we don\u2019t anticipate a benefit of any earnings in Venezuela in 2015, we expect to grow our total segment operating income 10% to 15% off of our reported 2014 segment operating income of $1.7 billion.","We expect sales volume growth of 1% to 2% for 2015. However, given the pre-buy in 2014 in North America related to the potential tariff on imported tires and our plans to increase supply of premium tires in the U.S., we anticipate that the majority of our volume growth in North America will occur in the second half of 2015.","That said, we expect the financial impact of the decrease in our tire production volumes during the fourth quarter, primarily in EMEA, to impact Q1 by about $30 million. Overall, we expect unabsorbed overhead to be neutral for the full year versus 2014.","We expect our cost savings initiatives to exceed the impact of general inflation by approximately $160 million with potential upside led by our operational excellence program.","We expect savings from the Amiens, France closure and related exit from the European farm tire business to generate approximately $20 million of incremental saving in the first half of 2015 with most of the benefit occurring in the first quarter.","Taken together with the $55 million benefit we saw in 2014, this would bring the annualized benefit to approximately $75 million consistent with our prior outlook. Additional financial assumptions for 2015 are listed on slide 14.","With the release of our U.S. tax valuation allowance, we estimate our tax rate to be about 30% of our global pretax operating income for 2015. Our cash tax rate for 2015 will remain much lower at about 15% of global pretax operating income as we do not expect to pay cash taxes in the U.S. for about the next five years.","We expect global pension expense of $125 million to $175 million and global pension contributions of $50 million to $75 million all of which will be directed to our international plan. As was the case in 2014, we expect our working capital to be neither a source nor a use of cash in 2015.","We are reducing our planned CapEx spend by about $350 million over the next two years in light of lower than previously expected growth in EMEA and Asia-Pacific. We expect capital expenditures for 2015 to be approximately $1.1 billion and our 2016 CapEx spend to be about $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion.","We will continue to invest where we see strong demand for our products; this include investments in our new manufacturing facility to support the America, which will come online in early 2017.","Our earnings growth targets continue to support our balanced capital allocation plan. With capital expenditures lower by about $350 million over the next two years, we expect to be able to reallocate additional cash to our shareholder return programs, contingent on our performance and our delivering on our financial targets.","We remain committed to a balanced capital allocation plan that provides for capital investments for future earnings growth, achieving an investment grade balance sheet and returning capital to shareholder.","So as we look at 2015, the benefits from lower raw material costs, solid economic trends in North America and continued cost savings performance are expected to be partially offset by a more difficult international environment, including a stronger U.S. dollar globally.","While the landscape has changed since we first communicated our three-year targets back in 2013, our plans continue to target 10% to 15% SOI growth in 2015 and 2016.","Now we will open the line up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Robert Higginbotham with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Robert Higginbotham","Good morning, everyone.","Laura Thompson","Good morning, Robert.","Robert Higginbotham","Hey, first question on how you see global product flows post the tariffs on Chinese product coming here. Do you have any sense of where that product being made in China is going to now after you\u2019ve already seen the big decline in imports in the U.S. in the December data? And if you can kind of walk-through how you\u2019ve embedded or how you\u2019ve contemplated that potential offsets in other markets outside of the U.S. into your price raw mat guidance?","Rich Kramer","So, Robert, I will start and Laura can jump in. I will tell you I think your assumption to start with is a good one that product will flow somewhere if it doesn\u2019t come to the U.S. in this case, so those tires will end up somewhere. And you may recall, we\u2019ve talked about it in the past when we had the 421 action that took place relative to Chinese imports into North America, we kind of had a bit of a perfect storm particularly in Brazil where we had a very strong currency and we saw available tires, if you will, and we saw Chinese imports in Brazil go up dramatically based on their availability and again the strength of the currency. So that phenomena did happen last time.","I would suggest to you at this time, it\u2019s a bit early to tell. I will say - you\u2019ve heard Laura make a comment in her remarks that we are seeing increased flow of Chinese tires and Asian imports into particularly Eastern Europe, so certainly I would suggest there is probably some corollary there. I think as we get into 2015, we will have to see how the product flow moves, but we did see that already in Q4 and I imagine there is some sort of nexus between those.","In terms of - and by the way, we will watch that very closely around the world. But I will tell you, how we build that into our business going forward, that low-end of the market, by and large, is not a market where we have played. Our value proposition, as you\u2019ve heard us talk about, is playing in those targeted markets segments where we can capture the value of the Goodyear brand. Certainly, our North America business has been on the forefront of that, but also that\u2019s true in our Asian businesses, in our Latin America businesses increasingly so, and in Europe as well.","So while those tires will come in at the low-end and clearly by definition they are going to have an impact, remember that\u2019s not the real part of the market that we tend to play in. So that's how I\u2019d have you think about it.","Robert Higginbotham","Thanks. And then a separate topic. You got into another strong year of net cost savings above and beyond inflation and certainly follow-through of what you\u2019ve accomplished in the past. Could you give us a little bit more color in terms of what is embedded in that number for this year, mechanically what you are changing, and then kind of what\u2019s the runway to further savings beyond this year?","Rich Kramer","So we were very pleased, I was very pleased that now multiple years in a row, we\u2019re getting cost savings ahead of inflation. And that\u2019s been really linked back to something that we did. We started, frankly, when I took the job a while back, our operational excellence initiatives in driving efficiency through our business and I would say the result is what you\u2019re seeing and remember that\u2019s a verity of programs through material substitutions to enhanced more effective purchasing, let\u2019s say, through getting our plants to run more efficiently by getting more production out of those factories at the same or lower cost and driving in very specific programs, driving a One Goodyear Way system throughout our manufacturing footprint around the globe, and driving it through transportation and warehousing to make sure that we are getting the right tires to the right customers at the right time.","All those programs, I would say, will continue into 2015 and they will continue beyond that. And I would say we are really just getting stared in terms of driving these programs throughout the world. So you saw in our guidance, I think Laura mentioned we are forecasting about the same net cost out in 2015 as we did in 2014, about $165 million. That said, you can be pretty sure that our internal goals are to deliver more than that, although we certainly know the global economy is driving a few headwinds as well.","Robert Higginbotham","Great. Very helpful. I\u2019ll let someone else. Thanks so much.","Rich Kramer","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Itay Michaeli with Citi. Your line is open.","Itay Michaeli","Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Rich Kramer","Good morning.","Laura Thompson","Good morning, Itay.","Itay Michaeli","So just a question on volume in 2015 and beyond. I think, last month in Detroit, you expressed a little bit of caution on the 1% to 2% target for the year. It sound like you\u2019re sticking to that. Maybe just talk us through kind of how your outlook and confidence level there spans and maybe also relative to what you\u2019re assuming for pricing for the year?","And then secondly to that, I think, in the 2013 plan, the annual volume growth assumption was like 2% to 3%. With some of the changes in the macro environment and the slight cut back in the growth CapEx, should we think about the next two years as more of that 1% to 2% as opposed to 2% to 3%? Just wanted to get your thoughts on that.","Rich Kramer","So, Itay, we have not given any guidance beyond 2015 at this point because we did see obviously some significant headwinds coming in. I wouldn\u2019t say starting in the fourth quarter, but certainly making themselves more visibly present in the fourth quarter as we looked at the global economy.","I would say, as we think about volumes for 2015, maybe just to start with that, and certainly Laura can jump in here as well, I would say that one of the elements driving headwinds in volume in 2015 is our European business. And remember what we have going on there is not only a more difficult economy at this point, but we have sort of the ever-present impact of warm winters.","And as we look at 2015, while we see some growth in the summer markets, what\u2019s going to happen again with now our third consecutive, in essence warm winter in Europe, we have a combination of the channels still being relatively full. And maybe if I go back just to shed a little bit more light on it, we planned for a green winter in 2014, so we didn\u2019t plan on it being very robust. What we got is what we\u2019ve internally sort of referred to as now a yellow winter because we saw sunshine in October and November.","So what happened is we had the channels full and very little sell-outs going on and that\u2019s continuing so far into 2015. We\u2019ve got some warm weather there. But what\u2019s going to happen is those channels are going to remain full. As we look at winter industry in 2015, we see it actually decreasing again.","And on top of the decreasing industry, as dealers now have dealt with three years of green winters, psychologically, they are less inclined, if you will, to go long on winter tires in anticipation of snow. So those two headwinds say that the Europe market - remember the winter tires are about 30% of the market there - will put a headwind on volume. And those are - Europe is a big market for us, so by the numbers that impacts our volume growth.","I would say we look at other markets, particularly Latin America and Asia. You\u2019ve heard us say we had double-digit growth in volume in Latin America, particularly in Brazil and Mexico. And that\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve done that in quite some time. So we are very pleased with the volume and share gains we\u2019ve got there.","Our volumes in Asia, let\u2019s say ex-Australia, are also still growing in a very good pace. And with a more robust economy in North America with miles driven up, with new car sales up, with sort of a more positive consumer sentiment, and with a combination of what is our best product portfolio ever.","And on top of that, the selectivity strategy we had at OE now a couple or three years old, getting on those good fitments, those cars are now going to roll into the replacement dealers to get replaced as well. So we see opportunity in North America as well. So from a volume perspective, roll that up, we\u2019re sort of on that 1% to 2% volume growth in 2015.","Laura Thompson","Exactly.","Itay Michaeli","That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks so much for that detail, Rich. Just a quick follow-up on capital deployment. Nice to see the increase in buybacks, or at least at the shareholder return program. I think in 2014, you were running kind of towards the high-end of that $600 million to $900 million previous range. You\u2019ve raised that high-end to $1.25 billion. Should we assume that you\u2019re going to be looking to accelerate that towards the high-end of that range now, and maybe if you could talk a bit about your preference for dividends versus buybacks?","Laura Thompson","Okay, very good. So, in the presentation, on page 15, we literally took that capital allocation plan that we updated in May of 2014, where our shareholder return bucket was $0.6 to $0.9, right, and right now, through 2014, we have about $650 million approved and around $450 million is our share repurchase program and about $200 million in dividends.","Now as we go forward, right, we\u2019ve shown that we can deliver very strong cash flows and what we\u2019re saying today is based on now our ability to reduce our growth CapEx over the next couple of years that we see the high-end of that shareholder return bucket going to $1.25 billion. Now this is still dependant right, we\u2019re one year into a three-year plan, so it\u2019s still dependant on us making our targets, achieving our numbers and our performance in 2015 and 2016. But that\u2019s really how we see kind of the cash under the capital allocation plan flowing out over the next couple of years.","Itay Michaeli","Great, that\u2019s very helpful, Laura. Thanks so much every one.","Laura Thompson","Okay. Thanks, Itay.","Rich Kramer","Thanks, Itay.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Emmanuel Rosner with CLSA. Your line is open","Emmanuel Rosner","Hi, good morning, everybody.","Rich Kramer","Good morning, Emmanuel.","Emmanuel Rosner","So, first of all, thank you very much for all the modeling detail behind the raw materials and pricing. This is really incredibly helpful in understanding better the dynamics here. I actually wanted to ask you about just a little bit more on that. When I look at your raw materials assumption, it looks like essentially you\u2019re expecting about a 10% decline in overall raw materials costs, but the way it\u2019s modeled, seems to be like about an 18% decline in your commodity costs. And I wanted to ask you where does the 18% essentially come from? Is it assuming that the current spot rates continue? Is there an easy rule of thumb in terms of, okay, if oil price comes down by certain amount, this is where our raw materials bill would sort of end up?","And then on the second part of the equation, so raw materials is about a $600 million tailwind, which sort of implies that you\u2019re planning for the gross pricing to be sort of like down $400 million in 2015. That seems to be the same performance as what you did in 2014 despite a potential help from the Chinese tires, so can you maybe also reconcile how you are thinking about the pricing for 2015?","Laura Thompson","Okay. Well, let me start, I guess, on the raw material piece. And you are right, with page 20, page 21 in the appendix, we really tired to give a lot more transparency about how commodity prices impact our income statement and cash flows as we go. And one of those new items that we made very transparent out there is that about 25% of our raw material costs aren\u2019t affected by commodity prices, right. Those are things like R&D and conversion costs and the profits for the vendor as we go. And that helps to really walk us down to that 10%. Now the 18% is really our view. There is no rule of thumb on that 18%, it\u2019s based on our planning assumptions, on the mix of the products that we will buy and it is based though on current spot rates as we go.","Emmanuel Rosner","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then on the pricing side of the equation, it seems like it\u2019s roughly planning for $400 million headwinds this year. Seems to be about the same performance as what you\u2019ve done in 2014. Any reason why the Chinese tires wouldn\u2019t sort of like help you get a sort of better outcome?","Laura Thompson","Yeah, no, based on the impact of the tariffs we saw in 2009, we did back then see some help as we went on the pricing as it moved up the tiers. Our price mix raws performance when excluding OTR was essentially flat in 2014. So the $200 million for 2015 is a significant improvement over 2014. We know we can keep that $200 million, but I'd say between RMI contracts that we have around the world and the timing of those and our best estimate is that we met $200 million price mix versus raw. So we see the same positives that you see, we see some of the same negatives that are out there. And remember, our strategy is very focused on not necessarily what happens to raw material costs, up and down, it\u2019s about pricing for the value of our brands in the marketplace and the whole kind of overall value proposition that we bring to a customer.","Emmanuel Rosner","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Rod Lache","Good morning, everybody.","Rich Kramer","Good morning, Rod.","Laura Thompson","Good morning, Rod.","Rod Lache","Couple things to clarify. If you thought about that $200 million net raw material benefit regionally, is it basically that you\u2019re thinking that it\u2019s almost entirely North America, as you look out to 2015? And maybe you can clarify that and maybe what your thoughts are for the net of price versus raw materials internationally and how we should be thinking about it first half versus second half for this year?","Rich Kramer","Yeah, Rod, I\u2019ll start and let Laura jump in. We don\u2019t break it out by region. As you know, it\u2019s something that we look at in the aggregate. And I will tell you, clearly, our North America business has an opportunity in that number for increased price mix over raw materials in 2015.","And, Rod, I think you\u2019re right to point out and I think, Laura, said it in her script a bit as well is that the price mix equation versus raw materials in some of the international markets is more challenged by a number of reasons or for a number of reasons, I would say. And one of those certainly is the decrease in raw materials turning up in our raw material indices, or our RMI contracts, with the OEMs and with fleets that, as you know, work up and in this case, they work down as prices go down.","Secondly, as we look around the world, what we see are more competitive pressures in some of the sort of emerging market low-growth countries now, outside the U.S. in particular here, where we see more of the Asian imports that we see coming in like in Eastern Europe that Laura mentioned earlier. And you pair that up with sort of the depreciating for currencies they have as they buy raw materials or dollar-based raw materials that become more expensive, in those competitive markets what you see is a more difficult price mix versus raw materials in those places as well.","And then something, Rod, you are familiar with as well, as we look around the world, we have that lag impact of when those decrease in raw material prices actually come into our cost of goods sold. And clearly we sort of catch up over time, but that has a headwind as we look around the world in those competitive markets, as well.","But, again, I would go back to the fact that over a long period of time we have a very good track record of managing effectively price mix versus raw materials. We did it when raw materials were increasing 25%, 30% a year, and clearly, our intent is to manage that as we look at the environment we are in right now. And as you rightly point out, we have a positive opportunity to take advantage of that in North America as well.","Rod Lache","Is the first half versus the second half, we should be thinking about that as more back-half weighted?","Laura Thompson","Yes, exactly.","Rod Lache","Okay.","Laura Thompson","Exactly. And really it\u2019s just the timing of when those raws that have declined sharply recently hit the P&L.","Rod Lache","And just my last thing is, maybe it\u2019s very difficult to sort of reconcile how market share is trending. There\u2019s a lot of moving parts, but if you look at the market data that is available, obviously, it looks like the market was up in the fourth quarter by about 7% in North America. And if you extract the China imports from that, it looks like it may have actually been up even more than that 7%. How do we kind of square that against the 1% decline, especially considering that within North America you are like 70% HVA. How should we be thinking about your performance here? And it looks like similarly in Europe the performance versus the external market data looks a little bit adverse?","Rich Kramer","Yes, so, Rod, maybe let\u2019s take North America and Europe separately. If we look at North America, I think when you look at 2014 what you have is the market, frankly, being skewed by the tariff actions as we look at the year. As you know, in Q3, we had some 25% increase in Chinese tire volumes coming in ahead of the potential tariffs coming into place. And in Q4, we saw albeit to a lesser degree, the same thing happen in October and November with the decrease coming in December. I think that decrease was almost like 40% as we went. So that tariff impact is still sort of clouding what\u2019s really happening in the market, so to your point of - it\u2019s hard to really see what\u2019s going on.","I would tell you, in that market, we have stayed true to our North America strategy or our company strategy of staying focused on our targeted market segments where we can maximize the value of the Goodyear brand. Even in that tough market, we haven\u2019t changed and said, hey, the markets grow and let\u2019s just go sell more tires for volume, for volumes sake. We haven\u2019t done that and you see that in a record fourth quarter and you see it in a record full-year results. So we are managing it very well.","Now having said that, Rod, to your point, as good as we feel about managing it, we still have more demands for those HVA tires that we are not fulfilling at the moment. So that\u2019s something that we are sort of laser-focused on and what we are doing to get more tires to our customers, we\u2019re getting more out of the existing North America footprint we have from our operational excellence initiatives.","We are investing in our North America factories already, with the CapEx we have to get more HVA tires out of them. We are also leveraging our global footprint and shipping more tires of those HVA tires in as we have some excess capacity around the world. And finally, albeit a long-term solution, we are investing in the Americas factory for both HVA in Latin America and in North America. So, clearly, we still have more work to do on there as we go, but the positive we are selling into a growth environment, we are very, very well positioned to go do that.","And as regard to Europe, you know, Rod, I would say the European situation again was a bit skewed by winter. If we look through the third quarter year-to-date, frankly, I was very pleased with both our volume and share position particularly as we looked at the winter markets. We were ahead in both. We were ahead of the industry in both.","And that sort of gave all the way back in Q4, where because we had sold in early and there wasn\u2019t that much sell-out happening, we saw others actually selling more into the market in the fourth quarter where we didn\u2019t because we already had a shelf space or inventory in those channels, if you will.","So we gave back some of the share gains we had in the first three quarters of the year. On a full-year basis, we were essentially fine. And I think this winter SKU, I think another way to think about it, albeit it\u2019s a pro forma way and I\u2019ll say someday it will happen. I hope I\u2019m hope here to share in it as well. Had we had snow in the fourth quarter, we were extremely well positioned in terms of being on the shelves and having podium-winning product to sell out.","In a green winter - a yellow winter, as we said - I think we had record warm days in October and November. It didn\u2019t happen, and thus we have the situation that you refer to in Europe right now. Yeah, it is complicated and it is skewed by the weather, but frankly, that is the reality of what happened.","Rod Lache","Okay. So timing in Europe and capacity constraints in North America basically is what you\u2019re talking about?","Rich Kramer","Yeah.","Rod Lache","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Rich Kramer","Thanks, Rob.","Laura Thompson","Thanks, Rob.","Operator","And we will take our next question from David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","David Tamberrino","Hey, great.","Rich Kramer","Good morning, David.","David Tamberrino","Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in here towards the end. As I think about the comments you guys have made so far and kind of the reiteration of your 10% to 15% SOI target for 2015, coming off a depressed base in 2014, and then thinking about some of the unusual winter seasonal patterns in Europe, which you just discussed, and the pricing environment in North America, wouldn't it seem that the low-end of that is conservative and that maybe you\u2019re probably going to trend towards the higher end of that 10% to 15%?","Rich Kramer","So, David, I would say - and I\u2019ll let, Laura, jump in as well. But remember, Laura, mentioned two particular headwinds that we have. One is at current spot rates, we estimate about $180 million of FX headwinds. And for modeling purpose we said with the sort of uncertainty that\u2019s going on in Venezuela right now, we basically said, model it as essentially flat - or excuse me, zero for the year, away from about the $50 million that we had there last year. So when you add those headwinds in, I would just say those are extremely significant headwinds that we need to manage driving to our goal of 10% to 15%.","And we\u2019ve got a very good core business, it\u2019s operating well and I think you\u2019re right to point out that some of that positive momentum is being sort of muted by what are two very, very significant headwinds and of course foreign currency is something we\u2019re going to continue to watch. That\u2019s at current spot rates, but we don\u2019t know where those will go. And obviously in Venezuela, we continue to monitor that literally on a daily basis to determine what are our next steps as we move ahead in Venezuela. So there are some headwinds in there that I think we shouldn't lose sight of in terms of working our way through 2015.","David Tamberrino","Okay. I understand that. But can you just kind of tell us what you\u2019re seeing so far in the North American market for impact of pricing from the tariff. Obviously with, as you pointed out, December imports from China down 50%, you would expect to probably see similar numbers in January and into February here now, but have you seen anything in terms of firming prices or really price increases that have started to trickle up from the low end to the mid-tier and up to your premium priced offering so far?","Rich Kramer","David, we don\u2019t comment on any of the pricing, so I\u2019ll certainly refrain from commenting there. What I will say is that whatever the environment, our team\u2019s focus is to go out and capture the value of what we bring to our dealers out there because that\u2019s an enduring benefit that we need over the long term to drive this business, to drive it forward. We go out there and the value proposition we offer to our dealers, it\u2019s about products, it\u2019s about our brand, it\u2019s about our marketing support, it\u2019s about our customer service and it\u2019s about bringing them business and we view that value proposition as what ultimately is going to win in this marketplace.","David Tamberrino","Thank you for that. And just lastly from me, can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the off-road market? I believe you are thinking it's going to be neutral so far. Other more global players one have said that they can see - think there is going to be a continued step-down in inventories, another out this morning as well or last night, thinking that, that inventory direction, at least in mining tires, is coming to an end. What are you seeing in the marketplace?","Laura Thompson","Okay. Our view is probably very similar, right. We still expect that commodity pricing will continue to be depressed in 2015. We are not saying will see any significant impact from OTR kind of on the positive or the negative year-over-year in 2015. We are seeing some of that mine tire inventory still at higher levels than really I think anybody expected by now, but we're really not seeing the draw-down as quickly as maybe as we thought.","So we still anticipate inventories will decrease in 2015 versus 2014 of kind of all tires, especially, and just for us, in this business with our kind of very specific, unique customer mix and some of the demand opportunities we\u2019ve created over the past year or two, again, we still see it as a tough market in 2015, but really just feel comfortable with kind of our outlook and our business, and again, it not been a significant driver of SOI year-over-year either way.","David Tamberrino","Great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","And we will take our final question from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Ryan Brinkman","Hey, thanks for squeezing me in.","Rich Kramer","Sure, Ryan.","Ryan Brinkman","Yeah, thanks. Just to follow-up on the earlier price mix to raws questions, we're really delving into only price mix for a second, and only in North America. Now that we know what the anti-dumping piece is versus when you spoke in Detroit in January and we weren't sure yet, I'm curious to think that the average price of a tire North America, what it does in 2015 relative to 2014. Could industry pricing remain roughly flat despite a big fall off in raw mats that would ordinarily be passed on through to distributors and the consumer?","Rich Kramer","Yeah, Ryan, I think again, the question on where price is going is something we are going to refrain from responding to you, that\u2019s something we don\u2019t talk about.","Laura Thompson","Correct.","Ryan Brinkman","Okay, maybe just separately then, North America margins are already at record high levels, or North America profit, as we enter into 2015, even before a raw mat benefit or a potential price mix benefit. Where do you think these margins could ultimately go? Is there any natural limit that we should be thinking about in our models of what you could possibly generate here?","Rich Kramer","Well, Ryan, we haven\u2019t talked about \u2013 I guess number one, I\u2019m really happy to have a discussion on how high your North American margins could go having had discussions on how low they were many years ago, so I feel good about talking about this.","I think as we look at it, we haven\u2019t thought about the business in terms of how high they can go. You can look around the tire industry globally and look at sort of the competitive landscape and see where margins are and that\u2019s certainly a reasonable thing to do.","I think our focus really is really consistent with what we talk about internally and that\u2019s really creating value, sustainable value over the long-term and understanding the tire industry is a very cyclical industry and that our job is to grow this business, grow it profitability, win with our consumers in the marketplace and really help our partner dealers, our network dealers grow their business.","Some periods those margins are going to go higher and some periods those margins are likely going to be more challenge, but over the long-term, our goal is to drive higher highs and higher lows in our North America business.","Ryan Brinkman","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks for all the color today.","Rich Kramer","Thank you.","Laura Thompson","Thanks, Ryan.","Rich Kramer","Okay. Thanks everyone for joining us today. We appreciate it.","Laura Thompson","Thank you. Bye-bye.","Operator","Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today\u2019s program. You may disconnect at anytime."]}}
