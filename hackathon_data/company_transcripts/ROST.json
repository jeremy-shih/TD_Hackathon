The call will begin with prepared comments by management followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions]. ","Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results including sales and earnings forecasts and other matters that are based on the company's current forecast of aspects of its future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today's press release and the company's fiscal 2016 Form 10-K and fiscal 2017 Form 10-Q's and 8-K's on file with the SEC.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer.","Barbara Rentler ","Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Vice President, Investor Relations.","We'll begin our call today with a review of our fourth quarter and 2017 performance, followed by our outlook for 2018. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.","As noted in today's press release, despite our own difficult multi-year comparison in a very competitive retail climate, sales and earnings were well ahead of our expectations for both the fourth quarter and the full year. We are pleased with these results, which reflect our ongoing success and delivering broad assortments of compelling bargains to today\u2019s value-driven shoppers.","Earnings per share for the 14 weeks ended February 3, 2018 were $1.19, up from $0.77 in the 13 weeks ended January 28, 2017. For the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2018, earnings per share grew to $3.55 compared to $2.83 in the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2017. Both the quarter and fiscal year include a per share benefit of approximately $0.10 from the 53rd week and $0.21 from the recently enacted tax reform legislation. Excluding these items, earnings per share on a 52-week basis for both the quarter and fiscal year period grew 14% over the prior year. ","Net earnings for the 2017 fourth quarter were $451 million, up from $301 million in the prior year. Fiscal 2017 net earnings grew to $1.4 billion compared to $1.1 billion in fiscal 2016.","Total sales for the 14-weeks ended February 3, 2018 grew 16% to $4.1 billion with comparable store sales for the 13 weeks ended January 27, 2018, up 5% on top of a 4% increase in the prior year. ","For the 53-weeks fiscal year ended February 3, 2018, sales increased 10% to $14.1 billion with same store sales for the 52 weeks ended January 27, 2018 up 4% versus a 4% increase in 2016.","For the fourth quarter, sales trends at Ross were fairly broad-based across all major merchandise categories with children\u2019s performing the best. Geographically, Florida was the strongest region. ","Our fourth quarter operating margin of 14.6% was up 95 basis points from last year. This improvement was mainly driven by strong merchandise margin and expense leverage on solid gains in same-store sales as well as the impact of the 53rd week. For the full year, operating margin increased 50 basis points to a record 14.5%. ","dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS customers also continued to respond positively to its merchandise assortment leading another quarter and year of robust gains in both sales and operating profits. ","As we ended 2017, total consolidated inventories were up 9% over the prior year with packaway levels at 49% of the total similar to last year. As planned average in-store inventories were up 1%. ","As noted in today\u2019s release, we plan to make competitive wage and benefit related investments. These include raising our minimum wage to $11 an hour, providing one-time bonuses for eligible hourly in-store associates and improving our paid leave programs.","We believe these actions will allow us to continue to attract and retain a talented and growing workforce of over 82,000 associates who have been critical to our past performance and will be key to our future success. Further, our board recently approved and increased in our store repurchase authorization for 2018 to $1.75 billion, up from the previous $875 million. The board also approved a higher quarterly cash dividend of $0.225 per share, up 41% over the prior year. The increases of our shareholder payout for 2018 reflects the current strength of our balance sheet and our ongoing ability to generate significant amounts of cash after funding growth and other capital needs of the business. We have repurchased stocks as planned every year since 1993 and raised our cash dividend annually since its inception in 1994. This consistent record also reflects our continuing commitment to enhancing stockholder value and returns. ","Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our 2017 results and details on our fiscal 2018 full year and first quarter guidance. ","Michael Hartshorn","Thank you, Barbara. Let's start with our fourth quarter results. Our 5% comparable store sales gain was driven by a combination of higher traffic and an increase in the size of the average basket. As Barbara mentioned, fourth quarter operating margin increased 95 basis points to 14.6% which includes a 70 basis points from the 53rd week. Cost-of-good sold improved 50 basis points in the quarter driven by 40 basis points of higher merchandize margin and occupancy cost that were lower by 45 basis points. These gains were partially offset by 20 basis points increase in volume cost and higher freight expenses of 15 basis points. ","Selling, general and administrative expenses during the quarter were lower by 45 basis points due mainly to leverage from both the 5% same store sales gain and the impact of the 53rd week. ","For the fiscal year, operating margin increased 50 basis points to a record 14.5%, which includes an approximate benefit of 20 basis points from the 53rd week. As Barbara mentioned earlier, fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 earnings per share results are inclusive of an approximate $0.10 benefit from the 53rd week and $0.21 related to the recently enacted Federal Tax Reform Legislation. The tax savings amount is comprised of onetime earnings per share benefit of $0.14 from a revaluation of deferred taxes and $0.07 from a lower fourth quarter tax rate.","During the quarter, we've repurchased 3 million of common stock for a total purchase price of $226 million. For the full year, we repurchased 13.5 million for an aggregate price of $875 million. ","Let's turn now to our outlook for 2018. Our guidance reflects the positive impact from recent tax legislation and the aforementioned competitive wage and benefit related investments. For the 52 weeks ending February 2, 2019 we are forecasting earnings per share to be $3.86 to $4.03 up from $3.55 for the 53 weeks ending February 3, 2018. ","The operating statement assumptions for fiscal 2018, include the following. Total sales are projected to grow 3% to 4% for the 52 weeks ending February 2, 2019 compared to the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2018. This year-over-year increase in total revenue is being affected by the 53 week, which added approximately $219 million to sales in the 2017 fourth quarter and fiscal year. ","Comparable store sales are expected to increase 1% to 2% on top of 4% gains in each of the past three years. We plan to add about 100 new stores this year, consisting of 75 Ross and 25 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. As usual these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores. ","Safer sales are in line with our guidance of up 1% to 2%, and we projected operating margin for 2018, would be in the range of 13.3% to 13.5% compared to 14.5% in 2017, which again benefited by 20 basis points from the 53rd week. The forecasted decline reflects our plans for relatively flat merchandise gross margin, and the impact of the previously mentioned competitive wage and benefit investments. ","Net interest expense is estimated to be about $600,000, our tax rate is projected to decrease to approximately 24% to 25% due to tax reform legislation, we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about $374 million. Capital expenditures in 2018, are projected to be approximately $475 million and depreciation and amortization expense inclusive of stock-based amortization is forecast to be about $430 million. ","Let\u2019s move now to our first quarter guidance. For the 13 weeks ending May 5, 2018, we are projecting same-store sales to be up 1% to 2%. Earnings per share for the period are forecast to be $1.03 to $1.07 compared to $0.82 in the first quarter of last year. ","Other assumptions that support our first quarter guidance includes the following. Total sales are projected to increase 6% to 7%, we expect to open 23 new Ross and 6 dd's DISCOUNT locations during the quarter. First quarter operating margin is projected to be 14.6% to 14.8% versus last year's 15.2%. In addition, net interest expense for the quarter is estimated to be about $600,000. Our tax rate is expected to decrease to be approximately 23% to 24% again due to tax reform legislation. ","And finally, weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be around $378 million. ","Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments. ","Barbara Rentler","Thank you, Michael. Again, we are pleased with our better than expected sales and earnings gains for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year. As previously mentioned, these strong results were drive by our ongoing ability to deliver the best bargains possible to today\u2019s value focus topic. ","As we enter 2018, we continue to face tough multiyear comparisons and serious competition from both online and brick and mortar retailers. As a result, we continue to take a prudent approach to forecasting our business but we certainly hope to do better.","Longer term, we remain very confident in the strength of our business model. Our performance over the past several years demonstrates our proven ability to achieve ongoing profitable market share gains by consistently offering the exceptional values our customers have come to expect. This remains our top priority, as is now, it will always be the key to our success. ","Looking out over the next several years, we continue to believe that with the proper execution of our strategy we can achieve average annual earnings per share gains in the low double-digit percentage range. ","At this point, we\u2019d like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Daniel Hofkin with William Blair.","Daniel Hofkin","Good afternoon. Just a couple of quick questions. I guess first, Barbara put your comment about competition, obviously intense. Are you seeing any evidence of that becoming more intense in recent quarters either in brick and mortar or online or is it just sort of a steady trend there as you don\u2019t expect it to abate? ","And then just a question on your longer-term store targets, I think it\u2019s been a few years since you\u2019ve kind of updated comments on those. I was wondering kind of how you are thinking about that at this point? Thanks.","Barbara Rentler","Sure, Daniel. You have a couple of questions here. On the competition being intense, I think competition has been intense for a few years. I think competition will remain intense. I think as we go forward, online, department stores assuming better, I think whether it\u2019s highly promotional, remains to be seen but yes, I think it will be intense. ","Michael O'Sullivan","And Daniel it\u2019s Mike O\u2019Sullivan. On your -- the second part of your question about our store potential, we believe we have potential for about 2,500 stores between Ross and dd, up to 2,000 Ross, 500 dd\u2019s. Right now, we are at about 1,600 stores. In each year we open up approximately 19 net new stores. So, if you just do the math on that -- this isn\u2019t how we would actually open, but if you do the math on that, you have about 10 years' worth of growth. So, at this point, no plans to make any changes to that store potential number.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities.","Andrew Roberge","This is Andrew Roberge on for Bob Drbul. I think you guys mentioned that Florida was one of the top performing states. Could you quantify if any of that was a rebound from the hurricanes in the prior quarter? ","And then I guess our second question, any color around the performance by category, whether that be cold weather or any additional color on that would be great? Thanks.","Michael O'Sullivan","Sure, on regional performance as we mentioned in the commentary, Florida was the strongest region and some of that was a benefit somewhat from the bounce back from the hurricane. I would say outside of Florida, similar to the merchandise performance as we mentioned in our commentary, was fairly broad-based. Of the major markets, California was a slightly below the chain average. Texas had a strong quarter with comps above the chain average. And then I\u2019d mentioned the Midwest which continued to perform well for us on top of many years of being the highest comping region. Merchandise performance, we called out children's apparel and non-apparel had some had some of the comps that we reported. ","Barbara Rentler","But specifically, as it pertains to cold weather, based on the weather, cold weather assortments performed well. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Marni Shapiro with Retail Tracker. ","Q \u2013 Marni Shapiro","Congrats, so it was a fantastic quarter. Can you talk a little bit, Barbara I just had one question for you and then one real estate question? Are there any segments that you're missing in your stores or that are underdeveloped in the stores? And then, can you talk a little bit about real estate because you've been pretty consistent with the store openings, but have you changed the size or the process to where you're opening the stores over the last year or so? ","Barbara Rentler","Marni, in terms of merchandise segments, I don't really think there are whole segments I think we're missing. We're always looking to enhance the treasure hunting to add different products and classifications to the assortments. And so, you know, underdeveloped businesses often start as, couple of things you try and then go out into different businesses. But again, overall don't feel like anything particularly is missing and you know, continue to try new, new areas to grow. ","Michael O'Sullivan","And then Marni, on your real estate question. As you know, over the last several years we've opened up at a fairly steady pace about 90 new stores a year, in 2018, it'll be closer to a 100, which is more of a factor of timing and opportunity in terms of finding additional locations.","In terms of anything that's changing, I would say for some time now we've been fairly flexible in terms of new store openings in terms of size and also in terms of the type of location that we're moving into. And that\u2019s partly been driven by the fact as other retailers has gone out of business, that's creating some opportunities for us to move into existing buildings and that's basically triggered the need to be more flexible. But other than that, flexibility no other additional changes, that I will call out. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. ","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you, good afternoon. My first question is on the higher basket that you mentioned, have you seen any progress on you are flattening out and there\u2019s been a headwind for a while. ","Michael O'Sullivan","Sure Lorraine. As we mentioned in the remarks, the higher comp is driven by higher traffic and increasing the basket. The basket was driven by higher units per transaction and AUR was very similar to the trend throughout the year. It was down slightly. And that decrease was really a function of most of the business. ","Lorraine Hutchinson","Okay. And then just following up on the $11 wage increase, are you seeing tightness in laboring your markets right now? I guess maybe just a little bit of the why behind the decision to go to $11. ","Michael Hartshorn","So, the direct answer to your question Lorraine, is no, we are not seeing tightness across the board. They're always individual markets where there's tight labor market and where we have to respond, but across the board we're pretty happy with the candidate pool that we're seeing for new hires and with our retention level of existing associates. ","So, with that answer, let me give you a couple of reasons for why we're raising the minimum entry wage rate, why we're paying the one-time bonuses and improving the benefits programs. Firstly, although we\u2019re currently happy with the hiring pipeline and our ability to retain associates, we recognize the labor market is pretty dynamic and competitive. And there is no doubt with the strengthening economy as well as the effective tax reform that those things are going to continue to push up wage rates, and it\u2019s important for us to keep pace with those changes. ","Secondly, we have been pretty successful over a long period of time and with that success our associates have been able to sort of benefit from competitive wages and benefits as well as career enhancement opportunities overtime. We think with that continuous success and with tax rate changes now is a good time to sort of further recognize and reward our associates who helped have carved that success. ","So, I guess the bottom line to answer your question is we\u2019re happy with our ability to hire and retain associates today but we want to keep it that way, and that\u2019s why we are making the changes that we are making.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. ","Ike Boruchow","Hi, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. So, I will piggyback on the wage question. I guess Michael could you may be help us out, what percentage of the store associates you have are already at $11 an hour wage versus the increase that you\u2019re going to give to everyone else? And then I was wondering if maybe you could just help us with may be the EPS or the margin impact that\u2019s embedded in your guidance for the year from the higher wage?","Michael O'Sullivan","Sure. We wouldn\u2019t say specifically for competitive reasons, both on the question of how many of the associates are already at the minimum wage. I would call out the California is already at $11 so that\u2019s 20%, 25% of our store base. ","As far as guidance for the year, we didn\u2019t provide a specific wage and benefit impact. But just to reiterate, we are showing EBIT down a 105 to 125 basis points, and that includes 20 basis points from the 53rd week comparison. We would also expect de-leverage on a one to two comp. And so, beyond those factors, our guidance includes the impact from these competitive wage and benefit investments and I\u2019d also call out we expect freight cost to be a headwind this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kimberly Greenberge with Morgan Stanley. ","Kimberly Greenberge","Mike, could you tell us when the $11 per hour wage will be worked in to the system so that we know if it\u2019s fully impacting Q1 or perhaps not until Q2? ","And then secondarily, I am wonder if you can just talk about the freight and\/or trucking headwinds that you are seeing? I think you have been experiencing some freight headwinds now for the last few years that have generally been modest sort of in this range. Are you seeing any acceleration in those pressures and how are you looking to manage that expense? Thanks so much.","Michael O'Sullivan","Sure, Kimberly. On the timing, the wage and benefit investments will be having a larger impact past the first quarter. That said, the first quarter does have things like California that\u2019s already at the $11. ","In terms of freight costs, the increase in freight costs that we have seen is driven by higher market rates, which is a function of tight capacity. That appears to us to be a combination of an improving economy, regulatory impacts and driver shortages. In addition, at least in Q4, diesel prices were at three years high. Our expectation is we would continue to see, I would say similar pressure to what we saw in 2017 and we built that into our guidance.","Kimberly Greenberge","Actually Michael, can you remind us for 2017 was that a 15-basis point headwind on the full year as well for the fourth quarter? ","Michael O'Sullivan","So, for 2017, the impact due to freight costs was for the fourth quarter it was 15 basis points and the full year it was 25 basis points. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Adrienne Yih with Wolfe Research. ","Adrienne Yih","Good afternoon. Let me add my congratulations on a great holiday. My question is on the ability to pass through some of these costs increases, be they freight or some of this wage, wage increases. As the frontline distribution channel sort of cleans up their inventory and attempts to get a little bit more pricing discipline as they kind of move up their price points. Does that give you some ability to pass through some of these expense increases through your AUR? Thank you very much. ","Barbara Rentler","Really what we look at as is supposed to be AUR on pricing is our business is built of a great branded value bargain. So, we're in a business price differential business with department stores and specialty stores. So, our focus is on two things, is on having that meaningful price differential and offering the right values that our customer comes to expect. So, I don't think its a straight pass through on to the customer because customers absolutely want certain types of value. So, I don't think it's passed through the customer now. ","Michael O'Sullivan","And just adding to what Barbara jus said. AUR is not where we would look to, to try and offset some of these expenses. You know, if you look at our patent over the last few years, the wage inflation piece is not new, going back over the last three, four years now, we've been steadily taking out wages and despite taking out wages, we've been able to at the same time, actually improve our operating margin. ","And that's been driven by two things. Number one, a very strong internal focus on managing expenses. And number two, our sales comp has been very strong and that helps us to leverage some of these expenses. So, I think if you look on a go forward basis, what we\u2019re going to try and do is make sure that both of those two factors are still important, number one, managing down the costs and number two, the sales growth. ","That the final point I'd make about some of these costs increases is that, they are being driven largely by a stronger economy and that should be positive to retail. To the extent our customer ends up having more money in their pocket and should help the top line, which goes back to that point about using sales to leverage expenses. ","Operator","Your next question comes from c. ","Simeon Siegel","Sorry if I missed it, but what are your expectations for the Q1 gross margins? And then Barbara, has there been any change in the concentration of your top vendors versus prior years and would you expect anything to change going forward? Thanks. ","Michael O'Sullivan","Simeon, we didn't provide the first quarter, only for the full year. ","Barbara Rentler","And in terms of our mix of top vendors, I mean obviously we do business with over 8,000 resources and we wouldn\u2019t comment on the specifics of our mix of vendor but no one vendor represents more than 3% of our sales, so.","Simeon Siegel","And I guess more just talking about not the specific vendors but how the concentration of top vendors, does that change?","Michael O'Sullivan","No.","Barbara Rentler","No.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew Boss","Thanks. I just have a larger picture question. As we think about the closeout availability, I guess do you see expansion of e-commerce as creating incremental opportunity and may be just the best way to think about it? ","And then secondly on the department stores. If they were to maintain a leaner inventory positioning and promotions were paired back overtime, how do you think this impacts your business as well with just e-commerce and department stores, any impact, positive or negative as we think about off price in your business?","Barbara Rentler","Sure. First of all, there\u2019s been plenty of availability in the marketplace. So, we haven\u2019t seen any supply issues. In terms of goods coming from e-commerce or coming from department stores, it's hard to differentiate where the availability is coming from. In terms of department stores, if they keep their inventories aligned and they promote less, they will be promoting less because their business is better. And if their business is better but usually go hand in hand with that, is that merchants -- the vendor community has more confidence to go out and produce more goods. So typically, that\u2019s where supply would come from. So, if their business gets better, the supply should be better for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citi.","Paul Lejuez","Hey, guys. Can you give any color on your store openings this year, may be by region, talk about California, Florida and Texas? What percent those states makeup of the openings this year and how you think about that, Ross versus dd\u2019s? ","And then just second, which was about CapEx. Can you talk about the breakdown of CapEx spend this year versus last year, what that looks like? Thanks.","Michael O'Sullivan","Sure, Paul. I will start with the capital question. So about 30% -- of the 475 million, about 30% is new stores, 30% is for I will call it maintenance capital and store refreshes, 15% for supply chain related investments, and then 25% is technology and other G&A. The technology is focused on refreshing some of our enterprise systems and also information security.","And then in terms of store rollout, we typically don\u2019t provide by state level details, I would say that we\u2019re focused again on about a third in the new markets and then a third -- you saw -- quarter is dd\u2019s store openings and the rest is in our existing markets. ","Paul Lejuez","And then how are you guys thinking about next time we\u2019ll see you guys entering new market for Ross?","Michael O'Sullivan","Well we at the moment -- well for last five years our major new region, if you like, has been the rest. So, for us that\u2019s really focus on sort of new market openings. If I -- just to question flatly to when we thought opening outside of the Midwest is going to be a couple of years. So, for the next -- certainly for the next few years, new markets for us are going to be Midwest. The other point I would make is out of the 90 net new stores being sort of 100 growth, only about a quarter of those are in new region. The other three quarters are in existing markets we\u2019re already in. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Jamie Merriman, with Bernstein. ","Jamie Merriman","Thanks very much. Good afternoon. You have alluded a couple of times about the wage increase, maybe more broadly and impact that you're seeing on the economy. Do you think you're seeing any evidence of what's happening more broadly in the market in terms of wage increase starting to benefit the business yet, or is your expectation that that's still to come? Thanks. ","Michael O'Sullivan","You know, there are so many factors Jamie, that go into the sales line. So many things that can affect our sales our comp, it's hard to isolate one individual factor. For example, to split out the impact of wage rate increases versus reductions in our employment, but these are the factors that may be driving sales. So conceptually it is pretty easy to see whether the customer has more money in their pockets because of wages or because of lower taxes, so that should help us, but I would say it's pretty hard for us to isolate and evaluate the contribution that's making to sales. ","Jamie Merriman","Okay. And just thinking through the comp guidance, it seems like there's still maybe more to play for if you do start to see more of that comes through. Is that the right way to think about it? ","Michael O'Sullivan","Certainly, we always hope that on the comp line, that we will do better, and yeah when we put together our guidance, we try and weigh these factors, the positives and the negatives, on the positive side the growing economies, the lower tax rates, the higher wage rate. But on the negative side, you know, there are some reasons for caution too, whether it's, you know, the strong economy might drive inflation and the cost of living or improved results from some retailers may not be sustainable and may cause a more promotional environment that there are positive and negatives that went into my guidance. ","But certainly, we always hope to do better than our guidance. I think we've demonstrated certainly over the last few years that if the business is there we can chase it. So even if we guide to wanted to and manage the business, as if we're going to go to one to two, we\u2019ll always chase if the business exists and trying to over keep that guidance. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Omar Saad, with Evercore ISI. ","Omar Saad","Thanks. Great quarter. I kind of want to ask you a slightly philosophical question. If we are coming off a period where there is a lot of excess inventory in play and disintermediation from the rise of digital and we are entering a period where brands are a little bit more, a little bit careful, more careful department stores the industry as a whole have been more careful planning inventory and help us think about historically, with the better macroeconomic backdrop, maybe help us think historically how the business model has performed and in those periods where the economy maybe is healthier, consumer demand is healthier, but inventory availability maybe not as robust as it has been the last couple of years. Thanks. ","Michael O'Sullivan","Sure Omar. So, I think if we look back historically at our performance, we've done well as a business when the economy is doing poorly and we've done well in the business when the economy is doing well. And the drivers of our performance do change based upon how the economy is doing. So, when the economy is doing well, typically what happens is the price differentiation between us and department stores and other competitors actually increases. So, we actually offer even better value and that drives business, to the store. ","The other thing that tends to happen in an improving economy is the vendors tend to make more product, so that can also help us to fuel those down, obviously in a negative economy, you end up with the flipside happening. You end up with the market becoming more promotional, which makes life difficult. But you also end up with supply, because obviously some of the sales expectations of the department stores and other retailers aren\u2019t met. So, I kind of feel like if you look at the history, we\u2019ve kind of done well in both types of economy. So, it\u2019s not clear to us in an improving economy that we would face any serious problems. ","Omar Saad","You prefer one to the other or you\u2019re indifferent?","Barbara Rentler","There\u2019s much about that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory.","Dana Telsey","Hi, good afternoon. And congratulations on the results and the outlook. As you think about occupancy costs which it sounds like its improved in this fourth quarter, what are you seeing in terms of new store occupancy costs and how those are faring versus renewal of existing leases? And also, as you think about the online business just from online only entities gaining some share, are you benefiting from the returns, are they showing off them off price in terms of the returns and how does that margin compare to your traditional margin? Thank you.","Michael Hartshorn","Sure Dana, I will start with occupancy cost, I\u2019d answer the question more generally. What we\u2019ve seen is that rents have stabilized and occupancy costs have stabilized both in new rentals and renegotiation of things that are coming up for lease renewal. This year we are actually able to lever occupancy cost at below our historical 4% comp level. Going forward we see occupancy cost at right around the 4% in 2018.","Michael O'Sullivan","And then Dana on your question about online returns, it\u2019s possible that returned merchandise, if it\u2019s high quality and unspoiled, could be finding explain [ph] to your off-price channel. As long as it represents great value, we\u2019d be interested in that product. And that could be, I underline the word could, one of the additional things that\u2019s contributing to the abundant availability that we are seeing. As Barbara mentioned in the earlier answer, it\u2019s hard for us to separate out and identify where a specific product was originally intended for or we see at the end of the day is first quality unspoiled merchandise that\u2019s for sale and I would say it represents a good bargaining and we are interested in it","Operator","Your next question comes from Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company.","Courtney Willson","Hi, this is Courtney Willson on for Oliver today. Thanks for taking our question. I just had a question on marketing in 2018. Are you anticipating any changes to the strategy as you continue to build out your store base, are you are planning any change in the spend versus historical level? And then as you do open new stores, are you anticipating 2018 new store productivity to remain at similar levels to 2017? Thanks.","Michael O'Sullivan","On your marketing question. Our marketing strategy and message over the years has been very consistent. The message is that we offer the best values in apparel and home fashions. I wouldn\u2019t expect that message -- or that message will not change and our marketing programs, the communication will not change. ","That said, we will look for ways and we always do look for ways to make the message more effective whether that\u2019s in terms of a creative or the media strategy. But the underlying message to the customer that we offer great value will be consistent. ","Michael Hartshorn","And then on the new store productivity, give that our focus on new stores are in similar approach over the last couple of years. The new store productivity has been somewhat consistent around 60% to 65% for Ross. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Tunick with RBC. ","Brain Tunick","Great. Thanks, my congrats as well, on the strong year. I guess maybe Barbara for you, can you maybe talk about what categories might have lagged in the company in 2017 and maybe what do you think are the biggest opportunities in 2018. And then on top of that, maybe talk about the home business, do you have any longer-term goals of what you think home could grow as a percentage of the company? ","And then maybe Michael on the traffic side, just curious, any anecdotal, you know, estimates on much competitor bankruptcies or store closings might have aided your traffic gains, this past year? Thanks again. ","Barbara Rentler","Sure Brian. In terms of categories that lagged the company throughout the year, I would say the biggest category that lag was accessories, although as the year went on, in the fourth quarter improved, but in terms of total company clearly assesses was the business that lagged the most. ","Opportunities for 2018, we are feeling its very broad based, both apparel and home. We feel good about our apparel business, you know, it's moving in the right direction, always has more work to do, particularly in ladies, but it is moving in the right direction. ","And in terms of our home business, growing as a percent of a company, home has had good business for a number of years now, we see that continuing to grow. We don't have a particular percent of the company in mind, just that we know it's a growth area and we feel good about it. ","Michael O'Sullivan","Brian, then on impacted store closures. We are seeing a benefit to stores in proximity to the closed stores, but given the number of stores, the list is not meaningful to either our overall comp or traffic statistics. ","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters. ","Barbara Rentler","Thank you for joining us today and your interest in Ross Stores, have a great day. ","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

The call will begin with prepared comments by management, followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] ","Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts and other matters that are based on the company's current forecast of aspects of its future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today's press release and the company's fiscal 2010 Form 10-K, fiscal 2011 Form 10-Qs and fiscal 2011 and 2012 form 8-Ks on file with the SEC. ","Now I'd like to turn the call over to you, Michael Balmuth, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.","Michael Balmuth","Good morning. Joining me on our call today are Norman Ferber, Chairman of the Board; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Bobbi Chaville, Senior Director, Investor Relations. We'll begin with a review of our fourth quarter and 2011 performance, followed by our outlook for 2012. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. ","We are very pleased with our robust sales and earnings in the fourth quarter and fiscal year of 2011, especially considering they were achieved on top of strong multi-year gains. Our healthy revenue growth continues to be driven mainly by our ability to deliver compelling bargains on a wide assortment of exciting name-brand fashions for the family and the home to today's increasingly value-focused consumers. In addition, we continued to operate our business on lower in-store inventories, which benefited profit margin by driving faster turns and lower markdowns. It also enhanced sales by increasing the percentage of fresh merchandise in our stores. ","Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended January 28, 2012 were $0.85, up from $0.69 for the 13 weeks ended January 29, 2011. These results represent a 23% increase on top of 18% and 53% gains in the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009, respectively. Net earnings for the 2011 fourth quarter grew 19% to $192 million. For the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2012, earnings per share were $2.86, up 24% on top of 31% and 52% gains in fiscal 2010 and 2009. Net earnings for fiscal 2011 increased 18% to $657.2 million. ","Fourth quarter sales rose 12% to $2,398,000,000, with comparable store sales up 7% on top of 4% and 10% gains in the fourth quarter of the prior 2 years. For the full year, total sales grew 9% to $8,608,000,000, with same store sales up 5% on top of 5% and 6% increases in 2010 and 2009, respectively. ","Juniors and Shoes were the best-performing merchandise categories for the quarter. For the full year, strongest businesses were Dresses, Shoes and Juniors. ","Geographic trends were broad-based with all regions posting solid same-store sales increases for both the quarter and the year. Florida was the top region for both periods. ","Earnings before interest and taxes for the 2011 fourth quarter grew to 13% of sales, up about 70 basis points on top of 60 and 260 basis point increases in the prior 2 years. For fiscal 2011, operating margin rose to a record 12.4%, up 85 basis points on top of 140 and 250 basis point gains in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our improved profit margins for both the quarter and the full year were driven primarily by a combination of higher merchandise gross margin, lower shortage costs and leverage on operating expenses from the strong gain in same-store sales. John will provide some additional color on these operating margin trends in a few minutes. ","As we ended the fourth quarter, total consolidated inventories were up about 4% compared to the prior year mainly due to higher packaway levels that were about 49% of total inventories, up from 47% at this time last year. In-store inventories were down, on an average, about 7% in 2011 on top of double-digit declines in the prior 3 years. ","Our expansion plans remained on track as we added 49 net new Ross Stores during the quarter. As previously mentioned on our November earnings call, this growth included our initial entry into the Midwest region in October, with the opening of 12 new Ross Dress for Less stores in the greater Chicago area. As planned, we also accelerated new store growth at dd's DISCOUNTS in 2011, adding 21 locations and ending the year with 88 stores in 7 states. This business continued to deliver solid sales in 2011 and had a significant -- and had significant gains in operating profit compared to 2010 when it realized its first year of positive earnings. Similar to Ross, dd's has benefited from our ability to deliver a faster flow of fresh and exciting product to our stores while operating on lower inventory levels. ","Now let's talk about our financial condition. Operating cash flows provided the resources to make capital investments in new store growth and infrastructure, as well as fund our ongoing stock repurchase and dividend programs. In November, we announced a 2-for-1 stock split, and more recently, in January 2012, our Board of Directors raised the quarterly cash dividend 27% to $0.14 per share. This represented the 18th consecutive annual dividend increase since the program was initiated in 1994. Our recent stock split and ongoing stock repurchase and dividend programs reflect our commitment to enhance stockholder returns. They also demonstrate confidence in our continued ability to achieve our growth targets while generating significant amounts of excess cash after self-funding the capital needs of our business. ","Now John will provide further color on our fourth quarter results and details on our first quarter and fiscal year 2012 guidance.","John G. Call","Thank you, Michael. Our 7% comparable store sales gain in the fourth quarter was driven by mid single-digit growth in a number of transactions, combined with a low single-digit increase in the size of the average basket. Again, operating margin grew by about 70 basis points in the quarter to 13%. ","Cost of goods sold improved by 5 basis points, benefiting from a 35 basis point increase in merchandise margin, including 15 basis points of lower shrink expense. Other positive drivers included 35 basis points of lower distribution costs and 30 basis points of leverage on occupancy. These favorable trends were partially offset by 50 basis points in higher buying costs, mainly due to the timing of incentive expenses versus last year and 45 basis points of increased shrink expense primarily from higher rates and fuel costs versus last year. ","Leverage on the strong 7% comparable store sales gain in the quarter drove a 65 basis point reduction in selling, general and administrative costs. Store operating expenses declined by about 40 basis points, while G&A costs were 25 basis points lower. As Michael mentioned, for fiscal 2011, operating margin rose to a record 12.4%, up 85 basis points over the prior year. Total cost of goods sold improved by 35 basis points, mainly due to a 50 basis point gain in merchandise gross margin, which included a 15 basis point benefit from lower shrink and 20 basis points of occupancy leverage. These favorable gains were partially offset by slight increases in freight, distribution and buying expenses of 2010 and 5 basis points, respectively.  Selling, general and administrative costs for the year improved by 50 basis points as the 5% increase in comparable store sales levered both store and G&A expenses. ","Turning to our stock buyback program. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares for a total purchase price of $107 million. For the 2011 fiscal year, we repurchased 11.3 million shares for a total price of $450 million, representing 1\/2 of our 2-year $900 million authorization. We expect to complete, as planned, the remaining $450 million in fiscal year 2012. We opened 70 net new stores in fiscal 2011, ending the year with 1,037 Ross Dress for Less stores in 29 states and, as Michael mentioned, 88 dd's DISCOUNTS in 7 states. ","Now I'll spend a few moments summarizing the underlying assumptions that support our 2012 EPS targets. A more detailed version is available in the written transcript of our January sales release recorded comments in the Investors section of our corporate website. ","Our fiscal year 2012 earnings per share forecast of $3.12 to $3.27 was based on projected sales growth of 7% to 8% for the 53 weeks ending February 2, 2013, compared to the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2012. This top line growth is forecast to be mainly driven by a 6% to 7% increase in the net number of stores and 1% to 2% growth in same store sales. Our forecasted store growth for 2012 includes about 60 new or relocated Ross Dress for Less and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. About 1\/3 of these stores are targeted to open in new markets. These openings do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores. ","Our fiscal 2012 EBIT target is 12.5% to 12.7%, including an approximate 20 basis point benefit from the 53rd week. This suggests that operating margin on a 52-week basis will be relatively flat to 2012 compared to 2011. A modest increase in merchandise gross margin, driven by a mid single-digit decline in selling store inventories throughout the year, is expected to be offset by some slight deleveraging of buying and occupancy costs from the forecasted 1% to 2% gain in same store sales. We also expect somewhat lower selling, general and administrative costs as a percent of sales mainly due to a projected decline in incentive costs compared to last year. Net interest expense is expected to be about $8 million. Our tax rate is planned to be approximately 38%, and we expect an approximate 3% to 4% decline in average diluted shares outstanding to about 223 million. ","Our first quarter guidance that we issued at the beginning of February was for same store sales to be up 1% to 2%. We also projected earnings per share to be in the range of $0.82 to $0.86, up 11% to 16% from $0.74 in the fiscal quarter of 2011. Earlier this month, we reported a much better-than-expected same store sales gain of 9% for February. That was aided by favorable weather throughout most of our markets. And with most of the quarter ahead of us, we reiterated our forecast for same store sales to be up 1% to 2% in both March and April. ","Now I'll turn the call back to Michael for some closing comments.","Michael Balmuth","Thank you, John. Again, we are pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter and fiscal year of 2011. Despite exceedingly tough multi-year comparisons for both periods, we were able to achieve solid growth in sales and earnings. We continue to benefit from an increased focus on value by consumers, combined with the diligent execution of a number of strategies we have implemented throughout the company. Our top priority, of course, is continuing to strengthen our ability to acquire terrific name-brand bargains for our stores. To achieve this, we are making further investments in our merchandise organization. This is the key to both maximizing our access to the best opportunities for products and further expanding our very large vendor base. ","We also believe there is still room for additional reductions in selling store inventories. Today, these levels are almost 40% lower than just 4 years ago, and we are targeting an additional mid single-digit percentage decrease for 2012. Operating with less product in our stores has benefited merchandise margin due to fewer markdowns. Turning our merchandise faster has also enhanced sales by increasing the percentage of fresh merchandise in front of our customers. ","Our planning and allocation systems and processes have been rolled out for 2 full years now. They are helping us do a better job of getting the right merchandise to the right store at the right time. Planning and allocating at a much more detailed level is more important than ever today, especially with less inventory in our stores. ","Our performance has also benefited from our shortage control program, which has resulted today in record low levels of shrink. In addition, we have implemented numerous productivity enhancements and efficiencies throughout the business to drive down costs in our distribution centers, stores organization and back-office functions. All of this gives us the confidence to continue to target, over the longer term, average annual earnings per share growth of 10% to 15%. The formula for achieving this is a combination of unit growth, annual increases in same store sales and reductions in shares from our ongoing stock repurchase programs. ","At this point, we would like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Jeff Stein with Northcoast Research.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","A couple of questions for you. First of all, you had a very sharp jump in capital spending this past year, and I'm wondering if you can just talk about your plans for CapEx for the next couple of years. And then I do have one follow-up question.","John G. Call","So, Jeff, you're right. As far as CapEx is concerned, we did increase that spending in 2011, up from 2010. And our estimates for 2012 are around $450 million, and there's a couple of drivers. One is the types of stores we're building now tend to require more capital because we are taking up a possession of the build-out of those stores as the capital markets have pretty much put a crimp on development of shopping centers. The second piece is in the distribution area, we are beginning to plan the build-out of a couple of new distribution centers in the future years. So that is taking a bit more of CapEx as we get those activities ramped up and going. And also in the fourth quarter of this year, we've purchased corporate headquarters and we purchased another store, so that added to some CapEx as well. So I would expect...","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","Okay. So are you actually taking ownership of the stores?","John G. Call","We don't. On one store, we had a pretty significant opportunity where we actually did buy the store, but that's really the exception to what we do. We only own a couple of the 1,000 or more stores that we operate.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","Got it. And just a question for Mike. Wondering if e-commerce is in your future?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Actually, I'll take that, Jeff. It's Michael O'Sullivan. E-commerce is an area that we've certainly looked at very closely. Our assessment is that currently, it's very hard for an off-price business to make money in e-commerce, especially at the price points that we operate at. But it's something that we're going to continue to look at. And if a model starts to emerge online, where we think that might change and where we think we can make money, it's certainly something we'll take a closer look at. I would say, though, that our priority right now is rather than online is actually our off-line, sort of bricks-and-mortar business where we know the returns are very strong and we have attractive growth opportunities. So that's really the focus for us, off-line rather than online.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez from Nomura Securities.","Tracy Kogan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","It's Tracy Kogan filling in for Paul. Two questions. You guys guided the merch margin in F '12 to be up slightly. Do you expect all of that to come from better inventory management, or are you seeing any benefit on the cost side of things as you're placing your buys? And then the second question is can you tell us what your guidance for F '12 assumes for distribution costs and whether you're assuming that packaway levels stay kind of where they are now or if the packaway is going to flow out the stores?","John G. Call","So I'll address that latter part of that question first, Tracy. Our packaway levels, we have planned kind of in the neighborhood of where we are currently. We don't see that movement up or down. Having said that, as we know from our past, that as bargains become available, we want to take advantage of those bargains, so there tends to be some variation to whatever those plans might be, if they -- those buys are totally opportunistic. As are -- and what was the first part of your question related to merchandise margin, Tracy?","Tracy Kogan","Merchandise margin, and if you're seeing anything on the cost side?","John G. Call","Yes. So from a merchandising margin standpoint, the plan for 2012 really contemplates us managing inventories tighter. We think we can manage inventories down into mid single-digit levels, which should deliver out better markdown performance. So that's what we're anticipating in 2012.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Evren Kopelman from Wells Fargo.","Maren Kasper - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","It's Maren Kasper in for Evren. I was hoping you guys could elaborate a little bit on the new markets and specifically Chicago, if you can talk to what you're seeing in those markets. Are you seeing any discrepancies from the current chain in terms of traffic and conversion?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Okay, I'll try to answer that. It's Michael O'Sullivan again. Yes, it's very early in the new markets. We've only been -- those stores have only been open around 5 months. So in terms of your specific question on any unusual trends around tickets or traffic, nothing to call out, no. There's nothing out of line in terms of what we're seeing in the new markets versus the rest of the chain. What I would say is everything we've seen so far in terms of sales performance, customer research and just customer feedback, sort of reinforces our belief that we're going to be successful in those markets long term.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Patel from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Rick B. Patel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Can you provide us a little bit more detail on the profitability for dd's, perhaps talk about the contribution to operating profit or earnings, and also touch upon the strategy for that segment this year?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Sorry, Rick, you were a bit faint. Could you just repeat that question?","Rick B. Patel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Sorry, sorry about that. Can you give us a little bit more details on dd's? Just talk about the contribution to operating profit or earnings and also touch upon what the strategy is for this year? And as we think out -- as we think about that segment longer term, how many more stores do you think you need in order to really start ramping up the contribution to earnings?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Okay. I'll take the first part of that in terms of performance. Dd's, as Michael mentioned in his remarks, dd's had a very solid sales performance in 2011, beating our internal plans, or perhaps more notably, had a very strong profit performance last year. And that profit performance was driven primarily by margins, which, in turn, were driven by lower inventories and our sort of fresher supply of goods to the store, similar strategy to what we've used at Ross over the last few years. So we've been very happy with dd's performance. I don't expect -- segueing into the next part of your question, I don't expect any major changes to strategy at dd's. We're pretty happy with the strategic direction of that business. We'll make -- obviously, we'll make adjustments and improvements to the assortment or to operations as we identify areas for improvement. But no major changes. We're pretty happy with the direction.","Rick B. Patel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then a question on category performance. It seems like Shoes and Juniors have outperformed for some time now. Can you just talk a little bit more about what you think is driving the strength there? And as you think about 2012, do you see those same categories continuing to outperform? Or do you see other categories that are emerging as the leaders?","Michael Balmuth","Okay. I think there have been very good opportunities in the market, and there's been good market direction in both those businesses. And your last part of that question was do we see those businesses being strong in 2012 also? The answer would be yes.","Rick B. Patel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And do you see other categories also emerging to be just as strong?","Michael Balmuth","I see other categories emerging to be strong. Just as strong, I'm not so sure. They've been very -- these 2 categories have been very, very strong.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Tunick with JPMorgan.","Brian J. Tunick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess first, for Michael, just curious if you think the J.C. Penney customer overlaps with your customer? And could there be an opportunity given their new pricing strategy and maybe some market share for you there? And then maybe if John could talk a little more about the third quarter shrink reserve guidance, just maybe walk us through what's happening here? It's clearly the #1 thing. We get a lot of questions about regarding your guidance for the year.","Michael Balmuth","Okay. In general, we don't comment on other retailers\u2019 business models or strategies. But do we overlap with Penney's customers? I would say we do. I don't have a number off the top of my mind right now. But certainly, any dislocations in supply that any -- that create some uncertainties in this whole supply line usually are a good thing for Ross price. So that's how I look at the Penney situation. It's really kind of a watch-and-see. And virtually, every department store customer or most department store customers, there is some overlap with our pricing.","John G. Call","So as to shortage, Brian, we take our fiscal inventory in the third quarter, and then we'll adjust whatever our accrual rate was during the third quarter. For the first couple of quarters of this year, we expect about a 10 basis point improvement. That's just based on what we will accrue. And then the third quarter, we'll take inventory. For the plan for the year, because we have record low levels of that shortage, we're not anticipating any benefit to be derived out of shortage this year. While over the past several years, we have had very, very good outstanding shortage as a result. So that's not dialed into anything this year because of where we currently are.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan...","John G. Call","Does that make sense? [ph] Whenever we're down 200 or whenever we have like down 100...","Katie Loughnot","Can we get the next question, please?","Operator","Next question, from Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to understand dd's. It reached profitability in 2011. Can you share with us your longer-term vision and what you view as store potential for that concept? And at a -- on a 4-wall basis, I think you had commented previously that dd's was just about in line with Ross Stores or perhaps in line with Ross Stores. If you could just update us on the economics of dd's, that would be terrific. Lastly, 45 basis points of freight expense or I guess it was deleveraged in Q4. Can you just remind us when you start to anniversary those higher freight and fuel costs in your P&L in 2012?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Okay. Kimberly, you're right, dd's actually became profitable in 2010, and its profitability improved further in 2011. So we're very happy with its profit performance in 2011. In terms of our store potential, we believe that this concept can grow to about 500 stores. And in terms of 4-wall profitability, you're right. As we've commented in the past, if you look on a 4-wall basis, and by that, I mean if you take gross margin and subtract all store-related expenses, dd's is comparably profitable to a Ross Store. So that actually gives us encouragement that as dd's build scale over time, this is going to be an attractive business.","John G. Call","So, Kimberly, as to the freight question, a couple of drivers in that increase. Obviously, rate has something to do with that. We're looking at fuel pricing this year, which has to be determined on what costs will be. We have anticipating fuel going up to some extent but we'll have to see where it goes this year. So it's a bit of a headwind for us.","Michael Balmuth","And store potential for dd's, we look at it. It's 500 stores at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Mann from Johnson Rice.","David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","My question is as we're starting to see some signs of the economies improving, when you look back historically, that doesn't necessarily help off-price in terms of your performance or at least relative performance. Can you just talk about your -- after last year and the last couple of years where you've been outperforming the apparel industry what might be different this time as the economy recovers that might not hurt you?","Michael Balmuth","You're right. First off, we believe off-price and specifically our model, off-prices executed well does well in good times and bad times. I think one thing that is -- it's been a while since environment\u2019s become less promotional. Off-price, specifically Ross, we do better when we're in a non-promotional environment or less promotional environment. So I think that would be healthy for our business. And certainly, if I coupled out the dislocation of supply that could be going on now based on changes in strategies, that will help fuel our supply line during this period. And finally, I think our packaway position puts us in a much better position, in a very strong position to do well and if the economy starts to move a little up-tempo. So less commercial environments though in a better economy we think will be good for us. And one other big difference from the last time that we've been in the good economic situation, a lot of retailers have gone away. So I think we find ourselves in a better position just by surviving and being a reasonably profitable retailer in this time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laura Champine from Collins Stewart.","Laura A. Champine - Collins Stewart LLC, Research Division","John, my question is for you. I mean, Ross has done a great job of exceeding its same-store sales guidance on a pretty consistent basis. And it still looks like the outlook is conservative. Can you give us some insight in how you formulate your same store sales outlook?","John G. Call","Sure. When we look at the year, single year and over multiple years, our objective is to grow earnings 10% to 15%. From that, we'll basically go bottoms up. We'll figure out the store growth needed to arrive at that. We'll also figure out the comp level that seems reasonable. Keep in mind that this year, we're up against 3 pretty spectacular years, a 5, a 5 and a 6. And so up against some pretty heavy numbers. In our business, it always -- if we can make the P&L work to achieve that 10% to 15% earnings potential on a pretty reasonable comp, good things happen if we exceed that comp. So we do tend to plan the business with a conservative bias, and we always hope to do better.","Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And John, are you taking into account when you said that comp guidance, what changes are taking place in the competitive environment?","John G. Call","Sure, we take all that into consideration.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Jaffe from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And I just wanted some more color on the new markets. The 20 new stores in new markets, would that be in addition to the Chicago metro region, or is there another region you're going to enter? And if you could also comment on Chicago's contribution as simplistic as you can. I know you're not going to provide earnings by store, but some sense of traffic or volume compared to new stores in existing markets.","Michael B. O'Sullivan","So yes, as Michael commented, about 1\/3 of the new store this year will be in new markets. And Chicago is, by far, the biggest of those new markets. There are a few other smaller markets in the Midwest region that will account for the rest of those 20 new stores. In terms of how the Chicago stores are performing, again, it's too early, 5 months in. I think we're very, very happy with what we've seen, but I wouldn't extrapolate from it at this point. It's just too early. But as a general point, everything we've seen and heard in terms of research we've conducted, customer feedback we've gotten, as well as the early performance continues to reinforce our belief that we're going to be successful in this market.","Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Should we read the continued growth in new markets as a sign of success for the micro-merchandising initiatives that began several years ago?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","To some degree, it's not the only thing that we've done. So I think there are a number of components that sort of made us comfortable expanding into new markets last year and give us encouragement as we continue to expand. I think micro-merchandising is one piece, which really is a way of sort of adapting our assortments at a local level and trending those assortments more rapidly than we would've been able to before. So I think that's a very important tool in new markets. But I think some of the other investments we've made, I think -- the investments we've made in the merchant group over the last 5 years or so, which has benefitted the whole chain, should also benefit new markets in that the quality of the merchandise and the quality of the assortments has gone up. And I think the other aspect is the fact that we are carrying less inventory per store, which means that we're able to react much more quickly to trends that we see in an individual market. So I think there's a package of things that we've done in the last 2 years, which give us encouragement that we can be successful in our -- in the new markets.","Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Chain-wide as well, of course.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marni Shapiro from The Retail Tracker.","Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker","You've been pretty quiet about the home business, and I was just curious if we can get a little bit of an update on the home business at Ross Stores and then how -- if it's also successful at dd's? And do you guys pack-away product in this space at all? I was just curious.","Michael Balmuth","Home business in both concepts, we're very pleased with. It's just not been in the top 2 performance of the company, in both companies. And we are very pleased with where we've -- the progress we've made. We also -- I would say we packaway some products, but nothing in the -- nothing relatively large as we do in non-home businesses. But we use it selectively.","Marni Shapiro","Excellent. Is it a similar business in dd's as it is in Ross?","Michael Balmuth","It's a little different, okay. It's a little less gift-driven, and a little more utilitarian driven.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Pak with Barclays Capital.","Omair Asif - Barclays Capital, Research Division","This is Omair filling in for Stacy. In Q4 thus far, we've seen a much better inventory control from apparel and retailers so far. What are you seeing in terms of inventory availability?","Michael Balmuth","Actually, we're seeing plenty of inventory availability. What the exact reason for that is? I know what I've been reading. I've been reading the same things you have, but there's been plenty of inventory in a fairly broad-based way.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Klinefelter from Piper Jaffray.","Jeffrey P. Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions. One, with respect to the inventory reductions that you've executed in the stores, the significant reductions over last few years. I was just curious if you're now recognizing any opportunities or needs to reconsider store format, store fixturing? Any thoughts for kind of a net reduction in store prototype as you open new stores? And then one other thing, John, you commented on kind of the lack of shopping center development, kind of how that's playing into your cost of real estate. And I was curious if you could elaborate that on a little more? What are you seeing in the commercial development side? And what's happening net-net to your real estate costs?","John G. Call","Yes, I'll take the question on the impact of inventories or less inventories on our stores. So we design our stores with flexible fixtures, and the flexibility enables us to expand and contract in any given category within a store. But as we brought down our inventories, we have a flexible model as well that enables us to open up smaller stores where needed. So based on the demographic information that we use, we'll either open a smaller-sized store to fit that need or a larger store. So we -- the model overall is very flexible, and it's worked well for us.","Michael Balmuth","But in general, we have, not in a dramatic way, we have shrunk our prototype a bit over the last couple years, knowing where we're going with our inventory reduction.","John G. Call","So Jeff, on the second part of your question, when we take ownership and build out a store, the CapEx in that store is probably $1.5 million. If the landlord owns that, our fixturing, et cetera, costs about $0.5 million. That $1 million, you negotiate. Obviously, you negotiate your rents down, so paid back over a period of time. And so as we see the credit markets get reestablished, development get reestablished, we'd want to switch back to more of the -- what we call a turnkey approach where the landlord is owning, but leasehold improvements would be our preference.","Jeffrey P. Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And just a quick follow-up on the store prototype, Michael, is there a target prototype size, average size going forward that would deviate to some percentage from prior trends?","Michael Balmuth","I would say that the prototype size is smaller than what we've opened in the past. But we've always had a flexible model that's enabled us to open buildings that are larger than prototype. But I'd say most of them today tend to be -- tend to trend more towards smaller than our average prototypes. So we're finding our -- the ability to merchandise these better than we have in the past. It provides us with increased availability when we're flexible and we're able to get different sizes. But one of the benefits of having less inventory is we don't need as big a building.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Montagna from Avondale Partners.","Mark K. Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Just kind of following along with the questions we were just talking about. Have you thought about moving the backlog forward to make the store look fuller? Because there's a lot of stores where I've been in where shelves are empty, walls are empty and possibly try to improve the fullness look of the store.","John G. Call","I think we spend a lot of time and resources ensuring that the customer experience is right by location. And some of the examples that you've given, we've moved -- we've added walls to make sure that we have a customer-friendly environment. And as we evolve our fixtures and as we evolve our merchandising standards and skills, it's focused on ensuring that the store looks right and is presented in an appropriate way for our customer.","Mark K. Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Okay, then -- yes?","Michael Balmuth","I would add that our customers seem to be responding favorably to having an environment that is easier to shop, and I understand that in some cases, we're showing a little more wall or a lot more wall and a lot more chrome. And the customers seemed to be all favorably that, that is not a big issue for them if they're finding the right bargains.","Mark K. Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just kind of along those lines, in terms of your in-store inventories. Can you talk about how fast the inventory is turning now versus how fast it was turning before you got on this inventory reduction initiative?","John G. Call","Yes, sure, Mark. We're not public with the exact turn number. Clearly, inventories are down 40%. Sales were up, so it's turning significantly faster.","Mark K. Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, in terms of expense leverage. Can you talk about what comp is needed this year to leverage SG&A expense and what comps would be needed for the buying and occupancy portion of gross margin?","John G. Call","Yes. As we mentioned in the recorded comments, because we planned the year without the incentive, we're picking up some leverage from that. So this year, on the 1 to 2 comp, we're leveraging it a bit. Having said that, in a more comparable year-over-year period, it takes about a 3 comp to leverage the expenses.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adrianne Shapira from Goldman Sachs.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A few questions. Just perhaps talk a little bit about if you can share with us some quarter-to-date comp trends in that the 9% you saw in February, we obviously see continued weather strength. March seems to be lapping an easier comparison. The 1% to 2% comp you've got planned for March, April, maybe if you could give us a little bit more color around that in terms of any updates on quarter-to-date, and also any sense of how you think about the Easter shift?","John G. Call","So on -- Adrianne, our policy is really not to comment on mid-month sales. So we'll be out with that 1st Thursday of April.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, and any help in terms of how to think about Easter? The 1% to 2%, it sounds like no shift in March, April, same?","Michael Balmuth","Well, look, I can say this about it. That I think an earlier Easter is an advantage, okay? And that's as far as I think I can comment.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then question about when we think about -- you're hitting record EBIT levels this year. And obviously, next year, it sounds like we're going to set a new record. How should we think about dd's as that obviously has swung into improving profitability and that becomes less of a drag? How should we think about as that grows and that drag moderates? What potential help that could be to EBIT margins over time?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Adrianne, I'll take that. It's Michael O'Sullivan. As I've mentioned in an earlier -- in response to an earlier question, dd's has a pretty good 4-wall contribution level which tells us that as it scales up, it will become more profitable as a business. So we think the long-term prospects for dd's are pretty good. I mean, I would caution you that right now, although dd's is profitable, it's less than 8% of our stores. So it's really not a material impact on our overall P&L. And it won't be for a few years.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Any sense in terms of the differential, in terms of margin contribution, dd's versus Ross?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","It so hard to answer that because dd's has less than 100 stores. Ross has more than 1,000. And that scale matters a lot. So it's hard to compare the 2. I think suffice it to say, obviously, we're very happy with Ross' EBIT margin. And our long-term models tell us that as dd's scales up, dd's will have an attractive profit margin.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then my next question, you obviously have been capitalizing on whether it's a de-storing and the value focus out there. I'm just wondering, maybe if you could contextualize and shed some light in terms of the opportunities on the vendor relationships, what categories you\u2019re opening up? And without naming names, but how you're seeing the share shuffle that's going on, what that's doing in terms of opening doors to new vendors?","Michael Balmuth","Well, this shuffling -- there's a lot of shuffling going on in the mid-Tier, and I certainly couldn't comment on any vendors, okay? But this kind of shuffling is usually good for us, okay. We're a constant. We're stable. We're focused. We have a large volume buying organization, seeing lots of vendors. So the shuffling you're talking about is usually a very good thing for us.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then perhaps any way to quantify in terms of how many vendors you've got direct relationships last year, how that's improved, year-over-year?","Michael Balmuth","I don't think that's a number I would -- actually, I don't think it's a quantifiable number. You're asking where we've improved relationships. We've improved relationships with a lot of vendors. And I'm sure there are vendors you could call who\u2019d say we're slightly worse than we were last year as a vendor relationship. So I don't think it's quantifiable.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Can you talk little bit about the systems enhancements, the shrinkage reduction that's obviously led to margin improvement? What is next on the docket for systems or shrinkage that we should continue to see margin improvement? How do you think about it? And then also, as you think about the buyers, and we've always heard about adding to the buying team, where are you on the people side and what should be added? Any new categories we should be watching for?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Dana, let me take the first part of your question and split it into 2. I'll address the systems issue, and then separately, we'll talk about shrink. So on systems, we're -- I guess, the way we think about it is there are 3 buckets to sort of systems investment. There is firstly, sort of continually upgrading and improving our systems or improving things like information security and merchandise and operational reporting, a bunch of things like that, that we do on a continual basis. Secondly, there\u2019s systems investments that we make to sort of improve what I would call operational efficiency within our stores or within our IPCs. And then certainly, there's a bucket of what I'd call strategic investments, things like micro-merchandising. And we continue to look for those kind of sort of strategic investments, ways that IT systems investment can help the overall business. And we have some things in the pipeline, nothing on the scale of micro-merchandising at this point, but things that we're looking at. So that's kind of how I'd sum up the systems side of things.","John G. Call","I'll take the shortage question. As we said earlier, we're on our third year of -- third consecutive year of record lows in shortage. With that said, we continue to make targeted strategic investments designed to control our current levels of shortage. But with that, we're hopeful to do better.","Michael Balmuth","On the buying side, in -- from '11, -- in '11, I think we grew our merchant organization slightly over 10%. And I would think we'll probably -- we'll be growing the organization about the same amount in fiscal '12. There are new categories that we are putting into our store, but in this environment, I just wouldn't be comfortable discussing it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Glick with Buckingham Research.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Last year, at this point, we were trying to speculate about the impact of higher input costs and the impact that may have on your business. I wonder if you could share your thoughts as we look out to the potential benefit of lower sourcing costs in the second half and what, if any, impact that could have on your profitability.","Michael Balmuth","Okay. Certainly, what happened last year in import cost and what was not -- was something we all have to get used to and the customer had to get used to a bit. In some cases, they did; in some cases, they didn't. As we move towards fall, there are some reductions going on as cotton prices have come down significantly. And I think the potential benefit for an off-price retailer is as prices come down, I would expect that certain places in the market will invest more in product. If they do that and business is not strong in mainstream, there'll be opportunities for us. And that's how I think -- where I see the potential benefit for us.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your last question comes from the line of Patrick McKeever from MKM Partners.","Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Just another question. I know this was already asked, but maybe I'll ask it in a different way. On the March, April same store sales guidance, the up 1% to 2% in both months just -- I mean, you look back over the years and you typically do see a pretty major difference in your March same store sales and your April same store sales. For like last year, March was down 1%, April was up 10%. That big swing is pretty clear over the years. So I'm just wondering why -- and Easter this year is 2 weeks earlier. And -- so I'm wondering why this year would look different, why we wouldn't see some kind of a fairly significant swing those months?","John G. Call","I think Easter is moving what, a week or 2? I mean, it's 2 weeks. It's probably -- you had some minimal move compared to when it moved in 2010, it was more significant. So from our perspective, it's not going to be that significant kind of inter-month. Having said that, I'll reiterate again, our policy is not to comment on sales mid-month, but we do want to make sure that we are prepared to get through the Easter season, which I think we'll do fine. And Easter, obviously, this year is still in fiscal April, then switching to March, obviously.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn it back to management for any closing remarks.","Michael Balmuth","Well thank you, all, for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores.

[Operator Instructions] Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts and other matters that are based on the company's current forecast of aspects of its future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today's press release and the company's fiscal 2015 Form 10-K and fiscal 2016 Form 10-Q and 8-Ks on file with the SEC.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer.","Barbara Rentler","Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Balmuth, Executive Chairman; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Group's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Vice President, Investor Relations. We'll begin our call today with a review of our second quarter and year-to-date performance, followed by our outlook for the remainder of the year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. As noted in today's press release, both sales and earnings results in the second quarter were ahead of our forecast. Earnings per share for the period were $0.71, up 13% on top of an 11% increase in the prior year. These results include an approximate $0.01 benefit from favorable expense timing that is expected to reverse in the second half.","Net earnings for the second quarter grew to $282 million compared to $259 million for the same period last year. Sales rose 7% to $3,181,000,000, with comparable store sales up 4% on top of a 4% gain in the prior year. Higher merchandise gross margin during the second quarter drove a 50 basis point increase in operating margins to 14.4%. For the first six months of fiscal 2016, earnings per share were $1.44, up 9% on top of a 15% increase in the prior year. Net earnings were $573 million, up from $541 million in last year's first half. Sales year-to-date rose 6% to $6,270,000,000, with comparable store sales up 3% versus a 5% gain in the prior-year period. dd's DISCOUNTS again posted better-than-expected gains in both sales and profits for the quarter as customers continue to respond positively to their merchandise offerings.","During the quarter, California and the Midwest were the strongest regions, while shoes and home were the best-performing merchandise categories at Ross. We also made some progress improving the assortments in our ladies' apparel businesses, where we struggled during the spring season. As we ended the second quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 3% compared to the prior year, with average in-store inventories down 1%. Packaway as a percent of total inventories was 47% compared to 46% at this time last year. Turning to our expansion program. Store growth remains on track as 24 new Ross and 7 dd's DISCOUNTS opened in the second quarter. For the full year, we continued to plan for a total of 70 new Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate a handful of stores.","Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our second quarter results and details on our second half guidance.","Michael Hartshorn","Thank you, Barbara. Let's start with our second quarter results. Our 4% comparable store sales gain was driven by increases in both traffic and the size of the average basket. As mentioned earlier, second quarter operating margin was better-than-expected, increasing 50 basis points from last year to 14.4%. Cost of goods sold improved 60 basis points in the quarter, driven by 45 basis point increase in merchandise margin and distribution and buying costs that were lower by 10 and 5 basis points, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period increased by 10 basis points due mainly to higher wages. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.1 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $176 million. Year-to-date, we have bought back a total of 6.2 million shares for an aggregate price of $352 million. As planned, we expect to buy back a total of $700 million in stock for the year to complete the two-year $1.4 billion stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in February 2015.","Let's turn now to our second half guidance. For the third quarter ending October 29, 2016, same-store sales are forecast to increase 1% to 2% on top of a 3% gain last year, with earnings per share projected to be in the range of $0.52 to $0.55 versus $0.53 in last year's third quarter. For the fourth quarter ending January 28, 2017, we are also planning same-store sales to be up 1% to 2% on top of a 4% gain last year, with earnings per share projected to be $0.73 to $0.76 compared to $0.66 last year. The difference in earnings per share growth between the third and fourth quarters is mainly due to timing of packaway-related costs compared to the prior year. Now I'll provide some additional operating statement assumptions for our third quarter EPS target. Total sales are projected to grow 4% to 5%. We're planning to add 25 new Ross and 9 dd's DISCOUNTS locations during the period.","In addition to the previously mentioned timing of packaway-related costs, if same-store sales perform in line with our guidance for 1% to 2% gain, there would be some deleveraging on occupancy and other expenses. Thus, operating margin is projected to be 11.6% to 11.8% versus 12.1% in the prior year. Net interest expense is estimated to be about $4.5 million. Our tax rate is planned at approximately 36% to 37%. And we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 394 million. As noted in today's press release, based on our results for the first six months and the second half forecast, we are now projecting earnings per share for the full year to increase 7% to 10% to $2.69 to $2.75 on top of a 14% gain in fiscal 2015.","Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments.","Barbara Rentler","Thank you, Michael. To sum up, our sales and earnings growth improved from earlier in the year, with second quarter results that were above our projections. As previously mentioned, we have made some progress improving the assortments in our ladies' apparel businesses where we struggled during the spring season. However, we know we still have more work to do in this very important area. So as we move into the second half and beyond, we will continue to place additional emphasis on further improving our merchandise offerings in this business. We are well positioned with plenty of open-to-buy in order to take advantage of the large availability of products in the marketplace today, not only in ladies' apparel but throughout the store. This flexibility will allow us to offer plenty of appealing fashions and compelling bargains to our customers. That said, we still face an increasingly uncertain macroeconomic, political and retail environment. So while we hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to manage our business conservatively over the balance of the year.","At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question is from David Mann from Johnson Rice.","David Mann","I guess, my question is on the third quarter guidance. Can you talk about the comp guidance you're giving for the third quarter? Why we should expect that to decelerate a little bit from what you saw in the second quarter? And how much is that packaway expense, the differential that you're talking about impacting Q3 versus Q4?","Michael O'Sullivan","So David, on the comp guidance, first of all, I think as Barbara said in her remarks, as we look at the back half, we think we continue to face an increasingly uncertain macroeconomic, political and retail environment. And I would say that the retail environment we're expecting is likely going to be promotional, given relatively poor performance levels that been reported recently and also some store closure announcements that have been made. So weighing all those factors together, it kind of make sense for us to be relatively conservative in our guidance. Yes, we'll do our best and certainly, we have to do better.","Michael Hartshorn","David, on the timing of packaway, as we noted in our comments, the difference between the third and fourth quarter is mainly due to the timing of packaway-related costs. As a reminder, we saw benefits from the timing last year in Q3 and a significant negative impact in Q4. So while we hope to do better, Q3 and Q4 taken together implies a 5% to 10% EPS growth on a 1 to 2 comp versus the 9% increase in the first half of the year at the 3% comp.","Operator","The next question is from Brian Tunick from Royal Bank of Canada.","Brian Tunick","I guess, two questions, just trying to understand, it sounds like a lot of retailers are calling out July being the strongest month of the second quarter, people talking about back-to-school off to a good start. I know you guys had fewer, I think, tax-free days in Florida this year. So just curious, when you gave your third quarter guidance, how you view those inputs? And then if you could talk about the buckets of merchandise margin drivers, what's still are the biggest opportunities ahead of the company? Thanks very much.","Michael Hartshorn","Brian, it's Michael. In terms of trends during the quarter, for us, similar it sounds like the other retailers. July was slightly higher than May and June, and May and June were relatively similar. In terms of margin performance for the quarter, the higher margin - merchandise margin was driven by above planned sales and somewhat better execution. I'd say in the longer term, the best thing that we can do to drive sales is sales productivity - or drive margin is sales productivity.","Brian Tunick","And do you have an outlook on inventory per store decline goals? What do you think is left in the opportunity there?","Michael Hartshorn","Overall, since we started cutting inventory, we have inventories down over 40% in front of the customer. And I think going forward; we'll try to operate the business with slightly lower inventories. But I think we're certainly in the ninth inning of reducing significant inventory in front of the customer.","Operator","The next question is from Oliver Chen from Cowen and Company.","Oliver Chen","Regarding the ladies business, it sounds like you've made some really nice progress here. If you could elaborate on your thoughts on what work is left to do and also how this has interacted with traffic. It feels like it's been on its way to being corrected, but I know that you're thinking that there's more opportunity. And that was very nice to see that momentum in traffic, which has been tough for retailers as a whole. So I'm curious about those two and how they interplay going forward.","Barbara Rentler","So Oliver, I'll talk a little bit about the ladies improvement. We feel like we've improved slightly in Q2. The assortments, I would say, are moving in the right direction. But I would also say that we feel like we have ways to go. We believe that we're addressing the correct issues in the assortment, but it takes time to completely address those merchandise issues. So, although we've made some improvements, we know we still have - we have a little bit of road ahead of us.","Michael O'Sullivan","And Oliver, on -- go ahead, Oliver.","Oliver Chen","Well, on that topic, is weather something we should think and watch about? Because I know weather plays a role on the risk factor in terms of properly assorting. So if there's a way to think about that aspect - that axis of risk going on, it would be interesting to hear your thoughts.","Barbara Rentler","The weather, I would say, what really happened in terms of our assortment issues that we had in Q1. I don't think it's directly related to the weather, I think it's directly related to how we assorted the total assortment. I mean, obviously, we were taking some considerations of news of El Ni\u00f1o into consideration, but the weather itself wasn't the main driver. We just - we really just had execution issues and the assortments got off course. We feel at this point like we've identified issues from the process - of addressing and correcting those issues, but we still feel like we have improvements to make ahead of us.","Operator","Your next question is from Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo.","Ike Boruchow","I guess, maybe, Michael, on the expense front. It seems like you have a little bit more flexibility on the SG&A line than maybe a larger peer right now. I guess, my question is, it sounds like wage inflation should continue to be a headwind into next year, especially given your California exposure. Maybe just simplistically, would you expect next year to have similar amount of headwinds that you're seeing this year or more or less, just kind of curious ballpark, how do you think about that?","Michael Hartshorn","Sure, sure, Ike. Clearly, labor costs will be an expense headwind for us and frankly, the whole retail industry. We entered this year in 2016 and we've taken minimum wages up across the chain and the impact of those adjustments are reflected in our full-year guidance, which is currently a 7% to 10% increase. So we've done a good job organizationally finding efficiencies throughout the business. We will go through our 2017 planning process later this year and like last year, do our best to find efficiencies throughout the business to attempt to mitigate further wage increases. And we'll be providing an update on that when we give guidance early next year.","Ike Boruchow","Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Lindsay Drucker-Mann from Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker-Mann","Thanks. Good afternoon. I was hoping you could comment on whether when you had some of your larger big-box apparel retailers go out of business in a local market, whether that impacts your business and how you feel about occupying some of that space for -- especially if it's on mall. Thanks.","Michael O'Sullivan","So Lindsay, I guess, I would say there is a short-term impact and then more of a medium, long-term impact. The short-term impact is when a retailer goes out of business or when they close stores, that just adds to the promotional environment. And as Barbara mentioned in her earlier remarks, we're kind of assuming that the back half of the year will be fairly promotional and those store closures will add to that. ","In the medium- to long-term though, once those stores have closed, what we've found in the past is that when there's less competition, we have an opportunity to gain share. So longer term, that should be a benefit to that. ","On the third part of your question about, is there opportunity for space, it all depends on a particular store. I mean, as you know, we're a strip mall retailer, and it will depend upon the size of the store that's being closed, is there an opportunity to chop that up, et cetera, and that's something that our real estate group is pretty expert at looking at. So hard to answer that in terms of specific opportunities.","Lindsay Drucker-Mann","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","The next question is from Mike Baker from Deutsche Bank.","Mike Baker","Thanks. So department store inventories came way down this quarter that did a good job clearing a lot of product. I think [indiscernible] on a year-over-year basis as much as they\u2019ve been in about 5 or 6 years. How does that impact your business in the back half of the year? On one hand, does it mean that there might be less excess inventory available? Is that much more important to your vendors now that they're looking for someone to buy some product and what is it due to promotional high atmosphere? Thanks.","Barbara Rentler","Mike, I think that's a few different things. As their inventory comes down and in terms of having less excess inventory, the market is full of excess inventory now. There's a tremendous amount of availability in the market more than there normally would be. So in terms of excess from now through fall, I don't think there will be any inventory issue. In terms of how promotional they get, I mean, I still believe that even with less inventory, there's so many uncertain factors out there, the macroeconomic environment, political environment, even though stores are positioned perhaps with less inventory than they have last year, that doesn't necessarily mean that, that sales will materialize. So it's kind of remains to be seen. So what we're viewing is that the fourth quarter to what Michael O'Sullivan said that the fourth quarter will be highly promotional and then, I guess, that will determine the additional excess supply that could be there beyond what we're seeing in the marketplace today.","Mike Baker","Okay. If I could ask one more. You said that the third -- the second quarter, I think you said benefited from a timing expense that will reverse in the back half. But that's not the packaway that you're referring to. Is it or is there something else?","Michael Hartshorn","No, it is packaway. Packaway ended a little bit higher.","Mike Baker","Okay, that's what you're referring?","Michael Hartshorn","Yes, yes.","Mike Baker","Okay. Got you. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Binetti from UBS.","Michael Binetti","Hey, guys. Good evening. Congrats on a nice quarter. I guess, one of the questions earlier was related to labor for next year. And I guess, we're trying to figure out, for the most part, what the algorithms look like for next year in the space where I know you guys run a very tight box, and you guys have done a nice job on inventory. So you pointed to the 7 to 10 EPS growth this year. Flavor is somewhat similarly incremental next year. Can you help us think about maybe what the fix versus floating is in the rest of SG&A to your point earlier that the best source of leverage from here will be store level productivity?","Michael Hartshorn","Sure, Michael. And when we talk about our long-term model, we've said that low double-digit EPS growth is our long-term model, and that's based on a comp between 3% to 4%. So that's really what the most important driver of achieving that low double-digit growth. The other thing I'd say in terms of SG&A and occupancy, the leverage points for both of those have not changed. Currently, our guidance assumes SG&A for the year is about 3% and occupancy is about 4%.","Michael Binetti","Okay. And then would you mind just clarifying the comment earlier on the comps getting a lift from average basket size? Was that UPT or average unit retail? And what do you think was driving that, a little bit more color, please? Thank you.","Michael Hartshorn","Sure. As we mentioned in the remarks, the 4% comp was driven by both traffic and the size of the average basket and the higher basket was driven mainly from higher units per transaction. So for us, that's always about the merchandise and the assortment we put in front of the customer, and that's what we think is driving it.","Michael Binetti","Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Omar Saad from Evercore ISI.","Warren Cheng","Hi. This is Warren Cheng on line for Omar. I just had a follow-up to Ike's question on the wage inflation. Can you just -- as you kind of look ahead and look at wage inflation for the next year and beyond, is this something that you look to proactively get ahead of based on the competitive environment? Is it more based -- it is more determined by legislation that passed, kind of vary by state? Just trying to get a little bit of a framework for how long this could last and how you think about this, and how you make these decisions?","Michael O'Sullivan","Sure. So Warren, just a little bit of recap in terms of what we've done. Last year, we moved minimum entry wage rate to $9. And as we've mentioned on our previous call this year, we took our minimum hourly rate up to $10 per eligible store associates. But our expectation is that there's going to continue to be wage pressure in the general economy over the next several years. And we also know that in some states, some very important states like California, there's already legislation that's passed or close to being passed that's going to set up multiple years of minimum wage increases. ","So those are things that we're looking at and as part of our budget and longer-term planning process, we'll look for ways to offset some of those minimum wage increases. It will get harder over time. I think we've done a good job so far as Michael Hartshorn said in absorbing those wage rate increases in the last couple of years. But that's probably a limit to how much we can absorb. So that's our expectation over the next few years.","Warren Cheng","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan.","Matthew Boss","Thanks. On your store growth, what's the maturity curve for new stores? Do you see 90 stores roughly as a good number of net adds the next few years? And just what have you seen from your latest Midwest sales?","Michael O'Sullivan","So Matthew, yes, I think that 90 store, give or take a few stores, is a level we've been running at for the last several years now and it's a level we're pretty comfortable with in terms of availability of good sites and our operational capabilities in terms of being able to open stores in a high-quality way. So yes, we feel good about that number. In terms of the new region, the Midwest, we entered the Midwest 4 or 5 years ago now. And I would say, we're very pleased with how it's going. I mean, you all have heard on these calls over the last couple of years, certainly over the last 1.5 years, the Midwest has been one of our top-performing regions. So we're very good about the business we're building there.","Matthew Boss","Great.","Operator","The next question is from Paul Lejuez from Citigroup.","Tracy Kogan","Thanks. It's Tracy filling in for Paul. Two things, I was wondering if you guys could tell us what the comp gap was between your better and your worst-performing regions? And then secondly, what impact did ladies' apparel have on the comp or how much did it drag? Thanks.","Michael Hartshorn","Tracy, it's Michael. I\u2019ll answer that, just telling you some general outline of the regional performance. The strength in comp was relatively broad-based. As we mentioned in our comments, the Midwest and California were our strongest regions. The Midwest as Michael O'Sullivan just said, has been very strong over the last several years. California, for us, likely benefited from more seasonal weather during the quarter, and then of our larger markets, Florida and Texas were in line with the chain. In terms of absolute comp on ladies, that's not something we would disclose on a call like this, but sufficed to say, ladies did underperform the chain, but that is somewhat of an improvement versus Q1.","Tracy Kogan","So it's less of a drag than it was in the first quarter?","Michael Hartshorn","Yes.","Tracy Kogan","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you. Good afternoon. Barbara, when do you think you'll have the ladies' apparel business fixed or aligned with where you'd like it to be? And then could you also talk about where you see the greatest opportunities for the holiday assortment?","Barbara Rentler","Sure. The ladies business, it's a very big business in that -- at our size. It's not the easiest business to turn around. I don't have -- we continually are making progress. I don't have a definitive date of when I think I could say at a certain period of time, we're going to be 100% fixed. It's a work in progress, and so we feel like we're correcting the right things. We think we've identified our issues, but that -- that's a very big business and a very long haul, so I really couldn't give you a definitive time frame. In terms of holiday, we'll have an emphasis on gift-giving the way we did last year. It will be broad-based throughout the entire box with, obviously, the key classification, the home businesses, which are traditionally good gift-giving businesses. But really, we see that throughout the entire box everywhere.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from [indiscernible] Equity Reserach. [Operator Instructions]","Unidentified Analyst","Good afternoon. In this holiday season, being an election year and another fiercely competitive year, are there any significant changes that you expect to make to your media spend or advertising plans?","Michael O'Sullivan","Laura, the short answer is no. Our marketing strategy and message has been fairly consistent over the year. The message is pretty straightforward that we offer the best values in apparel and home fashions. That\u2019s still the strategy. It\u2019s still the message, so no significant changes.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. And then as we look forward into 2017, with everything we know today about changes in department store footprints, with the macro environment and the cost environment, would you see any significant step up or step back in your square footage growth?","Michael O'Sullivan","Not at this point, no, no. We plan, as you appreciate, with the nature of retail real estate, we have a pipeline of stores that we plan to open. So at this point, our 2017 openings have started far along. And as I said in an earlier answer or an answer to an earlier question, we're pretty happy with that 90-or-so level of new store openings.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Roxanne Meyer from MKM Partners.","Roxanne Meyer","Great. Thanks. Let me add my congratulations on a really strong quarter. First, I guess, I'm curious to get a little bit more color in the home category. Wondering what's driving performance there? Is there anything you're doing differently in execution or certain categories that are outperforming?","Barbara Rentler","Well, the home business performance has been broad-based. Obviously, the merchants are out there continually looking for better values and broader assortments. But in grand total home, it's very broad-based.","Roxanne Meyer","Okay, great. And then as it relates to the issues in the women's business, I'm just wondering if there's anything that you're doing differently going forward to both correct the issues and prevent future ones in terms of whether it's change in processes or otherwise and anything you can describe.","Barbara Rentler","What I would say about ladies is, we've done a lot of drill down, a lot of analysis, to understand what issues needs to be corrected and obviously, when you do anything like that and you look within your 4 walls, you're really going in and saying, reviewing everything from processes to total assortments. So I would say no stone left unturned. Really, you're looking at every component of it.","Roxanne Meyer","Okay, great. And then just last, inventory ended cleanly. But I'm wondering within your composition of inventory, if you have any clearance carryover within women's or whether you're able to end the 2Q in a clean inventory position within the women's merchandise.","Michael O'Sullivan","We ended pretty cleanly.","Roxanne Meyer","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot and best of luck in the back half.","Operator","Your final question comes from Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Greenberger ","Great. Thank you so much. Barbara, it sounds like you\u2019ve made progress. You're still -- you still have targeted additional work to do. I guess, I was surprised that the comp trend has reaccelerated so quickly to that 4% level with ladies still being a drag. I'm wondering if there are other categories that sort of filled the gap there. ","And then Michael, just a clarification. Could you remind us the basis point impact in 3Q and 4Q from that packaway shift? And can we just simply use that as a guidepost this year? Or does it depend actually on your packaway balances at the end of 3Q and 4Q and it's maybe somewhat difficult to forecast? Thank you.","Michael Hartshorn","Yes, the guidepost from last year, frankly, is going to change based on the volume this year. I think the best guidepost is to take the difference between EPS growth between Q3 and Q4, and the primary difference there is the timing of packaway.","Barbara Rentler","And Kimberly, in terms of filling the sales gap to get to the 4, as we said in our comments, our home and our shoe business has been very strong.","Kimberly Greenberger","And Barbara, was that an acceleration from the trends that you have seen in the first quarter and\/or the fourth quarter? Or was there a different category maybe that you saw acceleration in?","Barbara Rentler","No, there was an acceleration in that trend in those businesses.","Kimberly Greenberger","In those businesses. Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","I will now turn the call over to Barbara Rentler for closing comments.","Barbara Rentler","Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores.

The call will begin with prepared comments by management followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts and other matters that are based on the company\u2019s current forecast of aspects of its future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today\u2019s press release and the company\u2019s fiscal 2016 Form 10-K and fiscal 2017 Form 10-Q and 8-Ks on file with the SEC.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer.","Barbara Rentler","Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Balmuth, Executive Chairman; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Vice President, Investor Relations. We will begin our call today with a review of our second quarter and year-to-date performance, followed by our outlook for the remainder of the year. Afterwards, we will be happy to respond to any questions you may have.","As noted in today\u2019s press release, we are pleased with the better-than-expected growth we delivered in both sales and earnings in the second quarter, especially given our challenging multiyear comparison in today\u2019s volatile retail climate. Earnings per share for the period were $0.82, up 15% on top of a 13% increase last year. Net earnings for the second quarter grew to $317 million compared to $282 million for the same period last year. Sales rose 8% to $3.432 billion with comparable store sales up 4% on top of a 4% gain in the prior year. Operating margin of 14.9% for the quarter outperformed our projections mainly due to a combination of higher merchandise margins and leverage on our above planned sales.","For the first six months of fiscal 2017, earnings per share were $1.64, up 14% on top of a 9% increase in the prior year. Net earnings were $638 million, up from $573 million in last year\u2019s first half. Sales year-to-date rose 7% to $6.738 billion with comparable store sales up 4% versus a 3% gain in the same period last year. Sales trends during the quarter were broad-based across all major geographic regions and merchandise categories. The Midwest and Southeast were the strongest regions, while shoes, was the best performing merchandise category at Ross. dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS also posted strong better-than-expected gains in both sales and operating profits for the quarter. As we ended the second quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 3% compared to the prior year, with average in-store inventories up slightly. Packaway as a percent of total inventories was 46% compared to 47% at this time last year.","Turning to expansion programs, we opened 21 new Ross and 7 dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS locations in the second quarter. For the 2017 fiscal year, we continue to plan for a total of about 70 new Ross and 20 dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS locations. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate a handful of stores.","Now, Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our second quarter results and details on our second half guidance.","Michael Hartshorn","Thank you, Barbara. Let\u2019s start with our second quarter results. Our 4% comparable store sales gain was driven by increases in both traffic and the size of the average basket. As mentioned earlier second quarter operating margin outperformed our projections increasing 50 basis points to 14.9% compared to 14.4% last year. Cost of goods sold for the second quarter improved 25 basis points driven by better than expected 35 basis point increase in merchandise margin, 20 basis points in lower occupancy costs and distribution expenses that were lower by 10 basis points. These gains were partially offset by a 25 basis point increase in freight costs along with 15 basis points of higher buying costs.","Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period were lower by 25 basis points. This improvement includes a non-recurring benefit of approximately 20 basis points from legal related costs. During the quarter we repurchased 3.6 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $215 million. Year-to-date, we have bought back a total of 6.9 million shares for an aggregate price of $430 million. As planned we expect to buy back a total of $875 million in stock for the year under the 2-year $1.75 billion stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in February of this year.","Let\u2019s turn now to our second half guidance. For the third quarter ending October 28, 2017, same-store sales are forecast to increase 1% to 2% on top of a robust 7% gain last year. With earnings per share projected to be in the range of $0.64 to $0.67 versus $0.62 in last year\u2019s third quarter. For the fourth quarter ending February 3, 2018, we are also planning same-store sales to be up 1% to 2% on top of a solid 4% gain last year with earnings per share projected to be $0.88 to $0.92 compared to $0.77 last year. This includes an approximate benefit of $0.08 due to the 53rd week.","Now I will provide some additional operating statement assumptions for the third quarter EPS target. Total sales are projected to grow 4% to 5%. We are planning to add 30 new Ross and 10 dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS locations during the period. Operating margin is projected to be in the range of 12.4% to 12.6% versus 12.6% in the prior year. Net interest expense is estimated to be about $2.5 million. Our tax rate is planned at approximately 37% to 38% and we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 384 million. As noted in today\u2019s press release based on our results for the first six months as well as our second half forecast, we now are projecting earnings per share for the full year on a 53 week basis to increase 12% to 14% to $3.16 to $3.23 on top of a 13% gain in fiscal 2016.","Now I will turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments.","Barbara Rentler","Thank you, Michael. Once again we are pleased with the better than expected sales and earnings gains we delivered for both the second quarter and the first half of the year. These results were driven by our ongoing ability to offer compelling bargains for today\u2019s value oriented consumer. Looking ahead to the second half, we realize that we face our most challenging prior year comparisons and a volatile retail backdrop. So while we hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to maintain a somewhat cautious outlook for the balance of this year which is reflected in our guidance. Nevertheless over the longer term we are very confident in our ability to offer customers outstanding value throughout our stores. This will always be our top priority as it has proven to be the most crucial driver in consistently delivering solid results in both sales and earnings. At this point, we would like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo.","Ike Boruchow","Hi, good afternoon everyone. Congrats on a really strong quarter. Michael, I want to ask you about the merch margin line, you guided it flat to start the year for the first time in a long time, but it\u2019s come in well above that for the first half of the year. Just kind of curious if you could talk about what\u2019s driven that upside? Any specifics you can give and then how you are thinking about merch margin into the back half [Indiscernible] year?","Michael Hartshorn","Sure, Ike. For the second quarter, as we mentioned merchandise margin was up 35 basis points. It was really driven by a combination of better buying, but also when we are able to exceed our initial sales plan, there is markdown leverage and it helps us move to drive the business with closeout. So, that was beneficial in the second quarter. As we think about the third quarter, our current guidance assumes that merchandise margins are slightly lower, but that\u2019s because we are up against a 50 basis point increase from Q3 of last year.","Ike Boruchow","Got it. Thank you. Congrats.","Operator","Your next question is from Mike Baker from Deutsche Bank.","Mike Baker","Thank you. I want to ask about when you are seeing Hispanic markets, I know you talked about some of your regional trends, but there has been some concern that some Hispanic markets might not be performing as well, anything to call out there in terms of your same-store sales? Thanks.","Michael Hartshorn","Mike, we track and analyze the performance in our stores based upon various different demographic factors and obviously that includes looking at Hispanic markets and the answer is no. We have not seen an issue in those markets.","Mike Baker","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. If I could ask one more, I was curious about the promotional environment, some of the department stores lowered their inventories, their gross margins were lower though, which would speak to being promotional, obviously you guys did well, but I am wondering if you had any comments on the promotional environment from some of your competitors?","Barbara Rentler","Sure. Although the inventory levels were down, the promotional environment continued to be very aggressive. And actually we just consider that, that is the way to do business now, but that\u2019s going to continue as we go forward through back-to-school and through holiday.","Mike Baker","Okay, understood. Thank you for the color.","Operator","Your next question is from Omar Saad from Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad","Great quarter. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about marketing, how you guys are evolving your marketing strategies in this digital era are using new techniques, because the traffic in the comp trends are obviously quite excellent counter to what\u2019s happening out there in the rest of the retail and wondering if you can point to some new media strategies that might be working for you? Thanks.","Michael O'Sullivan","So, Omar, it\u2019s Michael O'Sullivan. I would say that our marketing strategy, marketing message, marketing programs remains fairly consistent. The message in those marketing programs is that we offer great values and it\u2019s really the great values that I think have driven our trend and we will continue to drive our trend rather than the marketing programs. Now, within your question you mentioned sort of new marketing techniques, it is true we are absolutely experimenting and expanding nontraditional forms of marketing. But I would stop short at saying that those are really making a significant contribution to our trend. They are helpful, but they are not really what\u2019s driving our business.","Omar Saad","Thanks for the information. Good luck.","Operator","Your next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you. Good afternoon. Can you provide some information around comp metrics, was traffic positive, what did you see in ticket and anything else that you could share to help us to get a feel for how you drove that plus 4%?","Michael Hartshorn","Sure, Lorraine. As we mentioned in our prepared remarks, the 4% comp was driven by higher traffic and an increase in the size of the average basket. Proportionally, traffic contributed more than the basket. The higher basket was driven by an increase in more units. AUR was down just slightly due to the mix of business.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Paul Lejuez from Citi.","Paul Lejuez","Thanks. The home business, could you just comment on how home performed during the quarter? And also curious what percent of your business is home right now in Ross versus dd\u2019s and where do you see that going over time?","Barbara Rentler","Sure. Home outperformed the company. It continues to be a strong business for us as it is for many people. In terms of our total percent to company\u2026","Michael Hartshorn","Yes, we wouldn\u2019t \u2013 Paul on the breakout between Ross and dd\u2019s we wouldn\u2019t break that out separately. On a total basis, it\u2019s upper 20% of the business is home for us, 25%. [Indiscernible] quarter.","Paul Lejuez","Got it. I am curious have you guys started thinking about store growth for Ross versus dd\u2019s next year? I am just curious how far away are we from maybe seeing the growth start to skew more towards dd\u2019s versus Ross or is that very far off into the future? Thanks.","Michael Hartshorn","Yes, we will comment more at the end of the year on our specific plans for 2018, but I think for planning purposes, you can assume that our store openings will be much pretty much in line with where they have been the last couple of years, 80 to 90 new stores, approximately 20 to 25 of those being dd\u2019s and the rest being Ross. I wouldn\u2019t expect a significant change in that over the next couple of years.","Paul Lejuez","Thanks, guys. Good luck.","Operator","Your next question is from Laura Champine from Roe Equity Research.","Laura Champine","Good afternoon and congratulations on a good number today. You just put up a very strong comp on a 2-year basis and the guidance for next quarter\u2019s comp is perhaps even better, implies that you could do even better an 8% to 9% comp on a 2-year basis. Is your confidence in continuing to grow the comp next quarter, the one we are currently in, is that driven by trends you are seeing today or what else may you be factoring into that assumption?","Michael Hartshorn","Sure, Laura. While we do face our most challenging prior year comparisons in Q3, it\u2019s clear to us that the consumer continues to favor retailers that offer compelling value. And we think that bodes well for us going into the third quarter.","Laura Champine","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Oliver Chen from Cowen & Company.","Oliver Chen","Hi, good afternoon. Great quarter. We had a question related to inventory. It\u2019s been extremely well managed throughout the years. What are your thoughts for what\u2019s next and it feels like your stores could even have more stuff and there is nice opportunities in new categories, so just a question about different priorities of the inventory management and what you can do to potentially even maximize the existing space you have? And then longer term, I was just curious about what\u2019s in your mindset in terms of your corporate strategies and what you are thinking about with digital at large over the next 5 years?","Michael Hartshorn","Oliver, on the inventory question, so we have gone through a period of 7, 8 years of inventory reduction, the total inventory is down over 40% over the last number of years. So, as we look at it going forward, we are comfortable operating at our current levels that those reductions obviously have contributed to significant margin improvements, but we are in the very late innings of those reductions and are comfortable at the current levels.","Michael O'Sullivan","And then on your question about digital, Oliver, if I break it into [Indiscernible] a marketing, over the last 5 to 8 years, we have gone from spending really nothing on sort of nontraditional digital marketing so to speak to a significant chunk of our marketing budget now goes into those media. And we are pretty happy with the results. A lot of that space is still evolving. So, I think we have additional things to learn, but I would be surprised if we didn\u2019t further increase our marketing mix in that direction over time. And separately I don\u2019t think this is what you were getting at, but separately digital sort of e-commerce, we have no plans to pursue \u2013 we haven\u2019t changed our view. We have no plans to pursue e-commerce at this point.","Oliver Chen","Okay. And are your inventories too lean because they are so tight, I am just curious where you will reach a point and where you can do more with more?","Michael O'Sullivan","Obviously, we watch very closely how inventory turns in the stores. And given our ability to continue to drive comp with a 4% comp in this past quarter on top of the 4% last year, we feel pretty good that we are capturing the business that\u2019s out there. Obviously, there is always \u2013 we always look at the mix of businesses and that some businesses are growing more rapidly and we might be more aggressive on inventory but that\u2019s really a business by business thing rather than overall.","Oliver Chen","Thank you. Best regards.","Operator","Your next question is from Michael Binetti from UBS.","Michael Binetti","Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. So just on your comments that the consumer is choosing value is the answer to the focus for third quarter and how we get to the comp with the difficult comparison, maybe you could help us with some of the dimensionality on a couple of things, first off, can I assume that the plan is to deliver a value and that the comp assumes strong traffic and maybe some more AUR pressure than we saw last quarter. And then maybe some help on how to think about gross margin versus SG&A, are you willing to take some more merchandise margin pressure than we see in the recent quarters to help you anniversary that big Tom?","Michael O'Sullivan","Yes. Michael on the comp, if we think about the components between first and second quarter and our current trends in the second quarter, performance was fairly broad based across merchandise divisions and regions. So we feel confident that the consumer is responding to value and we feel good about our inventory entering the third quarter.","Michael Binetti","And then maybe I can ask you just a follow-up on Lorraine\u2019s question earlier, a little bit on the AUR what is driving AUR in your business today, is it a mix function and then same question on what\u2019s \u2013 you have had some nice comments on the units per transaction to what other categories that are helping you guys drive that the consumer to pickup a couple of extra items from the basket?","Michael O'Sullivan","Yes. I mean on AUR, AURs have been relatively flat over the last several years, they are down slightly. Again that\u2019s mix related based on what\u2019s driving the business. I would answer your question on the basket if I go through the merchandising areas. All major merchandising areas were positive during the quarter as well as merchandise region. We did call out shoes during the quarter. Overall non-apparel during the second quarter outperformed apparel. So we feel really good about the trends and I believe we are set up well for a strong back half.","Michael Binetti","Thanks.","Barbara Rentler","Michael I think that the merchants have been able to deliver value to the customers. So in this promotional environment where value moves a lot, one of the critical things is for a merchant to understand the value as they move and to respond appropriately. And so with that comes potentially mix issues based on what\u2019s available, based on what the customer wants. But really understanding that movement of value as you move along and not really recognizing how promotional it is and how it\u2019s going to remain that way, I think it\u2019s a critical part of what the merchants do every day and that\u2019s added to our broad based success in merchandise categories in Q2.","Michael Binetti","I guess my question was more you are seeing that the Bogeyman at seven comp coming for a long time about a year ago, so is it look that the strategy here is value is working and the strategy for longtime has been to buy up for units so we will see the traffic component of the comp is what accelerates in the 2 year to help you guys lap that, is that what we should expect today?","Michael O'Sullivan","A couple of things Michael, our outlook for the back half has not changed from the beginning of the year. So again why we feel really good that\u2019s the way we plan the business. If you looked at our \u2013 the way we guided the back half it hasn\u2019t changed the upside to the year was based on the out-performance in the second quarter. So the $0.06 that we added to be at the high end of the range for the year was all based on second quarter performance.","Michael Binetti","Thanks a lot guys. Congrats a nice quarter.","Operator","Your next question is from Simeon Siegel from Nomura Instinet.","Simeon Siegel","Thanks. Good afternoon and congrats on the strong results. I think you spoke to merch margins, any color you could share on the 3Q and 4Q gross margins embedded within your guides and then could you quantify the concentration of your top vendors within revenues at this time and has that changed at all? Thanks.","Michael Hartshorn","In terms of the specific guidance in Q3 and Q4, the only guidance that we gave was my comment on merch margins and the comparison versus last year, so we wouldn\u2019t get any further detail in that back half margin.","Michael O'Sullivan","And then on the vendor base no real changes to that. As you know we have a very large diverse and fragmented vendor base with lots of vendors. And from time to time different vendors become more or less important, but no single vendor is particularly important in the overall mix.","Simeon Siegel","Okay. Thanks a lot. Best of luck for the rest of the year.","Operator","Your next question is from Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Greenberger","Thank you so much. I wanted to ask the third quarter comp guidance of plus 1% to 2%, is it fair to assume or could we assume that the business is running in that range so far here in the third quarter. And then secondarily it looks like there were a number of going out of business sales during the second quarter particularly among department stores, I know the environment is tough and seems to be just getting tougher every year, but Ross seem to sail right on through that undisrupted, I just wanted to know if there was any disruption at all in stores that were near those store closings or did you really just not see it at all, obviously we are not seeing any impact in the total company comp, but you obviously have more granular insight?","Michael O'Sullivan","Hi Kimberly, we wouldn\u2019t comment on third quarter trends. On the store closures what we are seeing is stores that are located close to the stores during liquidation has a slight negative impact and then post closures slight positive impact. That said the impact to the chain is not material giving on a base of close to 1,600 stores.","Kimberly Greenberger","Thank you, Michael.","Operator","Your next question is from Bob Drbul from Guggenheim.","Bob Drbul","Hi, good afternoon. Two questions, I was wondering if you could comment on how your business performed in California, I think there was a bit of a drag in the first quarter I think largely weather and I was also wondering if you might just comment on the women\u2019s business and how that\u2019s been performing for you? Thank you.","Michael O'Sullivan","On regional performance of all of our major markets California, Texas, Florida were relatively in line with the chain average in the second quarter.","Barbara Rentler","And in terms of related business ladies once again posted positive gain in the quarter.","Bob Drbul","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question is from Dana Telsey from Telsey Group.","Dana Telsey","Good afternoon everyone and congratulations. As you think about wages and shrink any update on those two components in the game plan for the second half of the year. And then on dd\u2019s and that strong performance on sales and operating income what are the key drivers there and has anything changed in that business? Thank you.","Michael O'Sullivan","Sure Dana, on shrink and wage question, no changes are expected in shrink trends. We continue to operate at very low levels, record levels for us. And we typically take our physical inventory in the third quarter. So we will have an update if any change to that trend in Q3. On wages we do expect the wage pressure to abate somewhat in the second half as we are now anniversarying the most recent companywide wage increases that took place in last year\u2019s second quarter. As a reminder, guidance for SG&A the leverage point remains at about 3% for the year.","Michael Hartshorn","And Dana on your question about these dd\u2019s, as Barbara mentioned in her remarks we were pleased with dd\u2019s strong performance in terms of sales and operating profit in the second quarter. dd\u2019s sort of basically continued as it has over the last several quarters its good results. In terms of what\u2019s driving that, frankly it\u2019s similar to many of the other things that we talked about on this call so far, in particular, for dd\u2019s customer is responding well to the values that we are offering.","Dana Telsey","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Lindsay Drucker Mann from Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Good afternoon. I was hoping could you tell us what proportion of your sales come from credit cards? And secondly on the SG&A piece, while the leverage point on a 4% comp, you leveraged operating margins pretty nicely. SG&A growth was slower than what we had seen in 1Q and sorry if I missed this, but can you talk about the rate of SG&A increase in 2Q being lower versus 1Q and what we should be thinking about for the back half?","Michael Hartshorn","Sure. On your question on credit, it\u2019s about a third of our business Lindsay. And then on the SG&A leverage as we mentioned in the call, we had 25 basis points of leverage on a 4% comp, 20 of that 25 was related to a non-recurring legal matter. So, baseline 5 basis points of leverage. As I mentioned on wages in the back half, we should expect less leverage so at a 1% to 2% comp, there maybe some de-leverage, but at 3% we should get leverage.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Okay, got it. Thanks for that. And then can you comment on how your new stores are performing, new store productivity \u2013 productivity of new openings for Ross and dd\u2019s relative to what you have seen in last year or years past?","Michael Hartshorn","Sure. So as we have mentioned it in the past, the new store productivity has come down since we entered the Midwest in 2011. And also, our growth of the dd\u2019s change has impacted overall productivity. I would say though in the last couple of years, it\u2019s been very steady at or above our expectations. Overall, Ross new stores about 60% to 65% on the chain average and then tends to comp faster in the first couple of years.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question is from Brian Tunick from RBC.","Brian Tunick","Thanks and good afternoon. I guess two or three questions. Number one, I know you guys don\u2019t manage to a packaway number per se, but obviously there has been a lot of concern given what the vendors have been talking about. So just curious if you can maybe talk about the buying staff what you have been doing there, maybe turnover in your top, I think Simeon asked 10 vendors, but just curious more about how packaway could continue to run at these levels given what the vendors seem to be saying? Second question would be maybe from a store growth runway and the returns you are seeing on the new stores, at what point would you guys consider a new concept like home, which seems to be something people are moving into? And then thirdly on freight contracts, Mike, just curious what\u2019s the length of the contracts and how is your best viewpoint going into next year? Thanks very much.","Michael Hartshorn","I will start with the last one, because that\u2019s probably the easiest, Brian. On freight, we expect there to be a headwind for the rest the year. Contracts vary, we have pretty good viewpoint for the rest of the year and we expect it to continue to be a headwind and then going into next year we will talk more about that on the year end conference call.","Michael O'Sullivan","I will take the second question and maybe Barbara will take the first and we will work in reverse order. So, on the store growth runway, we have put out there a store potential number of 2,500 stores, so that\u2019s 2,000 Ross, 500 dd\u2019s. We are only at 1,600, so we have got many years to go before we hit that number. You had mentioned home specifically and moving into I guess, the separate home concept, we are very excited about home and our home business has been one of our strongest performing businesses for a number of years, but we feel very happy with our ability to really go after that within our existing concepts and really us sort of continue to grow that business within Ross and dd\u2019s rather than through a separate concept.","Barbara Rentler","And as it pertains to packaway, the packaway number fluctuates based on the availability in the market and the ways the merchants see it. And there have been \u2013 there has been plenty of branded bargains in the marketplace. So, there is availability. I know there is a lot of talk about different vendors having different strategies, strategies fluctuate over time and net-net is that there are lot of goods in the marketplace and a lot of branded goods. And so we feel pretty good about the position that we are in and the conference that we have.","Brian Tunick","Great, thanks very much and good luck.","Operator","The next question is from Mike Baker from Deutsche Bank.","Mike Baker","Hi. Just two quick follow-ups if I missed them I apologize, but I don\u2019t think you talked about this how about trend through the quarter by month, anything to call out there. And then secondly you said your buying costs were up, I am just curious as to what happened there? Thanks.","Michael O'Sullivan","Sure Michael, so trends were steady during the quarter maybe were slightly stronger than June and July, but which were similar. In terms of buying cost, buying costs increased as we mentioned 15 basis points quarter-to-quarter which mainly reflects higher incentive costs given our performance but also ongoing investments that we continue to make in our most important asset or buying organization.","Mike Baker","Okay, that makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Barbara Rentler for closing remarks.","Barbara Rentler","Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores. Have a great day.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

The call will begin with prepared comments by management, followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts and other matters that are based on the company's current forecast of aspects of its future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations.

Joining me on our call today are Norman Ferber, Chairman of the Board; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Michael Hartshorn, Senior Vice President and Deputy Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Wong, Director, Investor Relations.","We will begin with a review of our fourth quarter and 2012 performance followed by our outlook for 2013. Afterward, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.","We are pleased with the record sales and earnings we delivered in the fourth quarter and 2012 fiscal year, especially considering they were achieved on top of strong multiyear gains. Results for both periods benefited from our ongoing ability to deliver compelling bargains on a wide assortment of exciting name-brand fashions for the family and the home to today's value-focused consumers.","Earnings per share for the 14 weeks ended February 2, 2013, grew to $1.07, up from $0.85 for the 13 weeks ended January 28, 2012. For the 53 weeks ended February 2, 2013, earnings per share were $3.53, compared to $2.86 for the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2012. Both the quarter and the fiscal year include a per share benefit of approximately $0.10 from the 53rd week.","Net earnings for the 2012 fourth quarter were $236.6 million, up from $192 million in the prior year, while fiscal 2012 net earnings grew to $786.8 million, compared to $657.2 million in fiscal 2011.","Sales for the 14 weeks ended February 2, 2013, grew 15% to $2,761,000,000, with comparable store sales up 5% on top of a 7% increase in the fourth quarter of 2011. For the 53-week fiscal year ended February 2, 2013, sales increased 13% to $9,721,000,000, with a same-store sales gain of 6%, compared to a 5% rise in 2011.","For the quarter and the full year, Juniors was the best-performing merchandise category, while geographically, the strength was broad-based. Earnings before interest and taxes for the 2012 fourth quarter grew to 13.7% of sales, up from 13.0% in the fourth quarter of 2011.","For fiscal 2012, operating margin rose to a record 13.1%, a gain of 75 basis points on top of an 85-basis-point increase in fiscal 2011. Profit margins for both the quarter and the full year mainly benefited from higher merchandise gross margin, leverage on operating expenses from the strong gains in same-store sales and the impact of the 53rd week. John will provide some additional color on these operating margin trends in a few minutes.","As we ended 2012, total consolidated inventories were up 7% compared to the prior year, while packaway levels were about 47% of total inventories, down from 49% at the end of 2011. On average, in-store inventories were down approximately 5% during 2012.","Our expansion program remained on track during the year, with the net addition of 54 Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS. We continued our growth in new markets, which accounted for about 1\/3 of these new store openings. We are pleased to report that dd's DISCOUNTS also delivered another year of solid gains in sales and operating profitability in 2012. Like Ross, dd's continues to benefit from our ability to offer a wide assortment of terrific bargains while also operating the business on reduced inventory levels.","Now let's turn to our financial condition. Operating cash flows provided the resources to make capital investments in new store growth and infrastructure, as well as fund our ongoing stock repurchase and dividend programs. In January 2013, our Board of Directors approved a new program authorizing up to $1.1 billion to be used to repurchase shares of our common stock over the next 2 years through fiscal 2014. This represents a 22% increase over the prior 2-year $900 million program that was completed in January of 2013. The board also raised our quarterly cash dividend to $0.17 per share, up 21% on top of a 27% increase in the prior year.","The growth of our stock repurchase and dividend programs has been driven by the significant amounts of cash our business generates after self-funding store growth and other capital needs. We have repurchased stock as planned every year since 1993, and this is the 19th consecutive increase in our quarterly cash dividend. This consistent record reflects our unwavering commitment to enhancing stockholder value and returns.","Now John will provide further color on our fourth quarter and fiscal 2012 results and details on our first quarter and fiscal year 2013 guidance.","John G. Call","Thank you, Michael. Our 5% comparable store sales gain in the fourth quarter was driven by low single-digit growth in the number of transactions, combined with a mid-single-digit increase in the size of the average basket.","Operating margin grew by about 70 basis points in the quarter to 13.7%. Cost of goods sold improved by about 55 basis points, benefiting from a 40-basis-point increase in merchandise margin, 35 basis points from leverage of occupancy and 10 and 5 basis points, respectively, from lower freight and shortage accrual. These improvements were partially offset by 25 basis points mainly from the timing of incentive costs and 10 basis points from increased distribution expenses due to timing of packaway-related costs.","Selling, general and administrative costs for the quarter declined about 15 basis points, driven by 25 basis points of leverage on store operating expenses, partially offset by 10 basis points due to the timing of incentive accruals and higher legal costs.","As Michael mentioned, for fiscal 2012, operating margin rose to a record 13.1%, up 75 basis points over the prior year. Total cost of goods sold improved by about 40 basis points, driven by a 40-basis-point gain in merchandise gross margin, 25 basis points of leverage on occupancy and 15 basis points in lower distribution costs. These favorable items were partially offset by 25 basis points in higher buying costs, 10 basis points in increased freight expense and 5 basis points in higher shortage accrual related to the year-over-year third quarter true-up in our shrink reserve.","Selling, general and administrative costs for the full year improved by 35 basis points, primarily due to leverage on store operating expenses from the 6% increase in comparable sales.","Turning to our stock buyback program. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares for a total purchase price of $116 million. For the 2012 fiscal year, we repurchased 7.5 million shares for a total price of $450 million, which, as Michael mentioned, completed the $900 million program authorized in early 2011.","We added 74 net new stores in fiscal 2012, ending the year with 1,091 Ross Dress for Less locations in 33 states and 108 dd's DISCOUNTS in 8 states.","Now I'll spend a few moments summarizing the underlying assumptions that support the 2013 EPS targets we communicated in early February. A more detailed version is available in the written transcript of our January sales release recorded comments on our website.","Our fiscal year 2013 earnings per share forecast of $3.65 to $3.80 was based on comparable store sales that are forecast to increase 1% to 2% on top of a strong 6% gain in 2012; total sales that are projected to grow 4% to 5% for the 52 weeks ending February 1, 2014, compared to the 53 weeks ended January 2, 2013. The year-over-year increase in total revenues is being affected by the 53rd week, which added approximately $149 million in sales in the 2012 fourth quarter and fiscal year.","We are planning to add approximately 60 new Ross and 20 new dd's DISCOUNTS locations, with about 1\/3 of these stores projected to open in the same new markets we entered in 2011 and 2012. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores.","Our fiscal 2013  EBIT target is 12.7% to 12.9%, compared to 13.1% in 2012, which benefited by about 20 basis points from the 53rd week. If same-store sales perform in line with our forecast for a 1% to 2% increase, we would expect some slight deleveraging of expenses while merchandise gross margin is targeted to be relatively flat versus 2012.","Net interest expense is expected to be about $1 million. Our tax rate is planned to be approximately 38%, and we expect average diluted shares outstanding of about 217 million. Capital expenditures in 2013 are forecast to increase to approximately $670 million, up from $424 million in 2012.","In addition to supporting our ongoing investments in new and existing stores, we will be building 2 new distribution centers over the next 2 years. During 2013, we also expect to buy out the lease for 1 of our existing distribution facilities, relocate our corporate headquarters and complete construction of a new data center.","Our first quarter guidance that we issued at the beginning of February was for same-store sales to be up 1% to 2%. We also projected earnings per share to be in the range of $1 to $1.04, compared to $0.93 in the first quarter of 2012.","Earlier this month, we reported a slight decline of 1% in February same-store sales, which we believe was mainly due to the delay in income tax refunds. With sales improving as the month progressed, we reiterated our guidance for first quarter EPS of $1 to $1.04 and same-store sales that were projected to be down 1% to 2% in March and up 5% to 6% in April. This monthly forecast reflects a shift in Easter holiday, is on top of last year's strong same-store sales gains of 10% in March and 7% in April.","Finally, as noted in today's press release, beginning with the second quarter of fiscal 2013, we will no longer report monthly sales. Quarterly comparable store sales will be provided with regularly scheduled earnings releases and conference calls. Reporting sales quarterly aligns us with the majority of other retailers who have already adopted this practice, while also increasing the focus on longer-term performance.","Now I'll turn the call back to Michael for some closing comments.","Michael Balmuth","Thank you, John. Again, we are pleased with our strong 2012 performance. Looking ahead, in order to operate successfully in today's very uncertain macroeconomic and political environment, we will focus on the execution of our proven off-price model that has enabled us to perform well in a variety of business climates. Investing in our merchandise organization is still our #1 priority. Experience showed that this is the key to increasing our access to the best name-brand bargains in the marketplace, while further expanding our very large vendor base.","To enhance sales and maximize gross margin, we will also continue to operate our stores with lower inventories, with selling store levels planned down in the low single-digit range for 2013.","In addition, our ongoing focus on fine-tuning our systems and processes to plan and allocate at a much more detailed level remains more important than ever today. This is especially true as we continue to grow in new markets and operate our stores with less inventory.","We also continue to implement numerous productivity enhancements and efficiencies throughout the business. These initiatives are driving down costs in our distribution centers, stores organization and back-office functions.","To sum up, we will stay intently focused on our core off-price mission of offering compelling discounts on wide assortments of name-brand fashions to today's increasingly value-focused shoppers. We know that delivering great bargains will always be the key to maximizing our opportunities for growth in sales and profits over both the short and the long term.","At this point, we would like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just wanted an update on the new store performance that you're seeing in some of these new markets. How are those sales trending? And also, can you just comment on the number of new markets that you'll enter in 2013?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","It's Michael O'Sullivan. I'll take that. Overall, we're very happy with what we've seen in new markets. As a reminder, we first opened stores in new markets in the end of 2011. So it's still relatively recent, but the performance since then, we've been very happy with. In terms of additional new markets, we're actually not planning any additional new markets in 2013. We are going to be opening additional stores in the new markets that we've entered over the past couple of years, but no additional markets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Hofkin with William Blair & Co.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just I guess a couple of questions in terms of merchandise categories, departments. Can you talk about where you see opportunities potentially for improved performance relative to what you're already doing and how you're kind of progressing against those improvement targets so far? And then my second question relates to store growth. Would you expect this number of stores to kind of be similar in an absolute sense such that the growth rate might trickle down a little bit?","Michael Balmuth","The biggest opportunity for improvement within our merchandise departments is really where we struggled in the back half of last year, which was on -- in our home business. And I would say what we're seeing so far and the changes we've put in place, we're on track to see our improvement as we move through the year.","Michael B. O'Sullivan","And then Daniel, on your second question about the number of new stores, I think at least for the next few years, you should assume that the number of new stores will be approximately at the same level as we have -- that we're planning to open this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow from Sterne Agee.","Irwin Bernard Boruchow - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Can you guys help us think about your inventory levels right now? Do you feel comfortable with your apparel merchandise assortment today, given the unseasonable weather outside? Do you see much risk if the weather continues at this pace and doesn't turn for another several weeks or so? And then also, what is your expectation for packaway as a percent of total inventory as the year progresses? Just curious.","Michael Balmuth","We're pretty comfortable with our inventory levels as it relates to seasonal merchandise. For years, we've been pushing it back based on how the seasonality seems to be moving back. And so, we find ourselves in a relatively comfortable spot, a couple of markets maybe, a small level of concern, but nothing material.","John G. Call","And Ike, as far as packaway levels are concerned, obviously, they're opportunistic in terms of what bargains we see out there. But from a planning perspective, we'll assume similar levels to what we had last year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Heather N. Balsky - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is actually Heather Balsky calling for Kimberly. We were just wondering how did home perform in the fourth quarter and how do you think that compares versus last year? And what are any strategies you have in place for home in 2013?","Michael Balmuth","Home trailed the company in the fourth quarter, and our strategies going forward are really to improve the executional mistakes we made. We've made some organizational adjustments, but we've made some executional mistakes within our assortments. So this is a year of getting back to basics in that business.","Heather N. Balsky - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Do you have any examples of execution issues that you kind of are looking to improve?","Michael Balmuth","Just the assortments were substandard, and so we've adjusted those.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Tunick with JPMorgan.","Brian J. Tunick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just 3 quick questions. I guess first on dd's, maybe you could just help us understand the earnings contribution you saw this year and maybe what you're seeing from the maturity curve of how your older dd's have been ramping. Second question is sort of as you look at the mid-tier department stores or the discounters, where you think you've taken market share, what are you seeing in terms of pricing? I know you like to maintain that delta, so just wondering what you're seeing from a market share perspective. And the third thing, if John could just give us maybe what he thinks a normal CapEx number could look like in 2014?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","So Brian, on the first question you asked regarding dd's, so dd's has been profitable for the last couple of years and has been making a contribution to our overall earnings during that period. We expect the same in 2013, in fact, a little more -- a little growth in that earnings contribution. But with all that said, dd's is still a relatively small part of the business and therefore, really isn't material. So it's making contribution, but it's very small.","Michael Balmuth","Relative to where we're taking share from, I think we're taking it -- grabbing it from a bunch of people. But clearly based on the more recent mid-tier results, it is more mid-tier. And it looks like within the mid-tier, it's hard -- it's fully hard to isolate, but clearly one retailer has had a bigger drop. So we're probably getting a little more share from there, but not sure. And what we're seeing about pricing around the horn is nothing wildly aggressive overall versus what we would expect at this time of the year. Things really normally heat up as you get closer to Easter, so probably I could better answer that on the next call.","John G. Call","Brian, as it relates to CapEx, as we mentioned in the comments, we're planning $670 million in CapEx this year, which is a peak level for us. 2014, we expect that level to come back down to more -- slightly more normalized levels around to what we spent in 2012 and then descend from there going forward as we complete the build-out of the distribution center.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So I wanted to ask about February, the miss there and how you have confidence that it was related to the income tax issue. And I guess, what gives you confidence that you'll still make your quarterly estimates with February being a little bit weaker and the weather in March presumably colder in most of your markets?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Mike, in terms of February, I think as we announced a couple of weeks ago, February's comp was minus 1, which is really just at the low end of our guidance. And again, as we -- the color we provided in that release was that we saw some slowness in the business, really at the beginning of the month and then things picked up as the month progressed. And we believe that, that slowness was driven by the delay in tax refunds, and that's why things started to pick up as the month progressed.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And as it relates to March, I know you don't comment into a quarter typically. But with a lot of noise around the income tax and payroll taxes and weather and all that, I guess the question is what gives you the confidence that you'll still hit the quarterly numbers with February at the low end?","Michael Balmuth","I think really it will just come from how our business accelerated as we moved through the month of February, and we wouldn't be able to comment on anything further beyond the end of February.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","If I can ask one more while I'm still on the line,  just can you flesh out that, that comment on maybe some pockets of inventory where there was a concern. I presume that means you have a lot spring product that isn't selling because the weather is cooler in some markets. Is that what that was related to...?","Michael Balmuth","No, actually, I said the opposite. Actually, I believe I said the opposite. My belief is -- our belief is that we are well positioned with our spring inventory. Okay? There's only a couple places where I have even a slight, very slight concern, but really, as a whole, not at all. And those, what I said, it was really immaterial to...","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Yes, I just wanted to clarify. I understand it's immaterial. But just for my own knowledge,  when you say a slight concern, is that too much inventory or too little inventory, I guess, is the question.","Michael Balmuth","You know something, I probably have situations of both, okay, and we always do. Okay? So it's not any real difference from our normal position entering a spring season where there are weather issues every year in both directions in the first few months of spring.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marni Shapiro with The Retail Tracker.","Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker","I have a really quick store question. Have you guys -- in the course of leases coming up and looking across your fleet, can you talk about on average how many stores you've been closing every year, renovating every year and what the plan is for this year and the next couple of years?","Unknown Executive","Sure. I'll take that. So this past year, we said in the comments, we look to close about 10 stores that are older, aged buildings, and that number moves around based on opportunities. As far as refurbs go -- on average, we look to about that same number as we move forward with closures. As far as remodels are concerned, we last year did, finished in the first quarter, the chain relative to the sign program that we implemented [indiscernible]. And then we're always looking at our buildings to ensure that we have the right experience for our customer, and we'll continue see iterations as we move forward.","Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker","So as I think about -- so the 10 stores is about average go forward. And at this point, you feel the chain's pretty -- very healthy. The sign program is completed. There's no big expense or a push going forward over the next year or so?","Unknown Executive","That's a pretty average number. As leases age and as demographics shift, we are constantly looking at those. But we don't have any -- we don't feel we have any large exposure and feel the chain is positioned well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Mann with Johnson Rice.","David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","A couple of questions. In terms of micro-merchandising, can you give us your view on where we are in terms of -- or where you are in terms of driving benefits to margin from that initiative, perhaps what inning we're in?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Sure. So, David, as you know, we've had our micro-merchandising systems and processes in place for 2 or 3 years now. And I think we said early on that as we gather more history, gather more data, those systems and processes become more effective. And that's kind of what we experienced over the past few years. We think there's still some opportunity with our micro-merchandising tools. I think Michael had mentioned in his remarks that we're trimming inventories again this year, and that's at least partially enabled by the micro-merchandising tools that we have. Now in terms of sort of next generation, what more can we do, we're also looking at opportunities there in terms of making further improvements and enhancements to our micro-merchandising and more broadly, to our planning systems.","David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Great. In terms of SG&A, I think in the past, you've talked about the ability to lever at a 1 to 2 comp. It sounds like this year, there'll be slight deleveraging. Can you just talk a little bit about the changes there and are there any cost-saving opportunities that you could put in place to maintain that historical leverage point?","John G. Call","Sure, David. As we look to 2013 on a 1 to 2 comp, we do delever occupancy a bit, so it's not necessarily G&A. G&A tends to be -- could come pretty close to leveraging G&A, but occupancy was a bigger drag from an expense standpoint.","David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. Great. And then one last question. On your businesses in January and February, especially dd's with the lower income customer, was that more adversely affected or did you see a more adverse effect from the tax issues that you called out? And did dd's pretty much recover by the end of February as you would have expected?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Dd's experienced a similar pattern to the pattern we described for Ross. But slowness was -- the slowness happened earlier in the month and then started to pick up as the month progressed.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Citigroup.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Regarding the comp forecast and the plus 1 to 2, it sounds like you've been having a great run rate with the average dollar sale trending up. So what's happening in terms of that forecast? Are your expectations that, that traffic is the offset to basket? And if you could just give us some more color around that, we'd appreciate it.","John G. Call","So in terms of, kind of dollar basket versus traffic, the dollar basket has grown a bit. We see that traffic was a real main driver for comps through fiscal 2012. As we started February, traffic was down but picked up as we went through the month.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So throughout the year, is your expectation that the traffic could weigh on the comp to offset benefits from the mix?","John G. Call","We think that traffic should drive the comp. I mean, we're not -- from a pricing standpoint, I think we're relatively flat to slightly up, but traffic should drive the comp.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then you've also talked about fortifying the merchandise organization. Is that coming in the form of incremental hiring or what's the strategy for that to happen?","Michael Balmuth","It's coming -- some incremental hiring, some splitting of businesses that we have, and we have people internally that we move up. And this is something that we've got built into our forecast and we've been doing for multiple years, but it's built into our forecast for this year.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Final question, trade-down. Have you guys been -- how would you speak to us strategically with respect to the customer environment? Do you feel like your concept is benefiting from customers trading down into your concepts? On the flip side, are there lots trading out given all the consumer pressure?","Michael Balmuth","I think over the last several years, the customer has been a trade-down customer that has come to our doors, and we've satisfied them. And so I think actually for our business, that's been a good thing. The second part of your question was...? I'm sorry.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Regarding your average unit retail being more modest, do you feel like there's also been customers that have been trading kind of out of being able to even afford your products as well?","John G. Call","I would say that's hard to measure, Oliver. Clearly, the results have been good, but difficult to measure trade-down versus fallout. Clearly, we have more traffic in the stores that increase the comp.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Stein with Northcoast Research.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","Just a few questions. First of all, wondering if you could help us understand roughly what percent of your apparel mix was targeted at the Junior customer or what percent you generated with the Junior customer in 2012 versus '11?","Michael Balmuth","That's not something we would feel comfortable disclosing in this forum.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","Okay. Can you give us, just roughly, what kind of growth rate in comp you saw from the Junior category last year?","Michael Balmuth","It's considerably higher than the rest of apparel.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","Okay, fair enough. And just kind of wondering, with the weather having been the way it is, it sounds like your inventories are in pretty good shape, but we're also hearing a lot of bigger box retailers have been canceling orders. And I'm wondering if you are seeing perhaps greater-than-normal opportunities within the categories you play in at this point in spring as a result of those cancellations?","Michael Balmuth","I think I'd answer it as it's a very good buying time.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.","Michael Balmuth","It's a very good time to be a buyer in off-price right now.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","Okay. And one quick question for John, wondering how much the extra week added to your SG&A and how it affected gross margin in the fourth quarter?","John G. Call","In the fourth quarter, the benefit was probably about 65 basis points to the total EBIT line, and we haven't broken that out between G&A and margin.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laura Champine with Canaccord.","Laura A. Champine - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Could you give us, of the 80 stores that you plan on launching this year, what percentage go to West Coast, Midwest and the Southeast, respectively?","Michael Balmuth","Sorry, Laura, could you repeat that question? You broke up at the beginning.","Laura A. Champine - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Sure. I'm just looking at the regional split of the 80 new stores that you're launching this year, West Coast versus Midwest versus Southeast?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","So of those 80 stores, about 1\/3 will be in what we call the new markets, which is essentially the Midwest markets. There'll be a handful in the Southeast, not very many, and then the balance will be our existing markets.","Laura A. Champine - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Any sign at all yet of cannibalization when you put a store in California?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","No, not really. Obviously, if we put a store very close to an existing store, then we might see a little bit of cannibalization, but it typically lasts for a few months. And then within a year, that original store is back to where it was. But overall, I think what your question is really getting at is are we saturated in any markets? And the answer is no, we're not. We still have plenty of opportunity in our existing markets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Roxanne Meyer with UBS.","Roxanne Meyer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","My question is on your strategy to open 2 new DCs. I'm just wondering if you can elaborate on that strategy, where those DCs are going to be located, any benefits that you think you're going to gain from those DCs and just how we should think about the return on this investment?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","So Roxanne, the last time we opened a DC was about 5 years ago in Southern California, and we're just getting to a point in our growth where we need to add capacity. And we need to add capacity on the West Coast and on the East Coast, which is why we're opening 2 DCs. We are staggering them. So rather than trying to open them both at the same time, one will happen next year and the other a year after. In terms of benefits, obviously, there's a capacity benefit. It enables us to continue to support our growth. And we -- obviously, we expect the new DCs to be very productive once we scale them up. So yes, we should see some benefit from those long term.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wilson with Tiburon Research.","Rob Wilson - Tiburon Research Group, Inc.","John, in your SEC filings, you have a disclosure for merchandise purchase obligations, and that number has been increasing year-over-year the last 3 quarters. And I'm just curious as to why that number would be materially increasing versus the prior year.","John G. Call","That does reflect increased purchases. It could reflect packaway buys. It could reflect increased store size, for all those reasons.","Rob Wilson - Tiburon Research Group, Inc.","Does it reflect maybe more made-for merchandise in your stores today than maybe the prior years?","John G. Call","No, not necessarily, not necessarily. It might have to do with timing. But clearly, as the need increases, we increase those obligations.","Rob Wilson - Tiburon Research Group, Inc.","Have you ever disclosed or do you disclose your made-for merchandise mix?","John G. Call","No, we don't.","Rob Wilson - Tiburon Research Group, Inc.","Okay. One final question. Why would interest expense only be $1 million this year versus a much higher number last year?","John G. Call","Sure. With the building of our distribution centers, a lot of interest is capitalized into building those DCs.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Fuhrman with Piper Jaffray.","Alex J. Fuhrman - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Wanted to talk a little bit about just some of the competitive forces you're seeing out there, especially with one of the other big off-price competitors making a move into e-commerce recently, curious to how that changes your conversations with the brands that you both sell and also, how that affects, really, how you're going after your customers from a marketing standpoint, given this introduction to e-commerce coming from your competitor?","Michael Balmuth","Our conversations with our vendors are really between us and our vendors, okay, so it really doesn't -- I wouldn't elaborate, but I would not expect that it's changing much of our conversation anyway. But I wouldn't get too much detail on that. What was...","Michael B. O'Sullivan","And then on the other part of your question, Alex, marketing. So most of the online activity that we see that we categorize as off-price is actually at very high price points, higher price points than we compete in. So in terms of our marketing to our customer, it really isn't affected. Our customer is looking for a bargain, and our marketing focuses on reminding them that if they come to Ross, they'll find a bargain.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Jaffe with Stifel.","Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just a question on dd and Ross. As dd becomes much more of its own business, is there an opportunity to share resources, whether it's vendors or packaway or buying power with Ross stores? Is there any kind of crossover or are they really very independent silos?","Michael Balmuth","Very independent silos, occasionally some crossover, but separate buying organizations.","Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then separate packaway as well, they both have their own...?","Michael Balmuth","Separate. Totally separate.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick McKeever with MKM Partners.","Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","On the -- just I guess a couple of quick follow-ups to questions that have already been asked in a broad way. But on the new distribution centers, will that involve any change in your distribution approach? I think you currently distribute -- all distribution centers distribute to all stores. Will that change with the DCs in different parts of the country and the growth that you've seen in your store base into new markets, that sort of thing?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Nothing dramatic, Patrick. Now obviously, we tweak things here and there. So even with our 15 DCs, there are some product areas that we only process in 1 or 2 DCs. And so, that kind of thing, where it makes sense to sort of tweak the model, we do, but nothing radical in terms of the overall approach.","Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","But it still makes sense even as you've grown, let's say, into the Midwest, to distribute to all stores from all distribution centers?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Yes, that's right.","Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","And then just a quick one on -- actually, I don't think this question has been asked yet. But on Penney's, are you seeing any difference in performance from your stores that are near Penney's versus those that are not so near?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","No, we've looked at that several times over the past 12 months. And what we found is that stores that are near a J.C. Penney are doing very well and stores that are not near a J.C. Penney are doing very well. I mean, all of our stores are doing -- did very well last year. I think what that tells us is that, sure, we meant -- we're almost certainly getting some kind of benefit. But there are many other things that are going on that are also driving that comp.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Evren Kopelman from Wells Fargo.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I have a modeling question. Some of the retailers have talked about with this year, with the extra week, every quarter starting a week later. People are seeing different effects in terms of, especially in Q1, that late -- early May week being a different size than the early February week that's being dropped off. How is that impacting your model and what kind of impact in Q2 and 3 as well, if you could touch on that?","John G. Call","It impacts it somewhat, but not enough to comment on. I mean, we -- our forecast 1 or 2 comp for the year, 1 to 2 this quarter so, Evren, not really a material impact.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, we're seeing some footwear trends, these wedge sneakers taking hold. Have you seen any pickup in your footwear category?","Michael Balmuth","Our footwear business has been strong for a while. And so I'm sure that's a piece of it, but our footwear business has been strong.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Montagna from Avondale Partners.","Mark K. Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Just have a question about your home department. It sounds like it was a little bit of a laggard last year versus the apparel. Can you just walk us through what transitions you made regarding the home department last year, perhaps from a buying standpoint, and what your anticipation is for this year, when you think that, that might be on track with the standards that you would expect?","Michael Balmuth","We made some actually organizational changes in there during the course of the year. We've also added a few more senior level merchants as we've started this year. And with those changes and other changes we've made, specifically on mix within our assortment by classification, we would expect as we move through the year that our assortments would be more in keeping with what we -- our expectation would be within our racks.","Mark K. Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Do you think that it would take a full year to get the transition or given that you're off-price and you buy much closer to need, that perhaps maybe it takes half a year? I'm trying to get a better gauge as to...","Michael Balmuth","Actually, home is really less -- is really more upfront product purchased in home than there is anywhere else in our store, so it's further out. It is a further out business. Or I think saying closer to a year is appropriate.","Mark K. Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then when you gave the monthly guidance for first quarter back on February 7, were you factoring in tax refund delays at that point?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","We were factoring in a number of factors, a lot of uncertainty. That's why we gave a range and why for February we said flattish because we knew there was some uncertainty out there. So inasmuch as we're able to sort of take into account those different areas of uncertainty, our guidance tries to capture it.","Mark K. Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just the last question. In fourth quarter, it seemed as though with the mall retailers being more promotional than planned, it sounds like yourself and T.J. and the other off-price retailers were able to maintain price. So I just want to verify that, that was accurate, that you did not have to stoop lower on promotions or markdowns, I guess. And would that really indicate that off-price is gaining pricing power and that price gap between off-price and traditional retailers maybe is shrinking and that it can be maintained at a smaller gap?","Michael Balmuth","I would say that -- look, our margins were fine. We didn't have to do anything to adjust our pricing to meet the more promotional environment. And your assumption or your hypothesis, I'd say, is probably true.","Operator","I'm showing there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn it back over to management for any closing comments.","Michael Balmuth","Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores.

And welcome to the Ross Stores Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Release Conference Call. The call will begin with prepared comments by management followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts, and other matters that are based on the company\u2019s current forecast of aspects of its future business.","These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today\u2019s press release and the company\u2019s fiscal 2015 Form 10-K and fiscal 2016 Form 10-Q and 8-Ks on file with the SEC.","Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer.","Barbara Rentler","Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Balmuth, Executive Chairman; Michael O\u2019Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Vice President of Investor Relations.","We will begin our call today with a review of our third quarter performance followed by our outlook for the fourth quarter after which we will be happy to respond to any questions you have.","As noted in today\u2019s press release, we are very pleased with our better than expected sales and earnings growth in the third quarter, as customers responded favorably to the compelling values we offered throughout our stores.","Earnings per share for the period were $0.62, up 17% on top of a robust 15% increase in the prior year. Net earnings grew to $245 million, compared to $216 million last year. These earnings results include a benefit of about $0.01 per share from favorable timing of expenses that are expected to reverse in the fourth quarter.","Sales to the third quarter rose 11% to $3.1 billion, with comparable store sales up 7% versus a 3% gain last year. Operating margin was above plan growing 55 basis points to 12.6% driven mainly by higher merchandise margin.","For the first nine months of fiscal 2016 earnings per share were $2.06, up 11% on top of 15% increase in the prior year. Net earnings were $817 million, up from $757 million last year. Sales year-to-date rose 8% to $9.4 billion, with comparable store sales up 4% on top of a 4% gain in 2015.","dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS continued a year-to-date trend with strong performance in the third quarter. California was the strongest region during the period, while shoes was the best performing category at Ross. Our ladies\u2019 apparel business also continued to strengthen as shoppers responded to our improved merchandise assortment.","As we ended the third quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 4% compared to the prior year with average in-store inventories down slightly. Packaway as a percentage of total inventories was 45%, compared to 48% at this time last year.","As planned, we completed our 2016 store opening program during the third quarter, with the addition of 25 new Ross and nine dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS. We expect to end fiscal 2016 with 1,338 Ross and 192 dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS, an increase of 84 locations for the year.","Now, Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our third quarter results and details on our guidance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year.","Michael Hartshorn","Thank you, Barbara. Let\u2019s start with our third quarter results. Our 7% comparable stores sales gain was driven by increases in both traffic and the size of the average basket. As Barbara mentioned, third quarter operating margin was better than planned, increasing 55 basis points from last year to 12.6%.","Cost of goods sold improved by 50 basis points, driven by 50 basis points in higher merchandise margin combined with a 20-basis point decline in occupancy costs. This was partially offset by an increase of 20 basis points in buying expenses.","Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period improved by 5 basis points, as leverage on the 7% increase in comparable store sales was partially offset by higher wages and certain other non-recurring costs.","During the quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $179 million. Year-to-date, we have bought back a total of 9.1 million shares, for an aggregate price of $530 million. We remain on track to spend a total of $700 million for the year to complete the two-year $1.4 billion stock repurchase program, approved by our Board of Directors in February 2015.","Let\u2019s turn now to our fourth quarter outlook. While we hope to do better, we are maintaining our same-store sales guidance for 1% to 2% increase. This range is on top of strong 6% and 4% gains in 2014 and 2015, respectively.","We expect earnings per share for the 2016 fourth quarter to be $0.72 to $0.75, which reflects the impact from the previously mentioned expense timing that benefited the third quarter. This updated range compares to earnings per share of $0.66 last year.","The operating statement assumptions for the fourth quarter include the following. Total sales are projected to grow 4% to 5%. Operating margin is forecast to be 13.2% to 13.4% versus 12.7% in the prior year as we anniversary higher packaway costs that negatively impacted last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Net interest expense is estimated to be about $4 million, our tax rate is planned at approximately 36% to 37% and we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about $392 million.","Based on our year-to-date results, along with this fourth quarter forecast, we are now projecting earnings per share for the full year to increase 11% to 12%, to $2.78 to $2.81 on top of a 14% gain in fiscal 2015.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments.","Barbara Rentler","Thank you, Michael. Again, we are very happy with our third quarter sales and earnings that were well ahead of our expectations. As Michael just mentioned, we base our most challenging multiyear comparisons this holiday season. There is an ongoing uncertainty in the macro economic, political and retail environments that could once again lead to a very promotional fourth quarter.","Despite these potential headwinds, we believe we are competitively positioned for the fourth quarter as our merchants have done a terrific job of acquiring a wide array of exciting and sharply priced name brand fashions and gifts to appeal to today\u2019s value driven holiday shoppers.","To sum up, we see consumers increased focus on value continuing for the foreseeable future. This along with a solid execution of our short and long-term strategies makes us optimistic about our prospects for continued growth in sales and earnings.","At this point, we\u2019d like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Paul Lejuez from Citi.","Paul Lejuez","Hey. Thanks, guys. Can you remind us of what your merchandise margin typically looks like on packaway merchandise compared to your normal in-season buys and has there been anything in the quality of packaway as you have seen over the past few quarters that\u2019s changed that relationship at all?","Michael Hartshorn","From a margin perspective, Paul, the margin on packaway is very similar to [inaudible] merchandise or direct store merchandise. To us it\u2019s the best value for the customer.","Michael O\u2019Sullivan","And it has been consistent\u2026","Paul Lejuez","Has been consistent?","Michael O\u2019Sullivan","Yes. It\u2019s been consistent over time, Paul. So, no real change over the past several quarters.","Paul Lejuez","Gotcha. Thanks. And just one follow-up, it looks like D&A growth slowed substantially, can you talk about what maybe going on on that line?","Michael Hartshorn","So on G&A, we obviously had a seven comp. We were 5 basis points lower, partly driven by\u2026","Paul Lejuez","D&A, I\u2019m sorry, Michael. I was asking about the D&A.","Michael Hartshorn","Yeah. Sorry, obviously, G&A. So, on capital spending, we are forecasting for the year about $315 million in capital, which is lower than we projected at the beginning of the year due to delay in some corporate office and supply chain projects that we expect to push into next year.","Paul Lejuez","Any initial thoughts on the CapEx budget for next year?","Michael Hartshorn","Expectation at this point would be around $400 million similar to how we started this year.","Paul Lejuez","Great. Thanks guys. Good luck.","Operator","The next question is from Lindsay Drucker-Mann from Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker-Mann","Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I was hoping to dig in a little bit on the drivers in D&A. I think that you mentioned some non-recurring costs that happened in SG&A in the quarter, but also some timing benefits that happened in the third quarter. So could you just add a little more color there?","Michael Hartshorn","Sure. So I\u2019ll break the timing in the quarter. The timing in the quarter was actually gross margin component. Packaway ended a little higher than we had in our current original expectations when we ended the quarter. So that timing moved from Q3 to Q4, which is why the Q4 guidance came down by about a penny.","In terms of G&A, we ended 5 basis points better. We would have expected more leverage on the 7% comp. That was driven by higher wage, and as we mentioned on the call, one-time non-recurring expenses.","Lindsay Drucker-Mann","Okay. And your inventories per store were actually down despite a really strong comp. I was wondering if you could talk about, we\u2019ve seen inventories down significantly at a number of department stores. How would you characterize the buying environment or the availability of product and also the driver of your own inventory reductions per store with the strong comp?","Michael O\u2019Sullivan","Lindsay, I\u2019ll separate that into two pieces. First of all, just the availability, I\u2019ll let Barbara comment on that in a moment. But in terms of the inventory in our stores, that\u2019s driven by our own plans. We tend to plan our inventories with some discipline, just to make sure that we can drive turns if the sales trend is strong. So, even though, yeah, obviously, our sales trend was very strong in Q3, we kept our inventories in line as we go into Q4. I\u2019ll let Barbara comment in terms of the availability of merchandise.","Barbara Rentler","In terms of availability, it\u2019s pretty broad-based and spread through all the markets. There\u2019s been obviously a lot of availability, despite the fact that department stores have kept their inventory basis in line. There is definitely more goods out in market at this moment.","Lindsay Drucker-Mann","Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next is from Adrienne Yih from Wolfe Research.","Adrienne Yih Tennant","Good afternoon and congratulations. My question was on the resolution of the spring product issue. It seems like that\u2019s clearly behind. But I was wondering if there was any impact whatsoever into the third quarter. And then how much chase or open-to-buy do you actually still have available to get to a higher comp similar to what you did in the third quarter? Thank you.","Barbara Rentler","In terms of impact of spring product, just to clarify the spring product going into the third quarter?","Adrienne Yih Tennant","Sorry. The spring product issue that was from Q1 on...","Barbara Rentler","Just the issue itself, a hangover effect, we did not have a hangover effect\u2026","Adrienne Yih Tennant","Yeah. The hangover, exactly.","Barbara Rentler","Yes. Okay. So we did not have a hangover effect in terms of product moving into the third quarter, and can you just clarify the second piece of question again?","Michael Hartshorn","I think on the second piece, just, I think, I\u2019d just answer that already. We -- our business is all about chasing sales trends. So, I\u2019ll remind you, coming into Q3 our guidance was a 1 to 2 comp in Q3 and we were able to chase it up to a 7%. So we\u2019ve been pretty good about our ability to go out\u2026","Adrienne Yih Tennant","Got it.","Michael Hartshorn","\u2026and get merchandise in Q4 if the sales trend is there.","Adrienne Yih Tennant","Okay. And then can you [inaudible] about over levering to some of the upside inventory that was out there? Thanks.","Michael Hartshorn","Sorry, Adrienne, you were cutting out there. Could you just repeat the questions?","Adrienne Yih Tennant","Oh, I\u2019m sorry. Just on the packaway opportunity that you have, how opportunistic was the buying last year in terms of, perhaps, any margin upside, does that make sense? So, to the extent that you were able to buy at better than historic pricing, averaging unit cost.","Michael Hartshorn","Yeah. I think we wouldn\u2019t expect to see a lot of margin expansion from that. What we have done is, to the extent we are able to buy great product opportunistically and put it into the hotel, put it into packaway, when we flow it out, what we\u2019re really doing is trying to drive sales. So that\u2019s really where we look for those bargains to really drive sales rather than add to our margin.","Adrienne Yih Tennant","Okay. Thank you very much. Best of luck. Great job.","Operator","Your next question is from Omar Saad from Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad","Thank you. Great quarter. I wanted to ask if you could talk about how much scale the current supply chain, the distribution centers, infrastructure you have, how much they can handle and when do you expect as we think out over time, the next kind of major round of investments in IT and supply chain?","Michael O\u2019Sullivan","Sure. So in terms of major processing facilities, major distribution centers, just as a reminder, we added a new distribution center last year, that was in 2015 and we had added one before that in 2014, so some pretty lumpy investments that we have now worked our way through.","Given our current growth projections, we would expect that we would need additional major distribution capacity, probably, in about four years or five years from now. And if you back off that you\u2019d probably start some of the capital spending a year or two year before that. So it\u2019s going to be a while before we have those kind of lumpy investments again.","Omar Saad","Okay. If I could have one follow-up, in terms of the great comp number you put up this quarter, do you think about the upside, perhaps, where your expectations were three months or six months ago, is more of the upside coming from the packaway product or the regular flow?","Michael O\u2019Sullivan","It\u2019s a combination. I wouldn\u2019t call out one or the other. The truth is, the upside really comes from the customer coming in and buying more product and we\u2019ve been able to get great packaway product and great flow product in order to fuel that sales trend.","Barbara Rentler","So the merchants are chasing the sales trend as we go.","Omar Saad","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next question is from Marni Shapiro from Retail Tracker.","Marni Shapiro","Hey, everybody. Congratulations. Fantastic quarter. So I was curious if there were any segments in the quarter that surprised you either to the upside or to the downside, be it home, personal care, juniors, other than I believe you called out footwear, any other call outs?","Barbara Rentler","I wouldn\u2019t say that that surprised us. Our home business continues to perform well. Shoes have been performing well all along and we felt good about our assortments in ladies as we were starting to move and improve the assortments. So we did -- we were happy with that performance.","I guess that would be -- if anything that would be the surprise is that business has been moving from quarter-to-quarter in the right direction. But, overall, I wouldn\u2019t say major surprises, because home and shoes have continued and have been overall good all the year.","Marni Shapiro","And within ladies, was it active wear, was it juniors, was it across the board?","Barbara Rentler","In ladies, well, active wear -- active wear is performing just fine. I would say it\u2019s really more in ladies and juniors would be at this moment in time.","Marni Shapiro","Excellent. Best of luck for the holiday season, guys.","Barbara Rentler","Thanks.","Michael O\u2019Sullivan","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you. Good afternoon. Just wanted to follow-up on the increase in basket size that you commented on in the prepared remarks, what was the driver of that? Was that a unit or a pricing increase?","Michael Hartshorn","Sure, Lorraine. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, this 7% comp was driven by higher traffic and an increase in the basket size. Traffic was slightly larger increase than basket. The basket was all driven by higher units per transaction, AUR was relatively flat.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Okay. And what do you expect for AUR trends going forward?","Michael Hartshorn","I don\u2019t think we comment at this point, but it\u2019s run relatively flat all year round for us.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Brian Tunick from Royal Bank of Canada.","Brian Tunick","Thanks. Good afternoon. Curious, I guess, for Barbara, may be, can you talk about what categories might be the biggest opportunity you see for next year or may be where some of your buying team is spending their time? And then, I guess, also curious on the real estate pipeline, any initial thoughts from a planning perspective, why either the store growth rate or mix could look different than what we saw this year? Thanks very much.","Barbara Rentler","Sure. In terms of categories for next year, we still feel very good about our home business. We feel there\u2019s a lot of opportunity that goes on and home, it\u2019s very broad based. If we continued to execute our strategies effectively in ladies, we would be feeling positive about our ladies business as long as we stay on track and execute appropriately.","And in terms of where the merchants are spending their time, all the merchants are spending their time in the market, not just home merchants, not just in specific areas that we think we would expand for next year, all merchants are spending their time in markets again because there are so much availability and potential opportunities.","Michael O\u2019Sullivan","And Brian, on your question about real estate and number of stores, obviously, we will be more specific when we talk about 2017 guidance in February. But, I think, it\u2019s a fair bet, if you look at our store openings over the past several years, we run at typically 80 to 90 net new stores a year. I wouldn\u2019t expect a dramatic deviation from that going forward.","Brian Tunick","And if I could throw in one more question, obviously, you guys have talked about wage pressure now and some of the things you are doing to absorb it? But are there other additional opportunities, both in the supply chain, on the store side that you guys are finding to offset the wage pressure?","Michael O\u2019Sullivan","There always are. I mean, as a company, we go through a rigorous and detailed budget process. There\u2019s a lot of sort of expense discipline within different functions within the company. So we\u2019re always looking for new opportunities to find efficiency and drive savings. And again, we will talk more about that when we give 2017 guidance.","I mean, I would say that, we feel pretty good about our ability to offset the wage increases that we have absorbed in the last couple of years. There\u2019s a limit to the degree to which we can offset those increases going forward.","Brian Tunick","All right. Super. Good luck this holiday.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Binetti from UBS securities.","Michael Binetti","Guys, good afternoon, and congrats -- my congrats on a nice quarter. Let me just ask you the department stores have come up a few times, if it seems like their strategy has been to reduce their inventories to try and lower their markdown cadence. If they are successful and you guys wake up tomorrow and see the department stores kind of leading their industry to higher AURs? What -- how do you strategically think about that? Does that bring an AUR opportunity for you or do you guys typically look for opportunities to gather market shares in that situation?","Michael O\u2019Sullivan","I would say, we would welcome that, I think, if they got less promotional, we would see that as an opportunity to gain more share and to drive sales. Specifically for us, it would be about sales rather than margin. But I think as Barbara said in her remarks, the indicators that we see support us to think that the fourth quarter will likely be very promotional and so those indicators include the fact that we are seeing plenty of merchandise supply, presumably that supply was made for someone.","Secondly, when we look at Q3 results that have been reported so far, they look relatively weak across the retail sector.","And then, thirdly, as Barbara said in her remarks, the political and economic environment looks uncertain. So if you mix all those together it suggests that the environment is likely to remain promotional rather than the other way around.","Michael Binetti","And then, if I guess, may be continue on that, I feel like there\u2019s not a week that goes by that we don\u2019t hear another one of a department store brand companies updating their strategy to include significantly lower inventory buys going forward. So maybe a soft inventory out there today, but in general, the off price channels continue to comment that inventory in the marketplace remains robust. You guys have certainly benefited from better inventory turns but better merchandise margins over time. If the brands do follow through with that strategy and take inventory lower, it becomes a bit counterintuitive for us to keep hearing off price industry in general, to say that, we still see plentiful inventory out there. How do you think forward to if inventories do get a little bit harder to come by, how you look at approaching your business for next year? Thanks.","Michael O\u2019Sullivan","So, those are good questions. I think, it all depends on what sales those departments stores are able to do and the comparison between those sales and the inventories that they have -- they bought themselves into. I mean, right now, as I say, based upon what we are seeing in the marketplace, we see no problem with the buy.","Michael Binetti","Thanks a lot.","Operator","The next question is from Laura Champine from Roe Equity Research.","Laura Champine","Good afternoon. I wanted to ask again about your expectations for Q4, because the comp guidance you\u2019ve given does look a very conservative, given what you just put up in Q3. Would your expectation be in Q4 to continue to gain share within apparel? Is it conservative on apparel just generally and on retail generally or is there something that gives you pause about your own performance?","Michael Hartshorn","I think it\u2019s nothing specific to us, Lorraine. I think, it\u2019s more about the external environment and really the things that Barbara has mentioned that the broader political and economic environment looks uncertain. The Q3, the third quarter results that have been reported so far look relatively weak and that suggests that it could get pretty promotional as retailers try to either hold on to or avoid losing share.","So the combination of those two things makes us relatively concerned about the external environment. The only thing that\u2019s specific to us, I suppose, is the fact that we are up against our toughest year-over-year comparisons in the fourth quarter on a two-year and three-year basis. So that\u2019s the other thing that sort of factors into our guidance.","Laura Champine","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Oliver Chen from Cowen and Company.","Oliver Chen","Hi. Congrats on best comps in retail. Regarding the comps and traffic gains, what was happening with traffic with respect to how they were -- it was so impressive? Were you able to chase into categories and did you have to delay shipments in terms of some of the seasonal weather? Just curious about how that traffic number was so impressive. A related question is just on the merchandise margins. Is that attributable to the strong inventory control? Thanks.","Michael Hartshorn","Oliver, I will start with the merchant margins. We obviously outperformed the high end of our comp sales targets, so that meant we had faster turns resulting in markdown leverage. We also benefited from our ability to take advantages of buying opportunities in the marketplace. So, both of those factors contributed to the higher merchandise margin.","Barbara Rentler","And in terms of chasing into categories, again there\u2019s been a lot of availability in the marketplace. So the merchants are out in market every day, looking for opportunities, so they\u2019ve been able to chase into categories that we are selling. In terms of seasonal products, we had relatively conservative seasonal plans for the Q3 and so seasonal performance has been overall fine at this point in time and the categories go-forward remain to be seen what we find out in the marketplace as we chase our way across.","Oliver Chen","Thanks so much. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Matthew Boss from J.P. Morgan.","Matthew Boss","Thanks. Congrats on a nice quarter. So, just on the 7% comp was performance pretty consistent throughout the quarter. And then just as you dig into the performance versus the choppy macro backdrop that you call out, are you seeing a broadening of the customer base, new customers shopping the store, just the best way that you track it, I\u2019m curious what you are seeing?","Michael Hartshorn","In terms of trends during the quarter, Matthew, the comps were similar across all three months in the quarter.","Michael O\u2019Sullivan","And then what\u2019s driving that 7% comp, it\u2019s hard for us to tell, Matthew, but it\u2019s almost certainly a combination of certainly some new customers and then some existing customers who are just shopping us more, looking for values and happy with what we\u2019re able to offer them.","Matthew Boss","Got it. And then just a follow-up on margins for the fourth quarter, what\u2019s the best way to think about recapturing the 100 basis points related to the packaways last year, just curious, how we should think about recapture of that loss from last year?","Michael Hartshorn","So the guidance assumes some recapture of the 100 basis points. We didn\u2019t -- we don\u2019t -- our practice is not to call out specifically in upcoming guidance, but it\u2019s part of the driver of the EPS growth in the fourth quarter.","Matthew Boss","Okay. Best of luck.","Operator","The next question is from Kimberly Greenberger of Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Greenberger","Great. Thank you so much. Michael, I wanted to just ask about wage inflation and SG&A leverage. It seems like the leverage point today, perhaps, starting in the third quarter, sits a little bit higher because of the wage increases. So I\u2019m wondering if you can just talk to your -- what comp you need to leverage SG&A in a normal environment? And it seems like starting in the third quarter and continuing maybe through the first half of \u201817 that comp needed is a bit higher because of the incremental wages, could you just talk us through that?","Michael Hartshorn","Sure, Kimberly. The third quarter levered by 5 basis points on the 7% comp. As we mentioned in our comments, that was partly driven by wages and that really hasn\u2019t changed from the first part of the year but it was also impacted by one-time non-recurring charges we took in the quarter. So I\u2019d say the leverage point change in the quarter was those non-recurring costs. At this point, we continue to believe, at least in the next couple of years that the leverage point continues to be about 3%.","Kimberly Greenberger","About 3%, okay, great. And I\u2019m wondering if there was any year-over-year increase in incentive compensation either driving that 20 basis points of gross margin deleverage or in your SG&A. And then lastly, Barbara, I apologize if I didn\u2019t hear this directly, but could you just comment on the apparel execution in the women\u2019s business? I think on the August earnings call you had mentioned, you\u2019ve made a great deal of progress in the second quarter, but you weren\u2019t entirely happy yet. I\u2019m just wondering if you can just update us on the progress there. Thanks.","Michael Hartshorn","Kimberly, on the incentive costs, yes, on both gross margin and SG&A. In our notes we mentioned that buying expenses were 20 basis points higher than last year and that was mainly from higher incentive costs given the outperformance during the quarter.","Barbara Rentler","And, Kimberly, in terms of the ladies business, we do feel like we\u2019re making progress. We are moving in the right direction and we are expecting, as long as we execute effectively where we had some real major execution issues in Q1 that we\u2019re going to continue to see it strengthening in the business. So, it\u2019s month-to-month improving business by business, but we do feel like we\u2019ve made progress and we do feel like we\u2019re on track as long as we continue to execute appropriately.","Kimberly Greenberger","Terrific. Thank you so much.","Operator","The next question is from Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo.","Ike Boruchow","Hi, everyone. Congrats on a great quarter. Michael, just a quick one on wages, can you remind us, I\u2019m not sure if you shared this, what kind of EPS headwind, wage inflation has been or do you project will be for you guys this year? And then just, not asking for guidance, but just simplistically when we think about next year, does that headwind, is it similar, does it lessen or does it increase?","Michael Hartshorn","So, Ike, we obviously haven\u2019t called out the impact of wages, because we\u2019ve been able to offset the impact to date. Obviously, we are working through our finalizing our 2007 (sic) [2017] budget and we\u2019ll be in a better position at the end of the year when we give our guidance for 2017 and the potential impact.","Ike Boruchow","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes is from Bob Drbul from Guggenheim.","Bob Drbul","Hi. Good afternoon. Just have two questions. The first one is, regionally you called out California, I was just wondering if there are any other call outs, specifically the Midwest has been pretty consistent for you guys, how you are doing in the Midwest. And then, the second question would be, I know it\u2019s early and a lot of subjecting this to this, but if tax -- corporate tax rates were to be reduced, could you maybe just help us think about how to think about the possible uses of cash in a scenario where additional cash became available in size for you?","Michael Hartshorn","Sure. So on the regional performance, geographically the strong comp performance was very broad based. We mentioned California, the Midwest also performed very well. On tax policy, I think, it\u2019s really too early to comment on the impact and what policy changes ultimately get implemented.","Bob Drbul","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Roxanne Meyer from MKM Partners.","Roxanne Meyer","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon and congratulations on a terrific quarter. I just have a follow-up question on category performance. Obviously, home and shoes were called out as standouts? I\u2019m just wondering if you could also share other categories that were both above and as well as below the chain average. Thanks a lot.","Barbara Rentler","I would say that other businesses fell pretty much closer in line in apparel. In terms of probably some of our weaker performances, we\u2019re still struggling in accessories as we\u2019re working our straight way through that, but after that, I would say pretty much most of the businesses fell in line.","Roxanne Meyer","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","The next question is from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Telsey","Good afternoon, everyone, and congratulations on the results. Any update open dd\u2019s and what you\u2019re seeing there, and how you are thinking about for 2017 and also any update on shrinkage? Thank you.","Michael O\u2019Sullivan","Dana, on dd\u2019s, as Barbara mentioned in her remarks, dd\u2019s continued the strong performance in Q3. The business is on track for another good year. We -- as we have over the last several years, this year we opened about 20 new dd\u2019s stores and again, we will be more specific when we give 2017 guidance, but if I had to speculate, I would say that you could expect that we\u2019re not going to deviate materially from that going forward.","Michael Hartshorn","On shrink, we finished our physical inventory as we do every year in the third quarter. Shrink results were slightly better than our expectations. That said, shrink was a slight headwind versus last year as we anniversaried better than expected results from the prior year.","Dana Telsey","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Simeon Siegel from Nomura Instinet.","Simeon Siegel","Thanks. Good afternoon. Sorry, if I missed it, but just any thoughts on where you\u2019d expect inventory to end the year and then any color on the long-term merchant mark-- merch mark opportunity from here? Thanks.","Michael Hartshorn","In terms of inventory for the year, I mean, I think, we\u2019ll continue to operate the business at slightly down and I don\u2019t think that our expectation would change for year-end inventories.","Michael O\u2019Sullivan","And then in terms of longer-term margin opportunity, at this point, it\u2019s really about the sales line. I kind of feel like in terms of the things that have driven our margin improvement over the last several years, those things have included tighter inventory control, which has obviously driven lower markdowns and improved shortage control. There might be some incremental opportunity in both of those areas, but it will be relatively small. So the real upside opportunity on margin is going to come from ahead of planned sales.","Simeon Siegel","Great. Thanks. Best of luck for holiday.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Barbara Rentler for closing comments.","Barbara Rentler","Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores.

The call will begin with prepared comments by management, followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts and other matters that are based on the company's current forecasts of aspects of its future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today's press release and the company's fiscal 2014 Form 10-K, fiscal 2015 Form 10-Q, and 8-K on file with the SEC.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer.","Barbara Rentler","Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Balmuth, Executive Chairman; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Group Senior VP and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Senior Director of Investor Relations.","We'll begin our call today with a review of our fourth quarter and 2015 performance, followed by our outlook for 2016. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. As noted in today's press release, we are pleased with our sales and earnings results for the fourth quarter, which exceeded our expectations despite the highly promotional holiday selling environment. Additionally, we faced our most challenging sales comparisons from the prior year.","Our results were driven by the competitive values we offered on a wide assortment of name, brand, bargains and gifts throughout our stores. Earnings per share for the fourth quarter grew 10% to $0.66 on net earnings that rose 6% to $264 million. Sales for the quarter increased 7% to $3.251 billion, with comparable store sales up 4% versus on top of last years 6% gain.","For the 2015 fiscal year, earnings per share grew 14% to $2.51 on top of strong multi-year increases. Net earnings rose 10% to $1.021 billion with comparable sales up 4% for the year.","dd's DISCOUNTS also posted better than expected gains in sales and operating profits for both the quarter and the year as customers continued to respond positively to their value offering. Misses sportswear was the best performing merchandised category of Ross for the fourth quarter while the Midwest was the strongest region.","Our fourth quarter operating margin of 12.7% was down from last year as improved merchandised margins and strong expense control were more than offset by the timing of packaway related cost.","For the full year however we are pleased that operating margin increased 10 basis points to a record 13.6%. As we ended 2015, total consolidated inventories were up 3% over the prior year with packaway levels at 47% of total inventories compared to 45% last year.","Average in-store inventories were down approximately 2% at year end. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 3.2 million shares of common stock for a total price of $170 million. For the full year we repurchased 13.7 million shares for an aggregate price of $700 million. We expect to complete the $700 million remaining under our current two-year $1.4 billion program by the end of fiscal 2016.","As noted in today\u2019s release our board recently approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.135 per share, up 15% on top of an 18% increase last year. The continued growth of our shareholder payouts reflects our ongoing confidence and the company\u2019s ability to generate significant amounts of cash after funding our growth and the other capital needs of our business.","We have repurchased stock as planned every year since 1993 and raised our cash dividend annually since its inception in 1994. This consistent record reflects our unwavering commitment to enhancing stockholder value and return.","Now, Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our 2015 results and details on our fiscal 2016 full year and first quarter guidance.","Michael Hartshorn","Thank you, Barbara. Let's start with our fourth quarter results. Our 4% comparable store sales gain was driven by a combination of higher traffic and an increase in the size of the average baskets. As Barbara mentioned, while full year operating margin was up 10 basis points compared to last year, fourth quarter operating margin declined 45 basis points to 12.7%.","Cost of goods sold increased 75 basis points in the quarter driven by a 100 basis points of higher distribution expenses due to the timing of packaway related cost that benefited earnings earlier in the year. Freight and buying expenses also rose 15 and 5 basis points respectively. These increases were partially offset by merchandised margin improvement of 35 basis points from the prior year and 10 basis points of lower occupancy cost.","Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period improved by 30 basis points benefiting from strong cost control and leverage on the 4% comparable store sales increase. Our tax rate for the quarter was lower than expected due to the passage of federal tax credit legislation and also the favorable resolution of the state tax matter.","Let\u2019s turn now to our guidance for the upcoming quarter and year. Earnings per share for fiscal 2016 are forecast to be in the range of $2.59 to $2.71 up 3% to 8% from $2.51 in fiscal 2015. The operating statement assumptions for fiscal 2016 include the following. Total sales are forecast to grow 4% to 5% on a comparable store sales increase of 1% to 2%. We expect to add about 70 Ross and 20 dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS locations, as usual these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about ten older stores.","If same-store sales are in line with our guidance above 1% to 2% then we would project the operating margin for 2016 to be 13.5% to 13.7%. This forecast calls for a slight increase in merchandised margin that would offset some deleveraging on operating costs.","Net interest expense is estimated to be $70 million; our tax rate is projected to be approximately 37% to 38%. We expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about $395 million.","Capital expenditures in 2016 are projected to be approximately $425 million. And deprecation and amortization expense inclusive of stock-based amortization is forecast to be about $385 million, up from $346 million in 2015.","Lastly, our guidance includes our plans to raise the minimum wage for eligible hourly associates to $10 per hour in the second quarter of 2016 up from the current $9 minimum. These wage adjustments will help keep us competitive in our hiring practices and enhance our ability to retain talented associates to provide the shopping experience our customers have come to expect.","Let\u2019s move now to our first quarter guidance. We are projecting same store sales to be up 1% to 2% and earnings per share to be flat to up 4% at $0.69 to $0.72. Following are the assumptions that support this range.","Total sales are projected to increase 4% to 5%, we expect to open 22 new Ross and 6 dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS locations during the quarter. First quarter operating margin is projected to be 15.0% to 15.2% compared to last years 15.7%.","The forecasted decline is mainly from the timing of packaway related costs that benefited the first quarter last year and also the impact of a new distribution center that opened in the second quarter of 2015.","In addition, net interest expense for the quarter is estimated to be about $4.5 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 38% to 39% and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be around $400 million.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments.","Barbara Rentler","Thank you, Michael. We are very pleased with our strong performance in 2015 as we were once again able to convert our better than expected revenue gains into solid double digit earnings per share growth. These results are due to the resilience of our off price business models and our testament to the talented people we have throughout our organization. They have demonstrated once again their ability to deliver compelling bargains to our customers which will always be the key to success in our business.","As we move into 2016, we are well positioned to take advantage of the best opportunities in the market place. However, we continue to face our own challenging multi year sales and earnings comparison. And with the increasing uncertain and volatile macro economic climate, it doesn\u2019t appear that the retail landscape will get any less competitive or promotional in 2016.","So while we hope to do better, we believe it\u2019s prudent to maintain a conservative posture when forecasting our business for this year. As we look ahead over the longer term, we remain confident in our ability to deliver average annual earnings per share gain in the low double digit percentage range. This view is rooted in our belief that the off price sector will remain a strong performing segment of retail especially given consumers ongoing focus on value.","Equally important is our proven ability overtime to maximize our favorable industry position by delivering the exceptional values our customers have come to expect.","At this point, we like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Binetti from UBS. Your line is open.","Michael Binetti","Hey guys, thanks congrats on a good quarter. Would you help us think about the timing shift that you pointed to with the merch margin up and the packaway I guess taking away a little bit of that merch margin upside that we saw and how to think about those dynamics as we go forward into the at least in the first half of 2016, please?","Michael Hartshorn","Yes so as we mentioned on the call, Michael, its Michael Hartshorn. For the quarter, it impacted us by about 100 basis points and to walk through that timing of what happened during the year Q1 we got about $0.03 benefit last year. Q3, we got about $0.01 and then Q4 went $0.05 with the charged earnings. So as we think about it going forward in the first quarter as we called out in our guidance we did expect some headwind in the first quarter. It\u2019s hard to predict how it will fall out during the rest of the year and that based on market availability of merchandise.","Michael Binetti","Right. And it sounds like the -- you are pleased with the inventory available in the channel in the quarter as you head into the first half of the year, I\u2019m trying to think about areas where perhaps that we\u2019ll see as we walk around the stores here in the first quarter where are some of the areas that we are going to see that you found to be more readily available perhaps than you thought as we get into the year?","Barbara Rentler","Actually I think the -- I think the availability Michael its pretty broad based. I mean it\u2019s really when you think about the sectors of the market where business was difficult, you know it\u2019s parallel and it\u2019s strong. So we feel that there are opportunities in all businesses.","Michael Binetti","Okay. And then If I could just sneak in one final one. There is obviously we get a lot of questions about new entrants coming into off price and everyone seems focused on getting their fair share of the growth that you talked about and the optimism you have in the category longer term. And the markets where you have seen you know a rising count of competitors fall somehow under the off price umbrella. Would you mind talking about sales dynamics, the competitive dynamics that you have seen in those markets? Thank you.","Michael O'Sullivan","So Michael, its Michael O'Sullivan. We really haven\u2019t seen any impact at this point. I mean if you think about the size of some of those new off price entrants, that\u2019s not too surprising, that is too small to have made much of an impact. But I guess I say more broadly, we try not to get too distracted by what other companies are doing and what new entrance is coming into the market.","We operate in a very competitive marketplace and we try and focus on what we\u2019re good at and to make best use of the advantage and the strength that we have. And yes, as we look at the fourth quarter, the 4% comp on top of 6% comp last year suggest that we\u2019re doing pretty well in that regard.","Michael Binetti","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Omar Saad from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Omar Saad","Thank you. Good afternoon. Great quarter. I was wondering if you could \u2013 you mentioned the promotional environment a few times in your prepared remarks. I was wondering if you could elaborate on a little bit, are you seeing any impact on your customers or the marketplace given the broader, more promotional environment in the quarter? Obviously, a really good comp, merchandize margins up. But how do you see that impacting the business or what do you concern about how that might effect, how consumers behave, your customers behave in 2016? Thanks.","Barbara Rentler","Well I think the increased promotional environment. I think what we saw in the fourth quarter especially in the department store sectors where we\u2019re going to see as we continue through 2016 I think what it means for the customer, it means for us, I mean, obviously we\u2019re not economist so we can\u2019t determine what the customers thinking. But I think what it means to us in our business is that we need to continue to deliver great value. And so value is something that moves based off of what goes on in the department stores and specialty stores. So we have to make sure we do two things that we stay very liquid, so that we\u2019re there and can maximize and closeout opportunities and those closeout opportunities then has to be at the right value. And since that moves that gives us the flexibility to deliver the values of the customers is wanting.","Omar Saad","Okay. Thank you. But to be fair, it seems like and tell me if I\u2019m reading this wrong. It seems like thus far your business is held up really well and you haven\u2019t seen kind of any negative detrimental impact from just how promotional it was in holiday quarter?","Barbara Rentler","That\u2019s because we went into the quarter with two things. We went into the quarter with very strong packaway values and we also we exceeding our sales expectations, so we also chased a big part of that through closeouts and the key to delivering value to the customers understanding what goes on around you, so you really need to have liquidity to make sure that you keep that relationship, so that the customer satisfied.","Omar Saad","Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Jaffe from Stifel. Your line is open.","Richard Jaffe","Thanks very much and I appreciate all the color on the packaway and that seems to be the gift that\u2019s going to keep on giving as we go into 2016. Looking at the product in the warehouse do you see more quarters or quarters that will be more impacted by packaway or less let\u2019s say, maybe you have gloves that will come out in November or swimsuits that will come in August. Any direction or is it evenly balanced on our quarterly basis or seasonal basis I should say?","Michael Hartshorn","Richard I would say, it\u2019s fairly evenly balanced, nothing to call out on a quarter-by-quarter basis.","Richard Jaffe","That\u2019s helpful. And despite the environment and the competitive pressure we talked about earlier. Looking at 2016 your cautions remains and is that the same old issues that we talked about before as a competitive pressure, department stores discounting or are there new things that are fueling your caution despite the high level of success in tremendous headwind?","Michael Hartshorn","Richard, I\u2019d say it\u2019s partly a mix of new and partly a mixture of whole things that\u2019s sort of bubble up I think two main factors. First is that sort of the uncertainty in the macro economic and retail environment. I know you heard us say that before, but this year it seems to have gone off to especially what we\u2019ve done in terms of the economy. So its about [Indiscernible] proposition.","And then other is our own top multiyear comparisons. Again you heard us say that for but again if I just compare this coming quarter Q1 versus last year we\u2019re up against the 5% comp, so again, we\u2019ve to be caution there in our guidance.","Richard Jaffe","Don't begrudge you the caution. Just wondering if there are other factors. Appreciate the input. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul from Nomura. Your line is open.","Bob Drbul","Hi, good afternoon. I just have a couple of questions. I think on the geographical performance can you comment little bit on the West Coast business tied in the Texas and in the Southwest? And I just wondered if you could maybe comment on how some of the outerwear business it did throughout the quarter for you?","Michael Hartshorn","On geographic performance, Bob, as we mentioned, the Midwest continues to be our strongest region that\u2019s been true over the last eight quarters. California, our largest region also performed ahead of the same average. I think you also asked about Texas. Texas was relatively aligned with the chain on top of very strong comps last year, when it was one of our top performing regions.","Barbara Rentler","And as it pertains to outerwear, the comp below company average, you would expect based off the weather and not the similar types of retailers.","Bob Drbul","Great. And can you comment on how you plan freights for 2016 as costs going forward?","Michael Hartshorn","We do see in freight some cost increase as carrier rate increases but it\u2019s just up slightly over 2015 and so we have a plan.","Bob Drbul","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Matthew Boss","Thanks. So new store productivity in the quarter looks a little lighter than in the past where we\u2019ve seen it. Can you just talk about performance in your latest store openings versus some of the more mature stores? Are there any timing shifts which maybe could have impacted this quarter? And then just as a remainder, what comps do you guys see from new stores in the first three years versus the chain and what\u2019s the average payback period?","Michael Hartshorn","Sure. On new store productivity, there is nothing to talk about in the quarter. There is always a mix of -- whether you are opening new market stores or existing market stores. We have said in the past that the overall new store productivity has come down over the last couple years with our entry into the Midwest and also our dd's expansion. That said, you can see the Midwest continues to be our strongest comping market, as we continue to gain name recognition there. What we usually see on the comp curve is over the first five years, we comp faster than the chain and we settle into about the chain average in year five. Overall, we put about a $5 million of capital on working capital into a store and the payback\u2019s about two years.","Matthew Boss","And then just one quick follow-up on that. When we do anticipate entering the Northeast?","Michael Hartshorn","Not further while. We entered the Midwest about four years ago now and the Midwest is a fairly big region. So, we feel like we\u2019ve got plenty of opportunity to build out that region. That\u2019s probably going to keep us going certainly for the next several years, so it\u2019s going to be sometime before we enter the Northeast.","Matthew Boss","Great. Best of luck.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen from Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Oliver Chen","Hi. Congrats on a really great quarter and end of the year. Regarding the year ahead as you are making these investments in labor, what are the major corporate strategies you are thinking about in terms of in-store execution opportunities with shrink or how you may think about the ratio of tops to bottoms or other opportunities like macro-merchandising? And then I just had a question for modeling. On the basket, can we assume that merch margin, like AUR; was AUR up as merch margins were up? I\u2019m just curious about the dynamic there?","Michael Hartshorn","So, I will start with the components of comp, Oliver. As we mentioned in our prepared remarks, the 4% comp was driven by a combination of higher transactions, which for us, that\u2019s our proxy for traffic and an increase in the size of the average basket. The higher basket was driven both by higher units per transaction and AUR was up a bit as well. So all the components were up over last year and that\u2019s pretty consistent with the trend we\u2019ve seen throughout the year in 2015.","Barbara Rentler","And Oliver, as it pertains to top to bottom, we wouldn\u2019t talk about that in this form.","Oliver Chen","Okay. And what about labor and how you are staffing stores and any efficiencies that you can drive just as we think about incremental year-over-year opportunities because your execution has just been stellar? So if you are able to share with us any corporate strategies there, it would help us just eliminate how we think about your numbers next year?","Michael Hartshorn","So, Oliver, as Michael Hartshorn mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are going to be making further way for adjustments this year, including taking up a minimum hourly rate to $10 for eligible associates in the second quarter and those costs to be clear are build into our guidance. Now, as we put together, we have a very detailed and rigorous budgeting process as you might expect. And as we went through the budget for this year, we looked at lots of different areas that we could go after to try and capture efficiencies and offset some of those increased expenses, increased wage expenses.","There wasn\u2019t one big silver bullet. There were lots and lots of small savings initiatives that will add up to a lot. And it\u2019s all the things you would expect. Some of them are reengineering processes in the stores to best utilize labor hours. There is also things like looking for savings in terms of services and supply that we purchase from the outside, looking for higher productivity in our DCs, looking for opportunities to trim non-merchant G&A. So there is a whole bunch of, I would say relatively small savings opportunities that add up to a lot and have allowed us to cover the wage rate increases that Michael Hartshorn mentioned earlier.","Oliver Chen","Okay. And just finally on the merch margins. It\u2019s great that you are making progress there. What\u2019s the rationale for you being able to have that attractive view of merch margins going forward in the context of some of your conservatism about how the marketplace looks?","Michael Hartshorn","Well, let me start by talking about fourth quarter. So fourth quarter, we obviously outperformed the high end of our comp sales targets. So that meant, we had faster inventory turns resulting in lower markdowns. We also benefitted from our ability to take advantage of buying opportunities in the marketplace, so both of those factors really contributed to better than planned merchandise margin.","What we said in our guidance is that we expect merchandise margin up slightly over the year. We did operate with lower inventories throughout 2015 and ended it down 2% on an average store basis and we\u2019d expect to operate a bit lower in 2016 as well and that should drive some margin improvement.","Oliver Chen","Thank you. Best regards.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Brian Tunick from Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is open.","Brian Tunick","Thanks. I will add my congrats as well. Curios, if you look at the merchandise mix of the business this past year and then you think three years from now, what do you think would be the biggest changes, would it be home growing faster than the rest of the business, would it be gifts and beauty, just curious if there is any categories you see moving over the next couple of years from where they are today?","And then the second question, really our new customer acquisition or your marking initiatives. Anything you could share with us, if you\u2019ve done any work or studies over the last 12, 18 months about sort of where your customers are coming from or what they are saying about Ross right now? Thanks very much.","Barbara Rentler","Brian, in terms of the merchandise mix, we basically see growth in all our areas. If I had to select one area, I would say probably home would be that area. We\u2019ve seen a lot of initiatives going on in there and gifts was a big portion of our fourth quarter success in home this year. So, if I had to pick one, it would be home.","Michael Hartshorn","And then Brian, on your second piece about the customers and the new customers specifically. Add new customers, frankly looks a lot like our existing customers. As we do research on the demographics of customers and what they are looking for, the new customers demographically look very similar. What all our customers have in common, no matter what the demographics is they are all looking for great values and great bargains. So in terms of making sure that we can attract more customers and retain customers, your main focus is having the best assortments we can, the best values we can offer.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Glick with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","David Glick","Thank you. Add my congratulations. I wanted to go back to some of the differences that you were talking about 2016 and 2015. One important difference seems like -- the department store missed their plans by a much more significant margin in the fourth quarter, assuming there will be a lot more packaway opportunity as a result and then also a point back more aggressively on their receipts that they plan for 2016.","So it does feel like they are being a little more conservative with our sales and receipt plans, particularly in the second half of this year. And I\u2019m just wondering, how does that scenario play out for you guys and what are the pluses and minuses, given kind of what you see, if I characterized it correctly what you see today? Thanks.","Barbara Rentler","From the supply side, department stores have pulled back over the last couple of years in total and how they plan. But it\u2019s not about how you plan it. It\u2019s really about the sales that materialize in a rate at which you spend your receipt money. So, if you look at where the department stores ended in January, most of them ended with more inventory and clearly ended with more clearance.","And so as we enter into the spring season, one would expect that there would be a bubble of inventory that we would see in spring, which we could use to fuel in spring and back to your point on packaway that would help us drive through packaway. So it\u2019s relative to have department stores plan, as well as relative to have the vendor\u2019s plan with department stores and how much risks they are willing to take. So, we do feel there are trends.","There will be opportunities in the marketplace. As long as traditional retailers continue to perform the way they are performing, you would think that there would be more opportunities there. So from that perspective on the supply side, we feel good, which is why we are keeping ourselves liquid and feel we are well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities in the marketplace.","David Glick","And if department stores, inventories are more in line in the back half and there are always promotional, obviously. But if there are not in, as much of a liquidation type scenario as they were in the fourth quarter of 2015, how does that impact your businesses? Is that an opportunity on the merchandise margin front? I\u2019m just trying to think through what, if that\u2019s potential opportunity as well?","Barbara Rentler","So just on the back to the supply lines, sales are the key contributor to what happens of excess inventory. So, sales are not stable in the world. If you look at sales, they have been volatile and you are watching department stores drop down. So again, receipts versus sales are two different scenarios. That\u2019s what creates that bubble. In terms of margin, obviously chasing closeouts and keeping tight inventory control helps us to get better position and to improve on merchandised margins.","Michael Hartshorn","And the other thing I would say David is when it less promotional, clearly we have more price differentiation. We can offer better value that tends to be better for us. But as you look at this year, certainly the way this year has started, there are lot of sort of economic uncertainty out there who\u2019s to say whether or not the department stores are going to hit their sales plans later this year or not. Anything could happen, which is why it makes sense for us to be relatively cautious as we plan our business for the year.","David Glick","Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Appreciate the color. Good luck.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marni Shapiro from The Retail Tracker. Your line is open.","Marni Shapiro","Hi everyone. Congratulations on the quarter and on the year. I remember many, many years ago when off-prices to be the least respected space and now it\u2019s like the most coveted space out there is kind of nice. I guess I have two questions on dd\u2019s. So first is, I wasn\u2019t\u2019 sure, did you do packaway at dd\u2019s and will you break out the percent, if you do? And you have a new presence in place in dd\u2019s and the business is doing well. I guess you are opening about the same amount of stores each year. I guess what do you need to see it to take it to the next level of store openings at dd\u2019s?","Michael Hartshorn","So, thank you for your respect, Marni.","Marni Shapiro","You\u2019ve always had my respect.","Michael Hartshorn","So on dd\u2019s, couple of quick answers to early part of your question. Yes, dd\u2019s does indeed use packaway and we don\u2019t break it out just because dd\u2019s is a relatively small part of cooperation. So, we don\u2019t break out, disclose that information. On the second part of your question that what we would need to see. Actually, we are kind of already seeing it. We are pretty happy with dd\u2019s performance over the last several years. We\u2019ve kind have been in a patent here with dd\u2019s, better than expected gains and sales and profits over a few years now. We opened just over 20 new dd\u2019s stores a year, which on a base of 117 stores is quite a big growth rate. So, I don\u2019t think you should expect that we are going to ramp that up significantly. Maybe in given year, it could go up to 25 but it\u2019s not going to increase dramatically.","Our history, as you know because you have been following us for a long time is that we are relatively conservative as we grow our business, as we\u2019ve grown Ross and we will apply the same thinking as we grow dd\u2019s. So the opening stores of 25 new stores, yes probably is the right planning assumption.","Marni Shapiro","That seems fair. And I guess along the same lines as growing the organization along with the stores, Ross always had many more buyers than your largest competitor for many years, an impressive merchandising staff considering the size of the store base. How should I think about that at dd\u2019s? Has the merchandising staff and buying staff, is it much bigger relative to the size of the dd\u2019s, are you fully staffed there or is there still going to be a growing part of the business?","Michael Hartshorn","It\u2019s very much the same model, as you just described for Ross. We believe that fundamentally an enterprise of having the strongest buying team is a key competitive advantage and that applies to Ross and to dd\u2019s. So, dd\u2019s, we have invested in dd\u2019s buying team over the last several years and we\u2019ve build a very strong asset there. Actually, I didn\u2019t really answer. You asked the question earlier about Brian Morrow joining. I think enhancing and expensing the merchant leadership has also been part of the investment that we made.","Marni Shapiro","That\u2019s fantastic. Best of luck, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Baker from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Mike Baker","Hey. Thanks guys. So, I just wanted to follow-up real quickly on the wages issue, the move from $9 to $10. Could you quantify what kind of impact that will have on your total cost structure this year and how that might compare with any increase that you took in 2015?","Michael Hartshorn","We didn\u2019t quantify the impact because what we said is we have been able to substantially mitigate those costs, Michael O'Sullivan referred to before that was there were numerous cost efficiency projects then frankly no silver bullets to say which came from many different projects across many areas of the business, non-payroll and payroll related activities. So given that we\u2019ve offset them in the guidance and offset them in 2015, we haven\u2019t quantified the impact.","Mike Baker","So with all of the offsets a similar impact in 2015 versus \u201916? In other words, impacts that you can manage to offset.","Michael Hartshorn","Yes. And I would say, remember, we went to $9 last year and $10 this year, so the impact is actually larger in \u201916 than it was in \u201915.","Mike Baker","But still you are able to offset it.","Michael Hartshorn","That\u2019s right. Within the guidance, yeah.","Mike Baker","Okay. Second, just another quick one. The earnings growth -- how does it pace throughout the year? So, we see the full year. We see the first quarter. So some quarter throughout the year are going to have to be better than the first quarter and with the wage increase coming in the second half of the year, I would think that that would impact that. Then again the packaway saying is reversing, so I guess which quarter should be bigger than others in terms of earnings growth?","Michael Hartshorn","So, we only give one quarter at a time. It\u2019s really going to be driven by sales. I mean that\u2019s the impact, the biggest impact on earnings. But we wouldn\u2019t quantify the quarters until we get to the conference call previous to the quarter.","Mike Baker","Understood. Yeah, you are guiding to the same comp growth throughout the year, which is why I wanted to understand why the earnings growth would be different. But okay, I guess we can figure that out in our own model. Thanks a lot for the time.","Michael Hartshorn","Sure. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Mann from Johnson Rice. Your line is open.","David Mann","Yes. Thank you. Nice year, guys. Question or couple questions on the balance sheet. The inventory growth in the fourth quarter was only like up 3%, which was the slowest growth all year, which seems a little counterintuitive, given the abundant availability of merchandise that we all are hearing about. So, I\u2019m just curious if you can reconcile that. The reason you weren\u2019t more aggressive with -- to gain advantage of availability or we see availability maybe not as strong as we are all thinking.","Barbara Rentler","David, there is availability in the market. But as you are talking about buying packaway, there is few things involved with buying packaway. There is price. There is value. There is this -- the timing of delivery. So when we went in there and assessed what we bought, we ended at 47% versus 45%, so we were comfortable with that number and we will continue to goods as we come across using that same criteria, understanding where we believe value will go in the future.","David Mann","Okay. And then one other balance sheet item. The accounts payable leverage has been trending down all year, even though you are obviously turning the merchandise pretty fast. Michael, anything you can share on that about why that\u2019s going down and where we would think that would go perhaps in 2o16?","Michael Hartshorn","Yes. I think in 2016 it would be similar levels to this year. At year end there was a timing difference, if you recall last year we had the port disruption and as part of mitigation efforts we brought in inventory early that had brought up leverage last year, so we\u2019re up against that compare. But really it\u2019s a function of timing of receipts including packaway receipts","David Mann","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Kimberly Greenberger","Great. Thank you. I will add my congratulations on a really great fourth quarter and a fabulous year. Barbara I just wanted to follow-up on David\u2019s question regarding the 3% growth in inventory in the fourth quarter. Would the right conclusion be based on the comments that you just made that your view of where the value or where\u2019s a maybe the market price of goods is going in the short term might be down and so you were basically holding back committing to packaway goods given your cautious outlook. And then, as a result of that, your view would then be you might be able to in fact buy even more goods in the February, March, even April timeframe relative to those you could acquire in November and December, is that the right read on the situation?","Barbara Rentler","I think the way I would look at this situation is whenever we buy packaway whether with this past fourth quarter, those are the metrics we look at, price, value, timing of when we want to bring it in. so, we\u2019re just going through the same process we normally go through. So when we went out and there were goods available, we went to see \u2013 if we saw it met the criteria of where we saw we were going. And in some places you\u2019re assuming that the vendors had merchandize, they\u2019re going to move on the price, right.","So sometimes vendors move on the price based of their needs. It\u2019s the end of the quarter, end of a half. So there is a lot of variables that we can\u2019t control. The only think I can say is that we bought what we thought was appropriate. We ended with 47% versus 45%. We feel comfortable with that number. And ultimately we\u2019re only going to buy what we think is the right price. Packaway is very hard to nail down. In a quarter in [Indiscernible] there has to be, there is some art to buying packaway. You\u2019d have to feel comfortable that after you put that in there, when you go to bring that out whether its four months later or eight months later, six months later depending upon the product that the value is right.","So, there\u2019s a lot of variables that we can determine as we\u2019re out in the marketplace, but that\u2019s really what the buyers do everyday of the week. So that was really our assessment in the fourth quarter of how felt about packaway. Now, whether vendors will move off the price as we get further into the next season maybe, maybe some people will hold inventory over, I can\u2019t answer those questions for the vendors. I can only answer what we feel comfortable in doing, which is the same thing we\u2019ve done every season.","Kimberly Greenberger","Great. And just one follow-up to that, did the vendors in general seem to have a somewhat challenging 2015 including a tough Q4. Are you hearing from any of your vendors that they thought maybe there might be a change in strategy, opportunity in 2016 or its different way to approach their own inventory management. Do they reveal that information to you? And do you have any color on perhaps what maybe happening broadly among the vendor community that you might be able to share in this forum?","Barbara Rentler","Not really Kimberly, I mean, vendors aren't going to be quick to be telling us that they\u2019re going to have more or less inventory. So, its really each vendor does their own thing and so I can\u2019t really determine that, to be honest with you.","Kimberly Greenberger","Okay. Good luck here for 2016.","Barbara Rentler","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Hofkin from William Blair & Company. Your line is open.","Daniel Hofkin","Good afternoon. Great results once again. Just a couple of quick questions. So, thinking about beyond and I know you haven\u2019t given guidance for next year yet. Is it fair to say that you would likely expect further wage increases beyond this year similar to what your largest competitor has discussed? And I guess related to that what enables you beyond this year to kind of get to the low double-digit sort of normalized EPS growth given that this year\u2019s wage increases that you\u2019re offsetting them in a number of ways on SG&A? And then I have one follow-up.","Michael Hartshorn","So, Daniel as you say next year, no, we haven\u2019t release guidance for 2017 yet. But as you know, I think we\u2019ve said before that we would expect that over the next few years as the economy \u2013 or if the economy picks up, we may see more expense pressures not just us, but in general companies and retailers will face more expense pressures including high wage rates.","Obviously as we start to plan 2017 which won\u2019t be for sometime, but as we start plan 2017, we\u2019ll start to look at what are the kinds of things that we could put in place to offset those kinds of expense pressure. Too early to comment on those now, but that\u2019s the kind of process that we would go through.","Daniel Hofkin","Okay. Is there\u2019s any just big picture thing, in terms of like that allows you to get to a more normalized low double-digit EPS growth over time?","Michael Hartshorn","Well, just to be clear, I mean, we ended the year with EPS up 14% despite the wage increase on a four comps, but certainly in between a three and four comp, we think we can get to double-digit EPS growth over the longer term.","Daniel Hofkin","Okay.","Michael O'Sullivan","Its worth underlying at that point. Our guidance if here is obviously 1% to 2% comp and that\u2019s what driving the EPS guidance as Michael Hartshorn just said, at a more normalized comp, I think we\u2019ve said in the past that our long-term model includes a 3% to 4% comp. At those levels we expect low double-digit EPS growth.","Daniel Hofkin","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And then, as it relates to AUR and the slightly different trend for you versus the main competitor. Any comment there in terms of what \u2013 I know its presumably not any inflation. There\u2019s probably some mix there. But what\u2019s driving the moderately higher AUR for you guys versus the other company?","Michael Hartshorn","Yes. I mean for us it\u2019s a bit of mix, but its also we continue to operate with lower inventory levels which means we\u2019re taking less markdowns, returning faster and it has an impact on AUR you\u2019re selling at higher prices. I\u2019d say, so between those two mix and our lower markdowns is what\u2019s driving the higher AUR.","Daniel Hofkin","Very helpful. Thanks. Best of luck in the coming year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez from Citi. Your line is open.","Paul Lejuez","Hey, thanks. Just wondering as far as CapEx once you look beyond this year, is there anything lumpy we need to thinking about over the next several years that might on your radar screen that you can share with us. And also just thinking about separately, where are your customers cross shopping, which retailers do you see the most overlap with, I\u2019m curious if you look at when you see a big box department store, retailer close, what sort of a lift that you get in nearby stores if in fact you take a look at that? Thanks.","Michael Hartshorn","Paul, on capita, at least over the next couple of years they will look similar to what we said for 2016 and call it 425 to 450 range I would say, so nothing extraordinary currently in our longer \u2013 at least over the next couple of years.","A \u2013 Michael O'Sullivan","And Paul on the other two pieces of your questions. Customers, we operate in a very \u2013 we operate in a pretty large and very competitively fragmented marketplace. So, when we ask our customers, if you hadn\u2019t spend that $30 at Ross today, where would you have spent here. We get a long, long list of companies that they would have spent that money at. So, from cross shopping point of view we\u2019re competing with everyone which is why we need to make sure we have the best possible values out there. In terms of your\u2026 ","Paul Lejuez","Do you think tops that list?","Michael O'Sullivan","It depends on the particular store, the particular market that we\u2019re looking at. Nationally I think you could probably just pick our closest peers and nationally, obviously they would show up on that list. But the point I\u2019m trying to make is none of them account for a very large share of that list, that the list itself is very fragmented and spread between many, many competitors which is why we need to make sure that we\u2019re sharp versus all those competitors.","The last part of your question though big box department stores going out of business and how that affects any other individual stores? It\u2019s really hard to say because the truth is that there are lots of things that go into the business that an individual store does including traffic levels to that strip mall, the competitive intensity in that strip mall, sometime they actually having more of price competitors in that strip mall can actually be helpful. So its hard to say whether or not a large retailer nearby going out of business helps us or hurts us, it depends who replaces in that space, what happen to the traffic in that strip mall et cetera.","Paul Lejuez","Just one more, any changes in the store size for your openings next year as you manage inventory down. Just wondering if you\u2019re continuing to bring the size of the store down?","Michael O'Sullivan","Sure. So the time that we brought down our average inventory per store by about 40% over the last several years, it has presented us with a few opportunities to make the stores easier to shop, so we certainly being doing that, expand into fast growing or new categories, and again we\u2019ve been doing that. And then, as you referencing also to reduce the store size, obviously that sizeable for new stores rather than existing stores. We\u2019ve also been doing that some degree as well. So, I would say that the lower inventory levels has given us the opportunity to do a number of things with regard to the size of the store and how we use the space in the store.","Paul Lejuez","Thank you, guys. Good luck.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Roxanne Meyer from MKM Partners. Your line is open.","Roxanne Meyer","Great. Thanks. Let me add my congratulations on a terrific 4Q and full year. My question is follow-up on the home category. I know that Barbara mentioned that over the next few years she would think about home maybe presenting the best opportunity. And I\u2019m just wondering how it performed in 4Q and what opportunities you see in 2016?","Barbara Rentler","Well, home perform better than company and it was really driven by gift-giving in Q4 and the thing about the home category is so broad based. There is so many product classifications in there. When you think about it versus apparel, there is just more things to go into which is why I feel that home is a good category for us to grow.","Roxanne Meyer","Okay, great. And then just really quickly, what comp do you need in 2016 to leverage our fixed cost?","Michael Hartshorn","So what we said in the past, Roxanne, it hasn\u2019t change for 2016 that a three comp we should be able lever SG&A and four comp for occupancy cost.","Roxanne Meyer","Okay, great. Thanks. And best of luck in the first quarter.","Michael Hartshorn","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson from Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you. Good afternoon. Just wanted to clarify comment that you made earlier on the call about the rough start to the year, and just confirm that you\u2019re talking about the over the macro and not Ross specifically?","Michael Hartshorn","Yes. To be clear, I was just referring to the fact that the overall economy I think to be a number of sort of concerns and questions out there about the overall economy and we don\u2019t know to what degree that will impact retail and our business over the coming 12 months.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Great. And then as wages continue to rise, are there any investments to make in your distribution centers to maybe make them a little bit more efficient?","Michael Hartshorn","Yes. That\u2019s actually one of things as we put together the budget for this year, as you would expect one of things that we looked at were any efficiencies, any areas of the DC, any processes in the DC that would reengineer or automate and certainly that\u2019s one of the areas that we\u2019ve pursued in terms of coming up with offsetting savings. I would say, it just one of the areas. There are other areas in the company as well, such as stores, processes in stores, G&A, supply cost, et cetera, that we also look aggressively at.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Stephen Grambling","Hey, good afternoon. Just wanted to make sure I\u2019m clear on the gross margin packaway topic. This was one of the biggest swings, that\u2019s relates the impact on both of these in years, so can you just clarify some of the drivers of these factors given the absolute percentage of packaway didn\u2019t seem to move much?","Michael Hartshorn","So the absolute dollars of packaway did drop there in the quarter, Stephen, so as we talked about in the past we capital the cost to store and process packaway including fixed cost and for us we charged gross margin or charge cost of goods sold when it sells. So for us the absolute dollar value of packaway fell during the quarter which means we had to take a charge and that was greater than the previous years.","Of the 100 basis points of distribution center deleverage in the quarter all of that was related to the packaway time.","Stephen Grambling","That\u2019s helpful. And then an unrelated question, some of your peers have had some pretty good success with royalty programs, can you just remind us of your own thinking there>","Michael Hartshorn","Sure. We don\u2019t have any plans right now to launch a royalty program. We're always willing to look at new ideas. But frankly over time we found most effective way to build customer royalty with the off price customer is to consistently offer great deals, great bargains. So more than anything else, that\u2019s how we build royalty.","Stephen Grambling","Fair enough. Best of luck this year. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Stein from Northcoast Research. Your line is open.","Jeff Stein","Good afternoon, Barbara. Quick question on the junior category, that\u2019s historically been one of the stronger performing businesses for you, and no mention of it on the call, just wondering how it perform?","Barbara Rentler","Juniors performed in line with the chain average and it was up against very strong comparison from the prior year. So we\u2019ve pleased with the junior business.","Jeff Stein","Okay. And with regard to packaway, I\u2019m just kind of curious, do you still have goods in inventory from the port slowdown last year? Because I would imagine that would be some pretty high margin stuff that you could put out, now if you still have some?","Barbara Rentler","As it pertains to the mix, you're talking about the actual mix we own in our assortment. Its hard to tell. I\u2019m sorry go ahead.","Jeff Stein","No, I was going to say because -- yes, it depends on mix that you have in your packaway, so I\u2019m wondering what percent of your packaway for example might be goods that you brought during this spring and perhaps early summer last year, as result the port slowdown and how much of that might flow through your P&L during the first quarter?","Michael Hartshorn","I would say Jeff most of the core issues were really in the first quarter of last year. And given that timing, I think that would be very little that we bought that long ago that will still be in packaway.","Jeff Stein","Got it.","Michael Hartshorn","That said, the port slowdowns could have had some knock-on effects in terms of inventory that became available in subsequent quarters. Hard for us to identify and quantify that, but certainly anything that we bought in more recent quarters could well still be in our packaway balance.","Barbara Rentler","It was hard to tell us at a certain point what was coming from just business being off in the department store sector, the supply that came from there and the supply that came from the port after a while it just became one large supply.","Jeff Stein","One lump. Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I\u2019m turning the call back over to Barbara Rentler.","Barbara Rentler","Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores. Have a great day.","Operator","This concludes the conference call. You may now disconnect."],"19056":["Ross Stores, Inc.

The call will begin with prepared comments by management, followed by a question-and-answer session.","Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts and other matters that are based on the company's current forecasts of aspects of its future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today's press release and the company's fiscal 2014 Form 10-K, and fiscal 2015 Form 8-Ks, on file with the SEC.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer.","Barbara Rentler - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Balmuth, Executive Chairman; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Wong, Senior Director, Investor Relations.","We'll begin our call today with a review of our first quarter 2015 performance, followed by our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. As noted in today's press release, we are pleased with our better than expected first quarter sales and earnings. Our results continued to benefit from value-focused customers responding favorably to our fresh and exciting assortments of name brand bargains.","Earnings per share for the first quarter were $1.37, up from $1.15 in the prior year. Net earnings for the quarter grew to $282 million, compared to $244 million for the same period last year. These earnings results include a benefit of about $0:04 per share mainly from the favorable timing of packaway related costs that are expected to reverse in subsequent quarters. Adjusting for this expense timing, first quarter 2015 earnings per share rose 16% over the prior year period. Sales rose 10% for the quarter to $2.938 billion with the comparable store sales up 5% over the prior year.","Like Ross, dd's DISCOUNTS also posted better than expected gains in sales and profits for the quarter as customers continued to respond positively to the value offering. The strength in merchandise and geographic sales trends for Ross during the first quarter were relatively broad-based. Juniors continued to be the best performing category during the quarter, while the Midwest was the strongest region.","Our first quarter operating margin grew to 15.7% up from 14.6% last year. As we ended the first quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 20% over the prior year, while packaway levels were about 45% of total inventories. Average in-store inventories at the end of the first quarter were down slightly versus last year. The growth in total inventory reflects our ability to take advantage of increased close-out availability, a portion of which is from the ongoing West Coast port disruption. In addition, we increased inbound in-transit inventories to mitigate longer lead times from this situation.","Let's turn now to our expansion program. Store growth remains on track with 32 new Ross and five dd's DISCOUNTS opening in the first quarter. For fiscal 2015, we continue to plan for about 70 new Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. As usual these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores.","Now, Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our first quarter results and details on our second quarter guidance.","Michael J. Hartshorn - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Thank you, Barbara.","Let's start with our first quarter results. Our 5% comparable store sales gains was driven by a combination of higher transactions and an increase in the size of the average basket. As Barbara noted, first quarter operating margins grew to 15.7%, up from 14.6% last year. Cost of goods sold improved by 80 basis points driven primarily by a 60-basis-point improvement in merchandise gross margins and 5 basis points of leverage on occupancy. In addition, distribution center costs were lower by 25 basis points due to the previously mentioned favorable timing of packaway-related costs. These improvements were partially offset by a 10-basis-point increase in freight costs.","Selling, general and administrative expenses improved by about 25 basis points during the period, mainly from leverage on the 5% same-store sales increase. During the first quarter, we repurchased 1.7 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $176 million. As planned, we expect to buy back a total of $700 million in stock for the year under the new two-year $1.4 billion stock repurchase program approved by our board of directors in February 2015.","Let's turn now to our second quarter and updated full year guidance. For the 13 weeks ending August 1, 2015, same-store sales are forecast to increase 2% to 3% with earnings per share projected to be in the range of $1.19 to $1.24, up from $1.14 in the prior-year period. Adjusting for our recently announced two-for-one stock split that becomes effective June 11, 2015, second quarter 2015 EPS is forecast to be $0.59 to $0.62, up from $0.57 in the prior-year period.","The operating statement assumptions for this year's second quarter are as follows. Total sales are projected to grow 6% to 7% on a comparable store sales increase of 2% to 3%. We are planning to add 18 new Ross and eight dd's DISCOUNTS locations during the period. Operating margin is projected to be 13.6% to 13.8% versus 14.3% in the prior year. As a reminder, the second quarter last year included a one-time benefit of approximately 20 basis points from the favorable resolution of an outstanding legal matter.","We are forecasting a slight increase in merchandise margins for this year's second quarter that is expected to be more than offset by higher cost from recent infrastructure investments including the opening of a new distribution center in California during the quarter. In addition, we expect some de-leveraging on expenses from higher wage costs. Net interest expense is estimated to be $2 million. Our tax rate is planned at 37% to 38%. And we expect average diluted shares outstanding before the effect of our recently announced two-for-one stock split to be about 205 million or 410 million post split.","Moving to our outlook for the full year. As mentioned in today's press release, based on our first quarter results and second quarter guidance, we now project earnings per share for fiscal 2015 to be in the range of $4.72 to $4.87 compared to our initial guidance of $4.60 to $4.80. On a split adjusted basis, earnings per share are forecasted to be $2.36 to $2.44, up 7% to 10% from $2.21 in fiscal 2014. Lastly, we will be making competitive wage adjustments beginning in the second quarter that are included in both our second quarter and updated annual earnings guidance.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments.","Barbara Rentler - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Michael.","As mentioned earlier, we are pleased with our solid start to the year. For the balance of 2015 and beyond, we remain confident in our ability to successfully execute the strategies that have enabled us to deliver solid financial results over the past several years. Our top priority remains providing the most compelling value as possible to our customers. The best way to accomplish this is by continuing to make strategic investments in our buying organization. We believe this unwavering focus combined with our ability to tightly control both in-store inventories and expenses will enable us to show respectable sales and earnings growth over both the near and the long term.","At this point, we would like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator",". Your first question is from Ike Boruchow with Sterne, Agee.","Ike B. Boruchow - Sterne Agee CRT","Hi everyone and congrats on a great quarter and thanks for taking my question. I guess Michael maybe for you, to talk about the merchandise margin line, I mean just you guys are putting up some very impressive numbers there, is that more a function of less markdown and less clearance in the store, it is more a function of just the merchants getting better buys, can you add some more color there for us?","Michael J. Hartshorn - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Ike, the margin improvement was really a combination of both. We did operate the business with lower inventories during quarters that helped us have more full-price selling. In addition, we had some pretty good buys in the quarter.","Ike B. Boruchow - Sterne Agee CRT","Okay, great. Congrats.","Operator","Your next question is from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, great quarter, guys. So, understanding there is a lot of noise in the retail landscape today, can you guys just kind of elaborate on some of the drivers between the more recent 4% to 6% comps that you are seeing today versus your multi-year 3% to 3.5% base case run-rate?","Michael B. O'Sullivan - Co-President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Sure Matthew, it's Michael O'Sullivan, I will answer that. We have been very pleased with our performance over the last few quarters, but there are few reasons to be a little bit conservative as we look forward. Firstly, we think the macroeconomic and retail outlook remains pretty uncertain. You see that and you get a sense of that in the recent results that have been announced by other retailers.","Actually that feeds into a second concern which is those results themselves may cause the environment to become more promotional over the next few months. And then the third reason for conservatism is that we're up against our own tough multi-year comparisons. Now those of you who had followed us for some time will know that this is straight from our playbook. In an uncertain environment, it makes sense for us to manage the business conservatively. If the markets promote \u2013 weak or promotional, we can protect earnings and if the sales trend is there, we can chase the business.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, best of luck.","Barbara Rentler - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Randy Konik with Jefferies.","Randal J. Konik - Jefferies LLC","Great, thanks a lot. I guess, Barbara, can you talk a little bit about the different long-term investments you want to make in the buying organization, what areas do you think you need more kind of bulk in or what have you and why? And then as it relates to just dd's, kind of what do you say \u2013 how should we just be thinking about the long-term economic model from here versus how you are thinking about the different profit \u2013 obviously the great profit margins you are able to put up in the Ross Stores, I am just curious how we should be thinking differently or the same about the dd's economic model long term from here. Thanks.","Barbara Rentler - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Randy, do me a favor, just repeat on the first part where you said the long-term investment more, I missed the word you said.","Randal J. Konik - Jefferies LLC","I am sorry, just in the buying organization, just like what areas, you talked about kind of adding to it, what areas do you really want to focus on and why and then just the second question was more around the long-term economic model around dd's concept. Thanks.","Barbara Rentler - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I would say from a merchandise perspective, it's very broad-based. Our total business is very broad-based. We've been pleased with some of the progress and things that we made in some of our core businesses like home. Our junior business continues to be good but overall, our total business is pretty broad-based and that is kind of how we're approaching it for the future. At this point in time, I would say if I had to select one particular area, I would say, it would be the continued investment in our home business. As it pertains to big dd's, on the longer term basis, Michael economically...","Michael B. O'Sullivan - Co-President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Sure. So, as was mentioned in the earlier remarks, Randy, dd's posted better than expected gains in sales and profits for the quarter. That's been a common theme actually over the last couple of years, dd's achieving good sales and profit improvements driven by frankly pretty similar actions to those that we've taken at Ross, particularly tight control of inventories and expenses. At this point, dd's has very similar four wall economics to Ross. So, as we look out over the longer term, we're very confident with the dd's business model. Well, we opened just over 20 dd's stores in 2014. We're going to open a similar number of new dd's stores this year. And as we described before, we expect dd's can be a chain of about 500 stores.","Operator","The next question is from Daniel Hofkin with William Blair & Company.","Daniel H. Hofkin - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.","Good afternoon, great quarter. Just wanted to understand a little bit, so you said roughly of $0.04 benefit from the packaway timing, can you just explain a little bit how that works and also the math on getting from that to the 25 basis points in gross margin, was there something else within SG&A that wasn't specifically quantified, just a little color on that would be helpful?","Michael J. Hartshorn - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Sure, Dan, it's Michael. So, for packaway, we capitalized cost per tier store in process packaway merchandising and that includes fixed costs. So, we capitalize until those items are sold. When sold, we charge those to expenses of cost of goods sold. So in a period of rising packaway levels, the higher capitalization means is a benefit to earnings. This year packaway levels increased during the first quarter versus last year when they declined. In terms of impact that $0.04 is worth about 45 basis points of favorability to the quarter. And Daniel, you referred to G&A, but our DC costs are in our gross margin line.","Daniel H. Hofkin - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.","Okay, maybe, I didn't. Okay, so the 25-basis-point favor \u2013 I thought you said 25-basis-point favorability on the DC, did that include the 45 basis points within that so to speak?","Michael J. Hartshorn - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","It does and what it means is the distributions center costs without the packaway would have de-levered and that's given the opening of the new DC in the middle of last year.","Daniel H. Hofkin - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.","Okay. Is that basically the unit cap? Is that kind of another \u2013 is that the same thing when people talk about the unit cap method?","Michael J. Hartshorn - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Yes, yes. Yes, that's a good way to look at it. Unit cap is really for tax purposes, but it's the same concept.","Daniel H. Hofkin - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.","Okay and then just one follow up if I could. So, did you feel like or there is anything where you saw over the course of the quarter a change in trend to the upside or anything where you could point to benefits from on the sales side or the cost of goods sold side from the port issues so far?","Michael J. Hartshorn - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","In terms of trend for the quarter, Dan, comp trends were steady throughout. After adjusting for the impact of the Easter shift which fell two weeks earlier this year, there was not a meaningful disparity in trends either from a margin or sales standpoint.","Daniel H. Hofkin - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.","Okay, great. Thanks, best of luck.","Barbara Rentler - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey good afternoon. Could you give us a little bit of better sense of the wage increase and how this potentially changes the SGA leverage point? Maybe not only this year, but perhaps over the next 18 months?","Michael B. O'Sullivan - Co-President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. Stephen, on the first part of it, what are we planning to do on wages, we've mentioned on the call in February that we expected to see more wage rate pressure this year and that we would be making adjustments to keep wage rates competitive. One of the adjustments we will be making in the second quarter is to raise our minimum entry level hourly rate to $9 and that adjustment together with any offsets is built into the earnings guidance.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And then in terms of...","Michael B. O'Sullivan - Co-President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","You had a second question on (18:57).","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, just in the terms of the leverage point, does this change that leverage point longer term?","Michael B. O'Sullivan - Co-President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","I would say now Stephen as we look through fiscal 2015 we're working to offset those costs, so the leverage point would be the same and going forward, it's a little bit of an open book as to what municipalities are going to do with their wage rates at this point.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then maybe taking a step back, certainly there has been a lot of new competition and testing from some of the peers, how do you think about the primary competitive advantages that the Ross model and maybe if you rank kind of scale, buying, supply chain for us? Thanks.","Michael B. O'Sullivan - Co-President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","So, we operate in a very competitive and fragmented market. We're always expecting that there is going to be competitors or new entrants that are trying to capture share. And frankly, we wish them the best of luck, but we know that with our off-price model, when it's executed well, we can compete very effectively against all comers. So there is no single competitor or new entrant that we are worried about. As long as we offer great branded merchandise at terrific discounts, we're going to do just fine.","Barbara Rentler - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Stephen, I would also add that we're well positioned. We have a buying team, buying organization of 700 merchants. So this is our core business and we've made a strategic investment over the years to build that team to be able to compete in all types of environments.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Sounds great. Well, best of luck.","Barbara Rentler - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to follow up on the inventory increase in your packaway. Is most of that product that will be flowing through the stores over the next couple of quarters or will we wait to see it coming through next spring and I guess just specifically how that relates to the $0.04 of cost coming through the COGS line?","Michael J. Hartshorn - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Lorraine, on packaway, obviously it varies by merchandise categories, it's hard to predict what availability will look like over the remainder of the year. We view packaway as the topline driver that represents some of the best values for the customer. Our guidance assumes that the additional packaway we had in the first quarter would flow to the store through the balance of the year and that's also reflective of our guidance on the packaway trend.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC","Hi, thanks, congrats on really solid results. As we look forward to the comp going forward, do you feel like it will also be split by transaction and size of the basket? And also related to the inventory build, can you contextualize for us, was this in line with kind of your expectations or did you witness more bargains than you expected with the dislocation, I'm just curious about the context of the rising inventories and how that happened strategically and competitively relative to your actions? Thanks.","Michael J. Hartshorn - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","On the inventory, as we mentioned in the remarks, there are really two factors that drove the inventory increase. The first is higher packaway inventory as we're able to take advantage of the increased close out availability. A portion of that was related to the port disruption. That piece was harder to predict and we take advantage of what the market gives us. And in terms of the other piece which is the inbound in-transit levels, that was our efforts to mitigate the longer port lead times. And we plan to do that as we'll continue to watch the port, there is still longer lead times and we'll continue to mitigate that with higher in-transit levels. And higher in-transit levels that means we're putting stuff imports on the water earlier or trying to ship around the West Coast port.","Michael B. O'Sullivan - Co-President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","The other sort of key inventory metric to look at is average in-store inventory, and as Barbara mentioned in her remarks that was down slightly versus last year. And what that tells you is that our in-store inventory is pretty fresh and is in pretty good shape. With 5% comp, we were able to achieve higher turns, which is one of the contributors to the high margin.","Michael J. Hartshorn - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Oliver, your other question on the components of sales, we have no reason to believe that, that trend will change.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. And the final question \u2013 sorry go ahead.","Barbara Rentler - Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, I just wanted to add on the packaway, part of what drives that number is really the great deals that we've gotten in the marketplace. Between the port dislocation and mixed sales results in Q1, there was a lot of availability. So, we feel very good about the packaway that we have, it's branded products at really great values that our customers expect, so we feel like it's a very good thing for us.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC","Got it and just a final question, you've had such stellar execution throughout the year and last year in holiday and back-to-school, so do you have any initial thoughts on your inventory flow versus last year and gifting initiatives versus last year as you anniversary your own outstanding performance.","Barbara Rentler - Chief Executive Officer & Director","From the giftings perspective, we were very happy with what happened in gifting last year, but we feel that we haven't maximized that business yet. So, that is one of the things in the fourth quarter that we will be focused on. Last year, we expanded into some new classifications. We tested some new classifications. So, we feel that we have a lot of room to grow in the fourth quarter. We recognize that we're up against some very big numbers. In terms of inventory flow, you mean just literally how the goods will flow, just trying to make sure I understand the question?","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC","Yeah, and that was very helpful with categories and you also mentioned home in your earlier remarks. Is that something that is an opportunity for you? I guess I am asking as you post game holiday from last year if you feel there were any elements that we should think about that's lower-hanging fruit as you approach it this year.","Barbara Rentler - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I don't know if I think there is anything that's low-hanging fruit but what I would say is that we obviously don't feel like we've maximized those businesses. Our home business has been getting progressively better over the last few quarter and for competitive reasons we wouldn't talk too much about it, but what I would say is, again, we tested a lot of classifications and we do that every year in an effort to increase the treasure hunt, drive sales, give the customer a better experience and so we feel that we can anniversary those numbers.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC","Thank you. Congrats and best regards.","Barbara Rentler - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. I just wanted to ask, if I could, about the promotional environment you talked about, I think you were referring to potentially it being more promotional but is that in reference to anything you're seeing? And I can just tell you one thing, we're monitoring is department store inventories which are up about 4% year-over-year higher than they have been over the last couple quarters, so is that giving you guys any pause to think that the promotional environment might be a little bit more intense over the coming quarters? Thanks.","Barbara Rentler - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, we do believe that promotional environment in Q2 will be much more aggressive than it was in Q1 based off the mixed sales results.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Right, okay and so that was presumably in your guidance for the second quarter. Is that something that is also contemplated in the guidance for the full year?","Michael J. Hartshorn - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","It is, Mike.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thanks. Appreciate the color.","Barbara Rentler - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Laura Champine with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Laura Champine - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Good afternoon. Congratulations on out-performing your peer group again. My questions is really if you can update us on new store economics, on the new storage you're building this year for Ross and dd, how much do those cost, what do you think you will see in first year sales and what are the cash-on-cash returns from those new stores?","Michael J. Hartshorn - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Sure. In terms of the earnings, Laura, it hasn't changed quite that much. Our CapEx is probably, given the mix of whether we take on a property we have to improve or whether we get a store that's' already build out, on average it's about $1.5 million, working capital and other about $200,000.","So if you take those economics we get in our new stores, a lower volume than our existing base as one would assume and as we roll out dd's a little more aggressively and enter new markets, the average store volumes are probably in the 60%s. You do that math, you get in-store returns in the mid-teens, you get a cash on cash return of right around two years.","Laura Champine - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Bob Drbul with Nomura.","Karyn O'Brien - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hi, good afternoon. This is Karyn O'Brien filling in for Bob. Thanks for taking my question. I was just curious, have you guys seen any material effect or under performance in the regions more sensitive to the oil industry. You mentioned last quarter that you hadn't but just curious if you've seen any changes there?","Michael J. Hartshorn - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","This is Michael. I'll answer that in terms of regional performance. As we mentioned on the call, the Midwest was the top-performing region and that's been the case for the last year. In terms of our larger markets which includes Texas. Texas and Florida were slightly above the chain and California our largest market was in line with the chain.","Karyn O'Brien - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question is from Jeff Stein with Northcoast Research.","Jeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Yes, just a follow-up on that prior question, within Texas, and I can't remember if you have dd's location in Texas, and if you do, have those locations performed any differently than the Ross locations within Texas?","Michael J. Hartshorn - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","No, they haven't, Jeff.","Jeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Okay. And I can't recall, I don't think you mentioned, did home underperform, performed in line or outperformed apparel during the quarter?","Michael J. Hartshorn - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Home was slightly ahead of the chain average.","Jeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Slightly ahead. Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Patrick McKeever with MKM Partners.","Patrick G. McKeever - MKM Partners LLC","Thanks. Hi, everyone. Question on the website and what you're doing with social media. Looks like there's been a recent redesign of the website. I could be wrong but looks different to me. So is that the case? And then with marketing, maybe you could talk through what you're doing with social media, Facebook and Pinterest and those kinds of things and do you feel like what you're doing is having much of an impact on the business, particularly the juniors business which continues to be very strong.","Michael J. Hartshorn - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Sure. So, Patrick, a few years ago we started experimenting with social media and now we actually we do allocate a portion of our marketing budget to those kind of media and we've been pretty happy with the results. I think we expect to see more of that overtime. What we like about social media is that the best marketing for us has always been word of mouth marketing; the customer finds a great bargain at Ross and then tells all their friends about it and social media provides a way to stimulate that but to do it more extensively. So yes, so social medial is definitely something we plan to do more of.","Patrick G. McKeever - MKM Partners LLC","And the website, is that a redesign.","Michael J. Hartshorn - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Yes. We recently redesigned the website and we do that periodically every couple years.","Patrick G. McKeever - MKM Partners LLC","Okay and then just, I know we're talking one or two stores, but with some of the announcements that have come out of some of the department stores, including Macy's and I guess today there's talk about Kohl's opening sort of maybe not off-price concept but some kind of a concept smaller store with deeply discounted product. So the question is, as you think about that becoming perhaps a bigger part of retailing, some of the bigger players getting into off-price or opportunistic buying and merchandising, is that a concern?","Michael J. Hartshorn - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","I think that we're happy if people want to grow the off-price category. If they want to grow the share of the off-price segment probably at the expense of other retail formats, that would be fine. But we actually have \u2013 we think we have quite a strong skill set and set of capabilities that put us in a pretty strong position and we've always operated in a very competitive environment. We never take the customer for granted and we know that if we can execute well on our price model and deliver great bargain to the customer, we'll do well no matter who the competition is.","Patrick G. McKeever - MKM Partners LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator : The next question is from Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thank you. I'll add my congratulations to a really terrific quarter, I'm wondering if you could help us with order of magnitude either on the transaction increase driving your comp or the average dollar sales, whether it's equally split or was one a bigger driver of the quarterly comp?","Michael J. Hartshorn - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Kimberly, as we motioned, the 5% comp was transactions which is our proxy for traffic and also an increase in the basket. Between those two it was fairly equal. The basket increase was mostly driven by units per transaction, but AUR was up just slightly.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay excellent. And then I'm wondering if you can talk about the cadence of wage increases that you're looking to make. Michael, you obviously talked about the move to $9 here in the second quarter. Are you contemplating a move in 2016 to $10 or how are you thinking about the wage environment?","Michael J. Hartshorn - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Sure. So we think the labor market is fairly dynamic certainly on a market-by-market basis. So we prefer to make wage rate decisions on a closer-in basis based upon what we're seeing in terms of market trends. As we've said before, though, we expect wage rates are going to move up over the next few years. I think you're seeing that in the press almost every day. So it's certainly something that we expect that we're going to be talking more about as we get into our budget for 2016 and our longer term plans and certainly when we talk about our earnings guidance next February, my guess it will be part of that discussion too. But I should say that although we're expecting wage rate pressure, two things: first of all, we're pretty confident that overtime we'll be able to find efficiencies in our business to offset some of those cost increases; and secondly, there is a silver lining here in that the customer has more money in their pocket because of higher wage rates that could well help our top line as well.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Terrific. My last question is just on the $0.04 benefit here in Q1, it sounded like you're expecting the pack-away to be sold throughout the next three quarters of the year. Does that mean that the $0.04 benefit here in Q1 just gradually runs through the cost of goods line in Q2, Q3, Q4? Is that how we should think about it?","Michael J. Hartshorn - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Kimberly, yes, at this point packaway for us is really hard to predict. It's based on what's available in the market, but our guidance assumes that it was throughout the remainder of the year.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thank you so much and good luck for Q2?","Barbara Rentler - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Anne-Charlotte Windal with Bernstein.","Anne-Charlotte Windal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. Thank you. I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on the traffic trends you're seeing and what type of order of magnitude are you seeing in terms of increase in traffic. And then if you could also elaborate a little bit on any type of traffic-driving initiatives that you are either implementing right now or looking forward to implementing during the balance of the year so from a marketing standpoint? Thank you.","Michael B. O'Sullivan - Co-President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","As we mentioned on traffic, what we said was about half of the flat comp was traffic.","Michael J. Hartshorn - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","In terms of initiatives to drive traffic, I think I would say our approach is the same as it ever was. You've heard us say this before, the most effective way for us to drive traffic is to have great bargains in the store. That means the customer will show up and through word of mouth more customers will show up. So there is nothing new that we're going to doing that's different to drive traffic. It's more of the same that focus on value.","Anne-Charlotte Windal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Marni Shapiro with Retail Tracker.","Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker","Hey, guys, fantastic quarter. I'm sorry if I missed this. I've been hopping on a few calls, but you have a great temporary leader in place for dd's and I was curious what kind of changes or things that are happening there that you're implementing that you've seen any traction with. And also along the lines dd's, are you seeing traffic to that website and is it getting any consistency?","Michael J. Hartshorn - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Sure, so on dd's first all, we certainly are making some improvements and changes at dd's. But that's a business that \u2013 we're pretty happy with how dd's has been performing over the past several quarter. And so we're very confident in the long-term future of that business, so I don't think there is anything I would call out at this point in terms of changes that we're making. In terms of the website, the website really is informational. We don't have an e-commerce business. We do track traffic to our website and overtime we've seen a growth in that traffic. But it is \u2013 I want to be clear, it is an informational website rather than a e-commerce business.","Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker","Right. Are you seeing increased traffic? Is the brand building more awareness at all?","Michael J. Hartshorn - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","On dd's specifically.","Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker","Yes, dd's.","Michael J. Hartshorn - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","So yes dd's growth of traffic both to the website, the Facebook page and other areas of social media we've seen quite a significant growth in traffic targeting dd's across those different media.","Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker","Fantastic. And then just one follow up also on dd's. As you go to the market for dd's merchandise, are you able to leverage the Ross power? Are you going in there and saying, look, this is Ross's little sister and potentially bigger sister who knows, but this is Ross's little sister and is that helping you to gain access to brands that maybe you might not have had access to?","Barbara Rentler - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would say a little. On occasion where we think it's appropriate for the two teams to travel together, they will travel together, but overall really dd's at this point at 150 some odd stores. We have a pretty big pencil and they go out and they shop different resources, different vendors and they do it on their own, but there is some slight overlap.","Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker","Fantastic. Best of luck for the summer season. Thanks, guys.","Barbara Rentler - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions.

Joining me on our call today are Michael Balmuth, Executive Chairman; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Group Senior VP and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Senior Director of Investor Relations.","We'll begin our call today with a review of our third quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the fourth quarter. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. As noted in today's press release, we are pleased with the better than expected sales and earnings growth we achieved in the third quarter. These results demonstrate that customers continue to respond positively to the wide assortments of fresh and exciting bargains we offer throughout our stores. ","Earnings per share for the third quarter grew 15% to $0.53 on net earnings that rose 12% to $216 million. Sales increased 7% to $2.783 billion with comparable store sales up 3% on top of last year's 4% gain. For the first nine months of fiscal 2015 earnings per share grew 15% to $1.85 while net earnings rose 12% to $757 million. Year-to-date sales increased 8% to $8.689 billion with comparable store sales up 4%. dd's also posted better than expected gains in sales and profits for the quarter and year to date period. Mens was the strongest category at Ross during the quarter while the Midwest was the top performing region. ","Third quarter operating margin increased 30 basis points to 12.1%. These results were above planned and primarily driven by higher merchandise margins. As we ended the quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 14% over the prior year with packaway levels at 48% of total inventories compared to 42% last year. Average in-store inventories at quarter-end were down approximately 1% versus last year. As planned we completed our 2015 store opening program during the third quarter with the addition of 19 Ross and 7 dd's Discount locations for grand total of 84 new stores this year net of closure. We expect to end fiscal 2015 with 1,274 Ross and 172 dd's Discount stores. ","Now, Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our third quarter results and details on our guidance for the fourth quarter and the year. ","Michael Hartshorn","Thank you, Barbara. Let's start with our third quarter results. Our 3% comparable store sales gain was driven by a combination of higher traffic and an increase in the size of the average baskets. As Barbara mentioned, third quarter operating margin was better than planned, rising 30 basis points from last year to 12.1%. Cost of goods sold was declined 45 basis points driven by a 45 basis points increased in merchandise margins and 5 basis points improvement each in freight and buying cost. This was partially offset by 10 basis point increase in distribution expenses related to recent infrastructure investment that were partially offset by the favorable timing of packaway related cost. Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period increased by about 15 basis points due impart the higher way wages.","During the quarter, we've repurchased 3.6 million shares of common stock for total purchase price of $179 million. Year-to-date we have bought back a total of 10.4 million shares for an aggregate price of $530 million. We remain on track to repurchase a total of $700 million in common stock for the year under the two-year $1.4 billion stock repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in February of this year.","Let's turn now to our fourth quarter guidance which remains unchanged from what we\u2019ve communicated in August. For the 13 weeks ending January 30, 2016, we continue to expect same-store sales to be flat to up 1% on top of a strong 6% gain last year, with earnings per share projected to be $0.60 to $0.63 compared to $0.60 last year. The operating statement assumptions for our fourth quarter guidance include the following; total sales are forecast to grow 4% to 5% on the previously mentioned comparable store sales forecast of flat to up 1%. If sales perform in line with this guidance, operating margin is projected to be 12.6% to 12.8% versus 13.1% in the prior year.","The forecasted decline versus last year is mainly due to our expectations for higher distribution expenses from recent infrastructure investments and the timing of packaway related costs. Net interest expense is estimated to be about $5 million. Our tax rate is planned at approximately 37% to 38%. And we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 403 million. Based on this guidance we now project earnings per share for the full year to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.48, up 11% to 12% over $2.21 in fiscal 2014.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments.","Barbara Rentler","Thank you, Michael. As we enter the fourth quarter we are pleased with our fresh and exciting assortments of name, brands, bargains and gifts for this holiday season. Despite outperforming our sales and earnings targets throughout 2015, there are number of factors that still cause us to be cautious when forecasting the fourth quarter. First, we are up against our toughest sales comparison of the year. A Michael mentioned, comparable store sales in last year\u2019s fourth quarter were up a robust 6%. Second, there is ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment and third, based on the current retail landscape we expect the upcoming holiday season to be highly promotional.","As a result, while we always hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to maintain a conservative posture. Over the longer term, we remain confident about our prospects for respectable sales and earnings growth. This is based on two key factor, our believe that off price will remain a strong performing segment especially during consumers ongoing focus on value and our own proven ability to offer our customers compelling bargains on an everyday basis. This is and always will be the key to the success in our business.","At this point, we like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.","Ike Boruchow","I guess my question -- I wanted to focus on the packaway number 48% of inventory, it seems like it\u2019s the highest it's been in about two years give or take. Just kind of curious your view of the environment -- the buying environment out there, it sounds like a lot of vendors are cancelling orders and the department stores aren\u2019t doing so well. Just your view of the environment and your packaway strategy and how you look at that right now?","Barbara Rentler","Well the buying environment, we continue to be a really strong supply of excess goods in the marketplace. As it pertains to packaway, packaway is typically the best bargains we carry on merchandise. We go in the market, we see what\u2019s available, we see what the great deals are and then we go in and pack it away. So we don\u2019t focus so much on the number itself. Ike, what we focus on is the value and the brands that we can offer the customer.","Operator","Your next question is from Paul Lejuez with Citi Research.","Paul Lejuez","Could you maybe talk a little bit more, give us more detail on regional performance specifically Texas and the oil impacted markets and also curious just higher level loss versus dd\u2019s and then also the performance of those two within those Texas and other oil mid-markets? Thanks.","Michael Hartshorn","This is Michael Hartshorn, the sales performance was fairly broad-based across regions as we mentioned the Midwest was our strongest region which has been true over the past seven quarters, California our largest region performed in line with the chain and then as far as Texas, Texas was in line with the chain average for the quarter.","Paul Lejuez","[Multiple Speakers] versus dd\u2019s?","Michael Hartshorn","Your question about dd\u2019s, as Barbara mentioned in her remarks we posted better than expected sales in profits. We don\u2019t typically break dd\u2019s down to a regional level, but overall we were very happy with dd\u2019s performance. ","Paul Lejuez","Got you. Michael, you\u2019ve had pretty positive to say about dd\u2019s for several quarters now. Are you at a point where you might feel more comfortable accelerating the growth of that concept beyond doing let\u2019s say in the low 20s per year. Can that be accelerated as we think about next year?","Michael Hartshorn","I think it\u2019s unlikely. We feel that for several years we\u2019ve been very happy with how dd\u2019s business developed and we feel very good about the business over the longer term. But we open as you said just over 20 stores a year at dd\u2019s but chain is now run about 170 stores. So 20 stores a year on a base of 170 is still relatively large incremental addition every year. So we think it\u2019s likely that it will in that ballpark, 20 to 25 stores a year.","Paul Lejuez","Got you. And just piggyback one, last one of off Ike\u2019s question. On the packaway merchandise, can you talk about the performance of that product, are you seeing let\u2019s in this most recent quarter, is it meeting your sales and merch margin expectations? That\u2019s it from me, thanks.","Barbara Rentler","Well packaway physically represents the best bargains we have so we feel that in third quarter this merchandise likely benefited sales and we expect it to help our sales in the fourth quarter as well.","Operator","Your next question is from Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Greenberger","Great, thank you. I will add my congratulations to a very fine quarter. I wanted to just follow up quickly on Paul\u2019s question on packaway. I think that packaway is probably a more broadly used term in Ross than maybe some of the other appraisers [ph]. Can you just confirm the composition of packaway, is it strictly goods that are shipped off and put into your packaway warehouse or do you also consider packaway goods that are sitting ready for the current season distribution to stores that are maybe partially already distributed in the current season, in other words goods in a variety of distribution centers and not necessarily shipped off in stores for six months, that the bigger representation of the product that you\u2019ve got held in your distribution center, does that make sense?","Barbara Rentler","More than likely, I think.","Michael O'Sullivan","Let me have a crack at it Kimberly, packaway, we think that packaway has good aftersales, they are packed away in our warehouse is to be released for sale in subsequent months or even next season. So I don\u2019t know if that helps, yes, does that answer your question? ","Kimberly Greenberger","It does. Are there examples where you actually have a current season order, you partially distribute let\u2019s say 70% of the goods to existing stores, help hold back 30% of your distribution centers an example, and then use that to fill in based on fill trends, would you consider that 30% that you hold back part of your packaway or would that be just inventory in the distribution center that you would not put in you packaway, in your packaway calculation?","Michael O'Sullivan","As long as they haven\u2019t been released for sale we treat as packaway. Once it is released for sales, then it counts as part of our selling store inventory.","Kimberly Greenberger","Sorry Michael go ahead.","Michael O'Sullivan","I was just going to make a point that I guess in Barbara's remarks she broke out total inventory. So the way to think about it is our total inventories are up 14%, add selling store inventory the inventory that\u2019s actually in the store for sale were down slightly, that\u2019s a key metric for us because with a 3% comp and within store inventory down slightly that means that we are getting top returns and better merchandise margin.","Kimberly Greenberger","Okay, great. So if I should divide your total inventory bucket, there is a piece of it that\u2019s in-store and the other piece that it does packaway. Is there a third bucket of inventory that would be neither considered in store or packaway that you would classify?","Michael O'Sullivan","Yes, Kimberly so there is a couple of buckets. You mentioned there is packaway inventory, there is store inventory and there is also in-transit inventory on the way to the distribution center. As we mentioned total inventory was up 14% and packaway was up at 48% of total inventories. In-transit inventory for us was actually down versus last year because we are up against the start of our mitigation efforts because of the slowdown in the quarter. So those are the primary three buckets.","Kimberly Greenberger","Okay. So anything that\u2019s in your distribution center that is not available for sale would be included in the packaway bucket.","Michael O'Sullivan","I will try, anything else in our distribution center is on its way to -- it\u2019s been processed on its way out the door. And that would not forward would not count as packaway.","Kimberly Greenberger","Okay. Great. So as I think about the wage increase, this is a first quarter really where we\u2019ve had any -- this is the first full quarter I think of the wage increase. I think you said in your prepared remarks of the 15 basis points increase in SG&A, it was largely driven by wages. Michael, I am wondering if you can just give us was it the majority, was it the full piece and were there any other moving parts in the SG&A?","Michael O'Sullivan","The primary difference and the reason we called out wages is typically we'd say 3% is our leverage point and that as there is always timing differences from quarter-to-quarter. A part of that deleverage was due to wages and there is some other timing differences that were not as meaningful longer term we still believe that we can lever at the 3% constantly.","Kimberly Greenberger","Would that your expectation in 2016 as well just given the wage increases that we have going through that I guess up probably 3% comp you would be able to leverage?","Michael O'Sullivan","Yes I mean it's a good question we are obviously in the midst of our budget cycle today and would expect to be able to provide some more color on the fourth quarter call. As we have previously mentioned we took our minimum wage up to $9 across the chain this year and those adjustments along with any offsets are included in our guidance this year for 11% and 12% EPS growth. We do view the labor markets as dynamic we think as the economy improves over the next couple of years there will be additional wage pressure out there but like this year we will do our work and where we can we will find efficiency throughout our business to attempt to mitigate the impact of any cost pressures we have in our business.","Kimberly Greenberger","And do you think there is a possibility that part of your traffic increase is actually that some of the consumers who shop at Ross Stores are seeing the benefit of some of those wage increases or is it very difficult for you to sort of draw that loop and come to that conclusion?","Michael Hartshorn","It\u2019s the later Kimberly. Conceptually we think if the customer has more money in their pockets that's a good thing for us. But very hard for us to sort of dissect that and split it out in terms of to what degree that\u2019s driving our comp [ph].","Kimberly Greenberger","Understood. Great quarter and good luck to you for the holiday.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Binetti from UBS.","Michael Binetti","Hey guys congrats on a great quarter. I think as you look ahead to 2016 you said you think you can hold the 3% leverage point. There is obviously the well documented labor inflation that you guys have already starting to get into or the full year than next year, maybe some more. Do you have merchandize margin room on your side to offset that top side margin compression this year or how should we think about merchandize margin as one of the leverage do you have to toggle next year?","Michael Hartshorn","I think at this point Michael will be in a better position to answer questions on 2016 in our fourth quarter call.","Michael Binetti","Okay. Maybe then as we just kind of ask something about the competitive backdrop here I think you mentioned, it looks like it stacking up to be a very promotional holiday and very competitors, as you look at the environment you\u2019re clearly gaining share of traffic and certainly with the industry backdrop it would seem that a strong value messenger is continue to drive those share gains in the fourth quarter and then into the medium term. What do you think is the right thing to do with IM user with starting price, do you think it's a good idea strategically maybe even dig a little deeper on value at this point or do you think the merge margin has maybe where you prefer you'd prefer to see some of the flow-through come from?","Michael Hartshorn","Michael I don\u2019t think we'd get into that level of detail in terms of how we go after the business but suffice to say that we agree with you. We think what's really driving the retail environment right now is that the customers is looking for value and our focus is to provide the best margins we can, put the best bargains in front of the customer and that's what will drive the business.","Operator","The next question is from Laura Champine with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Laura Champine","Good afternoon. Was just wondering if you could comment on strengthen strength in categories, was home stronger then apparel, any particular strengthen women's versus men's or anything you can say there on category strength?","Michael Hartshorn","In terms of merchandize performance home and apparel were fairly well they are both in line with the chain overall and frankly the only other call out we say is what we said in the comments as men's was the strongest performing merchandize category.","Operator","The next question is from Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company.","Oliver Chen ","The merchant margins were really impressive. Could you just elaborate on the main drivers I think it probably has something to do with your low levels denser [ph] inventories and mark down levels? I'm just sorry inventory level was also very impressive are you expecting that's the kind of continue to be negative and then I'm just curious about how that will trend just because the momentums has been so strong at your comp plan?","Michael Hartshorn","Sure, Oliver. So we outperformed the high end of our comp sales target during the quarter, so that's meant that we had faster inventory turns resulting in lower mark downs that was also help by the fact that we ran at with inventories down about 1% during the quarter. We also benefitted from our ability to take advantage of buying opportunities in the market plays and in addition we did see some benefit from ongoing improvements in our inventory shortage we typically take our physical inventory in the third quarter. So, all of those contributed to the better than planned merchandise margins during this quarter. ","Oliver Chen ","Thank you.","Michael Hartshorn","In store inventories for the fourth quarter we're again planning them to be down during the quarter, so that should answer the question. ","Oliver Chen ","And you guys have been ahead of the curve with booking about the marketplace from the environment that's happening. Were August, September, October steady in cadences or was there was a fair degree of volatility that you were seeing in the way that consumers behaving?","Michael Hartshorn","For us, relatively steady throughout the quarter.","Oliver Chen ","Okay. Now last question was the comp looked nicely driven by this healthy composition between traffic and basket, what's happening with basket, that's enabling you to have that momentum, is that the balancing that you think will continue, as you look forward on a medium and longer term basis between traffic and both baskets?","Michael Hartshorn","So Oliver, as you mentioned 3% comp was driven by both higher traffic and an increase in the size of the average basket. The higher basket was a combination of higher unit per transaction and also higher AUR. I mean for us, the way we do that is that we've been successful delivering great bargains to the customer and that's the way we think about it, we don't look at the composition, when we\u2019re planning our comps.","Operator","Your next question is from David Mann with Johnson Rice. ","David Mann","If you pointed this out but merch margin expectation within your fourth quarter guidance, how should we think about that?","Michael Hartshorn","I think at this point David if we perform ahead of plans like we did in a third quarter I think our expectations would be that it\u2019s up a bit over the last year. ","David Mann","Okay. And then in terms of the packaway impact on distribution cost, I think you suggested that there was a benefit in the third quarter, how many basis points would that have been?","Michael Hartshorn","We didn't call it out separately and we did call it out obviously the DC's, we said DC's are going to be a drag on the back half with the center value this year about 30 basis points but we didn't call out the packaway pieces of it.","David Mann","And in term of what you're thinking that in the fourth quarter in your guidance about that packaway impact on distribution cost, how should we think about that or are you assuming packaway normalizes to some extent as percentage? ","Michael Hartshorn","Yes, our guidance is -- it's a good question. Our guidance assumes that it does normalize by year end. We said overall operating margins we're going to be down 30 to 50 basis points primarily driven really by three things, one is the comp at flat to 1%. But DC cost that would de-lever because of the infrastructure investments and the timing of packaway related costs.","David Mann","And could you quantify how much that timing effect was, would you be willing to do that?","Michael Hartshorn","No, we didn't call it out","David Mann","Okay. And then last question on the home side of the business, I know you've been making great strikes there with some outperformance and some of the recent quarters. I guess this quarter is more in line or at least or three of the last four quarters, I think that was the case. Are you at a point now where you think that some of the benefits there have more stabilized or do you still think there is some opportunities to drive some outperformance?","Barbara Rentler","We still feel good about home. We fell like we'll well position for holiday for the fourth quarter and we feel that in future '16, '17, there is still room to grow there.","Operator","Your next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. ","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted the follow up on the higher AUR during the quarter, is there a mix shift happening there, what's driving the tickets higher?","Michael Hartshorn","Really two things, one because we operate with less inventory, it means that we had less clearance. So that drives of course a portion of the AUR increase and then there is always mixes by business that contributed. ","Lorraine Hutchinson","And then can you quantify the shortage benefit from the third quarter?","Michael Hartshorn","So, of the 45 basis point improvements last year, it's about a little less than a third.","Operator","Your next question is from Brian Tunick with Royal Bank of Canada. ","Brian Tunick","I guess first question was on the category side, did you guys say Mens was your strongest category, I don't think I\u2019ve heard that in quite some time, is there any comment you can put around that and is that because the either juniors or women's is slowing just curious what you're reading into that with a great buys or something like that and then maybe in some more context on the Midwest stores I know they continue to lead the chain here, is that how the new store maturity curve is playing out, is that the micro merchandising, what are you learning from that as you think about your next markets and when could we hear about a new market in the next year or two, thanks very much.","Barbara Rentler","Brian as a pretends to Mens no, for years we had difficult business in Mens but over the last couple of years we continue really just to just to improve our execution. So we\u2019re just literally doing a better job than we had done before. So our Mens business we feel pretty good about.","Michael O'Sullivan","And then Brian on your question about Midwest, so yes, we\u2019re very happy with performance in the Midwest, I think Michael Hartshorn had mentioned earlier that actually sort of past seven quarters the Midwest has been one of the top performing regions. When we entered the Midwest just over three years ago, we said that we expected it to be a very successful business overtime and with any progress that we\u2019ve made thus far and that reinforces our confidence and believe in. In terms of additional new markets, the Midwest is as you\u2019ll appreciate is a pretty big area and there are lots of individual market within the Midwest.","So our focus right now and probably for the next few years is going to be to build our presence in this market in Midwest.","Operator","The next question is from Bob Drbul with Nomura.","Bob Drbul","Good afternoon, just a couple of quick questions. The first one is, during the quarter the environment in terms of the promotional level or activity from the competition from the competition, did you see any changes then the quarter progress? And I guess you didn\u2019t really change at all the fourth quarter prospects in terms of guidance or your plans, so my question is has the environment at all given you the thoughts around changing it in terms of pricing umbrella from department stores probably being a little bit more promotional as you think about your prospects for the fourth quarter?","Michael Hartshorn","I\u2019ll handle the second piece of your question Bob on the fourth quarter, I think as Barbara has outlined in her remarks, we think it make sense to be relatively conservative in the fourth quarter in the ongoing economic uncertainty; secondly the environment looks like it will be fairly promotional and some of that is based upon just what we\u2019re seeing in terms of the recent performance in department stores those reports to be at the same, this could be by commercial in fourth quarter. And then as the final point for customers is important is that we\u2019re up against the 6% comp last fourth quarter, we reported really as a terrific 6% comps so we\u2019re up against that number.","The other point I would make is our business, we typically plan our business relatively conservatively, that\u2019s kind of probably the first bullet point in our play list, we plan the business conservatively and then we know we can shape the business as the sales of that, so I think -- we think it's best to plan conservatively but then we hope to do better.","Barbara Rentler","So just as it pertains to the promotional level during the quarter, it actually was pretty promotional during the entire quarter. It's not like there were couple of events the department stores added in October, but actually quite frankly it's been promotional since Q2 and just kind of came across through back-to-school and then increased I\u2019d say slightly in October.","Bob Drbul","And then in terms of categories, as the -- can you just talk about how your cold weather categories are performing and how you're positioned there? And if you can just give us an update in terms of what you're seeing from the business in terms of the handbags and accessories category?","Barbara Rentler","Cold weather has been I would say difficult, I mean it was difficult in October, we have relatively conservative plans in cold weather, we chase part of that business at the back end of season. So we can adjust as we come along the way, but it did start out slower than we would have liked. In terms of handbags and accessories, the business is still behind the chains performance and we\u2019re still working away for that.","Operator","The next question is from Marni Shapiro with The Retail Tracker.","Marni Shapiro","Congratulations. Just a question on dd's, so has Michael been running dd's all this time and will he stay onboard to transition buying enroll and for how long will he stay onboard? And are there any other leadership positioned open at dd's that you need to fill at this point?","Barbara Rentler","So Michael, dd's has reported Michael for this period of time, Michael, Brian will report directly to me, Michael will be evolved in -- heavily involved in this transition of Brian into the company and there are no other senior management jobs open at dd's at this point.","Marni Shapiro","And then just on the tropic side, have you guys seen traffic still increase or flat at Ross and dd's?","Michael Hartshorn","They are up in both during the quarter.","Operator","The next question is from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank.","Mike Baker","Thanks. So I was just curious the [indiscernible] they seemed like they got really got hit with a lot of heavy inventory because it was kind of warm. So it seems like they are worse off now than they thought they were three months ago, yet you haven\u2019t changed your guidance. So I guess did you predict -- correctly predict how bad it would be for the department stores or is there some other reason why you wouldn\u2019t change your guidance, so you're just doing that much better? And I guess related to that inventory is high, just as high as they are now at the end of the previous quarter, yet your margins are getting better not worse. So just curious how you're sort of bucking that trend and what that wouldn\u2019t be the same in the fourth quarter?","Michael Hartshorn","Let me answer the first part of your question Mike, question Mike about department store. When we think about our guidance for the quarter, a lot of factors go into it. Obviously, our influence in the third quarter, the outlook for the fourth quarter, the macro economy, our promotional we think is going to be -- and I would say as we look at this quarter that fact that are up against the 6% comp. So all of those things kind of go into the mixture for us to come with guidance for the fourth quarter. So I think I\u2019ve tried answer your question.","I don\u2019t think I really understood your second question about inventories, could you just repeat that?","Mike Baker","Yes, so one of the concerns is that inventories are high right now and so that leads to a promotional environment, and that might hurt your margins in the fourth quarter and that makes sense except I just point out that inventories were high at the end of the second quarter and they were also pretty high at the end of the first quarter I think due to the average department store inventories. At the end of the first, second and third quarter is up about 5% or 6% pretty consistently yet even with the high inventories throughout the year, your merchandise margins are getting better not worse. So is there a reason to expect that, that wouldn\u2019t continue into the fourth quarter?","Michael Hartshorn","I think it\u2019s all about inventories, and I think it\u2019s a combination of inventories and sales trend and at least what we have seen, we are using the same numbers, the data we\u2019ve seen suggest that actually the sales trend hasn\u2019t lived up to its people\u2019s expectations. So although the inventory levels may not move that much from quarter-to-quarter but sales trend have deteriorated and that\u2019s what could really drive it to be more promotional.","Mike Baker","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. If I had just one more longer term question. You guys always guide early start you had a 1% to 2% I can\u2019t remember the last time you actually comped at something in that range. As I do my model out, is it probably more correct to think about your annual growth as something higher than that typical guidance probably in the 3% to 4% range, how do you guys really think about it longer term?","Michael Hartshorn","I think we have described our longer term model as we believe that our long-term average comp should be in the region of 3%. We feel pretty comfortable of our ability to achieve that kind of comp number. And certainly if you look at the last 10 even further back 15 years, the data would suggest that that\u2019s a reasonable expectation. ","Now in any given year it could be plus or minus 1 or 2 points in any direction depending upon the circumstances, the economic environment, the competitor environment, the comps were up against it. But I think if you are modeling in 3% on an average basis, I think that\u2019s appropriate.","Mike Baker","Okay, makes sense. One more I promise. How does this work, when inventories are high in the environment right now are you more likely to get the excess product from vendors because we are getting inventory pushed back to them or they\u2019re not able to send it to the department stores or more likely to get directly from the department stores, in other words departments stores have already taken possession of it but now they are going to send it to you.","Barbara Rentler","We actually buy the merchandise from vendors direct.","Operator","Your next question is from Anne-Charlotte Windal with Bernstein.","Anne-Charlotte Windal","Hi, good afternoon and congratulations. So this maybe a good [ph] point given the availability of goods on the market. But with competition increasing in the off-price space are you seeing any change in the competitive dynamics, are you seeing any of your competitors becoming more aggressive in terms of what they are willing to pay for some brands?","Michael Hartshorn","Anne-Charlotte, not really no. I mean the new competition I think you are referring to that is too small to have any kind of impact. So no.","Anne-Charlotte Windal","Okay, just had to ask. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray.","Neely Tamminga","Great, thank you. Hey Barbara I just wanted to follow back up on the appointment of Brian Morrow for the company. Coming from Stein Mart obviously more of a national brand presence that exists in that format relative to what dd\u2019s currently has. So should we be reading into something around that in his chief merchandising experience or I would imagine anybody at this point -- your pick of the litter, like who would want to come work for Ross, right. So what specifically have you seen in Brian that\u2019s going to be very specific and relevant for dd\u2019s? Thank you.","Barbara Rentler","Brian has a very deep broad-based experience and he has over 30 years of experience in variety of sectors including moderate department stores and most recently off-price retail. This experience along with his strong leadership skill we think he is really going to be a valuable resource to dd\u2019s. Worrying about whether he can make the transition to a low to moderate customer? We don\u2019t foresee that as any problem. We think he is a very good merchant in a good merchant can merchandise all area.","Operator","The next question is from Matthew Boss with JP Morgan.","Matthew Boss","So as we think about your square footage expansion profile from here. First, how are your more recent stores performing? And then second, what\u2019s the best way to think about how many years left in the existing markets in the Midwest versus how we best should think about timeline for a Northeast entrance?","Michael Hartshorn","So Matthew in terms of new stores I would say that we have been very happy with the performance of our new stores actually over the last several years and this year has been no exception, we\u2019ve been happy with how they performed. Certainly this year, I can say for the last few years we have exceeded our initial sales plan. In terms of a time frame for new markets, I wouldn\u2019t give you time frame at this point I think we have plenty of opportunity left and frankly in our existing market as well as in the request so I think our was busy certainly for the next few years.","Matthew Boss","Okay great. And then just a follow up I mean you guys have been spot on with your call on the retail environment. In terms of the product availability that you are seeing I mean are there any particular categories of particular opportunity as it relates to some of the buys that you see coming in the pipeline?","Barbara Rentler","Actually the supply is very broad base. It's a great time with that.","Matthew Boss","Sounds like it. Best of luck.","Operator","The next question is from Roxanne Meyer with MKM Partners.","Roxanne Meyer","My first question is a follow up on inventory. I guess it\u2019s a follow up on inventory, I want to appreciate what are your guardrails around inventory. In terms of how higher you are willing to grow inventory on an absolute basis relative to your sales plans. Does that have a limit how do you think about your inventory strategy in total?","Michael Hartshorn","Sure. So Roxanne I think we think more -- I know we think about our inventory on a segmented basis. We think about in-store inventory which is really the inventory that's available in front of the customer, but we manage that very tightly. As we've talked about earlier on this call over the third quarter, I\u2019m sure there is slight decline versus last year and that's what we look for, we look for some of the key sort of drive turns and therefore drive multi-improvement and margin improvements. And so that's how we think about the in-store piece of inventory. Separately, we think about packaway based upon what's available in the market place and if we see terrific opportunities in the marketplace our merchants are encouraged to take advantage of those and that means packing away those goods and if packaway rises over a period of time that's because we've seen great bargains in the market place that we like. So that's kind of how we think about in between the different pockets of inventory.","Roxanne Meyer","Okay. So the buyers just has the ability to take advantage of deals in the market and it doesn\u2019t seems like there is too many constraints around -- at some point you just have to get cut off but you are willing to extend yourself knowing that it's for future periods.","Barbara Rentler","The buyers have plans, it's not just free-for-all they have their buying. There is a strategy, there is a plan, there is a plan by business segment of how much we think is appropriate. All that being said one of the benefits for model is that reflect able. So if we were to see a large amount of product and the classification or a business we weren\u2019t planning on particularly driving and that product could help us drive the business, we would put money into that plan and we reflect. So that's just one of the benefits of being a new up rise business.","Michael Hartshorn","Just one other on that Roxanne, is we do as you would expect, we have pretty significant control over what\u2019s in packaway, so we control very carefully sort of the ageing of packaway how long it's allowed to stay in there, what kind of goods. But we manage elastics of that, as you would expect.","Roxanne Meyer","Okay great. And then just curious on the traffic increases that you are seeing. Can you talk about what portion of the traffic is coming from new versus repeat buyers are they continuing to skew younger, are existing customers shopping more? I mean just some of that maybe the demographics behind that it would be great? Thanks a lot.","Michael Hartshorn","The new customers that we have attracted frankly over the last several years demographically if they look a lot like our existing customers what they will have in common is they were all looking for great value, after great bargains. In terms of your point about the age we've always disproportionately attracted a slightly younger customers and that continues to be true. When you look at the growth of our junior's business overtime that's a good manifestation of that, but I would say that demographic for our new customers are pretty similar to the demographics from our existing customers.","Roxanne Meyer","Okay great. Thanks and best of luck for holiday.","Operator","The next question is from Jeff S. Stein with Northcoast Research.","Jeff S. Stein ","Sure. Barbara this was the first quarter then I could remember that you did not call out Junior's as the best or one of the best performing categories and I'm just curious anything notable around that is that customer spending less or suddenly Mens just exploded during the quarter?","Barbara Rentler","Junior's perform slightly above the chain and was up against a very tough compare with that we had a couple of execution issues which we have corrected.","Jeff S. Stein ","And what would execution mean, is that -- would have been merchandizing or?","Barbara Rentler","Wrong timing on some products.","Jeff S. Stein","Okay. And real estate cost, what's going on there. It\u2019s one thing to compete against to other companies for merchandize I'm sure there is plenty of that there is less availability when it comes to real estate are you seeing real estate cost go up and perhaps choice locations becoming more difficult to identify?","Michael Hartshorn","Yes. I think we are pretty happy with the availability of real estate locations and, the range you're seeing there is a lot going on in the retail industry, not just in the power of retail but in other sectors office supplies, electronics, et cetera, which means that there is availability of real estate and we have the terrific teams over the years which enables to show greater patience performance on great deals. So, we're pretty happy within our progress. ","Jeff S. Stein","Okay. And one more quickly for Barbara, during that period where you got a lot of promotional activity going on and there is an overabundance of product, is there a chance for risk that packaway may not prove to be as greater value because perhaps you bought it six months ago at higher price and today you could [buy] it at much lower price?","Barbara Rentler","So as packaway, we actually -- Michael talked about all the difference metrics we have to measure packaway. We actually constantly look at the values that we're having there now. The merchants when they put merchandise in packaway, they are thinking of it from a promotional perspective. So the packaway that we own today would have been packaway we would have bought end of Q2 and to Q3, when we've already seen that promotional environment coming across. So they know when they put in there that there has to be a variance for what's going on in the world. All that being said, if there's something in packaway that we didn't think was the right value, during our processes, we would captured that and there is a lot of sides around packaway and what\u2019s in there, we've putted out and we would mark it down, we would move on.","But really the headset for merchants with something in packaways, they have to feel comfortable that when they take it out, it's really is going to be a great branded bargains. And so there is a lot of sides and rules and questions around what that looks like before they putted into packaway.","Operator","The next question is from Richard Jaffe with Stifel. ","Richard Jaffe","One more question on packaway, please. How long that something stay in packaway? What's the average life of its time in packaway, ballpark or some timeframe?","Michael Hartshorn","Richard, it's about three to four months. ","Richard Jaffe","That's great and I assumed, you're going to be -- you are in a position to take advantage of looks like a tremendous amount of product in the marketplace as I assume cancellations are out there, I'm sorry ","Barbara Rentler","We're in a good position going in to what we would call a volatile climate. So we feel pretty comfortable with where we are. ","Richard Jaffe","Yes, I think volatile maybe a kind word, going on way unfortunately","Barbara Rentler","No, it's okay. ","Operator","The next question is from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.","Stephen Grambling","One quick follow up, which I guess is just on the cost efficiencies that you captured this year, can you just talk to some of the biggest buckets there and maybe you want to still left?","Michael Hartshorn","We were looking everywhere. We're looking in non-pay role, pay role and we're looking for efficiencies throughout the business. So, I think we'll continue to do that, we're doing that in our budget process and we'll be able to give you an update in -- at the end of the year.","Stephen Grambling","I\u2019ll shoot one more in there, which is just there has been some investor concerned around one of your larger off price competitors going after low AURs. Clearly the overall comps -- reflected any impact, can you just remind us if you have seen any difference in comps by approximately to off-price period ","Michael Hartshorn","Steve, we always fight to tighten our business, we look at how difference stores are doing based upon characteristics like demographic, et cetera and frankly there is nothing to call out -- it's been broad based, it's been nothing that's really impact.","Operator","The next question is from David Glick with Buckingham.","David Glick","Most of my questions have been answered. I just wanted a follow up again on the Midwest, obviously that's a newer market for you and for most retailers it was the most challenging region because of very warm weather. I was just wondering if you could help me to understand how you can outperform in that market obviously when you turned your inventories faster, you're less relying on seasonal which gives you guys an advantage versus departmental stores but just a little more color on that, help me to understand that would be great. Thanks. ","Michael Hartshorn","So David, I would say that, we're always driving our business as a chain and actually regionally is having great product in the stores and I think, we feel very good about the assortment that we have in our Midwest stores and ultimately that really what\u2019s driven our business parallel to past couple of years. ","Operator","There are no further questions. I will turn the call back over to Barbara Rentler for closing comments.

Our better-than-expected results year-to-date were driven by our ongoing ability to offer shoppers a fresh and exciting array of compelling name-brand bargains for the family and the home. In addition, operating of stores on lower inventories while strictly controlling expenses continues to enhance profit margins. Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended October 27, 2012, increased 14% to $0.72, up from $0.63. These results are on top of a 24% gain in last year's third quarter. Net earnings for the quarter grew 11% to $159.5 million. Sales rose 11% to $2,263,000,000 with comparable store sales up 6% following 5% growth in the third quarter of 2011.","For the 9 months ended October 27, 2012, earnings per share were $2.46, up from $2.01. These results represent a 22% increase versus a 24% gain last year. Net earnings for the period rose 18% to $550.2 million, up from $465.2 million for the first 9 months of 2011. Sales for the first 9 months of 2012 increased 12% to $6,960,000,000 with comparable store sales up 7% on top of a 5% gain for the same period last year.","Merchandising geographic trends were broad-based for the third quarter. Juniors was the best-performing category, while the Southwest Texas and Florida showed the most geographic strength.","Earnings before interest and taxes in the 2012 third quarter grew to a record 11.3% of sales, up from 10.9% last year. As a percent of sales, higher merchandise margin, lower distribution cost and leverage on occupancy and general, selling and administrative expenses were partially offset by a lower shortage benefit in the prior year and increases in freight and buying costs. John will provide additional color on these operating margin trends in a few minutes.","As we ended the third quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 9% over last year, while packaway levels were 46% of total inventories compared to 43% at this time in 2011. More importantly, average in-store inventories were down 6% at the end of the quarter, and we continue to target selling store inventories to decline in the mid-single-digit range for the fourth quarter.","Now let's turn to dd's DISCOUNTS. dd's continued to generate solid results in the third quarter with better-than-expected sales and profitability. Like Ross, dd's is benefiting from our ability to offer a wide assortment of terrific bargains while also operating the business on reduced inventory levels. We continue to expect dd's to generate improved growth in pretax earnings for 2012 compared to last year.","We also recently completed our store expansion program for the year, adding 31 new Ross and dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS locations combined in the third quarter for a total of 80 new stores in 2012 as planned.","Now John will provide further color on our third quarter results and details on our guidance for the fourth quarter.","John G. Call","Thank you, Michael. Our 6% comparable store sales gain in the third quarter was driven by mid-single-digit growth in the number of transactions combined with a low-single-digit increase in the size of the average basket. Operating margin grew by about 35 basis points in the quarter to 11.3% as 40 basis points of leverage on selling, general and administrative cost was partially offset by a 5-basis-point increase in the cost of goods sold compared to the prior year. The slight increase in cost of goods sold consisted of 30 basis points of higher merchandise margin, 15 basis points of leverage on occupancy costs and distribution expenses that declined approximately 45 basis points.  The latter was mainly due to favorable timing of packaway-related processing costs.","These improvements were offset by 45 basis points from a lower shortage benefit than the prior year and buying and freight expenses that increased 25 basis points each. Shortage results from this year's annual physical inventory were better than expected, adding about $0.02 in earnings per share. However, the favorable variance versus our reserves was larger in the third quarter of 2011, when we realized a $0.04 benefit.","In addition, last year's third quarter was aided by a lower tax rate due to favorable tax audit settlements that added approximately $0.02 to earnings per share.","Our repurchase program also remains on track as we bought back 1.7 million shares in the quarter for a total purchase price of $111 million. As a result, year-to-date, we have repurchased 5.4 million shares for a total price of $334 million. We expect to buy $116 million in common stock during the fourth quarter, which will complete the 2-year $900 million program announced in early 2011.","Let's turn now to our guidance for the fourth quarter. As noted in today's press release, we continue to forecast earnings per share of $0.99 to $1.04 for the 14 weeks ending February 2, 2013. This compares to $0.85 for the 13 weeks ended January 28, 2012. The benefit to EPS from the 53rd week in 2012 is estimated to be about $0.08 to $0.09 and is included in this guidance range.","Operating statement assumptions for the quarter include the following: we are targeting total sales to grow about 12% to 13%, driven by a combination of new store growth; same-store sales that are forecast to be up 1% to 2% and the benefit from this year's 53rd week. As a reminder, we have a challenging comparison as same-store sales were up a robust 7% in last year's fourth quarter. Comparable store sales are planned to be flat to up 1% in November, up 2% to 3% in December and up 1% to 2% in January. December is expected to be the strongest month of the quarter as it has 2 extra shopping days before Christmas compared to 2011. Same-store sales increased 5%, 9% and 5%, respectively, in November, December and January of last year.","We are targeting fourth quarter operating margin of 13.2% to 13.5%. Net interest expense is planned to be approximately $1 million, and our tax rate is expected to be about 38%. We also estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding of about 221 million.","Now I'll turn the call back to Michael.","Michael Balmuth","Thank you, John. As previously noted, we are pleased with our strong performance for the first 9 months of 2012. Our financial results reflect that we continue to benefit from our ability to efficiently execute our off-price strategies, making our stores attractive destinations for today's value-conscious customers. As we enter the important fourth quarter, our merchants are doing a terrific job of delivering plenty of bargain-priced gifts and fashions for the family and the home. That said, during the holiday season, it is always difficult to predict how commercial and other retailers may become or how current macroeconomic and political uncertainties may impact consumer spending. In addition, as John noted, same-store sales increased a robust 7% in the fourth quarter of 2011 for our most challenging comparison of the year. So while we hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to maintain our prior fourth quarter forecast for both sales and earnings.","Based on our year-to-date results and fourth quarter guidance, earnings per share for the 53 weeks ending February 2, 2013, are now forecast to be $3.45 to $3.50, which includes the estimated earnings per share benefit of $0.08 to $0.09 from the extra week.","On a 52-week basis, our guidance range for fiscal 2012 represents solid projected earnings per share growth of 17% to 19% on top of a 24% increase in fiscal 2011, when we reported earnings per share of $2.86.","Looking ahead, our top priority continues to be maximizing our ability to offer shoppers the best bargains possible. Investing in our merchant organization has been and still is our most important initiative. And today, we have hundreds of merchants sourcing products from thousands of vendors. Our commitment to increasing these key resources should ensure that we will have ongoing access to an abundance of exciting name-brand products to drive our future growth.","In closing, we continue to target average annual earnings per share growth of 10% to 15% over the longer term. We believe we can achieve this through a combination of store growth, same-store sales gains, sustainable operating margins and the benefit to earnings per share from our ongoing stock repurchase program.","At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rick Patel with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Rick B. Patel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Can you talk about the impact of Hurricane Sandy on your business, in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic, perhaps quantify the impact it's having on your November comp? And then secondly, can you just talk about the impact of the hurricane on your sourcing opportunities? With a number of retailers having been impacted, are you seeing an abundance of buying opportunities in the marketplace? And if so, should we expect your packaway inventories to rise in the coming months?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Rick, it's Michael O'Sullivan. I'll answer that. In terms of impact on sales, we wouldn't expect it to be material and see much of the impact to the guidance we've just given for fourth quarter. In terms of sourcing, it's a little bit early to tell. Right now, we're pretty happy with the supply that we are seeing. We don't know whether Hurricane Sandy is contributing to that or not.","Rick B. Patel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then can you talk about your business in California? It seems like the last few months have been tough out there with some gas price volatility and then some unfavorable weather. Were the trends in that region significantly different in 3Q versus prior quarters?  And what's your outlook for that region in the fourth quarter?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Actually, California has been performing pretty well here.  We've been pretty happy with performance in the state. It's pretty close to the chain, just a little bit lower than the chain. So we're not too concerned. In terms of prospects over the next couple of quarters, we don't see a lot of issues that could change that trend.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","My first question is for John. John, looking at the new-store productivity for the stores that you've opened here over the last year, the way we model it, it looks like new-store productivity relative to the existing base is a little lower this year, and I'm wondering if that's new markets or dd's, if you could comment on that.  And then secondarily, the buying costs, I think, you indicated delevered about 25 basis points on a 6% comp. I'm wondering what the sort of -- at what comp level would you expect buying costs to be relatively neutral? And then, Michael, the inventory levels in store just continue to get leaner and leaner, and the stores are looking so very clean. I'm wondering if you could just comment on if you see further opportunities beyond the fourth quarter where you've already given guidance, so into 2013 and beyond to continue to take down those inventory levels?","John G. Call","Kimberly, this is John. In terms of new store productivity, the new stores this year are achieving what we had planned them to achieve at around 70% of average store volumes. So we're pretty pleased with that. Having said that, as we go into new markets and with both Ross and dd's, we do plan those levels slightly lower than if we're in market in some of those stores. So we're actually pretty pleased with how the new stores are coming on. And your second question was around where merchant buying costs might lever. As is our # 1 priority to obtain bargains for our customers, we continue to invest in the merchant group, and I think we'll continue to do that. So to say at what point in time it will ultimately lever, we think that we that it probably should grow with or probably slightly faster than sales growth, so we'll continue to make those investments.","Michael Balmuth","And on inventory levels going forward, we haven't established all our levels for next year, but I would anticipate that we'd have further reductions, probably in the low-single-digit range.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Evren Kopelman from Wells Fargo.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. One is on the average basket size, you said it's up low single-digits. Can you talk about be drivers behind that? Is it a mix shift among categories maybe that are higher priced or any other drivers? And then secondly, can you talk about the differences in strength between regions and what you think is driving some of the strength in certain regions?","John G. Call","Evren, I'll answer your first question on the average basket. It's being driven by slightly higher AURs, which could be slightly a mix difference, and the number of units is fairly flat.","Michael B. O'Sullivan","And then on your second question, Evren, about regions. Although we called out Florida and Texas in the Southwest, I would say that our performance has been fairly broad-based, and we're pretty happy with the performance across all regions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Citigroup.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Regarding the fourth quarter and your outlook, what are the puts and takes we should think about with respect to the gross margin opportunity in terms of the occupancy versus merch margin? Also, could you just update us on the incremental opportunities further for your macro merchandising initiatives? And our final question is in relation to the resolution of the elections. Has that been a positive or negative in terms of what's been happening after that's over now?","John G. Call","Oliver, it relates to the fourth quarter.  As we've mentioned, we're planning a 1 to 2 comp for that quarter. We would expect some deleverage from expenses in the quarter based on the 1 to 2 comp.  And on a 52-week basis, that's what we'd expect, between 10 and 40 basis points of deleverage. If you include the 53rd week, then we'd actually expect some leverage.","Michael B. O'Sullivan","And then on your second question about micro-merchandising. As you know, we've rolled out micro-merchandising across the chain about 2 years ago.  And I think at that time, we explained that our micro-merchandising uses history to project the inventory levels in each store. So obviously, the more history we have, the more accurate micro-merchandising is. So we think there's still continued value we're going to get from micro-merchandising over the next few years. So we've gotten some benefit today, which is what helped us to improve our turns, but we think there's still a little bit more to come. I think your first question was about the election. Certainly, we've seen no impact in terms of the outcome of the election on our business at this point. And we didn't expect one, so yes.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","As a follow-up on the deleverage regarding the gross margin, are there positive offsets? Are you expecting there to be a nice positive from greater full price selling on the inventory control?","John G. Call","So we would expect further market benefits.  As we take inventories down, we expect faster turns, which would reduce our current [ph] levels. So yes, we would expect some leverage from the merchandise line.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Tunick with JPMorgan.","Brian J. Tunick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A couple of questions. First, on the market share, any more thoughts as we move through most of the year, sort of how much you think market share may have come from J.C. Penney or sort of what you think you're seeing from new customers coming into the Ross Stores and how sustainable you think you'll be able to keep those new customers? Second question, Home has been lagging, and I was just curious as we move into the tougher comps and everyone's excited about the housing recovery, sort of what are you guys doing to reassort the housing and home-related product? And the third part, on the distribution side of it, I believe you have a new DC ramping up or open and how that could impact your distribution expense leverage for next year?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Brian, on the first question about market share. Obviously, with a 7% comp year to date, we believe we're gaining share from someone in the apparel market. And I think that's been true in the last several years. Our comps have generally outperformed the competitors. And obviously, we're watching closely what's been happening in the midtier. We've tried to ask -- to isolate the impact of the midtier and J.C. Penney on our comp. But mathematically, we haven't been able to really quantify the impact. But I think suffice it to say that we believe that with a 7% comp, we are gaining share, and the customers are pleased with the values that we're offering. Let me jump to your third question, and then I think Michael will come back on the question about Home. Your third question was about the distribution centers. We actually have a new distribution center that will -- scheduled to open in 2014. So in terms of DC costs, I wouldn't expect any deleverage in 2013.","John G. Call","I would add to that, Michael, that in 2013, we would have increased CapEx spending around the build of that new DC. But as Michael said, no P&L impact.","Michael Balmuth","Relative to Home, on a short-term basis, we have business well positioned, we believe, for gift-giving for the holiday period. And as we look further out, the way we approach things, first we ramp up more organization and we have in Home to help fuel some of the categories as business opportunities are starting to present themselves in more small-furniture-type businesses that we believe in in Home that relate to housing industry.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez from Nomura.","Paul Lejuez - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Just on the packaway levels, your assumption for packaway levels can impact how we think about the distribution line and its impact on the EBIT margin. So I'm just curious what is built in to your assumptions for fourth quarter as it relates to packaway? And then second, just bigger picture, you guys are always very methodical in terms of how you buy back stock. You have an authorization, it takes you 2 years to go through it. Would you ever consider being a little bit more opportunistic in the way that you treat buyback, when the shares are down to buy back more, or will you stick to the very predictable pace that you've done it in the past?","John G. Call","To packaway levels, Paul, this one's a little bit difficult to predict, but from a planning perspective, we look for packaway levels to be somewhat even with last year. Now having said that, again, we are opportunistic on that line, so don't necessarily hold us to that, but that's what we have built into the forecast for the fourth quarter. As it relates to the buyback, we do look at being opportunistic with the buyback when it matters. When we see fluctuations in our PE, dramatic fluctuations in our PE, we tend to be a little bit more aggressive. But our instinct is to remain pretty methodical, as you mentioned, about buying back stock. We don't tend to be market timers.","Paul Lejuez - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","John, on the packaway, is that flat to last quarter or flat year-over-year? And then....","John G. Call","Flat year-over-year.","Paul Lejuez - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then, so what's the assumption for whether that distribution line helps or hurts you in the fourth quarter?","John G. Call","So it helps us in the third quarter, would tend to -- it would help -- based on the projections, it would help us in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laura Champine from Canaccord.","Laura A. Champine - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","My question is about the competitive environment as we move into Q4, because I know you price at a discount to department store pricing. What is your perception of what's happening with inventory levels and with promotions early in the holiday season?","Michael Balmuth","It seems fairly promotional, okay? We probably say that every year to -- at this time. But certainly, with what's going on in terms of hours for Thanksgiving, it certainly seems like people position themselves pretty aggressively in promotions. Inventory levels, there's one store in the midtier that has certainly has stated that their inventory levels are much higher. The inventory levels look relatively under control.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of David Mann with Johnson Rice.","David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","A couple of questions. In terms of November, why -- or what are the factors that are behind that being the weakest month of the quarter?","John G. Call","As you looked at the quarter, David, we're up, again, we're up against a significant number, there's isn't a compelling reason to shop. We think for the quarter, we're -- planned it fairly conservative. We haven't really changed that guidance since we issued that guidance in August of this year. So we're approaching it as we have approached the year, being fairly conservative and hoping we'll do better.","Michael Balmuth","And you also have a couple of extra days in December before Christmas.","David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Got you. And then in terms of shrink, I guess this is the first year where your shrink benefit actually has been behind the last few years. How should we think about future opportunities in shrink?","John G. Call","So we have, as you mentioned, David, for the last 3 or 4 years, we've continued to have record levels of our shortage. That again was the case this year. As we get down to these levels, there's just not as much opportunity to carve out that benefit. Now going forward, we'll reduce our shrink accrual to reflect the levels we achieved this year, similar to what we've done over the past 3 or 4 years. So baked into our future guidance will be a lower shrink accrual.","David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","And then my last question, when you look at the packaway purchases you're making, how does the product cost look in the recent purchases relative to the last few quarters?","Michael Balmuth","Favorable.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marni Shapiro with The Retail Tracker.","Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker","Your traffic has been up very nicely and has been. Can you talk about if there -- if this is consistent across the country and if there's anything that you are looking to do differently or anything that you've changed that is the result of this, away from the strong assortments?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","In terms of traffic, Marni, there's really nothing that we're planning to do that's any different to the approach we always take, which is try and put the best bargains in front of the customer. We've found that over time, that's the most effective way to continue to grow our traffic to our stores. So certainly other things like using marketing to support that we'll continue to do. But nothing dramatically different than what we've done historically.","Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker","That sounds great. Can you just remind me, last year's shortage of on the last couple of years, it's been very low. Is this  year's level just really more normalized level reserve-wise versus shortage?  Or was last year's extremely low? I guess how should we think about that?","John G. Call","No. Actually, last year, we hit an all-time low, and again this year, we hit an all-time low. Just the benefit against that reserve was lower, has more to do with how we were reserving as opposed to the actual results.","Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker","So the actual shortage was still very low?","John G. Call","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Roxanne Meyer from UBS.","Roxanne Meyer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions. First, I'm wondering what your comp assumption is on a full 14-week basis? Second, any outlook for freight costs? And third, was November -- early November trends impacted by unfavorably warm weather in California? I'm just wondering if you can comment on that.","John G. Call","So on the first, the comp assumption for the 14 weeks as opposed to 13 weeks?","Roxanne Meyer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes.","John G. Call","So we haven't -- actually, the comp is going to be based on the 13-week assumption, which we said is 1 to 2. As far as your second question on freight, we did experience a little higher freight rates, probably due to slightly higher fuel rates. And we see that rolling through the fourth quarter as well. And the third question, Roxanne?","Roxanne Meyer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Was just commenting on California weather early in November?","John G. Call","We don't comment midmonth on sales at this point, Roxanne.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Alex Fuhrman from Piper Jaffray.","Alex J. Fuhrman - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Would like to ask about the continued strength that you guys are having in the Juniors category. I mean, it seems like now, you're starting to lap outperformance in that category now for a little bit of time now. It's been a little bit more than a year now. So I guess my question is as you think about a lot of the department stores have been calling that out as a category of weakness, as we try to get a sense of if this is a long-term secular shift or not, what are you seeing in terms of the average basket size and units per transaction within that category? Do you get a sense that Juniors customer is putting entire outfits together at Ross, or is she really more supplementing her existing wardrobe with more incremental smaller purchases?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Alex, I'll try to answer that. I think Michael had mentioned in his comments that Juniors was one of our strongest-performing businesses in Q3. In fact, we've been very happy with the Juniors business over the last couple of years. Juniors has always been an important business area for us. We attract -- or within our demographics, we certainly have a number of younger customers, and they are attracted to that Juniors business. In terms of some of the subtleties of what you asked about, in terms of how are they shopping, I don't think we really have a sense of that. All we know is that, like our other customers, they're looking for a bargain, and clearly, we've been able to satisfy them over the past couple of years, and that's what's driven the success [ph] of that business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Montagna from Avondale Partners.","Mark K. Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","I've got a question just about the Midwest and also the Home category. Can you tell us roughly how many stores you have in the Midwest that are in the comp basis for the new territories that you just went into? And then how you have, perhaps, adjusted the assortment to be more tailored for the winter month there versus the rest of the country? And then just going back to the Home category, can you just review with us when you started to see the weakness in your Home category?  Because I know you mentioned previously that you thought it was a little off-track.  And at what point did you feel that you've gotten it back on track to where you'd like it to be on the right trajectory?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Mark, on the first piece of that, the number of stores in the comp base in the Midwest, at this point, there are no stores in the comp base. We opened the stores -- the first stores in the Midwest were opened last October, and we wait a year and a few months before we actually put those in the comp base. I think your second question was about assortment changes, and I'll make a few comments. Since we've been in Midwest, we've looked to what's selling, what's working, and we've made adjustments, no different to what we would do in any other region. So nothing dramatic, just some tweaks here and there in terms of the assortments. And I think your third question was about Home.","Michael Balmuth","And Home, we saw some issues starting in first quarter, and by third quarter, we were seeing portions of Home get back on track, and we're feeling good about our prospects going forward and getting the rest of it on track.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Daniel Hofkin with William Blair & Company.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just one follow-up to an earlier question about the kind of competitive environment. I guess, aside from the issue of hours around Thanksgiving and whatnot, from a pricing or other competitive standpoint, I mean, looking back over your last few third quarter earnings releases, your language is somewhat boilerplate and cautious, and I know that you try to be a cautious management team.  But is there anything from a pricing or other competitive standpoint that you feel is changing this year versus the same time last year? That would be my first question, then I have a follow-up.","Michael Balmuth","We're not seeing the pricing being more severe than a year ago, no, at this point.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So it's mostly just kind of the tempo around hours around Thanksgiving so far?","Michael Balmuth","Well, you have that.  There is some concern out there that retailers who have a big presence in the Northeast, which is most companies, got hurt with Sandy and might promote a little more aggressively than normal as we move through the month and the holiday season.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then back to the Midwest stores, could you talk about, aside from the fact that they're not in the comp base yet, how you feel they're performing at this point relative to your expectation?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Sure. So Daniel, I think I've mentioned we first opened stores in the Midwest in October of 2011. At this point, we have -- if you combine all the states in the Midwest, we have over 30 stores at this point. But they're all relatively new, so it's kind of too early to provide a full assessment of the sales performance, but the early signs are very positive. The reception we've gotten from the customer base has been great. So everything we've seen in terms of early sales, customer research, \"down on the ground\" customer feedback, reinforces for us our belief that we're going to be successful in these markets long term.","Operator","This concludes the Q&A portion of the call. I'll turn it back for any closing comments.","Michael Balmuth","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts and other matters that are based on the company's current forecast of the aspects of its future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today's press release and the company's fiscal 2012 Form 10-K and fiscal 2013 Form 8-Ks on file with the SEC.","I would now like to turn the call over to Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer.","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. I will be presenting the prepared remarks today, along with John Call, our Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Michael Balmuth, our Vice Chairman and CEO, is under the weather and could not be with us this afternoon.","Also on the call are Norman Ferber, Chairman of the Board; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; Michael Hartshorn, Senior Vice President and Deputy CFO; and Connie Wong, Director of Investor Relations.","We will begin with a brief review of our first quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.","As noted in today's press release, we are pleased with the slightly better than expected sales and earnings we delivered in the first quarter, especially considering this growth was achieved on top of strong prior year gains. These results continue to be driven by our ongoing ability to offer terrific bargains to today's value-oriented consumers.","Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended May 4, 2013, were $1.07, a 15% increase on top of a 26% gain in the prior year. Net earnings for this 2013 first quarter grew 12% to $234.6 million. First quarter sales rose 8% to $2,540,000,000, up from $2,357,000,000 in the first quarter of 2012.","Comparable store sales for the 13 weeks ended May 4, 2013, rose 3% over the 13 weeks ended May 5, 2012. This compared to a robust 9% same-store sales gain for the 13 weeks ended April 28, 2012. The strongest merchandise categories during the quarter were Juniors and Accessories, while the best-performing regions were the Pacific Northwest, the Southwest and California.","Earnings before interest and taxes grew to a record 14.9% of sales, up from 14.4% in the first quarter of 2012. This increased level of profitability was mainly driven by higher merchandise gross margin and also benefited from favorable timing of expenses. John will provide some additional color on these operating margin trends in a few minutes.","As we ended first quarter, total consolidated inventories increased about 8% compared to the prior year, with average in-store inventories down about 3%. Packaway as a percentage of total inventories was even with last year at 45%. Both Ross and dd's DISCOUNTS sales and profits continue to benefit from our ability to flow a larger percentage of fresh merchandise to our stores by operating our business with lower inventory levels. dd's sales and profitability improved in the first quarter as each merchandise offerings also continued to resonate well with their target customers. Our store expansion program remains on track with about 80 locations scheduled to open during 2013, comprised of approximately 60 Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS.","Now John will provide further color on the first quarter results and details on our second quarter guidance.","John G. Call","Thank you, Michael. Our 3% comparable store sales gain in the first quarter was primarily driven by an increase in the size of the average basket. Operating margin grew by about 50 basis points in the quarter to 14.9%.","A 45-basis-point improvement in the cost of goods sold was mainly driven by higher merchandise margin, which grew by about 50 basis points over last year, including approximately 5 basis points from a lower shrink accrual. Freight and distribution costs declined by approximately 10 basis points each. The latter was mainly due to timing of packaway-related expenses. These favorable items were partially offset by approximately 15 basis points in higher buying costs and 10 basis points of deleveraging on occupancy.","Selling, general and administrative expenses declined about 5 basis points, mainly due to lower store expenses as a percent of sales.","During the first quarter, we repurchased 2.3 million shares for a total purchase price of $138 million. We are on track in 2013 to buy back about half of our new 2-year $1.1 billion authorization or approximately $550 million in common stock.","Let's turn now to our second quarter guidance. For the 13 weeks ending August 3, 2013, we are targeting same-store sales to increase 1% to 2% over the 13 weeks ended August 4, 2012. This compares to a strong 7% increase in last year's second quarter. Earnings per share for the second quarter of 2013 are projected to be in the range of $0.89 to $0.93, up from $0.81 last year. This represents forecasted EPS growth of 10% to 15% on top of a 27% increase in the second quarter of 2012.","Our EPS targets for this year's second quarter are based on the following assumptions. Total sales are expected to grow about 6% to 7%, driven by a combination of new store growth, and as previously mentioned, same-store sales that are forecast to be up 1% to 2%. We plan to open about 26 net new stores during the period, including 19 Ross Dress for Less and 7 dd's DISCOUNTS. We are targeting operating margin to be flat to up 20 basis points on top of an exceptional 110-basis-point increase in the prior year for a projected range of 12.8% to 13%. We are planning net interest expense to be approximately $500,000, and our tax rate is expected to be about 38%. We also estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding of about 217 million.","Moving to our outlook for the year. As noted in today's press release, we now project earnings per share for the 52 weeks ending February 1, 2014, to be in the range of $3.70 to $3.81. This compares to our initial forecast of $3.65 to $3.80 and earnings per share of $3.53 in fiscal 2012.","As previously reported, the 53rd week last year added about $0.10 to earnings per share in fiscal 2012. This updated guidance range reflects that approximately $0.02 of the above planned earnings per share result in the first quarter is related to favorable timing of expenses that are expected to shift into subsequent quarters within the fiscal year.","Finally, as a reminder, we will no longer be reporting sales or providing sales guidance on a monthly basis.","Now I'll turn the call back to Michael for closing comments.","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Thank you, John. Again, we are pleased with our solid first quarter performance, especially considering our strong prior year comparisons and the ongoing uncertain macroeconomic retail and political environment. We remain well positioned as an off-price retailer with an ongoing focus on offering compelling discounts on name brand fashions to today's value-focused customers.","Looking ahead, we will stay focused on the most critical drivers of our business. First, we will continue to make strategic investments in our merchandise organization. Prioritizing and expanding these resources remains the key to further increasing our very large vendor base and our access to the best name brand bargains in the marketplace.","Secondly, as we have said before, we continue to fine-tune our systems and processes to plan and allocate at a much more detailed level, which strengthens our ability to deliver great bargains to the right store at the right time. This initiative is more important than ever, especially with the lower levels of inventory we now carry, plus our current expansion into new markets.","Over the balance of 2013, we are planning selling store inventories to be down in the low single-digit range versus the prior year. As you know, operating on leaner inventories has improved sales, inventory turns and gross margin for many years now.","Finally, we continue to implement numerous productivity enhancements and efficiencies throughout the company. These programs have helped us to strictly manage expenses in our distribution centers, stores organization and back-office functions.","The successful execution of these initiatives has dramatically improved our sales productivity and profitability over the past several years. We believe our ongoing focus on these priorities will maximize our opportunities for future growth in sales and profits over both the short and long term.","At this point, we would like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Daniel Hofkin with William Blair & Company.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And just a couple of quick questions as it relates to the sales trend. Over the balance of the year, I know you're -- it sounds like you're keeping the 1% to 2% full year comp plan. How would you expect traffic versus ticket to contribute for the year as a whole?","John G. Call","So Daniel, in the first quarter, traffic was fairly flat. The contribution came from the average basket, which was up slightly. That kind of stuff is tough to predict. We think we do a good job of putting attractive bargains in front of customers. That helps drive traffic. So we don't plan our business around necessarily what we think traffic or basket is going to do, but the customers tend to self-select. So I would expect more of the same, comps up 1% to 2%, traffic flat to up slightly.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And as it relates to margin expectations for the second quarter or for the full year, can you shed any more light in terms of between gross and SG&A, what your expectations are?","John G. Call","Sure. Implicit in the guidance is inventory, as we said, would be down kind of low single digits. That implies faster turns on a 1% to 2% comp. So we would expect some incremental gross margin increase, partially offset by some deleverage in G&A.","Operator","And your next question comes from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. So 2 questions. One, can you talk to us about what's going on with your Home-related business, which I think had been an area where you had as well [ph] but were making some changes there. Are we starting to see any benefit or traction from those changes? And then secondly, can you tell us how your new markets are performing, Chicago, particularly, been there now for at least a year, I think, as part of the comp base. So can you talk to us about how the stores are comping and how the initial productivity is, et cetera?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Sure. So Mike, on your first question about Home, we actually feel good about the progress that we're making in Home. As we came into the year, we had a plan to strengthen assortments in the Home business, and that plan is on track. So we're feeling good about the progress we're making there. On your second question regarding new markets, as you referenced, we entered the Midwest region in October of 2011. So it's still relatively early, but everything we've seen so far in terms of sales, customer research, our on-the-ground customer feedback has been positive. So we're feeling good about how those markets are going. At this point, although you -- as you mentioned, there are a few stores that have turned comp, they haven't been comped for very long. So I wouldn't call out those or talk about those specifically.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. But those new markets, in line with plan, above plan, below plan, as expected?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","They're on plan to slightly better, yes.","Operator","And your next question comes from Brian Tunick with JPMorgan.","Brian J. Tunick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess, sorry to do it to you again, but regarding a lot of calls around J. C. Penney and perhaps they're going to be more promotional in driving traffic, so just hoping you could maybe talk about any data you have regarding maybe your perspective of where market share might have come from the last couple of years and maybe anything you can share about your core shopper. How many different retailers do you think they visit, so it's not just about J. C. Penney, I think, as we look at 2013?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Sure. Brian, I think as we've spoken before, I think one of the most important characteristics about the apparel retailing market is just how fragmented it is. There are many, many competitors. And as a result of that, we never take our customers for granted. They have plenty of choice about where they shop. And the important thing for us is that we focus on delivering great bargains. And if we do that, then frankly, it doesn't really matter what any single competitor does. We know we'll do well. And one other point I would make specific to -- you referenced J. C. Penney -- specific to J. C. Penney, is that obviously, J. C. Penney had a promotional strategy, I think, until February of 2012. And if you look at the years leading up to that, we did very nicely. So if they go back to the future, I don't think it will cause us too much concern in terms of our long-term trend.","Operator","And your next question comes from Laura Champine with Canaccord.","Laura A. Champine - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","My question is about the sales guidance. It looks really conservative just given what we're hearing from other retailers, and I know you don't have exposure to the nasty weather in the Northeast. But your trend in the most recent month was really strong. The 1% to 2% comp guidance for this quarter, what's driving that?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","When we came into the year, Laura, we cited a few sort of headwinds that were built into our guidance, the -- some economic issues, the higher payroll taxes, sequester cuts, and then frankly, the fact that we're up against very strong comps from the last few years. So frankly, none of those things have changed. We're happy with how we did in the first quarter, but those economic headwinds are still there. And frankly, if you look at it over a sort of 3-year stacked basis, our guidance actually seems pretty reasonable. So maybe the guidance is a little bit conservative, and we'd certainly hope to do better. But right now, we're comfortable with that sales guidance.","Operator","And your next question comes from John Kernan with Cowen.","John D. Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So I guess, thematically, how much faster can you guys turn inventory? And how much more can you possibly benefit from lower in-store inventory levels from a merch margin perspective? And then I've got one follow-up.","Michael B. O'Sullivan","At this point, John, we think maybe there's some additional incremental opportunity, which is why we're trimming inventories again this year. And certainly, our sales trend doesn't seem to have suffered from that. So I think the real answer is we don't know how much opportunity there is left. We think there's probably some, but at this point, it's probably incremental.","John D. Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And then can you talk about some of the buying opportunities you've had given some of the weather volatility that's affected full-price retail?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Sure. It's actually -- it's hard for us to isolate the drivers of supply, whether it's weather or the economy or competitive issues, but talking with Michael Balmuth earlier and talking with the merchants, I know we're very happy about the supply that we're seeing.","Operator","And your next question comes from Marni Shapiro with Retail Tracker.","Mark Friedman","It's Mark Friedman pinch-hitting for Marni. Can you talk a little bit more detail about some of the strategic investments in the merchandise organization. Is there anything new that you've done in the last couple of months since you reported year end or the way you're thinking about it going for 2014?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Mark, I think people who have followed us for some years know that we've long regarded the merchant organization as critical. It's sort of the key strategic asset that you have in off-price. So we've invested a lot over the years in terms of developing one of the best merchant organizations that there is. So it's really been a very long-term program and long-term initiative for us. I wouldn't say there's anything new that we've done. It's just more of the same in terms of strengthening that merchant group.","Operator","And your next question comes from David Mann with Johnson Rice.","David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","In terms of the comment you made earlier about traffic, in past years, even in, I think, the fourth quarter, you saw nice traffic gain, so I'm just curious if you can put some context on to why you think traffic might be moderating now? And do you have any efforts to specifically to try and drive traffic or expand the customer reach?","John G. Call","David, that traffic number, which was flattish, that doesn't concern us a whole lot. It ebbs and flows, a point here, a point there, so we don't think it's a -- necessarily a bad fact in terms of what we have going on. Our comps came through. Our sales came through. We're seeing good flow. So we're not overly concerned.","David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","And then the ticket gain, is that coming more from units or price?","John G. Call","Mainly coming from price, at least in the quarter it was.","David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of SG&A, I think on the last call and previous calls, you've talked about being able to leverage your leverage point for expenses at about 1% to 2%. I guess in the first quarter, you didn't necessarily leverage -- or hardly levered with a higher comp, and then for the year, you're not talking about it too much. So are you seeing a higher level of expense? Or is that leverage point changing at all?","John G. Call","No, we think -- so we may have said 1% to 2%. Really, when we look at it, it's probably 2% to 3%. There's timing issues between quarters, all that sort of thing. But on the year, we think 3% will -- should deliver some leverage, flat to some, and that's kind of where we are.","Operator","And your next question comes from Oliver Chen with Citigroup.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Regarding a longer-term question, where do you think your operating margin can go? And will that be more gross margin or SG&A leverage driven? And as a follow-up, if you could -- it sounds like there's a lot of opportunity domestic bricks and mortar, but could you update us on your thoughts on global and e-comm?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Sure. Oliver, on your first question about margins, if you look at what's happened to our margin over the past several years, there's really been 3 drivers of our improved margin. One is lower markdowns, which has been driven by tighter inventory controls. The second is lower shrink, which has been driven by specific initiatives we've made around shortage control. And then the third has been expense leverage on ahead-of-plan sales. So when you think about those 3 drivers, we think that there's no reason why we should give up on any of them. We don't see margins declining because we're not going to walk away from any of those 3. But if you look at where the opportunities are going forward, for incremental margin, it's really in that third one, further expense leverage from ahead-of-plan sales, which is the hardest thing to predict. So to answer your question, we think there might be some additional opportunity in margin, but it's really around sales. And if we can -- if the sales are there, we'll be able to drive margin further. On your second question about e-commerce, as we've commented in the past, our assessment is that in e-commerce, it's very hard for an off-price business to make money, particularly at lower price points and at the price points that we operate at, with the cost of shipping, the cost of marketing, taking returns, et cetera. The economics just don't add up. Now most of the activity in the last few years externally has been with companies that operate at much higher price points, price points that we don't really compete at. And even those companies appear to be struggling to make money. So we don't regard e-commerce as a high priority, at least not right now. For us, the priority is really our bricks and mortar business, our off-line business where we know we can be successful, we know we have strong returns, and we have plenty of growth opportunity. So that's really where our focus is.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And as a quick follow-up, could you just tell us how you feel about the health of the consumer? Do you feel like you continue to see volatile trends in relation to how macroeconomically that customer -- what kind of challenges they might be facing?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Sure. I mean, our observation is that the overriding characteristic about this economy is it's very unpredictable and that the consumer remains pretty stretched and that they're looking for value. And in that kind of environment, we would expect, I think you would expect that the off-price model, when it's well executed, should do pretty well.","Operator","And your next question comes from Roxanne Meyer with UBS.","Roxanne Meyer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I'm just wondering, first, if you could share any benefit from the calendar shift both in 1Q and looking ahead to the remaining quarters of the year, just how timing may have an impact on the cadence of your earnings? And then second, Juniors has been a source of strength for you guys for a while now. Just wondering if you've noticed any difference in trends between the consumer who is purchasing that category, whether disproportionately driving traffic or price or units versus some of your other demographics?","John G. Call","On the first question about the calendar, Roxanne, there is a shift that favors the first part of the year. We have a week kind of dislocation. It doesn't match up from a sales reporting standpoint versus a fiscal or earnings reporting standpoint. It's probably worth about 1 point comp. That comes back in the back half. So the back half is actually hurt by about 1 point comp, so there's a 2-point swing between first half and back half in terms of our business and what that extra week meant.","Michael B. O'Sullivan","And then, Roxanne, on your second question about the Juniors business, as we mentioned in the remarks, the Juniors business was one of our top performing categories in Q1. And I would go on to say I think the Juniors business has long been an important business for us. It's a pretty well developed business for us. And we feel good about that business. I think we feel good about that customer segment. We've always done well with the younger customer.","Operator","And your next question comes from Mark Montagna with Avondale Partners.","Mark K. Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Just a follow-up on that calendar shift question. Is there -- beyond just the comps, is there a margin shift beyond, say, leverage such as merchandise margin that might get shifted around because of the calendar change?","John G. Call","There's a couple of other things implicit to our calendar. So recall that in the third quarter last year, we picked up a couple of cents based on a shortage true-up. That isn't in the plan or the guidance so far. And remember, the 53rd week, as we mentioned in the recorded comments, we picked up an extra $0.10. If you put that all together and normalize for everything, on the 1% to 2% comp, our guidance is that we'll grow earnings 8% to 11% for the year.","Mark K. Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Right. But I'm thinking in terms of if you shift a week out of the third quarter into the second quarter, is that week that's being shifted a high-margin week or a low-margin week? Because I'm running across other retailers where there's an interesting dynamic that is actually kind of meaningful that way?","John G. Call","Yes, it may see more sales. I don't think it has to do with the kind of margin percent between the quarters, it's mainly a substitute.","Mark K. Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then the distribution expenses that are going to rise in the future with packaway, is that -- should we just view that as evenly distributed between first -- second through fourth quarters?","John G. Call","Yes, I'd say it's probably -- at least -- that one's a little hard to predict. Packaway is, based on where the market conditions were, came in a little bit higher than we had anticipated coming in. And right now, we'd assume that, that would flip in the second to third quarters, but we'll have to see what opportunities look like.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Dutch Fox with FBR Capital Markets.","Dutch Fox - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I wanted to ask you a couple of quick questions about dd's. Just being in the stores and looking at them, they appear to be improving. Actually, they look very good year-over-year. I know you only talk about that concept directionally, but could you give us or help us a little bit with understanding how the dd's fleet is performing compared to the Ross Dress for Less stores? And also, how you expect that to evolve over the course of the year? And I don't have it in front of me, but have you talked about whether or not the concept is going to be accretive this year, and if so, how much?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Dutch, on the first part of that question regarding dd's, we don't disclose dd's financials separately mainly because the business just isn't material to the overall size of the corporation. But I would make some comments. We're very happy with dd's performance. And one thing I'd call out is, like Ross, dd's has benefited over the last few years from lower inventory levels. By controlling inventories, we've been able to drive the proportion of fresh merchandise that the shopper sees at dd's, and that's also helped with margin. So overall, we're pretty happy with the trajectory of that business.","John G. Call","And relative to its profitability, we're happy, like Michael said, with the four-wall contribution, and it does tend to be slightly accretive, as it was last year.","Dutch Fox - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And that's included in your existing guidance?","John G. Call","That's correct.","Operator","And your next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Sterne Agee.","Irwin Bernard Boruchow - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to touch on some of the investments that you'll be making, I guess, towards the end of this year in terms of the 2 new distribution centers that will be going up. Can you remind us the timing of when those will start to come into play and if there will be any impact on the P&L in terms of any incremental expenses? And if there are, would that be towards the end of this year or the beginning of next year? And just kind of how to think that through.","John G. Call","Sure. So CapEx this year is planned at about $670 million. If you remember, that is up pretty significantly from the $424 million we spent last year. The biggest driver of that is around the 2 new distribution centers that we're building. They're sketched to open, one in 2014, the first part of 2014, and then the other in 2015. So as it relates to the 2013 P&L, there's no impact.","Operator","And we have no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to our presenters.","Michael B.

The call will begin with prepared comments by management followed by a question-and-answer session. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations of their future growth and financial results including sales and earnings forecasts and other matters that are based on the company's current forecast of aspects of its future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today's press release and the company's fiscal 2015 Form 10-K and fiscal 2016 Form 10-Q and 8-K's on file with the SEC.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer.","Barbara Rentler - Ross Stores, Inc.","Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Balmuth, Executive Chairman; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Vice President, Investor Relations. We'll begin our call today with a review of our fourth quarter and 2016 performance followed by our outlook for 2017. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.","As noted in today's press release, we are very pleased with our better than expected sales and earnings results for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year, especially given our strong multi-year comparisons and the highly competitive and promotional holiday season. Our results continue to benefit from our ability to offer customers great values on a wide assortment of gifts and fashions for the family and the home.","Earnings per share for the fourth quarter grew 17% to $0.77 on net earnings that rose 14% to $301 million. Sales for the quarter increased 8% to $3.5 billion with comparable store sales up 4% on top of last year's 4% gain. For the 2016 fiscal year, earnings per share grew 13% to $2.83, while net earnings rose 10% to $1.1 billion. Sales grew 8% to $12.9 billion with comparable sales up 4% on top of a 4% gain in 2015. dd's DISCOUNTS customers also responded positively to its merchandise assortment which led to solid growth in sales and operating profits at dd's for both the quarter and fiscal 2016.","For the fourth quarter, shoes and men's were the best performing merchandise categories at Ross, while the Midwest and Southeast were the strongest regions. Our fourth quarter operating margin of 13.6% was up 90 basis points from last year. This improvement was mainly driven by our above-plan sales along with a favorable comparison of packaway-related cost versus last year's fourth quarter.","For the full year, operating margin increased 40 basis points to a new record of 14%. As we ended 2016, total consolidated inventories were up 7% over the prior year with packaway levels at 49% of total inventories compared to 47% last year. Average in-store inventories were up slightly at year-end.","As noted in today's press release, our board authorized a new program to repurchase $1.75 billion of our common stock over the next two fiscal years. This represents a 25% increase over the prior two year $1.4 billion authorization that was completed at the end of the fourth quarter. The board also approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.16 per share, up 19% on top of a 15% increase in the prior year. The continued growth of our shareholder payouts reflects our ongoing confidence in the company's ability to generate significant amounts of cash after funding our growth and the other capital needs of our business. We have repurchased stock as planned every year since 1993 and raised our cash dividend annually since its inception in 1994. This consistent record also reflects our unwavering commitment to enhancing stockholder value and returns.","Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our 2016 results and details on our fiscal 2017 full year and first quarter guidance.","Michael J. Hartshorn - Ross Stores, Inc.","Thank you, Barbara. Let's start with our fourth quarter results. Our 4% comparable stores sales gain was driven by a combination of higher traffic and an increase in the size of the average basket. As Barbara mentioned, fourth quarter operating margins increased 90 basis points to 13.6%. Cost of goods sold improved by 110 basis points in the quarter, driven primarily by 65 basis points of lower distribution expenses mainly from the timing of packaway-related costs that negatively impacted last year's fourth quarter. Merchandise margin improved by 15 basis points while buying and occupancy costs were lower by 40 basis points and 5 basis points, respectively. These improvements were partially offset by a 15 basis point increase in freight costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period increased approximately 20 basis points due mainly to higher wages.","Turning to our stock buyback program. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.6 million shares for a total purchase price of $170 million, which completed our previous two-year $1.4 billion stock repurchase program. For the year, we repurchased a total of 11.6 million shares for an aggregate price of $700 million.","Let's turn now to our guidance for 2017. Earnings per share for fiscal 2017 are forecast to be $3.02 to $3.15, up 7% to 11% from $2.83 in fiscal 2016. Incorporated in this guidance range is an estimated benefit to earnings per share of approximately $0.08 from the 53rd week in 2017. And $0.03 in a lower tax rate related to our adoption of the new share-based payment accounting standard. The operating statement assumptions for fiscal 2017 include the following. Total sales for the 53 weeks ending February 3, 2018 are forecast to grow 6% to 7%. Comparable store sales on a 52-week basis ending January 27, 2018 are expected to increase 1% to 2% on top of a 4% gain in 2016.","We plan to add about 70 Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores. If same-store sales are in line with our guidance of up 1% to 2%, then we would project operating margin for 2017 to be in the range of 13.9% to 14.1%. This EBIT margin range assumes merchandise margin for 2017 will be relatively flat on top of strong growth over the past several years. Also incorporated in this operating margin guidance is an estimated benefit of about 15 basis points from the 53rd week.","Net interest expense is estimated to be $13 million. Our tax rate is projected to be approximately 37% to 38%. We expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 386 million. Capital expenditures in 2017 are projected to be approximately $400 million. And depreciation and amortization expense inclusive of stock-based amortization is forecast to be about $400 million, up from $377 million in 2016.","Let's move now to our first quarter guidance. For the 13 weeks ending April 29, 2017, we are projecting same-store sales to be up 1% to 2%. Earnings per share for the period are forecast to be $0.76 to $0.79. Included in this guidance is an estimated $0.02 benefit from a lower tax rate related to the aforementioned adoption of the new share-based payment accounting standard.","Other assumptions that support our first quarter guidance include the following. Total sales are projected to increase 4% to 5%. We expect to open 23 new Ross and 5 dd's DISCOUNTS locations during the quarter. First quarter operating margin is projected to be 14.7% to 14.9% compared to last year's 15.4%. The forecasted decline in EBIT is mainly due to higher wage and freight costs. In addition, net interest expense for the quarter is estimated to be about $3.5 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 36% to 37%, resulting from the previously mentioned accounting change. And finally, weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be around 390 million.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments.","Barbara Rentler - Ross Stores, Inc.","Thank you, Michael. Again, we are very pleased with our better than expected financial performance for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year. As previously mentioned, this is notable considering our own robust sales and earnings growth over the past several years and the ongoing competitive retail climate. As we look ahead to 2017, there continues to be a great deal of uncertainty in the political, macroeconomic, and retail climates. In addition, we face tough prior year sales and earnings comparisons.","As a result, while we hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to remain somewhat cautious in planning our business for the coming year. Nevertheless, we are confident that the off-price sector will remain a strong performing segment of retail especially given consumers' continued focus on value. This combined with our proven ability to deliver exceptional values our customers have come to expect, makes us optimistic about our prospects for future growth. As a result, over the longer term, we continue to believe we can achieve average annual earnings per share gains in the low-double-digit percentage range.","At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question is from Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thank you so much. Congratulations on a really terrific finish to a great year. I'm wondering, Michael, I think you mentioned that inventory at the end of the fourth quarter in store is up slightly. That seems to be, I think over the last several quarters in the last several years it was down slightly. It seems like maybe you're getting to the point where inventory's turning about as fast as it can turn in store, and so now you're maybe looking a little bit more at sort of stable inventory to up slightly. Is it a change in strategy or is there something going on with the timing? And then if you might comment, you obviously can choose not to, but if you saw any softness in \u2013 I think there was a delay in tax return payments. It seems to be affecting some retailers in, let's say, the second and third week of February. Did you see any kind of mid-month softness, and if so, have you seen a reacceleration since then? Thanks so much.","Michael J. Hartshorn - Ross Stores, Inc.","Sure, Kimberly. On inventory, I think at the end of the year, it's timing. As you know, we've reduced inventory by over 40% over the last number of years. I think our perspective is at this point that we'd expect stable inventories going forward. There's not additional room for improvement in that strategy or process, though. I think as we look forward to 2017, we'd expect our in-store inventory levels to be relatively flat year-over-year. In terms of tax refunds, it's been our practice not to comment on inter-quarter trends.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks so much, Michael.","Operator","The next question is from Omar Saad from Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Thank you. Good afternoon. Great quarter. Great year. I wanted to see if I can get you to give a little bit more color on the comment you made around merchandise margins. It sounded like you think they're going to flatten out a little bit this year after some nice expansion over the recent years. Is there something going on in the mix dynamic there? It sounds like basket is still rising, but I'm not sure about unit prices. But would love kind of any detail of how you're thinking about the evolution of the merch margin component of gross margin.","Michael J. Hartshorn - Ross Stores, Inc.","Sure, Omar. As we said in our comments, the planning assumption going into the year that they'd be relatively flat, and that's very simply based on anniversarying many years of strong merchandise margin gains as well as what we believe to be an ongoing challenging and promotional retail environment.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Okay, great. And then could I ask about the home category? You're seeing a lot of retailers really go after this category. It's a big and important category for you guys too of course. I mean, are you seeing changes in the dynamics around that that part of the business? Or do you still feel that that's a key component of the growth strategy going forward? Thanks.","Barbara Rentler - Ross Stores, Inc.","Sure. I think home is definitely a very important category for us and has been an important category in all of this year. But what I would also add to that \u2013 and we feel good about home, but what I would also add to that is we believe that we have growth opportunities beyond home throughout the rest of our business.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Thank you very much. Good luck in 2017.","Michael J. Hartshorn - Ross Stores, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Laura Champine from Roe Equity Research.","Laura Allyson Champine - Roe Equity Research, LLC","Good afternoon. I mean, there's obviously a lot of speculation about a potential tax or tariff on imports. What's your thinking on that and what would your strategy be if something like that were to be rolled out?","Michael J. Hartshorn - Ross Stores, Inc.","Sure, Laura. Obviously, for us, direct imports comprise a very small portion of our overall business. I'd say it's still too early to speculate on what specific tax policies will actually get enacted. But we'll continue to watch it closely. For us, volatility has historically been a good thing for our price.","Laura Allyson Champine - Roe Equity Research, LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good afternoon. You called out a couple of pressures for first quarter margins, freight and wages. Can you expand on that and just talk a little bit about how you see that playing out through the year? What the drivers are and how big of an impact it'll have on earnings? Thank you.","Michael J. Hartshorn - Ross Stores, Inc.","Sure. So we said in the commentary that EBIT is planned down to 50 basis points to 70 basis points. For us, if sales perform in line with the 1% to 2% comp, we would lose some leverage on fixed cost. In addition, we expect wages to be greater headwind in the first half of the year than the back half as we raised wages in the middle of 2016. And then further we expect freight cost to be a headwind in 2017 as we've seen higher carrier rates. In terms of the full year guidance, stripping out the 53rd week and the impact of the accounting change, we're guiding up 3% to 7% on a 1% to 2% comp. And that's very consistent with how we've guided previous years. With the 53rd week included, it shows EBIT margin relatively flat, and then without the 53rd week, it's down slightly.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Binetti from UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Let me add my congrats on a great quarter and to a great year. Can we talk a little bit about how you're thinking about the year and maybe even maybe just in the front half as far as near-term planning, you've got the department stores who seem to be focused on lowering marked down levels in their stores, and are certainly buying inventories lighter. We did hear from a big competitor, Target, today talking about getting much more aggressive on pricing I think including categories where you guys would overlap. So how do you think about your competitive positioning here, and how do you think about relative pricing spread strategy in the near-term given some diverging strategies in the marketplace right now?","Barbara Rentler - Ross Stores, Inc.","Sure. I think the way we think about pricing is the way we always think about pricing. I mean, we go out. We look in the competitive market and we see what's out there. And we're in the value business, so our job is to make sure that the merchants are out there understanding the pricing and then buying so that we keep that value differential. So that is part of their ongoing job the way they do it in the fourth quarter. We've been in this highly promotional environment for an extended period of time, so Target is kind of an addition into the picture. But that is what we do every day for a living. And so going in with a conservative sales plan gives us the ability to chase back, and when we're chasing back, we're chasing back at values that we know are competitive to the outside world.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Great. And I think one thing that's been a little bit more noticeable I guess from the public companies that are brands that sell into the department stores, there seems to be a fairly urgent focus on getting inventories down and getting in front of a couple of years of quite a bit of excess. If we see that those brands do what they're planning and start reducing the inventories that they bring into the country, how do you think about \u2013 obviously, in the near-term, you'll always say there's good supply in the channel, but is there anything you should be thinking about longer term if the inventory availability were to tighten up on a strategic basis, more medium or longer term from those retailers?","Barbara Rentler - Ross Stores, Inc.","Sure. Let me \u2013 so, first, on the short-term in terms of as people tighten up on their supply, whether it's the vendors or in department stores, supply comes from a struggle with full-line retailers forecasting their sales. So in the shorter term, that's where a lot of goods come from, store closures, Penney's closed stores, closed stores. So in the short-term, that's where the supply comes from. In the longer term as we think about supply, we speculate about everything that could happen with a lot of changes that are going on out there. We're always studying the retail landscape and how that might change. And we're looking at that constantly. We don't see near-term supply issues in the next two to three years. So that's kind of how we're looking at supply at this moment in time. And over time, we may need to be more creative in terms of supply. But that's how we look at it today.","Michael B. O'Sullivan - Ross Stores, Inc.","And over the longer term, one of the things you've heard us talk about in the past is investing in our merchant organization. That's something we plan to continue to do. We regard that as frankly the best defense, the best strategic asset for long term success in the off-price sector.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","The next question is from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. On the SG&A front, is expense leverage possible this year at 3% same-store sales? Or do we need to think about that higher fixed cost hurdle this year just given the wages, just any other investments to consider or headwinds in the SG&A line?","Michael J. Hartshorn - Ross Stores, Inc.","Sure, Matthew. So for SG&A in 2016, the costs were up about 15 basis points. Obviously that was slightly above our 3% leverage point. That said, we were obviously pleased with our overall operating margin expansion. Our guidance for 2017 projects SG&A leverage at about the 3% leverage point, which is consistent with our historical levels.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Best of luck.","Operator","The next question is from Simeon Siegel from Nomura\/Instinet.","Simeon A. Siegel - Nomura\/Instinet","Thanks. Good afternoon. Do you know and could you share roughly what percent of your traffic increases come from new customers versus repeat visits. And maybe what's your shoppers' average trips per year? How does that look now versus the past several years?","Michael B. O'Sullivan - Ross Stores, Inc.","Yeah, it's hard to break that out, Simeon. We do regular customer research, where we try and identify existing customers versus new customers, but it gets pretty murky in terms of if someone had shopped off-price a couple of years ago, do they still count as an existing customer or are they a new customer? The one thing that we take from the research is that what the new customers and the existing customers are both looking for is the same set of things. It's the same set of \u2013 well, basically great values. But in terms of splitting them out like that, it's a little more difficult to answer that question.","Simeon A. Siegel - Nomura\/Instinet","Okay, great. And then just you ended the year with just meaningfully higher cash, recognizing the authorization, the quarterly dividend, any other uses of cash we should consider or do we assume the growing cash continues to flow to the dividends and repurchases? And do you guys have a target payout ratio you can share?","Michael J. Hartshorn - Ross Stores, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, I would answer generally to say we have a long history of delivering excess cash to shareholders. And we've done that in a planned and deliberate fashion, so anytime we look at the deployment of cash, we're looking at it over kind of a longer period. But that process is at the same time of maintaining a very strong balance sheet. So I would not expect that to change going forward. And the significant increases in our dividend and share buyback programs announced today reflect that commitment.","Simeon A. Siegel - Nomura\/Instinet","Great. Thanks a lot. Best of luck for the year.","Michael J. Hartshorn - Ross Stores, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Brian Tunick from RBC.","Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon. I'll add my congrats as well. I guess two questions. Curious, I guess, Barbara, on the merchandise categories, I know certainly here in Q1 from last year, there was some noise around some of the missy and sportswear products. Can you maybe talk about do you think there's a great opportunity here in the first quarter to course correct some of the issues last year, even though we have a later Easter? And then second question on store plans for 2017, can you maybe discuss, are you guys planning to enter new markets both for Ross and dd's and how we should be thinking about the rollout from a geographic perspective? Thanks very much.","Barbara Rentler - Ross Stores, Inc.","Sure. I'll take the first part on ladies sportswear. We feel like, in 2016, we made progress in improving our assortments. And we believe that we've made the right adjustments for our ladies merchandising strategy. And that will take us to leading to further improvement in 2017.","Michael J. Hartshorn - Ross Stores, Inc.","On \u2013 go ahead.","Michael B. O'Sullivan - Ross Stores, Inc.","On those store plans, Brian, our store plans for new stores this year are very much in line with the last few years: 80 to 90 new stores a year. In terms of new markets, as we categorize it, the Midwest for some years now has been our major new market, major new region. That continues to be how we think about new markets. There's no additional new markets outside of the Midwest that we're planning to move into this year.","Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And same for dd's?","Michael B. O'Sullivan - Ross Stores, Inc.","That's right.","Operator","The next question is from Paul Lejuez from Citi.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey, thanks guys. We saw a bunch of Macy's stores close about a year ago, 40 stores. Just curious if you've tracked how your stores in those markets have performed? And separately, if you could, just talk about what were your weaker regions and categories in the fourth quarter? Thanks.","Michael J. Hartshorn - Ross Stores, Inc.","I'll start with the regional performance, Paul. As we mentioned, the Midwest and the Southeast were strongest. The Midwest obviously has been very strong region for us as the best performing category the last three years or so. Southeast likely benefited from favorable weather. I'd call out other major markets, California was in line. Texas performed below the chain average in Q4. For us, beyond the possible impact of the oil industry, we believe there were other factors that impacted the region including the stronger dollar as well as negative weather during the quarter.","Michael B. O'Sullivan - Ross Stores, Inc.","And, Paul, on your question about store closures, it's difficult to respond to specifically, the Macy's example that you gave, specifically how that affected our stores. There's just too much noise to pick out the effect of those individual store closures. What I would say, though, is in general, with store closures, competitor store closures, there's a short term effect which is as that competitor store is doing and going out of business now, that can impact our business negatively for the weeks of that happening. But then, obviously once that store is closed, there's one less competitor in the market. So in general, it tends to be a good thing for us in the medium- to long-term.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks, guys. Good luck.","Operator","The next question is from Oliver Chen from Cowen & Co.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks. Congrats and great results. Regarding this new stores, are there any thoughts on how the store of the future looks versus your existing store base? And also, as you just continue to have a great store base, what are your thoughts for remodels or how you continue to edit your existing stores? And any in-store initiatives, whether that be the cash wrap, the dressing room, or managing shrink to your liking in terms of what we should think about for next year?","Michael B. O'Sullivan - Ross Stores, Inc.","Sure. So, Oliver, in terms of how we think about our stores, we think about our stores very much in terms of a sort of evolution rather than a revolution. We look at different parts of the store and we look at opportunities, particularly in areas that are growing or categories that are growing very rapidly to maybe give them more room within the store, maybe give them new [fixed spring], that kind of thing. We also look at opportunities to update other aspects of the store, whether it's the front end or signage. But we do those on a sort of evolutionary basis, so it's not something that really happens overnight. There are individual initiatives obviously that roll out from year-to-year, but nothing dramatic that I would call your attention to at this point.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And on the accessories frontier, have you been pleased with the execution and are there opportunities? Or where do you think that category is heading with respect to what your buyers are seeing versus consumer demand?","Barbara Rentler - Ross Stores, Inc.","Our accessory business continues to be difficult. It trailed the chain in fourth quarter. In terms of what we see in the outside world, accessories is really driven by handbags, and handbags tends to be a weaker business in the outside world.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. Best regards.","Operator","The next question is from Adrienne Yih from Wolfe Research.","Adrienne Yih - Wolfe Research LLC","Good afternoon. Let me add my congratulations. My question is on packaway, I was wondering if you had any notable advantage from buying opportunistically last year either in margin or in helping comp? And then what is your in-season open to buy for the spring season? Thank you very much.","Michael J. Hartshorn - Ross Stores, Inc.","In general, in packaway, we see it as a sales driver, not a margin driver. So that's the way I think about it.","Barbara Rentler - Ross Stores, Inc.","Right. And in terms of spring, we're well positioned to take advantage of packaway opportunities.","Adrienne Yih - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question is from Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo.","Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, everyone. Let me add my congrats. Just to piggyback on Tunick's question that he asked, can you maybe update us on how the merchants are buying within the ladies apparel category right now? I think I remember you talked about merchants taking more conservative buying approach after the spring execution issues last year. So just trying to figure out, are we back to normal at this point within that category or still not quite yet?","Barbara Rentler - Ross Stores, Inc.","In terms of our buying approach, I guess I would say back to normal, whatever you're defining back to normal as. The merchants are out there shopping the market and buying it the way they see it. So I guess if that's how you're defining back to normal, that would be true.","Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Roxanne Meyer from MKM Partners.","Roxanne Meyer - MKM Partners LLC","Great. Thanks. And let me add my congratulations as well. My question is on CapEx this year. I'm just wondering your guide from new stores and relocations if there are any major projects that are being earmarked. And then in terms of the comp, the average transaction size being up, if you can break it down between AUR and units. Thanks.","Michael J. Hartshorn - Ross Stores, Inc.","Sure, Roxanne. On CapEx, so we're guiding it about $400 million. That's higher than 2016 which was the lowest level since 2011. So that was lower than normal. In terms of the breakout of the $400 million, about 30% is new stores, 30% is for store refreshes and maintenance capital, 15% for supply chain investments, and 25% for, call it, technology and other G&A capital. In terms of the components of sales, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, the 4% comp was driven by higher traffic and an increase in the size of the average basket. The higher basket was driven by higher units per transaction with AUR down slightly compared to last year.","Roxanne Meyer - MKM Partners LLC","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Michael J. Hartshorn - Ross Stores, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","The next question is from Bob Drbul from Guggenheim Securities.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi, good afternoon. I was just wondering if you could expand on the success you've seen in the most recent quarter in the footwear business. And with some of the store closures of competitors out there, are you seeing more willingness for brands that haven't sold you significantly in the past to be a little bit more open with availability for you?","Barbara Rentler - Ross Stores, Inc.","Sure. As it pertains to the footwear business, similar to our last two prior quarters, our shoe performance was very broad-based. In terms of the marketplace and competitors being open to selling us, I think we've shown over the years that we have really good vendor relationships, and I would say that most brands are open to doing business with us. Yes, they're open to doing business with us.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Mike Baker from Deutsche Bank. Mike Baker, your line is open.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hello? Hello? Hi, it's Mike, can you hear me?","Operator","Hi, Mike.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hello?","Michael J. Hartshorn - Ross Stores, Inc.","Hi. We can hear you.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, sorry, I completely messed that up. My fault. Anyway, I was going to ask you about the buying environment. In a number of relatively high profile vendors have sort of said they're not as open to selling to off-price as much as they were in the past. And I don't need to go down the list, but I'm sure you guys have heard the public comments from some big public vendors. So how does that impact you? I mean, have you frankly seen some of these vendors pull back already to selling to you guys? And does that change the way you think about going to market in the future?","Barbara Rentler - Ross Stores, Inc.","It's actually been a very positive buying environment. With the difficult fourth quarter, obviously there's supply in the marketplace, so I would say that, overall, high profile or broad-based all the way through moderate vendors, there's still been a willingness for people to sell us merchandise.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","But is there a concern that as you go through the year, that slows down when you have all these vendors saying publicly that they just don't want to sell as much to off-price?","Barbara Rentler - Ross Stores, Inc.","I think \u2013 I'm sorry, go ahead, Michael.","Michael B. O'Sullivan - Ross Stores, Inc.","Yeah, that's always a concern. We're always concerned about supply. But one point Barbara had made a little while ago is that what really drives supply is other retailers and their inability to forecast their own sales. And if they're not able to forecast their own sales, that tends to mean there's greater supply availability, so.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, okay, understood. If I could ask one more follow-up. Easter is three weeks later this year. Historically has that tended to help you guys as people have a longer season in which to buy Easter related products?","Michael J. Hartshorn - Ross Stores, Inc.","Mike, I think historically weather has had a more meaningful impact on performance during the first quarter than the timing of Easter, which is what we've seen in the past.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","The next question is from Marni Shapiro from Retail Tracker.","Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker","Hey, everybody. Congratulations on a great holiday and a great year. I'm curious \u2013 I know online is not a conversation for you as far as sales, but you do have sign-ups online and customers that are coming into your stores. So I'm curious are you seeing a growing file of people signing up online or even in stores? And what are you doing with these lists and are you considering any kind of consumer outreach or anything like that beyond just e-mails?","Michael B. O'Sullivan - Ross Stores, Inc.","Sure. So, Marni, we do have a database of customer e-mails. We do use that for some of our marketing activities. But more broadly beyond that, we also over the last few years have been experimenting with other forms of sort of online marketing whether it's direct online advertising or social media marketing. So that's how we think about it. There has been \u2013 we've been investing more in those media channels over the last few years, and that's driven a lot of the growth and a lot of the customer sign-ups. But it's really a marketing activity rather than a sort of a \u2013 in any way \u2013 it's not teeing up e-commerce in any way, it's really about marketing.","Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker","That makes sense. And are you guys finding any change in the hiring landscape out there as some of the department stores try to be off-pricers? I'm saying try with all seriousness. I don't think they're excelling at it.","Michael B. O'Sullivan - Ross Stores, Inc.","I'll let Barbara answer on the merchant side. On the operating side, no, no impact at all.","Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker","Okay.","Barbara Rentler - Ross Stores, Inc.","Are you trying to ask me if they're trying to steal our people, Marni?","Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker","Kind of. Or if you're finding it \u2013 or you're having to pay more or you're finding it more difficult to find people.","Barbara Rentler - Ross Stores, Inc.","Listen, I think we have a very strong merchant team. I think we have \u2013 Ross is a great culture. We have a lot of long tenured employees. And I think that in terms of the retail landscape and hiring people, there are obviously a lot of people out there that are now looking for jobs. And so we are kind of sorting our way through that. I think \u2013 listen, it's a very competitive market for talent. And I think people do look to try to steal our talent. But we do run pretty low turnover rates. And I think Ross \u2013 I can't be objective here, I think Ross is a great place to work. Yeah, so hopefully that answers your question.","Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker","It does. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question is from Lindsay Drucker Mann from Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to ask on wages, on the wage inflation you called out for calendar 2017, is the majority of that from mandated minimum wage increases? Or are there any other factors at play?","Michael J. Hartshorn - Ross Stores, Inc.","So, Lindsay, last year, we took our wages across the board in the company up to $10 an hour based on tenure. Obviously it includes mandated minimum wages and our upcoming guidance takes into consideration the mandates that we're aware of today.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Is there anything incremental that you guys expect outside of mandated increases in terms of your own effort to raise wages?","Michael J. Hartshorn - Ross Stores, Inc.","Not at this point.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then, Barbara, in your comments you refer a couple of times to the really intense competitive environment. And I was just curious, I think that you've oftentimes and the environment often has been competitive. Is your characterization of the competitive environment today any different than what you might have described it in the past? In other words, is it any more competitive or any worse than what you're used to seeing?","Barbara Rentler - Ross Stores, Inc.","I think the competitive environment for the last two years has been pretty intense. I don't foresee that going away. I think that's kind of what business is about now. And I think that's built into how you have to think about your business and how we think about our business, and how we think about our values, and how we chase our business, but I think it's been competitive for a long time. And I think that's now the new norm of business as usual.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","The next question is from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Good afternoon, everyone, and congratulations. As you think about the store footprint, the Ross Stores, and dd's, are you changing anything in terms of size of stores and what's happening on the occupancy cost front, percentage rents versus fixed rents. And then just as you think about new store openings, then the annualized new store open rate, has anything changed there? Thank you?","Unknown Speaker","I'll take the first part. Over the last 10 years, we've decreased the size of our storefront by about 15%. And the decrease was really just based on the reductions of inventory that we've seen over the years. Today, as we go out and look for new stores, we right-size them based on the market and demographics, et cetera.","Michael B. O'Sullivan - Ross Stores, Inc.","On the other part of your question, Dana, I would say that occupancy costs are fairly stable at this point. There's good availability in terms of locations. The rents are fairly stable. And our new store opening rate is about \u2013 we add about 6% more stores every year on the base of stores that we have. We open 80 stores to 90 stores, which is about 6% increase each year. And I would expect it will stay more or less at that level for the next few years.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from David Glick from Buckingham.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you. Most of my question's been answered. Just a quick follow-up there. dd's is approaching 200 stores. And when you look at the mix of stores that you open, are you at the point where that is a part of your business that you may want to accelerate the store opening rate? Thank you.","Michael B. O'Sullivan - Ross Stores, Inc.","As Barbara said in her remarks, yeah, we were very happy with dd's performance in Q4 and for the full year 2016. It turned in a very solid sales and profit performance. And actually over a longer period of time, we've been pleased with that business. But we've always been fairly deliberate about how we roll out and grow our business. This is true with Ross, and it's also true with dd's that on a base of about 200 stores, we feel pretty comfortable being able to open 20-ish \u2013 20 stores, 21 stores, 22 stores. I think it's unlikely that we would accelerate that. I think there are constraints in terms of being able to do that in a high quality way, whether it's real estate locations or building the operational team, we prefer to open and rollout dd's in a much more deliberate way. Yeah, that's about it.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much, good luck.","Operator","The next question is from Christian Buss from Credit Suisse. Christian Buss, your line is open.","And there are no further questions at this time.

[Operator Instructions] Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts and other matters that are based on the company's current forecast as of aspects of its future business.","These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today's press release and the company's fiscal 2012 Form 10-K and fiscal 2013 Form 10-Q and 8-Ks on file with the SEC.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Michael Balmuth, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.","Michael Balmuth","Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Norman Ferber, Chairman of the Board; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, our Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Michael Hartshorn, Senior Vice President and Deputy CFO; and Connie Wong, Director of Investor Relations.","We'll begin with a brief review of our second quarter and year-to-date performance, followed by our outlook for the second half and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.","As noted in today's press release, we are pleased with our better-than-expected results for the second quarter and first half of the year, which were mainly driven by above-plan sales and merchandise gross margin. Our performance for both the quarter and year-to-date periods continues to benefit from the solid execution of our core off-price strategy of delivering compelling name-brand bargains to today's value-focused consumers.","Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended August 3, 2013, were $0.98, up 21% on top of a 27% gain in the prior year. Net earnings for the 2013 second quarter grew 17% to $213.1 million.","Second quarter sales rose 9% to $2,551,000,000, up from $2,341,000,000 in the second quarter of 2012. Comparable-store sales for the 13 weeks ended August 3, 2013, rose 4% over the 13 weeks ended August 4, 2012. This compared to a strong same-store sales gain of 7% for the 13 weeks ended July 28, 2012. For the 6 months ended August 3, 2013, earnings per share were $2.06, up from $1.74 last year. These results represented 18% increase on top of a 26% gain in the first half of 2012.","Net earnings for the period rose 15% to $447.7 million, up from $390.6 million last year. Sales for the first 6 months of 2013 increased 8% to $5,091,000,000, with comparable store sales up 3%, which was on top of a robust 8% gain in the prior-year period. The strongest merchandise categories for the quarter were Juniors and Accessories, while Texas and Florida were the top-performing regions.","For the second quarter, earnings before interest and taxes grew to a record 13.6% of sales, up from 12.8% last year. This increased level of profitability was driven by a 70-basis-point improvement in cost of goods sold, mainly due to higher merchandise gross margin and a 10-basis-point decline in selling, general and administrative expenses. John will provide some additional color on these operating margin trends in a few minutes.","As we ended the second quarter, total consolidated inventories increased about 9% compared to the prior year, with average in-store inventories down about 4%. Packaway as a percentage of total was 46% compared to 48% for the same period last year.","Like Ross, dd's sales and profitability also improved in the second quarter as both change continued to benefit from our ability to flow a larger percentage of fresh and exciting product to our stores. With respect to our expansion program, we now expect to open 88 Ross and dd's DISCOUNTS locations combined in 2013. As usual, this growth does not include our plan to close or relocate about 10 older stores by the end of the year.","Now John will provide further color on our second quarter results and details on our second half guidance.","John G. Call","Thank you, Michael. While we realized a slight increase in the number of transactions during the quarter, the 4% comparable store sales gain was mainly driven by growth in the size of the average basket. Operating margin grew about 80 basis points in the quarter to a record 13.6%.","A 70-basis-point improvement in cost of goods sold was mainly driven by higher merchandise margin, which grew by about 80 basis points over last year, including approximately 5 basis points from a lower shrink accrual. This improvement was partially offset by higher distribution costs that were up approximately 10 basis points, mainly due to the timing of packaway-related expenses.","Freight, occupancy and the buying costs were all the relatively even with last year as a percent of sales. Selling, general and administrative costs improved by about 10 basis points as result of leverage on the 4% increase in same-store sales.","During the second quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares for a total purchase price of $138 million. Year-to-date, we have bought back a total of 4.4 million shares for $277 million. We remain on track in 2013 to buy back about $550 million in common stock or about half of the 2-year $1.1 billion authorization approved at the beginning of 2013.","Let's turn now to our second half guidance. As a reminder, due to the 53rd week in 2012, all fiscal quarters are one week later in 2013 versus the prior year. While this shift is relatively neutral for the full year, it added about 1% to total sales growth in the first half. This benefit is expected to reverse and reduce fiscal sales growth by a similar amount in the second half, which is embedded in the following guidance.","For the 13 weeks ending November 2, 2013, we are projecting a same-store sales increase of 2% to 3% on top of a 6% increase in the third quarter of 2012. Third quarter 2013 earnings per share are forecast to be in the range of $0.75 to $0.78, up from $0.72 in last year's third quarter.","For the 13 weeks ending February 1, 2014, we are also planning same-store sales to be up 2% to 3%, on top of a 5% gain last year. Earnings per share are projected to be in the range of $0.99 to $1.03 compared to $1.07 for the 14 weeks ended February 2, 2013. As a reminder, the 53rd week last year added about $149 million in sales and $0.10 in earnings per share to the 2012 fourth quarter and fiscal year.","Now I'll provide some additional operating statement assumptions for our third quarter EPS targets. Total sales are expected to grow about 5% to 6%, driven by a combination of new store growth, and as previously mentioned, same-store sales that are forecast to be up 2% to 3% versus the same 13-week period last year that ended November 3, 2012.","We plan to open 33 new stores during the period, including 24 Ross Dress for Less and 9 dd's DISCOUNTS. We are targeting operating margin to decline 50 to 70 basis points versus last year for a projected range of 10.6% to 10.8%. About 40 basis points of the planned decline is due to the shortage comparison versus last year when our physical inventory results were better than expected and added about $0.02 to third quarter 2012 EPS.","The remainder reflects some de-leveraging on expenses. The same-store sales are in line with our guidance for a 2% to 3% increase. We are planning no net interest expense in the quarter. Our tax rate is expected to be about 36%, and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are estimated to be about 215 million.","Moving to our outlook for the full year. We are now projecting earnings per share for the 52 weeks ending February 1, 2014, to be in the range of $3.80 to $3.87. So again, as sales performed in line with our guidance for the second half, our updated forecast for fiscal 2013 would represent estimated EPS growth of 11% to 13% on a 52-week basis. This compares to strong prior year gains of 20% and 24%, respectively, in 2012 and 2011.","Now I'll turn the call back to Michael for closing comments.","Michael Balmuth","Thank you, John. While we are pleased with our better-than-expected year-to-date results, we believe it is prudent to maintain a somewhat cautious outlook for the remainder of the year for a number of reasons. These include the ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, our own challenging multi-year comparisons and the potential for a more promotional and competitive retail climate.","This is especially true for the fourth quarter, which has a compressed holiday selling period due to 6 fewer shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year. Throughout the second half, we will continue to run our business with selling store inventories down in the low single-digit range. As an off-price retailer, we have the flexibility to buy closer to need, and at this point, have plenty of Open to Buy [ph] to take advantage of potential dislocations and opportunities in the marketplace over the balance of the year.","We are also staying intently focused on the key areas of our business that have allowed us to perform well for the past several years. Merchandising remains our top priority, and we plan to further strengthen the organization through investments in people, processes and technology.","In addition, we continue to fine tune and upgrade our planning and allocation systems and implement productivity enhancements and efficiencies throughout the company. Going forward, we plan to carefully execute these proven strategies, as they are the key to maximizing our prospects for earnings and revenue growth for both the near and long term.","At this point, we would like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from line of Daniel Hofkin from William Blair.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just wanted to follow up a little bit on some of the category trends. And can you discuss -- I know the home department has been a particular area of focus since last fall. Can you update us on how that's been performing relative to your expectations, relative to the overall comp, for example? That would be my first question.","Michael Balmuth","Home, we're pleased with the progress we've made. And Home performed in line with the total store for the quarter. So we're happy with the progress we've made. We're right on track.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, great. And in terms of the regional detail, can you just discuss quickly how -- obviously, the West Coast is a particularly important region for you, but how was that relative to your overall comp?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","The West Coast was pretty much in line with the chain comp. Actually, regionally, our comp performance was pretty broad based. I think in Michael's comments, he mentioned Florida and Texas as particularly strong. But frankly, other regions were -- did pretty well, too.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then can you just, I guess, update us, where -- in terms of the systems -- kind of ongoing systems enhancements that you touched on, where do you feel like you are in that progression relative to -- I mean, is this just something that kind of you see being -- having a long runway ahead? Or do you think -- where do you stand in that?","Michael Balmuth","Charles [ph]?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Well, Daniel, I think we're pretty far along in terms of the planning and allocation systems that we have in place. As you know, we rolled out micro-merchandising across the chain about 3 years ago. But part of the benefit of planning and allocating at a more detailed level is that that allows you to go for opportunities that you wouldn't otherwise see. So I think there are -- I think we expect that over the next few years, there are going to be opportunities down at individual classification levels or down at individual store or regional levels or even, frankly, looking at different clusters of stores, different segments of stores and spotting opportunities to turn faster and to guide margin and guide sales. So I think we feel pretty good about where we are from a systems point of view. But I think we can get quite a lot of opportunity to use other systems to really drive the business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Mann from Johnson Rice.","David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Question about the promotional environment. Most of the other major apparel retailers are talking about the fact that there was promotional pressure in the second quarter. Just curious if how you feel like -- there was any impact on you in the quarter? And whether you think that what you're looking at, going into the rest of the year?","Michael Balmuth","We thought it was typically promotional, okay, not unusually rugged, okay, but fairly typical. I think coming out of the second quarter, where all the major department stores and discounters struggled in the second quarter, they have plenty of time to be preparing, ramping up for a more promotional fourth quarter than they did -- than they were able to for the second quarter, which kind of -- I think quite a lot of people caught off guard.","David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of the merchandise margin, there was -- it looks like a little bit of an acceleration there. It was a nice gain relative to the last few quarters. Perhaps, John, you can talk a little bit about, was that just better buying in IMU or better sell-through and less markdowns?","John G. Call","I think it was a bit of both, David. We saw a bit of both increase in the second quarter.","David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then last question, on the ticket gain, the gain in average ticket driving same-store sales, are you seeing more units per transaction or just some average increase in price? How should we think about that, and that going forward as well?","Michael Balmuth","Yes. So with that, that was mixed as well, so we had a slightly more SKUs being purchased per basket. And also the AURs are up a little bit as well. And we were happy to see that, actually, traffic was positive as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Jeff Stein from Northcoast Research.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","A couple of questions. First of all, I want to make sure I heard this correctly. Because of the calendar shift, is there going to be a narrowing of the spread between comp in total because of that shift in the back half of the year?","John G. Call","Narrowing -- so explain that? What are you trying to get at, Jeff?","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","I think you mentioned -- somebody mentioned that there was -- you're going to get penalized by 1 percentage point in sales because of the calendar shift. Is that because you're giving up 1 week of higher volume in August and picking up 1 week of lower volume in November? I just wanted to make sure I'm understanding that correctly.","John G. Call","That's exactly right, Jeff. There were 2 counters which is off those weeks.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","Okay. So -- okay. And my second question would be on the SG&A line. Why only 10 basis points of leverage on a 4% comp? I guess, what's embedded in your SG&A that is preventing you from seeing more leverage?","John G. Call","So on that, we think we lever typically around a 3%, so we did get some leverage on the 4% in the quarter. I wouldn't say there's anything unusual in the quarter that would either promote that or bring that down, so we actually felt pretty good about the leverage we got.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","Okay, okay. Final question, and that is on the subject of outerwear. Now the industry has had 2 consecutive years of warmer-than-expected weather, and I'm just kind of wondering what the close-out environment is for outerwear this year? Are the vendors producing less, and therefore, you have less? Or do you have more in packaway from last year? How do you kind of see these seasonal apparel business shaping up for you this year?","Michael Balmuth","We're a little better -- we're better positioned than a year ago in packaway based on last year's performance globally. And this year's situation flows out, it's premature. Nobody's closing out outerwear this early. So it's a wait-and-see. It -- actually, the seasonal businesses happens later and later in the year. It makes it more difficult to secure close out in season. More is done in packaway. So we'll just have to wait and see.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Baker from Deutsche Bank.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Mike Baker, so 2 or 3 questions. One, you ticked up your store count a little bit. You're going to open to 88 from 80, I believe. Can you discuss that? And secondly, maybe more importantly, can you talk about how your stores performed in the Midwest? You can calculate new store productivity. But at some of these stores, I think, in Chicago, we're starting to enter the comp base. Are you seeing outsized comps, because it matured [ph] -- I think last quarter, you said that they were -- I think you said slightly above plan? Can you update us on how those Chicago Midwest stores are doing?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","So Mike, you're right, we took our new store count up to 88, that's just a few more than we had planned at the beginning of the year. That's really just driven by real estate opportunities. In terms of your broader question about the Midwest, as you know, we entered the Midwest in the fall of 2011, so a little over 1.5 years ago. So this really just a handful of stores that are now in the comp base. So rather than commenting on those, I think what I'd say is we've been very happy with the performance, in general, of the stores that we've opened in that region over the past 1.5 years, both in terms of how they've done against their sales and earnings plans but also in terms of the customer feedback we've had in those markets. So we're feeling pretty good about our ability to build a strong business in that region over time.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Michael, I'm wondering if you can talk about the Juniors business. It seems like Ross and TJX are the only 2 businesses out there that have a really strong Juniors business. And I'm just wondering, is there some sort of a focus on the category in particular inside the organization? Or are you seeing just better product available for this customer that's allowing you to drive this business? And then just stepping back, I think you've been doing a great job at cutting in-store inventory. And I want to say that I think you've started it back in the second half of 2007, and you've just been managing sort of at ever more conservative levels on in-store inventory. Do you still see an opportunity to cut inventory levels further? Is that helping your -- is that helping you guys to reduce clearance markdowns? And will the distribution centers that you have coming online over the next 1 to 2 years, do they actually help you manage even more conservative inventory levels?","Michael Balmuth","Okay. First, on the Junior question, I really can't speak for what other people are doing differently in juniors. The way we've approached it, we saw an opportunity a few years ago. We felt the Junior business was an opportunity for at least us. We organized our staffing that way. We positioned ourselves so we could take advantage of market opportunities. And that's really how we've done it. And we funded it appropriately in addition. So we run much more of a pure classification Junior business than maybe other people do, who maybe run more of a collections Junior business, and that has served us well.","Michael B. O'Sullivan","On your second question, Kimberly, about inventories, you're right, we've reduced inventories by about, actually, a little bit over 40% since the back half of 2007. And actually this year, we're planning to reduce inventories further, sort of in the low single-digit range. Longer term, we haven't put together our plans for next year. But I think we're absolutely going to look at whether there's additional opportunity there may be. And I think we feel good about our ability to sort of flow fresh merchandise to the stores, and that's really helped drive our sales over the last few years. Now in terms of what will be the driver of being able to reduce inventories further, the DCs may help, but I also think that just improved merchandising in terms of making sure we have the right product in the right store will also be a key enabler as well.","Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's really helpful. And I'm wondering if I can just ask one follow-up on the general environment. I know that there's a lot of volatility in general out in the retail environment, and in particular, it seems like in the department store space. So I know there's always plenty of inventory for you guys to buy, and there's substantially more available out there in any given season than you could possibly buy for your own stores. But are you seeing any kind of incremental dislocation, just given the volatility we're seeing in the environment? Or does it feel very much the same as 1 or 2 years ago?","Michael Balmuth","It's hard to answer. What I would say is that the dislocation that was really just reported in the time I've been in the off price for a while leads to a lot of opportunities. And since a lot of people were not forecasting this kind of performance, it invariably leads to a lot of products for the off price sector. We've been comfortable at the level of product we've seen so far this year. I only expect that it should be a little more advantageous than it's been even.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Ike Boruchow from Sterne Agee.","Irwin Bernard Boruchow - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I guess, question on your comp guidance. You're guiding a 2% to 3% comp for next year. The last 3 quarters, you guys have been guiding 1% to 2%. Just curious, are you feeling a little bit better right now about your end market demographic? Or has anything changed with how you view the world right now?","John G. Call","So I don't think anything's changed with how we viewed the world. Actually, as we laid out the year, it was pretty consistent. I mean, we did a 3% in the first quarter, 4% in the second quarter, and we just think a 2% to 3% is probably more appropriate place busy [ph] in the company.","Irwin Bernard Boruchow - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, real quick follow-up. It looks like new store productivity was pretty strong in the quarter. Can you talk about the new store openings that you've seen in new markets and existing markets and how the stores are performing relative to plan?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Sure. So yes, I would say actually, over the last couple of years, we've been pretty happy with how new stores have performed, both in existing markets and in new markets. And part of it is the same trends that are driving our comp store performance have helped our new stores as well, the fact that we have great merchandising, great value. And I also think with new stores, I think, we've done a better job of the planning and, operationally, opening those stores. So I think those things have contributed to a pretty satisfactory new store performance.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Brian Tunick from JPMorgan.","Brian J. Tunick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Curious, it sounds like in the comments that you're saying the traffic, I think, has been moderating. I think this is a quarter or 2 now. So wondering why you think that traffic might be moderating? And any comments on your marketing spend plans for the second half, vis-\u00e0-vis trying to bring in a new customer, et cetera? I know you talked about the Junior side. And then on the second one is maybe just talk about on the 2,500 store target that you recently updated, what exactly is preventing you guys from accelerating even faster from a square footage growth perspective? Is it site availability, district managers, waiting for the distribution center, just maybe talk about what's prohibiting a faster rollout?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","All right, Brian. I'll try and answer your questions on traffic and marketing, and then I'll hand it over to John on the store's potential. On traffic, we've had -- over the last few years, we've had pretty significant traffic growth. And if you look at our annual comp growth, just over the last 4 years, what you see is 6% to 5%, 5%, 6%. So pretty strong comp performance, and traffic has been the major driver of that comp growth. So clearly, that would never going to on forever. At some point, traffic was going to moderate, and that's kind of how we viewed the last couple of quarters. And, obviously, as a retailer, we'd like to drive traffic higher, so the best way we can do that is to make sure that we have great bargains in the stores. And that's what we're focused on doing. I should say on the flip side, we're pretty happy that we're seeing increases in the average basket, which suggests that when customers are coming to the store, they are finding opportunities to spend more. On your point about marketing, I think we've said in the past that we think paid marketing can be very helpful in a way of reminding customers to come to our store, remind them that we have great value, great merchandise. But, frankly, we've always thought the best marketing for us is sort of unpaid marketing, word of mouth. And that really comes from making sure we have great value in the stores, the customer buys the goods, they go and tell their friends, et cetera. But that really remains our focus from a marketing point of view. Our paid marketing really hasn't changed in the last few years, so nothing new or radical in terms of marketing campaign.","Michael Balmuth","So as to the growth question, Brian, so we say we can basically double the size of the chain. That gives us, obviously, plenty of room to grow. The way we like to grow is not a tack 20 [ph] market at 1 specific time to not get too distracted by multiple fronts. And our growth pattern in the past has been growing to contiguous markets, and that's worked well for us. We have the ability and the systems and the people in place to sustain a 6% to 7% growth rate and do that well. And that's what we're going around. So we'll be steady and consistent with that growth pattern. So we're pretty comfortable with where we are today.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on your somewhat cautious back half outlook. Is that based on what you're seeing today in the macro environment? Or is that just anticipation of what could be a very heated promotional holiday season?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Lorraine, it's a combination of things. I think, Michael, in his remarks, mentioned there is sort of continuing economic uncertainty. We are going to be anniversary-ing some big comp numbers over the last 3 or 4 years. There is a more compressed holiday shopping calendar. And then we are anticipating that there's at least a risk that the retail and competitive environment could be more promotional. So we've taken all those factors and tried to wave them into our guidance. Now we -- we always hope to do better, and I think over the last few years, we've demonstrated that when we plan conservatively, we're still able to chase the business if the sales are there. That approach has certainly helped us drive margins when the sales trend is running ahead of our plan.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of John Kernan from Cowen.","John D. Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to get your thoughts on what you thought the long-term potential for merch margin and continued advances in that rate? It's been on an -- obviously, been on a upward trajectory since 2006. And how much more room is there to take that merch margin higher over time?","John G. Call","So John, we're happy with where it is. We believe it's sustainable. You're right, it has grown significantly over the past several years. It's really a function of what the top line can drive that. So if we can accelerate comps at a more meaningful level, then we'll get the fall through. But at the comps we have planned out today, we think that the margin is somewhat sustainable at those levels.","John D. Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And then, I guess, one follow-up would be any update on dd's and the sales trajectory within that chain and margin trajectory there as well?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Sure. Well, John, as you know, we don't disclose dd's financials separately just because, at this point, it's not really material to the corporation. But, overall, I'd say, we continue to be happy with dd's performance. And this year, it's continued to exceed our sales and profit plans for the business. And, actually, one other notable point here is that like Ross, over the last 2 years, dd's has benefited from lower inventories and therefore, fresher merchandise, and that certainly helped it from a margin perspective. So I think, overall, we're very happy with dd's, as we have been in the last few years.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Jessica Schoen from Barclays.","Jessica Schoen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I'd have a follow-up question on the inventory levels in the quarter. In store, I believe, you said they were down about 4%. I was wondering if you could tell us if that was in line with your expectations? And if there's any further reduction that you're expecting as you continue to control your inventory level?","John G. Call","So the inventory levels were in line with our expectation for the quarter, and, I think, Michael O'Sullivan mentioned, we're anticipating inventory to be down in the low single digit in the back half.","Jessica Schoen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And so as you continue to manage it, how much, going forward, in years to come, do you feel like there's a lot of incremental reduction that you could do?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","I wouldn't use the word \"a lot\". I think -- we think that there might be some additional opportunity based upon doing a better job of buying great merchandise and trying to flow merchandise to the store more rapidly. And we may be able to squeeze out more inventory. We haven't put together plans for next year yet, but that's certainly something we're going to look at.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laura Champine from Canaccord.","Laura A. Champine - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","John, could you give us an update on the CapEx budget for this year? And then where it should settle out in years beyond?","John G. Call","Sure. The CapEx budget is around $670 million this year. As we're building on a couple of DCs, we actually bought out the lease of 1 DC. As Michael mentioned, we're putting plans together for next year. And we'll announce those towards the end of the year, we'll have more updates on our CapEx plans going forward.","Laura A. Champine - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","If I can ask a second question then. The margin pressure, you mentioned about 40 basis points comes from a change in shortage [ph]. Is the balance of the margin pressure just a typical lack of sales leverage on that 2% to 3% comp?","John G. Call","Yes, that's where it came from. And that's EBIT margin leverage. And you actually get some deleverage on some of the expense lines, with the 2% to 3% comp.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Oliver Chen from Citigroup.","Nancy Hilliker","This is Nancy Hilliker, filling in for Oliver Chen. We'd like to know is that a bit more about your view in expansion. Are you targeting any regions in particular that you're thinking about going into? And are you seeing real estate opportunities given any retailers in the macro environment right now? And then also, just if you could comment on -- you've done so well in your current categories. Is there any room for expansion either in adjacent categories or bringing in a new brand?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Nancy, on the first part of your question about regions and real estate, historically, our strategy, when we've moved into new markets, has been to expand in a fairly targeted way, so we open up in a market and then we build up our presence and share in that market before we move onto a whole new region. So given that we only entered the Midwest market 1.5 years ago, that's probably going to be our focus, I would say, for the next several years. And then on real estate, we continue to be happy with the real estate opportunities we're seeing. We have a great and very experienced real estate team who've done a great job of finding good locations for us in the last few years. And what we see in the pipeline remains very strong.","Michael Balmuth","And relative to new categories in the business, we're always testing and experimenting with new categories and looking for new brands. Unfortunately, we have a very large team of merchants scouring the market and building relationships. And we expect to have some new fresh and exciting things next year. But the forum would prevent me from going into it right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from Marni Shapiro from Retail Tracker.","Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker","Two questions. Just one on the uptick in the store openings. Is that spread throughout, or is any of that higher proportion to the Midwest, given the performance to date? And then just in the second half, any particular categories where you see bigger opportunity, either because of the first half performance or because of changes in the market?","John G. Call","So I'll take the question on the additional new stores. I mean, it isn't really concentrated in any one area. It just represented an opportunity for us to move up stores into this year, and it was relatively minor.","Michael Balmuth","On the categories, I believe that you asked about for the fourth quarter. Home would be one of them based on performance last year and the improvement schedule we're on and the improvement we've had in the previous quarter and Ladies Apparel & Accessories. We feel good about them also.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from line of Neely Tamminga.","Neely J.N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Great. I just had a few follow-up questions here to today's conversation. First, if you can give us a little on dd's. As I'm thinking about the chain hitting about 120 new stores and heading towards 200 or so, does that put that chain that chain in a competitive advantage take on more, better product as it can be a one-stop solution for vendors looking for opportunities to clear? And then if I may also follow-up here. Could you just comment on the digital side of your business of marketing? Any thoughts maybe this year or next year to shift a little bit more towards digital marketing, really to help expand your social media footprint. That would be really helpful.","Michael Balmuth","On the first question relative to dd's. Was that relative to dd's carrying better product?","Neely J.N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Yes.","Michael Balmuth","Okay. The customers who dd's caters to is somewhat below the Ross customer. So we market very carefully through all these different urban areas have a very different balance of product in each of the stores. And so I would say, as we're expanding, we are getting better at micro-marketing in dd's as opposed to elevating the product line to a higher price line. And so our emphasis is really getting it right for the customer base we have, which is below the Ross customer.","Michael B. O'Sullivan","And then Neely, on your the question on your Digital Marketing, we have been investing in Digital Marketing over the last 2 years. It's become a bigger part of our marketing mix. And I think that we actually think there's some very interesting aspects, particularly with social marketing. And we're testing a number of things. And I would say that, yes, I think, it's quite likely that over the next few years, you'll see more growth in that area.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of the Patrick McKeever from MKM Partners.","Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","You had commented on past calls that the performance of your stores near a J.C. Penney store and those that are not so near is fairly similar. Was that still the case? Did that continue to be the case in the second quarter? I'm just wondering if you had any views on some of the recent changes there, with the return to promotional pricing and whatnot.","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Sure. So Patrick, we haven't seen any major change in terms of our stores\u2019 performance-based upon their proximity to J.C. Penney. And I think our only view on the changes that are going on there is that over the long term, we don't think our long-term trend will be affected. I mean, we -- it's true that we actually performed very well last year when J.C. Penney was pursuing its new strategy. So, frankly, we've been performing very well for multiple years before that. So even if they return to their old strategy, we don't expect it to impact our long-term performance. That said, we do think there's some risks in the back half, but the overall retail environment will get more promotional, not only driven by J. C. Penney but potentially with other retailers, too. And we try to factor that risk into our guidance.","Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just back to the Juniors area. Was that a good area for you in the second quarter? And are you doing anything different to target that customer?","Michael Balmuth","It was a good business for us in the second quarter, as it's been for quite some time. And we're not doing anything materially different from market with that customer, okay? I think that customer were presenting a product that we believe is trend right at very strong values. And I think to the young consumer who is very pressed economically, and so value, coupled with trend right, is really our focus.","Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","But you didn't see any change in trend like it appears -- as it appears to have been the case across the teen apparel space in the quarter?","Michael Balmuth","No, not for us.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I'd turn the call back over to the presenters.","Michael Balmuth","Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores.

The call will begin with prepared comments by management, followed by question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts, new store openings, and other matters that are based on the company's current forecast of aspects of its future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today's press release and the company's fiscal 2018 Form 10-K and fiscal 2019 Form 10-Q and 8-Ks on file with the SEC.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to you, Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer.","Barbara Rentler","Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President and Chief Operating Officer; Travis Marquette, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Vice President, Investor Relations.","We'll begin our call today with a review of our third quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the remainder of the year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.","As noted in today's press release, we are pleased that our third quarter results were ahead of our expectations. Earnings per share for the period were $1.03, up from $0.91 last year. Net earnings grew to $371 million, from $338 million in the prior year. Total sales for the third quarter increased 8% to $3.8 billion, with comparable store sales up a strong 5% on top of last year's 3% gain.","For the third quarter, we saw broad based trends across both merchandise departments and geographic regions, with children's and the Midwest performing the best. We also continue to see improving sales trends in our Ladies apparel business. While this area becomes less important as we move into the fourth quarter, we believe the actions we are taking here will lead to ongoing improvement during the holiday selling season, and into 2020. Operating margin of 12.4% was above plan mainly due to better than expected sales and merchandise margins. For the first nine months of fiscal 2019, earnings per share were $3.32, up from $3.06 last year.","Net earnings were $1.2 billion, versus $1.1 billion in the first nine months of 2018. Sales year-to-date rose 7% to $11.6 billion, with comparable stores up 3% on top of a 3% gain last year. As we ended the third quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 10% over the prior year, while packaway was 39% of the total, compared to 41% last year. Average in-store inventories at the end of the period were up 3%. dd's DISCOUNTS continues to perform well, with robust above planned growth in both sales and operating profits.","Turning to our store expansion program, we opened 30 new Ross and 12 dd's DISCOUNT locations in the third quarter, completing our 2019 store opening program. We expect to end the year with 1,546 Ross and 259 dd's locations for a net increase of 89 for fiscal 2019.","Now, Travis Marquette will provide further color on our third quarter results and details on our guidance for the remainder of the year.","Travis Marquette","Thank you, Barbara. Let's start with our third quarter result. Our 5% comparable store sales gain was driven by higher traffic and an increase in the size of the average baskets. Third quarter operating margin of 12.4% was above plan and similar to last year. Cost of goods sold increased 10 basis points in the period. Merchandize margin grew by 20 basis points, while occupancy and buying levered by 10 and five, respectively. These favorable items were more than offset by distribution expenses that increased 45 basis points mainly due to the unfavorable timing of packaway relate costs and higher wages. Freight was flat for the quarter.","Selling and general administrative expenses for the period decreased 10 basis points. During the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019, we repurchased 3.0 million and 9.6 million shares respectively of common stock for a total purchase price of $326 million and $966 million, respectively. We remain on track to buy back a total of $1.275 billion in stock for the year.","Let's turn now to our fourth quarter outlook. As noted in today's press release, we continue to project fourth quarter comparable store sales to increase 1% to 2%, versus a 4% gain last year. In addition, our guidance for fourth quarter earnings per share remains unchanged at $1.20 to $1.25, which now includes a one-time non-cash benefit of $0.02 per share primarily due to the favorable resolution of a tax matter offset by slightly higher pretax expenses. This forecasted guidance compares to $1.20 per share in the prior period, which also included a one-time per share benefit of $0.07 related to the favorable resolution of a tax matter. Excluding both of these one-time items and if comparable sales only perform in line with our guidance, earnings per share are forecasted to grow 4% to 9% over the last year.","The operating statement assumptions for the fourth quarter include the following. Total sales are projected to grow 5% to 6%. Operating margin is projected to be in the range of 13.0% to 13.2%, compared to last year's 13.2%. We expect net interest income of about $2.3 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 22% to 23%, which includes the aforementioned one-time tax benefit. And weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about $357 million. Based on our year-to-date results and updated fourth quarter guidance, we now project earnings per share for the full-year to be in the range of $4.52 to $4.57, compared to $4.26 in fiscal 2018 which included the previously mentioned one-time per share benefit of $0.07.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments.","Barbara Rentler","Thank you, Travis. As we mentioned earlier, we are pleased with our solid sales and earnings performance in the third quarter. We believe these above plan results demonstrate that we are well positioned to compete effectively in today's volatile retail environment, giving consumers continued focus on value and convenience. However, as we look ahead, we expect another highly competitive fourth quarter. In addition, we are up against strong multiyear sales and earnings comparison, a shortened calendar between Thanksgiving and Christmas, and ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic and political landscape. Therefore, although we hope to do better, we believe it best to maintain a cautious posture heading into the holiday selling season.","At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Matthew Boss with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Matthew Boss","Great, thanks, and congrats on a really nice quarter. Barbara, on the top line, any areas of sequential improvement that you'd like to highlight by category, maybe how best to think about ladies apparel relative to the total comp going forward, and any particular areas of assortment opportunity that you think is worth noting into this year's holiday.","Barbara Rentler","Well, as we said in the comments, basically all merchandize areas it was very broad based the performance, so overall the company took a lift. As we look at Ladies, we really saw improved sales in the quarter, and it performed slightly above our expectation, and we're expecting to see ongoing progress in the quarter. So we're pleased with the pace of improvement, but at this point we wouldn't provide more detail in terms of that.","Matthew Boss","Great, and just a -- oh sorry, go ahad.","Barbara Rentler","Just say the second question again?","Matthew Boss","Just more into the holiday, any particular areas of assortment opportunity that you're excited about?","Barbara Rentler","Sure. Our main focus will be to build upon the success of our gift giving assortment. I mean we've built out gifts throughout the entire store, and we feel good about that, and we feel that we're offering gift items at really compelling values, because we really feel that value remains the most critical factor for her where she makes her shopping decisions, and we believe that we're really positioned to deliver on this.","Matthew Boss","Great. And then just to follow-up more on the margin side. So it sounds like freight has now moderated, and it's not the headwind for pretty much everybody out there. So I guess my question is if same-store sales are consistently in the 3% to 4% range and as we're thinking now going forward, is there any reason to think that the algorithm is any different historically than it was on the bottom line. Again, if you're at that 3% to 4% comp range just any margin headwinds or things to highlight that would be different than that historical 3% to 4% same-store sales double-digit earnings growth algorithm going forward.","Michael Hartshorn","Matt, it's Michael Hartshorn. So, our long-term earnings algorithm has not changed the combination of new store growth, comp growth, EBIT margin expansion at the high end, and then the buyback program. The one thing that I would throw in the mix with a lot of uncertainty around it is tariffs. So net of tariffs we haven't changed our long-term algorithm.","Matthew Boss","That's great, best of luck.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Altschwager with Baird. Your line is open.","Mark Altschwager","Great, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Was hoping you could give a bit more color just on the distribution expenses in the quarter, I know that was a bit of a headwind. Do you expect that to normalize in Q4? And then just more broadly, hoping you could touch on the buying environment and how you'd characterize what you're seeing out there versus the earlier part of the year. Thanks.","Travis Marquette","Yes, sure. This is Travis. In terms of the distribution cost expenses, as we said, they were related to a couple of things. One, unfavorable timing of packaway, and then also wages. With respect to wages, there were a couple of things that have impacted that, as you all are aware. Last year, we raised our national minimum wage to $11 across the country. We did anniversary that after the second quarter of this year. Beyond that, there are ongoing state and municipal wage increases, particularly in California. California wages went up in January by a dollar and they'll continue to do so for the next couple of years. The wage increases do impact both stores and distribution centers, but as we managed the business this year more of cost mitigation efforts ended up in the SG&A line. In terms of guidance going forward, we feel comfortable with the guidance that we have. We do expect some continued pressure, and it's built in to the guidance that we gave.","Barbara Rentler","And as it pertains to the buying environment now versus the earlier part of the year, there's been plenty of availability in the marketplace pretty much all year. I'd say it's been consistent, whether it's vendors bringing goods in for tariff or just supply coming from sales falling off in the department store sector, there's been a lot of goods all along, and what we're really seeing is that the availability is broad-based across brands and categories. So it's really a good buying time.","Mark Altschwager","That's great, thank you. Best of luck over holiday.","Travis Marquette","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank for America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thanks. Good afternoon. The packaway percentage is lower than it's been in quite a few years. And I was just hoping you could give us a little bit of insight into how the in-season buying is looking, and how you'll manage through holiday with a lower level of goods available in the packaway.","Michael Hartshorn","Sure, Lorraine. As we mentioned in our commentary, total inventory was actually up 10%. Packaway was 39% versus 41% last year, but on an absolute basis packaway was actually up year-over-year. The percentage was a function of higher inbound in transit, so that was higher for us. And we brought in product earlier to support the holiday selling season. I'd say overall, as Barbara mentioned, we continue to see plenty of availability, but our buyers are very strategic and ensure we have the best values. And I'd also add that we did [indiscernible] packaway to chase the -- ahead of plan sales in the quarter.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Paul Lejuez","Hey, thanks, guys. I'm wondering if you could give any more color on dd's comps versus Ross. Maybe talk about the magnitude of the traffic and ticket increases that you saw, maybe for each one. And then second, just to continue on the availability of product question, are you seeing, Barbara, any particular price strata more available just like the good, better, best as you think along those lines, are you seeing outsized availability in any particular price point? Thanks.","Michael Hartshorn","Paul, on dd's, we don't break that up separately. I'd just repeat what we said in the commentary. We're very happy with the results that performed well, and robust above planned growth in both sales and operating profits.","Travis Marquette","In terms of the components of sales, as we mentioned, the comp was driven by both higher traffic and an increase in the size of the average basket. The average basket was driven more by items per basket that was up, while AURs were down a little bit. In terms of traffic versus basket it was pretty evenly split.","Barbara Rentler","And then in terms of availability of product from a good, better, best point of view, the availability is truly broad based in all three, across all brands and categories. I mean there's really a large assortment of product to choose from. So I wouldn't say it's just focused on one, I'd say available in all.","Paul Lejuez","Got you. Thank you. And then just one follow-up, home versus apparel, any color you can provide there, and also, could you just remind us the percent of the business that home represents in 4Q versus the rest of the year? Thanks.","Michael Hartshorn","Yes, overall, apparel versus non-apparel results were pretty similar, and\u2026","Travis Marquette","Home is a little bit more than a quarter of the business, and it's slightly higher in Q4.","Paul Lejuez","Thanks, guys. Good luck.","Operator","Your next question is from Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Kimberly Greenberger","Okay, great. Thank you so much. Barbara, I wanted to just hear your sort of State of the Union on the ladies apparel business. Are you happy? It sounded like you like the trend, but are you satisfied with the performance across ladies at this point?","Travis, I just wanted to ask you a follow-up on the 45 basis points of distribution center headwinds. Was it unfavorable packaway and freight or unfavorable packaway and wages? I just wanted to get a clarification there. And then on the unfavorable packaway, could you just clarify, does that mean that sequentially from Q2 to Q3 packaway dollars would have declined sequentially, and so you would have more expenses flowing through the DC in the current period, is that right?","Travis Marquette","Yes, I guess, let me answer that question first. Packaway dollars were actually higher year-over-year and quarter-to-quarter. The unfavorability relates to sort of the magnitude of the increase compared to last year. So, they were up less than last year, but we typically see a benefit on the P&L from packaway this quarter. Your question on the 45 basis points, yes, it was packaway timing and wages was the answer.","Kimberly Greenberger","Okay, sounds great. And that just relates - sorry, Barbara. Go ahead. Sorry.","Barbara Rentler","No, go ahead, go ahead.","Kimberly Greenberger","I just wanted to make sure I understood the connection, and that was related to the wage rate increases in the state of California or have you not yet lapped wage increases in your distribution centers that were may be implemented later.","Travis Marquette","We lapped the $11 increase that we did sort of as a minimum across the company that was lapped after Q2, and so, these are primarily related to sort of state minimum increases, their state and local minimum wage.","Kimberly Greenberger","Right.","Barbara Rentler","And as it pertains to the ladies, as I said, the business performs slightly above our expectations, and we expect to see more ongoing progress. We were pleased with the pace of the improvement in the ladies business during the quarter. Obviously, I'm not going to go into more detail than that, but we expect to see ongoing progress in Q4 and beyond.","Kimberly Greenberger","Okay, great, Barbara. And just a quick follow-up question on tariffs, if I could, I'm wondering if you have -- what the tariff impact would potentially be incorporated into your Q4 guidance? Is there a way to quantify that? And do you have any visibility for the impact of tariffs -- your potential impact of tariffs beyond the fourth quarter at this point?","Travis Marquette","Sure, Kimberly, for Q4 right now we have $0.01 to $0.02 built into the impact, obviously they just went in place especially in apparel and shoes in the third quarter. It's too early to speak about the impact longer term. Obviously, the longer the tariffs remain in place, the more pressure it will put on the retail marketplace. So, the situation remains very fluid at this point. So, we wouldn't comment at this point beyond that.","Kimberly Greenberger","Okay, understood, thanks, and really nice quarter here. Good luck for holiday.","Travis Marquette","Thanks, Kimberly.","Barbara Rentler","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Alex Walvis with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Alex Walvis","Hey there, thanks so much for taking the question. I have a few questions on the category dynamics if I may. You mentioned children's being a particularly strong category for you. Can you talk about what's really working there? And then, second question is on men's that's been mentioned as a strong category for the last few quarters, can you talk about the progression of that business as well?","Barbara Rentler","Sure, the kids business really, really benefited from strong execution of the merchandise strategy. We have a very strong team. They put a strategy in place, and they really stick to their mantra, and then have done a really fine job. The business itself is pretty broad-based in terms of performance across total kids.","Our men's performance has been strong, and strong for a number of years, continues to be strong, it's performed pretty much in line with chain average, and we also feel like we have a solid strategy in there, and the business continues to move forward. I mean there is supply, there're some good opportunities in men's also.","Alex Walvis","Fantastic, thank you. And then maybe, if I may, a question on pricing trends in the market, recognizing of course that you guys -- price follows, any comments on what you're seeing out there? Any thoughts on what price could look like across that the categories in which you operate as you move into next year, and how you're likely to respond there?","Barbara Rentler","Sure. So far, we really haven't seen any material changes in pricing so far. I mean, the merchants are constantly competitive shopping and trying to stay on top of that, but to your point, we're not the lead, we're following pricing. So we'll have to wait and see how different retailers ultimately react to the higher cost and how they approach pricing, and then we'll go from there, but we're not the lead, we definitely follow, and again to-date we really haven't seen any material changes.","Alex Walvis","Marvelous, thanks so much.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Michael Binetti","Hey, guys, so congrats on a great quarter, thanks for taking our questions here. Barbara, would you -- I think it's the second time you've been very, very direct with your expectation for an ultra-competitive promotional marketplace in the fourth quarter, I think excluding the one-time benefit, you moved the midpoint down a penny or two in the fourth quarter as far as what you expect now, could you just tell us what changed since many days ago, particularly since you're delivering it really well on the top line in the quarter? And I think, I guess, on the back of that, you did mention some higher pre-tax expenses that moved, and maybe you could just tell us a little bit about what some of those expenses were, so we can think about it for a model, please?","Travis Marquette","Yes. Just in terms of the expenses that we did have a couple of extra days of expenses in Q4 and those are really split across cost of goods and SG&A, so wouldn't be more specific really beyond that.","Michael Hartshorn","And Michael, on the guidance we didn't change the guidance coming out of Q3 and Q4. As we said, we guided with comp at 1% to 2%, and just to reiterate what we said in the commentary, we expect it to be highly competitive, and especially with the recent department store performance in Q3, and we're obviously up against a strong multi-year comparison. We have a shortened calendar between Thanksgiving and Christmas, and there continues to be uncertainty in both the macroeconomic and certainly the political landscape. I'd add, historically, the shorter calendar compressed the sales with minimum impact to the overall quarter. That said the shorter calendar had some uncertainty if there's a weather disruption, for instance, especially near the Christmas holidays, it's more difficult to overcome, but we believe it's the best way to manage our business with a cautious posture during the holiday season.","Michael Binetti","All right, that makes sense to me. I guess one follow-up, a little longer term question, as we look at some of the components, one thing that's fairly noticeable and impressive is that you've kept the merge margin expanding slightly, call it in around 20 basis points pretty consistently on a run rate basis for a while, talking years, not quarters, but you have been able to do that on pretty consistently lower AUR as well. I think it's been a few years since we heard the AUR up, is that a dynamic that's sustainable going forward on a multi-year basis is you know, you're thinking that you continue to prioritize value and to plan the AUR to be down slightly, but that the merged margins can continue to be up is there any reason that, that dynamic changes we look, lift our eyes to next year and beyond?","Michael Hartshorn","You know, what the key for us is to plan the business cautiously, and if we can beat the sales plan, one, we can turn faster, which helps on the markdown line, and then two, we chase the business with closed outs, which typically have better margins. So that's the secret sauce, if we can beat our sales plan, that's our opportunity.","Michael Binetti","Okay. Thank you very much.","Travis Marquette","And AUR is not something that we plan. We don't target a specific AURs, it's really an output of the process, not an input.","Michael Binetti","Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Paul Trussell","Thank you. Good afternoon and good print. Just wanted to have you talk a bit more about new store performance, maybe discuss in what you're seeing in terms of some of the existing markets as you backfill and what you're seeing in new markets as well, and is there any reason why we shouldn't think that 100 doors a year is a good go forward number.","Travis Marquette","Sure, yes. Our new store performance has been pretty consistent for the last couple of years. As you might imagine, performance in our established existing markets tend to be a little bit higher, it's a little bit lower in our new market, but the average has worked out to around 60% to 65% over the last couple of years, and we're still seeing that. If we talk about sort of the opportunity for future growth, we're pretty comfortable with the 100 stores per year. We've been doing that 100 growth per year we are doing that for a little while now, and we think it sort of aligns with our ability to make sure we find the right side. We're not sort of forced to make decisions that we wouldn't -- sort of wouldn't be as beneficial to us, and we can open them in a way that, that sort of drives their success.","Michael Hartshorn","And I would just add that on the new store opening is our lineup site is really just a couple of years out. That's what we can see in the hopper from a real-estate standpoint. So we're comfortable with it.","Operator","Your next question is from Kate Fitzsimons with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Kate Fitzsimons","Yes, hi. Thanks so much. I'll add my congratulations as well. My question is on inventory receipts, you had slowed them earlier headed back to school, and it looks like that decision obviously really reap the rewards in the third quarter, maybe just how was it adjusting your views on inventory flows headed into holiday? Heard in-store inventories up 3%, I believe. So maybe just curious about the decision behind maybe adjusting some of those receipt timings headed into the fourth quarter. Thank you.","Travis Marquette","Yes, I mean, for us, it was really about the compressed calendar, and we thought we had some opportunities that we may have missed going into the quarter last year. So, it was in our plan at the beginning of the year, and we actually see it good.","Operator","Your next question is from Daniel Hofkin with William Blair. Your line is open.","Daniel Hofkin","Good afternoon. Just a quick question, I think you talked a little bit about home and I believe it was kids. Any other category commentary or kind of regional variances that you would care to comment on? That's my first question then I just had a quick follow-up.","Michael Hartshorn","Yes, sure. As we discussed, kids was the top performing category. Performance was pretty broad based to both cat --across both categories and geographic regions. Aside from kids, some of the shoes were also a strong category. Geographically, the southeast and southwest were also strong performers, but again, performance is pretty broad-based.","Daniel Hofkin","And any anything you can kind of as you're getting further into the kind of the improvement within ladies apparel, any more color you can share on kind of what the issues were, or have been that you're now correcting? And then, I guess, lastly on just online resellers, curious if there's any updated thinking about what you're seeing out there in the competitive landscape? Thank you.","Barbara Rentler","Sure. So, listen, back to the ladies scenario, what I would say about ladies is rather than rehashing is that we believe that we have the right initiatives underway to drive sales growth through the fourth quarter, and then into 2020. We continually see improvement, and although we're never fully satisfied with any part of our business, we're happy that it's moved in the right direction, and we feel like we have a strategy in place as we go throughout 2020.","Michael Hartshorn","On the retail competition, relative to the retail business model, we believe we have a differentiated value offering. We've obviously competed with many different retailers over the years, and our focus is making sure we continue to offer our customers the best branded values possible.","Operator","Your next question is from Adrienne Yih with Barclays. Your line is open.","Adrienne Yih","Good afternoon. Let me add my congratulations. Barbara, two longer term questions, and a quick one for Mike, what if anything would have to happen for you to contemplate the launch of a potential e-commerce business? And then, as you think about the expansion plans in the U.S., at what point in time, would you accelerate sort of a northeast regional expansion? And for Michael, you talked about some rent trends, what's happening with off small rents, and is it impacting at all sort of where your breakeven comp is on fixed expenses? Thank you very much.","Michael Hartshorn","Adrienne, I'll jump in there and take all three of those. So, on e-commerce, our view has not changed. We think that the moderate off price business, which is what we're in, would not work in an online environment. With a $10 to $11 AUR the economics with free shipping and returns are just not financially sustainable, and we don't see any way that business would be accretive to our profit. In terms of real estate growth over the next several years, our focus will continue to be building in the Midwest, about 10% to 15% of those stores, and continue to grow in existing markets and we will continue to do that over the next couple of years before we would enter into the rest of the country including the Northeast. And then, real estate trends, really not significant changes. We've not seen any significant changes in terms of rent or lease terms recently.","Operator","Your next question is from Michael Baker with Nomura. Your line is open.","Michael Baker","Thank you, guys. Two follow-ups, one, tariffs were supposed to be $0.03 in the back half, you said 1 to 2 in the fourth quarter, does that mean that they impacted by $0.01 to $0.02 in the third quarter? In other words, that we still looking for $0.03 in the back half, and then, a follow-up on the fourth quarter guidance and the slightly higher pre-tax expenses? Should we consider those to be one time as that $0.02 benefit that you mentioned, you specifically called out as one time or the slightly higher pre-tax expenses more just ongoing business expenses?","Michael Hartshorn","Mike, on tariffs our original guidance assumed $0.01 impact in Q3 and then the $0.01 to $0.02 in the fourth quarter. As I mentioned earlier, the tariffs just went into effect for the latest trench for a -- in September, so mid-quarter. I would also say that we had pre-tariff Packaway inventory and pre-tariff purchase orders that enabled us to mitigate the impact in Q3 where you saw we had a 20 basis point improvement in merchandise margin.","Travis Marquette","And on that $0.02 additional expenses, those are just for -- we expect this just before Q4 only.","Operator","Your next question is from John Kernan from Cowen. Your line is open. John Kernan with Cowen, your line is open","John Kernan","Hey, guys, sorry about that, congrats on another nice quarter. Just want to go back to the inventory question. Your inventory turns improved consistently the last several years, it's obviously had great effects on the growth of free cash flow. Just wondering, how much faster you think you can turn how much more productive you think you can be with inventory and working capital. Thank you.","Michael Hartshorn","I think going forward it's been down. If you go back a decade, I mean, we brought down inventories over 40% in front of the customer. Given the way we plan the business, if we posture the plans at a lower level and we can beat those plans that's really like margin, that's our opportunity to turn faster.","Operator","Your next question is from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is open.","Dana Telsey","Good afternoon, everyone, and congratulations on very nice results. Can you please talk a little bit about beauty and women's apparel? Are you still seeing the progressive improvement from Q1 and Q2 that was in the plan? And on the beauty side, how is that growing and as that becomes a larger piece of sales? Thank you.","Barbara Rentler","So, the beauty business has been one of our growth areas and continues to expand as we add additional classifications of products and boards and the assortments, and so we feel good about beauty, it's a growth business and it continues to grow, sequentially quarter-to-quarter. So ladies apparel business, you know, as we've gone through the year has progressively improved and as I said as we're looking forward you know, we expect to see ongoing progress","Operator","Your next question is from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Ike Boruchow","Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Question for the team, just a high level question, nothing specific, but the company had a decade plus of margin expansion behind them, and this will be the second year in a row of operating margin was declining. I guess my question is the outlook for freight seems to be a little bit better, the outlook for wages, it doesn't seem like there's any broad-based wage inflation to begin next year. Can the business get back to potentially a period of margin growth, just kind of curious to put some takes again, just big picture looking out?","Michael Hartshorn","Yes, Ike, I think if we look ahead, certainly will start a year with a cautious outlook on sales and if we can drive ahead of the sales plan, that's where our margin opportunity is going to be. This year, I would point out even though we've been able to mitigate the tariff impact, the home accessories and cosmetics, tranches one through three have been in place all year, and we've spent a lot of time trying to mitigate those, and then here with transport. So, again, what different going into next year is tariffs, which are very uncertain at this point.","Operator","Your next question is from Marni Shapiro with Retail Tracker. Your line is open.","Marni Shapiro","Hey, everybody, congratulations, and I'd like to add it's a pleasure having such a boring conference call. I think you guys have missed it. That's a compliment. It's a great thing. Barbara, I have a big picture ladies question for you. There has been a lot of talk about ladies business. When the business got tough in the stores, did you see the shopper not buying, or was she shifting to other departments, whether that's anecdotal or you can tell by her receipts and credit card data, and if she was shifting to other departments, are you seeing that shifts back or is she just buying more, I'm curious just how the dynamics working in the store.","Barbara Rentler","I think when look -- I think when your ladies apparel business is tough, you know, our core customers are woman, so obviously it makes it makes the entire business more difficult, but when you think about the ladies customer, we don't think of her as just apparel, so we think of her more holistically, so we think of her as apparel and shoes and cosmetics, all the handbag, all the things that satisfy her. So, when this is all anecdotal, so this isn't going to be anything from -- any fact other than the other businesses that were healthy like beauty were healthy, stays healthy and continue to grow well ladies was difficult. And so, I don't necessarily -- I think she bought other products in the store. However, I think she probably would have bought those products, even if ladies apparel has been good or better I should say than what it was, because those businesses are growing exponentially and there're lots of products and things for her to choose. So I think in the end it all just becomes about the assortments that we deliver. If we deliver compelling bargains and compelling assortments, and we do that in ladies apparel, and we do it all the other things that satisfy her personally, all businesses and all ships arrive, but I think also when we don't do that in an area as big as ladies, there is potentially some total impact I think the total store, but I think that's very difficult to quantify, but if you think that these are core customer, it will be illogical.","Operator","Your next question is from Bob Drbul from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.","Bob Drbul","Hi, good afternoon. I was wondering if you could talk to did weather impact your business at all throughout the quarter, and was there any variation sort of month-to-month, and I guess the last piece you mentioned handbags, but you may be just talking about women handbags and accessories and how that as a category you've seen play out at this point? Thanks.","Travis Marquette","Yes. This is Travis, we don't specifically comment on results month-to-month. Generally speaking, there wasn't a lot of variation. In terms of weather, again, it wasn't a significant impact at all for the quarter. In terms of accessories and performance, again, it performed pretty close in line with the chain.","Operator","Our last question comes from Laura Champine with Loop Capital. Your line is open.","Laura Champine","Should be a quick one on the ladies business, was AUR down more in that category than it was for the company overall?","Travis Marquette","Yes, we don't generally talk about sort of AUR by specific line of business.","Laura Champine","I've got a Plan B. The Midwest region calms better than average. Can you give us a reason why you think it was strongest region in the quarter?","Travis Marquette","Yes, the Midwest has been one of our best performing regions ever since we entered the market many years ago. I think the customers responded well to sort of the values in the product that we offer them, and so we've been very pleased with the performance ever since we entered.","Laura Champine","Got it, thank you.","Travis Marquette","Sure.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Q&A portion of the call. I will now turn things back over to management for any closing remarks.","Barbara Rentler","Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores.

As a reminder, all earnings per share results and forecasts for both the current and prior year, reflect our recent 2-for-1 stock split, that became effective June 11, 2015.","As noted in today's press release, we are pleased with our solid sales and earnings growth for both the second quarter and first six months. These results reflect that our assortments of compelling name brand bargains, continue to resonate with today's value focused customers.","Earnings per share for the second quarter increased 11% to $0.63, up from $0.57 in the prior year. Net earnings for the quarter grew to $259 million, compared to $240 million for the same period last year. Sales rose 9% for the quarter to $2.968 billion with comparable store sales up 4% over the prior year.","While second quarter operating margin of 13.9% was down from last year, it was slightly better than expected. The quarter benefited from higher merchandise margins and tight expense control, that partially offsets a planned increase in distribution costs, related to recent infrastructure investments.","For the first six months of fiscal 2015, earnings per share increased 15% to $1.32, up from $1.15 in the prior year. Net earnings were $541 million, up 12% from $583 million (sic) [$483 million] last year. Sales for the year-to-date period rose 9% to $5.906 billion, and comparable store sales increased 5%.","Similar to Ross, dd's posted better than expected gains in sales and profits for the quarter and year-to-date period as customers also responded positively to their value offering. The strength in merchandise and geographic sales trends for Ross during the second quarter were relatively broad-based. Juniors and home were the best performing departments while the Midwest continued to be the strongest region.","As we ended the second quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 20% over the prior year with packaway levels at 46% of total inventory compared to 43% last year. Average in-store inventories at quarter-end were down slightly versus last year while total inventories were higher as we have taken advantage of increased close-out availability in the marketplace.","Now let's turn to our expansion program. Store growth remains on track with 19 new Ross and eight dd's DISCOUNTS opening in the second quarter. For fiscal 2015, we continue to plan for about 70 new Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. As usual these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate a handful of stores.","Now, Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our second quarter results and details on our second half guidance.","Michael J. Hartshorn - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Thank you, Barbara. Let's start with our second quarter results. Our 4% comparable store sales gain was driven mainly by an increase in the size of the average basket with the number of transactions up slightly from last year.","As mentioned earlier, while second quarter operating margins of 13.9% declined 35 basis points from last year, it was better than expected. Cost of goods sold increased 20 basis points mainly from a 40-basis-point increase in distribution expenses that were impacted by the opening of a new distribution center during the second quarter.","Freight and buying costs also increased 10 basis points and 5 basis points respectively. These unfavorable items were partially offset by 25-basis-point increase in merchandise margin and occupancy leverage of 10 basis points.","Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period increased by about 15 basis points. Last year's second quarter included a one-time benefit of about 20 basis points from the resolution of a legal matter. This prior year comparison more than offset the expense leverage we realized from the 4% comparable store sales increase.","During the quarter, we repurchased 3.5 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $176 million. Year-to-date, we have bought back a total of 6.9 million shares for an aggregate price of $352 million. As planned, we expect to buy back a total of $700 million in stock for the year under the two-year $1.4 billion stock repurchase program approved by the board of directors in February 2015.","Let's turn now to our second half guidance. For the third quarter ending October 31, 2015, same store sales are forecast to increase 1% to 2% on top of a 4% gain last year, with earnings per share projected to be in the range of $0.48 to $0.50, up from $0.46 in the 2014 third quarter.","For the fourth quarter ending January 30, 2016, we are planning same store sales to be flat to up 1% on top of a 6% gain last year, with earnings per share projected to be $0.60 to $0.63 compared to $0.60 last year.","Now, I'll provide some additional operating statement assumptions for our third quarter EPS targets. Total sales are projected to grow 5% to 6% on the previously mentioned comparable store sales forecast of up 1% to 2%. We're planning to add 19 new Ross and 7 dd's DISCOUNTS locations during the period.","Operating margin is projected to be 11.3% to 11.5% versus 11.8% in the prior year. We are forecasting merchandise margin for this year's third quarter to be relatively flat, while distribution costs are expected to remain elevated over the prior year. The higher distribution costs reflect the recent infrastructure investments and unfavorable timing of packaway related expenses.","Net interest expense is estimated to be about $4 million. Our tax rate is planned at approximately 35%. And we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about $406 million. Based on our results for the first six months and second half forecast, we are now projecting earnings per share for the full year to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.45, up 9% to 11% over $2.21 in fiscal 2014.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments.","Barbara Rentler - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Michael. While we are pleased with our better than expected results for the first half, we face more challenging sales and earnings comparisons over the balance of the year. In addition, the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, and we expect the retail landscape to be highly promotional during the fall season, especially given the recent results from other retailers. Based on these factors, while we hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to remain cautious in forecasting our business for the second half of 2015.","To maximize our results, we will continue to dedicate our resources to address our top priorities, offering customers the best bargains possible on a wide assortment of fresh and exciting name brand fashion for the family and the home. This will be the key of delivering respectable growth in sales and earnings, both now and in the future.","At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Lorraine Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good afternoon. Can you discuss any regional differences that you saw during the quarter and if you felt an impact from either the back-to-school tax shifts or the later Labor Day?","Michael J. Hartshorn - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Sure. Lorraine, it's Michael. On the \u2013 across regionally, the results were actually fairly good from a broad-based perspective. We mentioned the Midwest continues to be our strongest region which has been true over the last year and a half. In terms of back-to-school markets, like all other retailers, we're impacted by later sales tax holiday events. But overall, that did not have a big impact for us for the quarter.","Lorraine Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Hofkin from William Blair. Your line is open.","Daniel H. Hofkin - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.","Good afternoon. Just wanted to understand kind of the traffic versus ticket dynamic a little bit different than one of your competitors. Just curious whether you feel like going forward, pricing is a lever that you might choose to pull a little bit more even if it means sacrificing some ticket to drive more traffic. And just obviously you have harder comparisons in the second half, but the 1% to 2% guidance versus the 2% to 3% initial guidance going into this quarter, is it based on seeing a slower kind of underlying trend or are you just being conservative given the tougher compares that you have? Thanks very much.","Michael J. Hartshorn - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Dan, on your first piece, as we mentioned in the remarks, the 4% comp was driven by a combination of the larger basket and a slight increase in the transactions. The basket was primarily driven by an increase in unit per transaction and AUR was up slightly.","In terms of overall traffic, I mean, the way we think about our sales as we focus on overall sales and it comes down to merchandising. So based on that, we'll continue to do what's best and that is try to deliver the most compelling bargains to our customers.","Unknown Speaker","And Daniel, on AUR, I think your question was would we sacrifice AUR to drive sales. I think we do that all the time. I think our pricing is always intended to be very sharp and I think that's driven our performance over the long term. We are all about offering great prices and great bargain. So our AUR is always an area of focus for us.","In terms of the guidance, the 1% to 2% in the back half versus the 2% to 3%, we've been very pleased with our performance the last couple of quarters. But there are couple of reasons to be conservative in our guidance. There's ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic and retail environment, and you get a sense of that in some of the recent retailers' results, particularly from some of the department stores. And then the second reason to be conservative is we're up against some pretty tough multiyear comparisons in the back half. Last year's third quarter was a full comp. Last year's fourth quarter was a fixed comp. So we're going up against those numbers.","So putting all that to the side, you and others who followed us for a while will know that this is sort of \u2013 this is very much from our playbook. We tend to manage the business relatively conservatively, but we hope to do better. And certainly, if the sales trend is there, we'll chase it. So that's kind of the outlook.","Daniel H. Hofkin - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.","Got it. That's helpful. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marni Shapiro from The Retail Tractor (sic) [Tracker]. Your line is open.","Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker LLC","Hey, guys. The Retail Tractor I think of that to be the Retail Maserati. It sounds like there's, as always, a lot of inventory in the market and a lot that you've packed away. I'm just curious if there was any \u2013 were there any segments that you found were tougher out there and there's just really exceptional deals? And are they segments that have done well in your stores that maybe weren't doing well in other stores?","Barbara Rentler - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Actually, I think the deals are pretty board based. I mean, you're talking about which classifications of business?","Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker LLC","Yes.","Barbara Rentler - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Actually, the deals have been pretty broad based. I mean the supply lines have been in almost every business that we touched. So our assortments are broad in the stores, the availability is broad, so that's why we've been able to maximize a lot of deals in the market.","Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker LLC","Fantastic. And are you guys doing anything differently in the back half marketing wise to maybe further boost traffic or drive home the values?","Unknown Speaker","Marni, not really. Our marketing strategy and message is pretty consistent. The message is the ways that we offer the best values. So there's really nothing new there. I mean the focus really in terms of driving traffic is really to have the best bargains in the store.","Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker LLC","Fantastic. Best luck with the back half, guys.","Barbara Rentler - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Unknown Speaker","Thanks, Marni.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company","Hi, thanks a lot. We're just curious about the back half and how you're thinking about inventory planning, your inventories have been managed quite tightly and you've done a good job, keeping your open to buy pretty open. Also I wanted to just ask you about your comments on the uncertain environment and the highly promotional landscape. Just because at some of the more broadline retailers we've seen some really good momentum in apparels. So I was curious about how there is mix messages out there in the marketplace?","Unknown Speaker","Sure, so on the second part of your question, the uncertain environment, I would say the results have been slightly mixed, some good, some not so good. And certainly when we're out in the market looking for goods it seems like there's plenty of supply which again reinforces for us that there's some uncertainty in terms of the economic environment. On inventory planning, just repeat your question Oliver on inventory planning what you're looking for there?","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company","Just curious about how you're planning in the holiday season and if you can continue to kind of grow it a lot less than sales and if there's anything we should know about the timing of which you'll do gifting or floor sets relative to last year?","Unknown Speaker","Sure. In terms of how we're planning inventory, I think in Barbara's remarks she said that in-store inventory levels were down slightly and that's kind of how we're planning them going forward. In terms of timing I don't know that there are anything different there, Barbara on \u2013 yeah.","Barbara Rentler - Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, in terms of the floor sets and the gift set-up, no, the timing will be similar to last year. In terms of the promotional landscape, Oliver, the promotional landscape in Q2, it was aggressive in certain segments of the market. So we were planning on it being aggressive, it was aggressive. I think when back-to-school comes to an end we're going to see that that was very aggressive and that we're going to see that continue going into the fall season, especially some retailers are going in to fall with high inventory levels. So that would be our...","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company","Okay. That's helpful. And just lastly as we look at the weather, do you have any differentiation in terms of how you're thinking about certain categories in light of the forecast? I'm just curious about outerwear and any read-throughs there about categories as it relates to weather as we approach the back half?","Unknown Speaker","Nothing that we call out at this point, Oliver. No, nothing at that detailed level.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company","Okay. Thank you very much. Best regards.","Barbara Rentler - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Jaffe from Stifel. Your line is open.","Richard E. Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks very much. Just a follow-on, so the inventory build-up we should assume is in packaway and you've been able to take advantage of some of the disruption in the port to buy opportunistically? Is that a correct assumption?","Unknown Speaker","Yes, Richard, that's right. As Barbara said, total inventories were up but that was entirely packaway.","Richard E. Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","That's great. And I know there's been an open job at dd's, I'm wondering if there's a change in your thoughts about filling that job or just changing the reporting structure and operate without a President? Can you comment on that?","Unknown Speaker","No changes in how we're thinking about that. We're still thinking about it in terms of replacing that position. That said, dd's business has been doing pretty well over the last couple of quarters. We have a strong team in place but no changes in terms of how we're thinking about the long term leadership structure.","Richard E. Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And you'll call us when El Nino hits and you'll get a first on the west coast, right. So you'll give us a heads up.","Unknown Speaker","We will.","Richard E. Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I'm so sorry. I had no idea you guys were going to become weather forecasters. I loved Richard's comment. Anyway, so, okay, excellent quarter, nicely done. Can you just remind us what the packaway inventory was doing? How first quarter ended in terms of packaway? What percentage of inventory. So in other words, did you see a nice kind of sequential acceleration in the second quarter in packaway? And I'm wondering if you can tell is the goods you're getting were sort of dislocated goods from the port or is it really quite difficult to tell actually how the goods are getting to you?","Michael J. Hartshorn - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","In terms of overall levels, Kimberly they're very similar to where we ended the first quarter.","Barbara Rentler - Chief Executive Officer & Director","In terms of \u2013 trying to understand where the goods came from, I would say at this point it's really difficult to tell. I mean departments or business it was difficult and so some goods are clearly coming from that market. And at this point, it's much more homogenized than the beginning when we saw huge amounts coming everywhere in every business from the port.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So Barbara do you think it's just the additional availability that you're seeing? It's just sort of a function of a tough environment with vendors really trying to find a home for goods, just given the disappointing numbers we're seeing out of department store space. Is that your read on the situation?","Barbara Rentler - Chief Executive Officer & Director","At this point, yes.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you so much and good luck to you in the second half.","Barbara Rentler - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laura Champine from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","Jason Smith - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Good evening, guys. This is Jason Smith on for Laura. Thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering, if you can give us a sense as to how your competitor going down market may impact you guys going forward.","Barbara Rentler - Chief Executive Officer & Director","What I would say about that is, we're clearly operating in a very promotional and competitive environment. And that's really true across the entire retail landscape including our biggest competitor. But our focus really is on our own business. So our top priority really remains providing the best compelling bargains possible to the customers and that's really not going to change. So that's really what our focus is, how we feel about it.","Jason Smith - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anne-Charlotte Windal from Bernstein. Your line is open.","Anne-Charlotte Windal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you and congratulations. Two questions, if I may. The first one, I was wondering if you had any update to share with us on the potential impact from the wage increases and your ability to absorb cost from that. And my second question is, one of your big competitors is talking a lot about their strength of their global sourcing capabilities. I was wondering if you give us a little bit of an update on how global, I mean you are at this point from a sourcing standpoint, so I'm thinking about your buying teams, I mean where do you have active buying offices internationally? Thank you.","Unknown Speaker","So filling on the first part of your question, wage increases. As we mentioned on the call in May, we've taken up our minimum entry level wage to $9 an hour. That adjustment together with any offsets is built into the earnings guidance for the rest of the year. In terms of further increases, we think the labor market is fairly dynamic and we like to sort of follow the labor trends before making decisions on any future move. But I think in general, we think as the economy improves over the next couple of years, it's likely that there'll be additional wage pressures out there.","Barbara Rentler - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And in terms of the global sourcing availability, we buy from a lot of different sources around the world. So we feel that we have a wide assortment from a variety of countries and it's pretty wide spread.","Anne-Charlotte Windal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Barbara Rentler - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. So as we think about gross margins, can you walk through the drivers of the merchandise margin expansion this quarter and how should we think about the margin opportunity in the second half and on a multiyear basis from here?","Michael J. Hartshorn - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Matthew, it's Michael Hartshorn. So in terms of margin, merchandise margin for the quarter is actually a mix. We continue to operate the business with a lower in-store inventory which is that we ended the quarter at down, slightly down 1%. So that helps drive faster turns and lower markdowns and it also included better volumes, so a little bit on total margin.","Unknown Speaker","In terms of margin on a multiyear basis, Matthew, I think as you know, we've taken a number of steps that have helped to drive margin over the last several years in terms of very significant reductions to inventory, very significant improvements to shrink. We'll keep chipping away at those, but I think on a go forward basis, I think any improvement in margin, EBIT margin is likely to come from ahead of plan sales.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And then just a quick follow-up. On the uncertain retail landscape commentary, I mean can this provide opportunities for your model or does a more promotional environment actually convince the value spread? Just curious kind of the puts and takes on some of the larger picture commentary and how it relates to your model.","Barbara Rentler - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, there's a couple of things, from the pricing and value perspective, it goes to our being prudent about how we plan the back half because as the department stores promote and they have a lot of inventory, the values move. So we chased our business back. So we understand what's going on there and where our values need to be.","As it pertains to supply, when business is uncertain and difficult to create supply, any disruption in business creates supplies. So you would think ultimately that there would be a bubble of goods that results from, let's say, if back-to-school turns out to be more difficult than people anticipated, that there would be goods as a result of that. So you kind of get it on both sides.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Best of luck.","Barbara Rentler - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Stein from Northcoast Research. Your line is open.","Jeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Good afternoon. Just a quick question on your home performance. Wondering how it performed relative to the rest of the store and then if you could distinguish between hard home and soft home.","Barbara Rentler - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Well, home performed above the chain average and actually both segments of home were good. I would say the decorative piece was even better than the bed and bath piece.","Jeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Omar Saad from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Nice quarter. A couple of quick questions. First, I want to make sure I understood. It sounded like part of the reasons behind your conservatism in the back half was some of you're seeing pretty fairly promotional environment out there. I want to understand a little bit more, what's driving that and why you think that affects your business or you consider that might affect your business? And then, I have one follow-up please.","Unknown Speaker","So, Omar, yeah, I think, really two key reasons to be \u2013 well, I guess three key reasons to be conservative in our outlook. One is the multi-year comparisons that I mentioned. Secondly, in our business, we can always chase good news. We can always chase the good trend. So it makes sense to manage conservatively. And so we keep expenses and inventory in check and then obviously we can chase.","And then the third piece, which is what you're getting at, which is sort of the outlook. I think a combination of things. I think mixed results and \u2013 actually weak results from the department stores forces us to think that the environment which is already fairly promotional will continue to be pretty promotional in the back half. And how that affects us is we're all about price differentiation, the differences between the value at Ross and the value elsewhere and to the extent that other stores, department stores etcetera promote, that obviously eats into that price differentiation. So that's what's built in to the conservatism.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","That's very helpful. And then kind of along that similar vein, if I look at your merch margin, it's been up, I think, 50 bps to 60 bps the last couple of quarters and slowed a little bit this quarter, 20 bps or 30 bps. But the packaway percentage is still up year-over-year. Is it the promotional environment that's kind of causing that differential with the packaway up? I guess I'd expect to still see some more merchandise margin gains, and like you're seeing in the last couple of quarters, or am I being too acute here, reading too much into it?","Michael J. Hartshorn - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","No, so there was a differential in the first versus the second quarter. In addition, entering 2015, we had lower clearance levels, so that actually helped us this year versus last year and our comp was a little higher over planned in the first quarter versus the second quarter. So both of those factors resulted in more favorable margin in Q1 versus the second quarter.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Got you. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jill Nelson from Johnson Rice. Your line is open.","Jill R. Caruthers - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. Just given the energy crisis that we're hearing about the oil and gas market, could you talk about maybe your performance in Texas and if you felt any pressure there?","Michael J. Hartshorn - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Texas, overall, has consistently been a good performer for us. In the second quarter and year-to-date, it's performed above the chain average for us. So it continues to be one of our best-performing regions.","Unknown Speaker","And, Jill, we don't know whether that could be that consumers are trading down from more expensive retailers in that region. We don't really know what's driving that.","Jill R. Caruthers - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Okay. And then I know you said dd's comps outperformed. Could you just give a little bit more clarity on how its performance was in the second quarter?","Unknown Speaker","Sure. So as Barbara mentioned in her remarks, dd's posted better-than-expected gains in sales and profits in the quarter. And that's actually been the pattern over the last several quarters. We've been doing a number of things in the last couple of years at dd's to drive sales and actually to drive profitability, particularly more tightly controlling inventories and expenses. So we feel good about how that's gone. In terms of longer term, we are very confident in the dd's business model. We just \u2013 last year, we opened about 20 dd's stores. We're on track to do about the same. So we're pretty happy with that business.","Jill R. Caruthers - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. One of the other differentials impacting gross margin, I think, was the step-up in the deleverage on the DC. Can you give us a little better sense for how that line item should progress over the year, and could you actually see some leverage as you move into next year and lap some of those costs?","Michael J. Hartshorn - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Stephen, it's Michael Hartshorn. Yes. So, in the first quarter, we actually got a benefit in distribution and we actually expect that to turn around in the back half. So distribution centers are going to be impacted both by the packaway-related timing costs and the fact that we just opened a new distribution center in Central Valley, California during the second quarter. As you move into next year, you'll still have a hangover from the additional DC in the first half of the year and then you should be able to leverage in the back half.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, great. That's it from me. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul from Nomura. Your line is open.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon. I guess the question that I have is as you progressed throughout the second quarter and as you look at the fall, have you had to make price adjustments on any of your merchandise given the competitive landscape that you're seeing out there?","Barbara Rentler - Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. We haven't had to take price adjustments. We chase a big part of our business as we go which is one of the reasons why we run usually with conservative plan, so that we can watch the promotional activity and understand where we need to be in relation to department stores, as Michael said, it's a value game, department stores to off prices.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","And then \u2013 thank you. And I guess the second question that I have is with packaway being up, does it at all hinder your ability to buy sort of very close to need or are you making the investment in inventory now? Will that change the way you approach the business going forward or you have complete flexibility around it?","Barbara Rentler - Chief Executive Officer & Director","It doesn't hinder anything. We have complete flexibility around it.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Great. Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick McKeever from MKM Partners. Your line is open.","Patrick G. McKeever - MKM Partners LLC","Thanks. Hi, everyone. Just on the wage increase, I don't know if you've quantified the impact on margins what kind of headwind I guess that amounted to in the quarter, but it has, I'd like to know that. And then \u2013 and if not, I mean, maybe some broad parameters around the wage increase, percent of employees that got it, that sort of thing. And how are you measuring the impact? With Walmart, they're combining the wage increase with training and more flexible scheduling and some other things just hoping to improve the in-store experience for customers. So I guess my thought is or my question is what's the ultimate objective there with you?","Unknown Speaker","So let me start with the last piece. I mean, our ultimate objective is to continue to attract and retain great associates and we've been very pleased with our ability to do that over the last several years. The reason to take up wage raise this year was to ensure that we will continue to do that going forward.","The impact on margin in the second quarter, there really wasn't one because we were able to find offsets in the business to neutralize the impact of the wage increase, and in fact we were able to do that for the back half of the year, too. So as a result, it really didn't have an impact overall.","In terms of more broadly looking at how we manage our resources, our labor, our associates, we're always looking for ways to improve on how we do that. I'm not familiar with some of the examples that you just described, but we're always looking at other ways to improve both our customer experience and actually also our associates retention at Ross.","Patrick G. McKeever - MKM Partners LLC","Okay. So Michael then you're saying for the back half of the year it's more, it's going to continue to be more of a neutral factor as it relates to margins?","Unknown Speaker","That's right. So it's in our guidance for the back half, that's right.","Patrick G. McKeever - MKM Partners LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","And this concludes our Q&A session.

The call will begin with prepared comments by management followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts and other matters that are based on the company's current forecast of aspects of its future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today's press release and the company's fiscal 2011 Form 10-K and fiscal 2012 Form 10-Q and 8-Ks on file with the SEC.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Michael Balmuth, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.","Michael Balmuth","Good morning. Joining me on our call today are Norman Ferber, Chairman of the Board; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Bobbi Chaville, Senior Director, Investor Relations.","Before we review our financial results, I'd like to briefly discuss our recent announcement of an updated CEO succession plan approved by our Board of Directors. As part of this plan and at my request, the board and I have reached an agreement where I will remain with the company at least through May of 2016. My CEO role will be unchanged until June of 2014. I will then become Executive Chairman, and the board will elect the new CEO from our strong bench of very talented and skilled senior executives. The new CEO will report directly to the board and take on responsibility for most areas of the company.","As the Executive Chairman, I will remain actively involved in the business, with property development and dd's DISCOUNTS continuing to report to me. Our Chairman, Norman Ferber, will become Chairman Emeritus with his current consulting role to remain unchanged. The board and I firmly believe this type of long-term succession plan will allow us to remain focused on executing the strategies that have driven our outstanding financial results over the past several years. We are also confident this plan will help us continue to maximize future stockholder returns.","In a couple of years, I will partner with the new CEO to effect a smooth leadership transition. I was able to benefit from this type of mentoring relationship with Norman Ferber, who handed the CEO reins to me 16 years ago. To ensure our ongoing success over the long term, I will continue to stay very engaged with the entire senior management team in setting strategy and direction for the company. I have been privileged to work with outstanding people at Ross Stores for 23 years and look forward to continuing to do so for many years to come.","Now turning to earnings. We'll begin with a brief review of our second quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the remainder of the year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.","We are pleased with our better-than-expected performance in the second quarter and first 6 months of 2012. Our strong sales and earnings growth for both periods continues to be driven by our ability to deliver compelling name-brand bargains to today's value-focused consumers, while strictly controlling both inventories and expenses. Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended July 28, 2012, increased 27% to $0.81 from $0.64. These results are on top of a 20% gain in the same period last year.","Net earnings for the quarter grew 23% to $182 million. Sales rose 12% to $2,341,000,000, with comparable store sales up 7% on top of 5% growth in the second quarter of 2011. For the 6 months ended July 28, 2012, earnings per share were $1.74, up from $1.38. These results represent a 26% increase on top of a 23% gain in the first half of 2011. Net earnings for the period rose 22% to $390.6 million, up from $321.2 million last year. Sales for the first 6 months of 2012 increased 13% to $4,698,000,000, with comparable store sales up 8%, which was on top of a 4% gain in the prior year period.","Merchandise and geographic trends were broad based for the second quarter and the first 6 months. For both periods, Juniors and Shoes were the best-performing categories, while Florida showed the most geographic strength.","Earnings before interest and taxes in the 2012 second quarter grew to a record 12.8% of sales, up from 11.7% in the prior year. The drivers were higher gross margin and leverage on selling, general and administrative expenses from the strong gain in same-store sales. John will provide additional color on these operating margin trends in a few minutes.","As we ended the second quarter, total consolidated inventories increased 2% versus the prior year, while packaway levels were 48% of total inventories compared to 49% at this time last year. More importantly, average in-store inventories declined 5%. As a reminder, we are planning selling store inventories to be down in the mid-single-digit range for the back half of the year.","Now let's turn to dd's DISCOUNTS. dd's generated solid results in the second quarter with above planned sales and gross margin. Like Ross, dd's is also benefiting from our ability to flow a larger percentage of fresh product to our stores by operating on lower inventory levels. We continue to expect dd's to generate improved growth in pre-tax earnings for 2012 compared to last year.","With respect to Ross Stores' expansion program, we remain on track to open a total of 31 new Ross and dd's DISCOUNTS locations in the third quarter and about 80 stores for the full year. This growth includes our ongoing expansion into the Midwest, where we expect to operate 36 Ross stores by the end of the year.","Now John will provide further color on our second quarter results and details on our guidance for the balance of the year.","John G. Call","Thank you, Michael. Our 7% comparable store sales gain in the second quarter was driven by mid-single-digit growth in the number of transactions, combined with a low single-digit increase in the size of the average basket. Operating margin grew by about 110 basis points in the quarter to 12.8%. The 80-basis point improvement in gross margin was driven by a 65-basis point increase in merchandise margin, which includes 10 basis points from a lower shrink accrual and lower distribution and occupancy costs, which contributed about 50 and 25 basis points, respectively. These favorable trends more than offset 55 basis points of higher buying costs due in part to one-time severance-related expenses and modestly higher freight costs.","Leverage on the robust 7% comparable store sales gain drove a 30-basis point reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily due to a lower store cost as a percent of sales. During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.7 million shares for a total purchase price of $113 million. We remain on track to buy back a total of $450 million in common stock during fiscal 2012 to complete the 2-year $900 million program authorized in early 2011.","Let's turn now to our guidance for the back half of the year. For the 13 weeks ending October 27, 2012, we are targeting total sales to grow about 8% to 9%, driven by a combination of new store growth and same-store sales that are forecast to be up 3% to 4%. Comparable store sales are forecast to increase 4% to 5% in August, 2% to 3% in September and 3% to 4% in October. This compares to last year when they rose 4% in August and 5% in both September and October. As Michael mentioned, we plan to open 31 net new stores during the period, including 25 Ross Dress for Less and 6 dd's DISCOUNTS.","Third quarter earnings per share are forecast to be in the range of $0.63 to $0.66 compared to $0.63 in the prior year. Last year's third quarter benefited from much better-than-expected shortage results and a lower tax rate due to favorable tax audit settlements. Together, these items increased third quarter 2011 EPS by about $0.06 per share.","We are targeting operating margin of 10.4% to 10.6% for the 2012 third quarter. As I just mentioned, higher projected shortage this year compared to do very favorable prior year shrink results is expected to more than offset significant leverage on selling, general and administrative expenses and improvement in merchandise gross margins in this year's third quarter. Net interest expense is planned to be approximately $2 million, and our tax rate is expected to be about 37%, up from 35% in the prior year period. We also estimate weighted-average diluted shares outstanding of about $223 million.","For the fourth quarter, we are targeting same-store sales for the 13 weeks ending January 26, 2013, to increase 1% to 2% on top of strong 7% gain last year. For the 14 weeks ending February 2, 2013, we are targeting earnings per share to be in the range of $0.99 to $1.04, up from last year's $0.85. Without the estimated per-share benefit of about $0.89 from the 53rd week, fourth quarter EPS is projected to grow about 6% to 12%.","Now I'll turn the call back to Michael.","Michael Balmuth","Thank you, John. As noted in today's press release, we are raising our 2012 guidance with earnings per share for the 53 weeks ending February 2, 2013, now forecast to be in the range of $3.36 to $3.44, including the previously mentioned $0.08 to $0.09 benefit from the extra week. This compares to our prior guidance of $3.26 to $3.37 and represents projected earnings per share growth of 14% to 17% on a 52-week basis over earnings per share of $2.86 in fiscal 2011. Looking ahead, we recognize that there are still a number of headwinds in today's macroeconomic and retail environment that could have a negative impact on consumer spending. As a result, while we hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to plan our business conservatively. That said, we remain very liquid in our open-to-buy, and our merchants continue to find plenty of competitively priced, name-brand fashions for the family and the home.","In addition, we are very well positioned as a value retailer in the current climate. By efficiently executing our authorized business model, we believe we can continue to benefit from consumers' ongoing preference for bargains. To accomplish that, we plan to stay focused on the same strategy that have driven our successful growth over the past several years, namely offering our customers fresh and exciting assortments of compelling name-brand merchandise, while strictly controlling both inventories and expenses.","At this point, we would like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Brian Tunick with JPMorgan.","Brian J. Tunick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess first question, just trying to understand a little more as we think about, last quarter, you raised your overall store target plans. And just maybe any learning so far from the Midwest and the Chicago market, whether it be the micro-merchandising or how you're flowing inventory into the stores, that can give you more confidence about sort of either accelerating or holding your square-footage growth rate here going forward. And then the second question, on the shrink, I know it comes up on a lot of the calls, but besides having obviously lower inventory per foot, are there other things you guys have done in the past 3 or 4 years in the stores on the employee side where you think that can continue to improve the shrink rate?","Michael Balmuth","Okay. Brian, on the first piece of that, the new markets. We -- as you know, we opened 14 stores in new markets in October of last year. So still very, very early to get any kind of read. But what I would say is that the early signs have been very positive. Customer reception and the customer feedback we've gotten have been very good. And that kind of reinforced our belief that we're going to be very successful in those markets long term. Any major learnings? I think that's the question you already asked. Nothing major. I think we've made some tweaks along the way, some minor improvements here and there, to assortments and to operations but nothing major. So overall, we feel very good about the new markets.","Gary L. Cribb","And this is Gary, I'll answer the question around shrink. So we, over the past number of years, have implemented a significant number of shortage initiatives. To name a few, we have increased our physical personnel in stores designed to prevent shortage. We've got a number of technology advances that we use. We've implemented hard tagging throughout store, again, designed at shortage prevention. And we believe that through consistent execution that we can get better over time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Patel with Bank of America.","Rick B. Patel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It looks like you had a pretty decent ramp-up in packaway inventories on a dollar basis from 1Q to 2Q. And can you just help us think about that? Is it a function of ramping up for the holidays? Or have you seen an uptick in a number of great buying opportunity in the marketplace? And then secondly, how should we think about packaway inventories ramping in the back half? And what are the gross margin implications of that?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Yes. Rick, it's a function of a sliding, what we consider, terrific bargains -- branded bargains, okay? And thinking about our packaway levels going forward, it's going to be a function of what we find, okay? If it continues to be a very good buyers market, it would ramp. But that remains to be seen. So far, we've been seeing some very good buying. Buying opportunities out there are very good. And the gross margin on it, the gross margin on it is favorable. But you match up gross margin to the parent business that it comes from. So better product has obviously lower margin than moderate products. But the packaway product of each is higher than if we were buying goods regularly on close-ups.","Rick B. Patel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then can you update us on your marketing strategy for the back half? I'm curious if you're planning marketing dollars to be up versus last year and how much of a change you're expecting in impressions given the different channels that you're using for marketing this year.","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Yes. Rick, there's pretty no change in our marketing strategy in the back half. Our marketing spending will be in line with last year as a percentage of sales. And our marketing mix in terms of TVs and other channels will be comparable to last year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Katz with MorningStar.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Are there any new ways that you guys have thought of increasing traffic maybe through some sort of targeted marketing in certain regions? Obviously, you called out Florida as a strong region. But are there some regions maybe that are coming in a little bit weaker that you guys have changed the way you've targeted the audience there?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Let me take that question in 2 parts. First of all, in terms of the regions, our sales performance have been pretty broad based. I know Michael mentioned in his remarks that Florida has been the strongest. But actually, we've been strong across all regions. SO there haven't been any weak regions in our chain. In terms of any special targeting, any special marketing, no really. I mean, our style in our strategy has always been to use marketing as a way to remind the customer to keep coming to Ross. So the real perk is the bargain that they find in the store. So our focus is really to make sure that we have great merchandise, great bargains, and that's what keeps the customer coming back. Marketing is just to remind them of that. We're not trying any gimmicks with our marketing program. We're not doing anything different.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Stein with Northcoast Research.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","A couple of questions. First off, question for John. Hammering at the high end of your guidance range for the third quarter, in other words, if you do a 4% comp, would you leverage SG&A at that level?","John G. Call","Yes, we would.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","Okay, great. And then next question, wondering your home business seems to have lagged the apparel business for some time, and I'm wondering if there is any strategy in mind to kind of maybe reenergize that business and try to ramp up the growth rate a little bit more?","John G. Call","Well, we think at home, in the more recent period, we've had some execution issues, and we think we're in the process of cleaning all that up. And we would expect home to be back on track based on that.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","Okay. And what if -- should we expect to see that in the back half of this year? Or is that more of a calendar 2013 initiative?","John G. Call","I think -- oh, no. It's an initiative that's ongoing. It's -- you'd expect -- we'd expect to see some improvement in Q4 and more so as we move into the spring.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","Okay. And just finally, CapEx. Can you talk at all about spending levels beyond the current fiscal year? Should they begin to abate somewhat? Or will they remain at these levels?","John G. Call","So as far as CapEx goes this year, we've updated our view around that. We think we'll spend between $465 million and $475 million. Principally, the increases there are related to distribution centers that we're building. That will continue into 2013. And then after that, it will abate back to more historical level.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to ask about the second quarter transaction metrics. John, if you could break those down for us between the transaction count versus average dollar sale and averaging at retail price. As I recall, it's primarily been an increase in traffic and an increase in transaction sort of driven your comp, so far, this year. And I'm wondering if you have any insight into the drivers of that surge in traffic. I -- as I think about your business over the last 10 or 12 years, I don't remember a year where I think traffic has been as robust as this year. So maybe just any insight you could offer there. And secondarily, if you have a similarly low shrink results this year, when you do your physical inventory in September as you did last year, would that be neutral to third quarter EPS? Or maybe what's embedded in your third quarter guidance?","John G. Call","Sure. As far as the transaction trends in the second quarter, the number of transactions as we mentioned was up mid-single-digit rates, so the driver of the comp was the transaction volume. We did see a little single-digit increase in the size of the average basket. But as of seen over the last several years, it's been traffic that has really driven the comp. And last year, we had a similar levels of kind of mid-single-digit increase in traffic, and that's been a recurring thing. As far as shrink is concerned -- so we have no doubt any benefit into positive shrink results above and beyond our approval this year. I'll remind you that over the past probably 2 or 3 years, the results have benefited the third quarter by probably $0.04 to $0.055 over a 3-year period. We don't think it's prudent to expect that again and continue to expect that because we're at historically low levels, and we think it's just prudent not to dial that in. And I don't think it's realistic that we'll receive the 4% to 5% benefit. Having said that, as Gary mentioned, we're still very bullish on our shrink work. We continue to invest on those initiatives, but we're down to a level of where we have already picked the high-hanging fruit.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Mann with Johnson Rice.","David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","John, can you talk a little bit about the components of gross margin, how we should think about those in the third quarter? And then also, can you just give us a sense on how big that one-time severance expense was?","John G. Call","Yes. So in the third quarter, the thing will continue for the year, which is the lower inventory levels have increased turn, which have reduced our markdown levels. And that should continue into the third and the fourth quarters, as we anticipate inventories will be down in the mid-singles. And as far as the kind of one-time severance piece, it was worth about 20 bps.","David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then on, in terms of the distribution number, the benefit that you have in the current quarter, the second quarter, can you just talk a little bit about what was going on there?","John G. Call","Sure. We had -- we did have at a kind of a gross level the distribution centers did perform better on higher volumes, so we did have some leverage there. There's also a piece of packaway timing embedded in that 50 basis points of improvement in distribution.","David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And one last question, in terms of dd's, you guys are delivering, it sounds like much improved performance or continued improved performance there. Can you give us a sense on, in terms of your guidance, what kind of improved bottom line performance dd's is likely to contribute this year?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Well, overall, David, you're right. dd's continued to perform well for the second quarter. And actually for the first half of the year, it beat itself in margins plans. And over the last few years, it's benefited from the same approach that we've taken at Ross in terms of reducing our inventory levels, which has improved the freshness of the product, which has driven sales and has also sped up terms, which have improved the margins. So we're pretty happy with the -- with dd's performance. I think we've mentioned, earlier in the year, we expect that dd's should be accretive to earnings, not really material. I mean, it's still a relatively small part of our overall business, but it's on track to be pretty accretive to earnings this year.","Michael Balmuth","Yes. The only thing I'll add to that is that we are pleased with the dd's store contribution levels, which pretty much mimicked those at Ross Stores [indiscernible].","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Jaffe from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-on with dd's, how much of your Ross Stores' expertise in the market is helping dd's? How much does one team sort of provide a helping hand to the other in terms of great product or packaway or excess product? Or are they run as really silos, very, very independent?","Michael Balmuth","They're separate buying organizations that work closely together when it's appropriate.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laura Champine from Canaccord.","Jason Smith","This is Jason Smith on the line for Laura. I just had a quick question about your Q3 guidance. Is there something that you're seeing in August that's making you a little more conservative, given recent traffic and sales trends?","Michael Balmuth","So for August, we're guiding 4 to 5, which we're guiding that the highest month of the quarter. It's up against a lower comp. Other than that, I think I'll remain silent on it in that we don't comment on in a month so.","Jason Smith","Okay. And -- I mean, where is the conservatism coming, given recent trends?","Michael Balmuth","We hope to do better, okay? And we think it's better to run our business in a very conservative model. And it's worked well for us, doing that for a number of years. And we'll continue to do that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Omar Saad from ISI group.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of an update on the buying organization. What size you're at, at this point? And have you seen a lot of growth there? Are you being -- is that -- what's the talent availability like as the business continues to grow? Are you seeing turnover kind of where -- what are your long-term goals? Or you -- or do you kind of feel you have the organization in place on the buying side for what you're looking for, for the business long-term?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Okay. I would say we had a very well-developed buying organization that we grow close to 10% a year. We -- that's our plan -- our medium-range plan. We have a very aggressive program developing our own. And certainly, the talent availability outside of our company, to your question, with what's going on in the retail industry over the last few years, there's some potential talent out there, too. But we prefer to grow our own when we can.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then, if I could ask a -- just a quick question on kind of like the landscape, the competitive dynamics out there, some dislocation happening at various departments stores. Do you see changes in the way consumers are shopping? And can you see in your data new customers coming into your stores, whether it's the Ross Stores or the dd's stores that are kind of fleeing some of these other channels?","John G. Call","Yes. We -- I guess a couple of full-term response to that, Omar. First of all, with an 8% comp store sales growth in the first half of the year, it's clear that we're growing customers from somewhere. We -- next, that's been true for the last few years. Our comp sales has been very strong, so we're taking share of the apparel market. We do a lot of research where our customers are coming from, and we've gained a lot of new customers over the last few years. And what the research tells us is that there are number of factors, and there are a number of places that our customers come from. So partly, it's dislocation into the spot department store channel but also the general economy and perhaps, most importantly, the #1 thing of course is customers that comes to Ross and do business with us is that we're offering them great deals. So it's a combination of all those factors. But the most important one is that we're offering them a bargain.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Evren Kopelman with Wells Fargo.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask about your micro-merchandising initiatives, kind of maybe where we are in terms of the benefits you expect to see from that and maybe some of the surprises that you have seen that, relative to your expectations, that the systems have allowed you to do.","Michael B. O'Sullivan","So Evren,, we rolled out micro-merchandising perhaps 2 years ago. It is -- it has actually been several years in development, so we spent a lot of time thinking about it before we put it in place and designing it. But it's really been in place for about 2 years across the chain. And we think it's helped our business in terms of making sure that we have the right product going to the right stores at the right time. And it's been a major contributor to us being able to continue to cut our inventory levels, which in turn has improved freshness of the merchandise and help to drive turns. In terms of big surprises, I don't think there's been any. I think it's kind of done what we expect it to. Each store now has a much more customize assortment based upon the micro-merchandising planning and trending that we've done but the best kind of what we intend it to do. So no big surprises to report.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Pamela Quintiliano from Oppenheimer.","Daniel Jacome - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","It's Dan Jacome filling in for Pamela. Just had a quick question on Ross versus dd's. Can you help us think about the traffic and conversion levels at those 2, given that they reflect different demographics? And earlier this week, a competitor, caters to a more constrained consumer, had suggested that the macro is, well, beginning to weigh more heavily. So just any insights would be greatly appreciated.","Michael Balmuth","Dan, in terms of the composition of comps among both companies, very similar traffics driving both of those increases, and we haven't seen a large disparity among the 2.","Michael B. O'Sullivan","And around conversion, both Ross and dd's have pretty help the conversion rates. Typically, what we find is when a customer visits a Ross store or when a customer visits a dd's, more often than not, they are going to find something that they like. So the conversion rates are pretty high at both chains.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Roxanne Meyer from UBS.","Roxanne Meyer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","First, I just wanted to follow up on your comments regarding new customers and where you're getting them from. Wondering if you could share anecdotally any insights as to, are you seeing a wider customer demographic? I know one of your competitors talked about seeing a younger customer increasingly shopping their stores. And then secondly, given that so many retailers are talking about lower sourcing costs trickling through in the back half, wondering if you have any update as to what that impact could be on your business as well.","Michael B. O'Sullivan","So Ross, handling the customer question. Yes. We've certainly done research on the new customers that we've attracted. And by and large, the demog -- they're growing from the same demographic groups as our existing customer base. You've mentioned younger customers. We've always done particularly well with younger customers. I think that's a combination of they're attracted to the great values that we offer and the assortment that we offer. And we see that -- again, in our research on new customers, we see that continuing that we do particularly well with younger customers.","John G. Call","Relative to cost and impact on our business, we price our merchandise off of branded product that's in department stores. So we watch how they -- we'll be watching how they price their product and we have been watching. And we'll be pricing accordingly to keep a proper distance from their retails -- our retails. And the cost for us is really a function of the existing supply lines in the market, okay, regardless of what they're paying for product.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Fuhrman with Piper Jaffray.","Alex J. Fuhrman - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I would like to talk a little bit about the composition of your packaway inventory, given that it's been -- it's been building based on opportunistic buys, and I would assume the quality is very high. If you could comment on the quality of the brands in your packaway inventory, how you feel that sits versus last year. And then, given the strength you've had in the Juniors business the last 11 months, and I know it's a little bit harder to pack that merchandise away because it's a little bit more of a fickle customer in terms of fashion. Has the composition of your packaway inventory by merchandise category changed at all as Juniors has become a more prominent part of the business?","Michael Balmuth","We actually feel very good about the quality of brands in our packaway, and that's the reason why the number has been climbing. Our Junior business is not a big participant in the packaway business. It's a much more trendy business and it happens. There's really one classification, in particular, where we might pack away a little more. But for the most part, in Juniors, it's a buy-and-sell business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Hofkin with William Blair & Co.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just following up on the earlier question on the department stores, specifically, J.C. Penney, can you say qualitatively in trade areas versus non-trade areas of J.C. Penney, are you seeing a measurable difference in the comp over the last -- since earlier this year? And then, is that also helping you on the dislocation among some of your department store competitors helping you in terms of incremental product availability?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","In terms of the sales impact, Daniel, 95% of our stores are within 10 miles of a J.C. Penney. And we've sliced and diced stores based upon proximity. And we don't see a pattern. So analytically, what I can tell you is, we don't see that stores near J.C. Penneys are comping better than stores that are farther away. All the stores, whether they're near or far from J.C. Penney, are doing well. With that said, I'll go back to the point we talked about earlier. With an 8% comp in the first half, it's clear that we're taking share from somewhere, and customers are coming from somewhere. But I think our conclusion is that they're coming from a lot of different places. This is only one factor. There are many other factors driving our comp performance.","John G. Call","And in terms of seeing product as it relates to specifically one retailer, I would say the mid-tiers has struggled a little more in total. And although we don't often know exactly where the product is coming from as then to sell it to us, our suspicion is that we're getting products from a few of the key mid-tier players.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. If I could ask -- I'm sorry, I was just going to say if I could ask one follow-up which is, what sort of the current thought about that drop-through rate on an incremental comp point? I know you guys budget your business for a low comp.","Michael Balmuth","Yes. So our drop-through rates around 25% for incremental sales above plan, and that's about what we're running.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","It's above -- that's above the operating margin on the incremental sales.","Michael Balmuth","It's about the operating margin. That's -- on an annual basis, 1-point comp was probably worth about $0.06 to $0.07.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Montagna from Avondale Partners.","Mark K. Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Just wanted to get a little bit more clarity in terms of customers from major prior question on this. Are you seeing a broadening of your age range by any chance? And are you seeing a broadening of the income demographic, perhaps a higher income demographic?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Well, we -- our customers are pretty -- have a pretty broad set of demographics to begin with. We -- our existing customers are drawn from different income groups, different age groups, entities and so forth. And so, no, we haven't seen any major change in that -- in that profile, in that demographic breakup.","Mark K. Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, just regarding inventory shrink. It sounds like you're guiding to flat. Wouldn't it be logical that if your inventories may be down mid-single digits, we should expect some less shrink to some [indiscernible] less inventory out there?","Michael Balmuth","Is the question we should extract lower shrink levels because we have lower inventories?","Mark K. Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Yes. Because clearly, you're executing well on a lot of the other disciplines to prevent shrink, just is it logical there's that much less to be?","Michael Balmuth","I'd say we hope so. We're optimistic about that. It's not only lower levels of inventory but the programs that we put in place, and we keep investing in that area of the business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Glick with Buckingham Research.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Just 2 quick questions. First, on the SG&A leverage in the second quarter, clearly a very strong operating margin performance. So I was just curious why the leverage wasn't as great as previous quarters. I'm assuming perhaps that it was a higher incentive comp accrual or maybe a catch-up accrual, and I was wondering if you could give some color on that. And then I have a follow-up on your expansion strategy for Ross.","Michael Balmuth","Sure, David. I think that's right. There's always timing issues between quarters. We did have some pretty good leverage in G&A. But we did take our bonus accrual up in the quarter as well. So I'd say good leverage. There's some timing issues in there. But overall, we're pretty pleased with the result.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay, that's helpful. And then in terms of your expansion strategy for the Ross Stores, you opened in Chicago 1 year ago. How do we think about how you fill in the white space as you move across pretty vast area where you don't have stores? Is your strategy to be expanding into more contiguous markets? Or could you kind of leapfrog around to various parts of that white space?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","We -- that's something we look at all the time in terms of [indiscernible] availability and new markets to move into. Right now, our focus is on the new markets we've moved into, such as Chicago and building our scale in those markets. I'd rather not comment in terms of the next markets that we would go to after that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marni Shapiro with The Retail Tracker.","Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker","Two very quick questions. On dd's, as you open stores, should we expect to see a similar growth regionally as the way you rolled out Ross Stores still with the cluster approach and across the Southern tier before you would hit someplace like the Midwest?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Yes. Well, I can't -- a couple of things. One thing for sure is that the approach that we took at Ross, historically, was a very targeted approach, where we pick one market and we move to another market and we move to another market, rather than sort of a shotgun, sort of scattergun kind of approach. We've always tried to be much more focused to build scale in the markets that we're in before we move on. And I think you can certainly expect the same thing in terms of dd's.","Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker","Excellent. And then following on the heels of the last question, is there any thought over a longer period of time of moving into either Canada or secondary or not-obvious markets, like maybe outlet malls?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","On your first question about other country that's nationally, no, not right now. Our priority right now is to make good news within the United States. We're only in just around about 30 states. So until we've expanded into a greater number of states within the U.S., I don't think we're really going to look internationally.","John G. Call","And relative to outlet malls, I don't have the number with me, but we are in several outlet malls.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","As you think about new markets, how do you see the performance in new markets? Anything being done differently in terms of size of store, timeframe to return, logistics in getting those stores accepted in a quicker manner? And lastly, with the strength of the comp that you've been having lately, any way to track how much of the business of the traffic is from new customers, how much is from existing customers?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Dana, on the first thing, markets. We've put a lot of work into preparing for our entry into new markets, and we certainly went back and looked at what we've learned from previous new markets that we entered. And I think there are a number of things that we were able to incorporate into our entry into the Chicago market last year. Those things included just how we factored out setting up an operating team, how we think about marketing. Obviously, we've talked a lot in the past about micro-merchandising and making sure we have better tools to come up with the right assortments as we enter new markets. So I think there are whole host of things that went into preparing for the new market entry. On the second part of your question, new customers versus existing customers. We know that -- from our own research, we do know that our comp growth has been driven by a combination of new customers and existing customers spending more or coming to the store more often. So it's really a combination of both of those.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez from Nomura.","Paul Lejuez - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I was just wondering about the packaway strategy at dd's. How does that compare to Ross Stores? Is it a larger or smaller percentage of the total inventory at any given time?","John G. Call","It's smaller.","Operator","I'm showing there are no further questions on the line. I'll turn the call back to Mr. Balmuth.","Michael Balmuth","Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores.

The call will begin with prepared comments by management followed by a question-and-answer session [Operator instructions].","Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts and other matters that are based on the Company's current forecast of aspects of its future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today's press release and the Company's fiscal 2017 Form 10-K and fiscal 2018 Form 10-Qs and 8-Ks on file with the SEC.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer.","Barbara Rentler","Good morning. Joining me on our call today are Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Group Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, VP Investor Relations. We'll begin our call today with a review of our third quarter and year-to-date performance, followed by our outlook for the remainder of the year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.","As noted in today's press release, both sales and earnings for the quarter were ahead of our forecast despite being up against very strong multiyear comparisons. Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended November 3, 2018, were $0.91 up from $0.72 for the quarter ended October 28, 2017. Net earnings grew to $338 million, up from $274 million in the prior year. Our third quarter 2018 earnings results include a benefit from Tax Reform Legislation of approximately $0.16 per share. Sales of third quarter rose 7% to $3.5 billion with comparable store sales up 3% over the 13 weeks ended November 4, 2017. This compares to 4% gain in same-store sales for the prior year period ended October 28, 2017.","The Midwest and Florida were the strongest regions for the quarter, while men's was the top performing merchandise category. Though above plan, operating margin of 12.4% for the third quarter was down from last year as higher merchandise margin was more than offset by planned increases in freight and this year's wage investments. For the first nine months, earnings per share were $3.06, up from $2.36 last year.","Net earnings for $1.1 billion compared to $912 million in the prior year. The year-to-date earnings results include an approximate benefit of $0.51 per share from tax reform legislation. Sales year-to-date rose 8% to $10.9 billion with comparable store sales up 3% over the 39 weeks ended November 4, 2017. This compares to 4% gain for the nine months ended October 28, 2017.","As we enter the third quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 8% with average in store inventories up 9% compared to last year. As planned, store inventories increased due to the earlier Thanksgiving this year. Packaway as a percentage of total inventories was 41% compared to 46% last year. Similar to Ross, these discounts continue to post better than expected gains in both sales and operating profits for the period.","Turning to our expansion program, we opened 30 new Ross and 10 dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS locations in the third quarter, completing our 2018 store opening program. We expect to end the year with 1,477 Ross and 235 dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS stores for a net increase of 95 locations for fiscal 2018.","Now, Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on a third quarter results and details on our guides for the remainder of the year.","Michael Hartshorn","Thank you, Barbara. Let's start with our third quarter results. Our 3% comparable store sales gain was driven by increases in both traffic and the size of the average basket. As Barbara mentioned, third quarter operating margin of 12.4% was down from last year, though better than forecast.","Cost of goods sold for the quarter rose 60 basis points as a 20 basis point increase in merchandise margins was more than offset by 50 basis points of higher freight cost and increases of 15 basis points each from buying and distribution expenses. Occupancy costs were flat for the quarter.","Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period increased by 30 basis points due to the previously mentioned wage investments. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.9 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $278 million. Year-to-date, we have bought back a total of 9.4 million shares for an aggregate price of $807 million. We remain on track to buyback a total of $1.075 billion in common stock during fiscal 2018.","Let's turn now to our fourth quarter outlook. As reported in our press release, while we hope to do better, we continue to project fourth quarter comparable store sales to increase 1% to 2% versus our strongest prior year comparable stores sales gain of 5%. We're now forecasting our earnings per share to be in the range of $1.09 to $1.14, which includes a one-time nontax benefit of approximately $0.07 per share related to the favorable resolution of a tax matter. This updated guidance compares to earnings per share for the 14 weeks ended February 3, 2018 of $1.19, which included a per share benefit of $0.14 from onetime revaluation of deferred taxes and $0.10 on the 53rd week.","The operating statement assumptions for the holiday period guidance include the following. Total sales are projected to increase 1% to 2% and operating margin is forecasted to be in the range of 12.6% to 12.8% versus 14.6% last year. This guidance reflects a negative impact from the additional week last year, which benefited sales by $219 million and operating margin by 70 basis points.","Net interest income is estimated to be about $3.6 million. Our tax rate is planned at approximately 19% to 20%, which includes the aforementioned one-time tax benefit. And we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about $370 million. Based on our year-to-date results and projected fourth quarter guidance, we are now planning earnings per share for the full year on a 52 week basis to be in the range of $4.15 to $4.20.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments.","Barbara Rentler","Thank you, Michael. Looking ahead to this year's holiday season, while we hope to do better, we believe it's prudent to maintain a somewhat conservative posture entering the fourth quarter. As previously mentioned, our projected same store sales growth of 1% to 2% is on top of robust multiyear gains. In addition, we expect another intensely competitive holiday season, both in brick and mortar and online.","Nonetheless, we remain confident in the strength of off-price and most importantly, our ability to perform well within this sector. As long as we remain focused on the careful execution of our strategies, we believe and continue to achieve solid gains in both sales and earnings as we have for some time now.","At this point, we would like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from Simeon Siegel from Nomura Instinet. ","Simeon Siegel","First off, do you have a view you could share on the health of just the broader retail channel into holiday? And then Mike, could you speak to the moving pieces you expect within gross margin for 4Q and then maybe anything to keep in mind for going forward.","Barbara Rentler","View of the health of the broader retail channel?","Simeon Siegel","Yes, just how you're thinking about pricing and inventory levels, the full price channel\u2026","Barbara Rentler","And this fourth quarter will be as fiercely competitive as it's been in the past. So in terms of pricing, my expectation would be is that there'll still be tremendous promotions and that's what people would use to drive the business. In terms of just the general health overall of the channel, I mean obviously, there's more money in the economy and so one would expect that consumers would be spending. But I think it remains to be seen. And again, I really believe that's going to be highly promotional again, and the AUR depends but I think it will be promotional.","Michael Hartshorn","On fourth quarter guidance and some of the trends, so as we mentioned in the remarks, gross margin was down 60 basis points for the quarter and that was driven by higher merchandise margin that was offset by ongoing freight cost inflation. I would expect more of the same going into the fourth quarter. Freight cost will continue to be a headwind at similar levels. We'll also continue to see wage deleverage. As a reminder, we increased our minimum wage to $11 mid-year so the impact is greater in the back half than in the front half.","Simeon Siegel","And just any moving pieces within packaway that you'd expect?","Michael Hartshorn","No, for the quarter, packaway was relatively neutral and our guidance assumes it would be neutral in Q4.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matthew Boss from JP Morgan. ","Matthew Boss","On the expense front, what was the magnitude of the wage investment in 3Q? And should we expect a similar headwind in 4Q? And then just larger picture as we move beyond this year. Is there any reason to think about a 3 comp not continuing to be the leverage point for SG&A? Just maybe any headwinds or tailwinds to think about that would make it any different?","Michael Hartshorn","On SG&A as we mentioned, it de-levered by about 30 basis points and that was wage investment. I'd expect similar to maybe slightly higher in Q4, Q3. We actually -- versus guidance SG&A was a bit lower as we had some good cost control there. We wouldn't comment on 2019 at this point going forward. That said, we would expect to continue to have wage and freight inflation, but we'll also be looking for efficiencies in our business to offset those costs. And we'll have more to say on that in our year-end conference call in early 2019.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Greenberger","Michael, could you look back at the freight inflation, which I know has been going on here for a couple of years. I think it really picked up this year and I can't remember if it inflected in the second quarter or really more here in Q3. I'm just wondering how to think about the magnitude of potential pressure in out years. I know you are not providing 2019 guidance. But any help on the cadence of freight would be great? And then I wanted to ask about the overall retail environment. I think there was a department store largely in the Midwest that shut operations. Are you seeing any benefit to the stores in your -- where you've got co-location or -- whether or not you do have co-location with that retailer? And do you think that may give you additional opportunities to develop new brands or acquire inventory here over the upcoming year? Thank you.","Michael Hartshorn","On freight cost, Kimberly, it's hard to say like all markets, at some point, we'll reach some equilibrium. It's hard to predict when that will be. As you know, there are number of things driving freight costs this year; very tight capacity, higher rates driven by Trucker and driver shortages; the improved economy is obviously impacting capacity; regulations around electronically monitoring drivers; and then diesel costs aren't helping that, that are 20% -- up 20% year-over-year and in the third quarter, which is at three year highs. So we'll wait to see what happens next year but at this point, we'd expect Q4 to look a lot like Q3.","Gary Cribb","And then Kimberly on your question about some store closures at other retailers. In general, I would say when another retailer closes it tends to help tend to help the whole -- the remaining retailer. That business has to go somewhere. So you'd expect the remaining retailers to benefit to some degree. So as other retailer close stores or as other retailers liquidate, we'd expect to win some of that business. It's hard to quantify the precise impact in any given year it's not likely to be material. But over the long term we think that's beneficial.","Barbara Rentler","And in terms of supply, usually store closures generate some form of supply.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Tunick from Royal Bank of Canada.","Brian Tunick","I guess two questions, one curious Michael about in-store inventories, I guess up 9%. Curious what they would have been ex the Thanksgiving timing and how you're thinking about in-store inventory levels maybe from here heading into next year from a philosophy perspective. And then maybe Barbara, do you want to talk about as you lap last year's very healthy 5% comp in the fourth quarter, maybe what are two or three things that the organization is doing differently this year, whether it's marketing, product flow, mix et cetera, to lap last year's strong performance. Thank you very much.","Michael Hartshorn","Brian on the inventory, as we mentioned in our remarks, Thanksgiving is a week earlier this year so we did slow inventory without -- so in-store inventory was up about 8%. Without that inventories would have been relatively flat. And as far as expectations for running the business, going forward beyond this 53rd week comparison year, we'd expect inventory levels to be relatively flat.","Barbara Rentler","In terms of things we're doing to be up against the strong comparison, we're really building out what works out for us. In the past, we've had many years of robust gains in the fourth quarter. So this isn't the first time we're up against the strong number. And really what we were building on is further opportunities and gift giving, because that really is what drives sales in the fourth quarter and we view that as something that goes on in the entire box, obviously, home is the place where there's always strong gift giving opportunities. But we feel last year we were successful in other areas in gift giving and so we're building upon that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank for America Merrill Lynch. ","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to just follow up on the packaway numbers, which were down for the second quarter in a wow as a percentage of inventory. Is there anything going on with what you're seeing in the market or what you're deciding to hold in packaway versus flow immediately?","Barbara Rentler","No, actually there's still strong availability in the market. So we haven't we haven't seen availability drop off. But the packaway can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter month-to-month based on what's out there. No, I wouldn't say that -- I think what we're putting in packaway is appropriate. There\u2019s lot of criteria about what we put in packaway, you have to feel as good about it as it comes out when it comes out. So I wouldn't say there's any shift in our thinking as it pertains to packaway. And then obviously this quarter, as Michael said, we slowed parkaway earlier this year Thanksgiving is a week earlier, so that's really part of the shift that you're seeing right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell","On the 3% comp in 3Q, very solid against tough compares, I know you said men's lagged. Just curious of any other takeaways or details on the top line in 3Q, especially as it relates to beauty and home efforts and kids and outerwear. Just curious what you're seeing on those fronts? And also just on the merchandise margins being up, if you can just talk about the drivers of sustainability potential for additional gains ahead?","Michael Hartshorn","On the performance -- comp performance during the quarter, as we mentioned in our remarks; men's was a top performer for our; shoes and accessories also performed above the chain average; home was relatively in line; and then in terms of apparel versus non-apparel, they were relatively similar for the quarter. As we mentioned on merchandise margins, it was up about 20 basis points that was driven by being able to chase the business and above plan sales and also better buying. Our strategy has always been to go in with a more conservative comp and if we can chase the business, we can also drive merchandise margin. So that's the way we would think about it going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jay Sole from UBS.","Jay Sole","My question is about you talked about how it's going to be pretty emotional 4Q environment. Do you see that more in relation to the bulk price competitors or more from the off price competitors? And secondly, how much would you be willing to trade and merchandise margin, which has been very strong in exchange for better sales?","Barbara Rentler","Well, the promotional environment, I think, in full price, it's historically been promotional. I think it will be promotional. I think we're watching to get it more promotional in the last few weeks. In terms of the off prices, I mean they're putting out their values the way we were putting out our values I don't know if I consider that the same thing nobody promotes, nobody -- there's no POS. So I think we feel that we have very strong values going out on the floor and we feel good about that comparison. Obviously, I'm not going to compare it to my other two off-price competitors. And what was the second part of your question?","Jay Sole","If you felt like you wanted to drive sales, how much could you try to trade merchandise margin for sales?","Barbara Rentler","Actually, I don't think we need to trade merchandise margin for sales. I think, the merchants -- we have the large merchant team and a big vendor base and they are out getting really strong values every day of the week. And so I think there's always that fine line that's the art not a science of deciding how much money versus what the retailers where you're offering the customer compelling bargain that you can. And so I think that's what we do every day of the week. And I think the merchants are very, very attuned to that.","So I don't think that they have the direct line of if I just -- to say we'll tighten up the IMU or just something there's a direct line to that, because I think the merchants really are out there getting best possible values. And they are out, competitive shopping, looking at what bulk price stores are doing, looking at what the other off prices are doing. So we're in the value gains to each other and that's really our strategy. And I don't think that would be a strategy we would use going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Lejuez from Citi.","Paul Lejuez","Curious if you could talk about the sales cadence during the quarter, and I\u2019m not sure if you mentioned whether or not the weather helped or hurt you? If you can make any comment on weather during 3Q. And I am also curious just near-term, any impact from the fires out west, how many stores are impacted? And do you expect that to be any material impact to 4Q sales? Thanks.","Michael Hartshorn","Paul, just on the fires, we wouldn\u2019t comment on fourth quarter impact at this point. In terms of weather in the third quarter, it did not have a meaningful impact and obviously, a lot of moving parts with two major hurricanes last year and then a bounce back afterwards and then the southeast hurricane this year. In terms of trend, so overall weather neutral for the quarter and then trends during the quarter, comps were stronger earlier in the quarter. Late in Q3 were up against the bounce back from the two major hurricanes last year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Binetti from Credit Suisse.","Michael Binetti","I know you talked about some of the cost drivers. I want to look at a little bit further than just fourth quarter though. As we look into next year, do you guys have an impact from the changes in lease accounting that we need to think about next year? I think a competitor mentioned that also put it on the radar? And then related to tariffs, I\u2019m just wondering if you can help us think about what the behavior in the industry is. If there\u2019s an analogy period you could point to for your own business to help us think about how tariffs impact the business like any past global macro events like that that can help us think about how players in the industry build inventories and how you guys think about what the inventory situation could look like if we have some issues at the border here?","Michael Hartshorn","On lease accounting next year, yes, there is some impact. Its non-cash related. It\u2019s purely accounting. And again, we would look to find areas in the business to offset those additional costs.","Gary Cribb ","And on tariffs, Michael, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything -- there\u2019s any historic event that we could point to that would be a good analogy on tariffs. Other than saying, in general, the tariff situation in terms of will there be tariffs, which things will have tariffs on them? How long will tariffs last? Well, it all creates uncertainty. And in an uncertain environment, off-price tends to do comparatively well in that environment but really no historical event that we could point to as a comparison.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alexander Walvis from Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Walvis","We had a question on home, thanks for the color on some of the category drivers of the comp, just the home was in line with some of the other categories this quarter, having outperformed for the rest of the business for some time. Is there anything specific that you can talk to there or any change to the strategy of increasing penetration across the business? Thank you.","Barbara Rentler","Home was up against its very solid results last few years. And so the performance relatively in line with the chain -- above planned chain sales for the quarter felt okay. In terms of looking at future, looking at assortments, we\u2019re always looking to grow new businesses and look within our four walls to improve the assortment. So in terms of specifics, I wouldn\u2019t go into specifics but we do think home is the growth area. It\u2019s very broad based but a large amount of different products are conglomerate into there. So we do feel good about it and again always looking to improve it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo.","Ike Boruchow","But I guess to start to the team, just curious if you guys have looked into the tax dynamics for your consumer, mainly in early \u201819. It seems like the low end consumer could have a very favorable cycle ahead of them. So just curious wanted to ask if you guys have dug into that at all or had any thoughts.","Michael Hartshorn"," I guess we have looked at it. And obviously, that would have an impact on the first quarter but we'll have more to say about that going into next year. The tax rebate cycle has changed pretty dramatically over the next couple years, so we'll have to see what we build into our expectations when we give our year end results at the beginning of next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Janine Stichter from Jefferies. ","Janine Stichter","I just wanted to ask about the composition of the basket. I think in the past, you've called it out as being you featured in. Just one another -- I think the call out in terms of AUR tickets? Thank you.","Michael Hartshorn","As we mentioned 3% comp was driven by higher traffic and an increase of the average basket. The basket was all driven by units per transaction. AUR was relatively flat for the quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from Laura Champine from Loop Capital. ","Laura Champine","I'm wondering, Barbara, to the extent that you can tell. Do you think that Ross gained share or just held share in the apparel market overall? And the context we\u2019re asking the question, I'm sure you can surmise is that Ross's comp although it was good, was well below what we perceived as its nearest competitor this quarter.","Barbara Rentler","In terms of our performance, I mean, obviously, I'm not going to comment on our competitor. But on a one, two, and three basis, we were up against a 3, a 4 in 2017 and 7 in 2016. So in terms of our comp performance, overall, it was 14. So in terms of gaining share in apparel versus our competitor, I think it's very hard for us to measure the share of apparel that we're gaining quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year. But I would say is that apparel has grown significantly over the years as our comps have grown over the years. So I think it's hard for us to compare back to one of our competitors now would I really compare back to that but apparel obviously continues to grow.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bob Drbul from Guggenheim Securities. ","Robert Drbul","Just a couple category questions. Can you talk about what you're seeing in the toy category and just your expectations there, especially into the holiday? And I was wondering if you could maybe talk about your footwear business, men's shoes, women's shoes and boots and just the opportunities that you see in that category as well. ","Barbara Rentler","In terms of toys, we obviously see some opportunity in toys with all the recent bankruptcies and closures. But toys is overall a small percentage of our business so historically toys does get bigger for up during bigger part of our mix holiday and will be again this year. But in terms of a grand total for the Ross, it's still a small business but yes, again some opportunity. In terms of our footwear business, our footwear business has outperformed the chain average in the third quarter it's very broad based between the three businesses. And in terms of the mix itself, again, it's pretty broad. I mean boot business with the weather -- I'm sure, boot businesses the boot business has been good for a few years now. So I think overall it's strong execution in our business and maximizing some key opportunities.","Robert Drbul","And just question on the wages, with the investments that you've made. Do you feel like you're ahead of the curve just keeping up in terms of the competitiveness? And are you seeing any challenges to filling your new store openings with employees?","Michael Hartshorn","So we feel good about where we are with the workforce today. Obviously, we've raised wages and that's good news for the people that we're looking to hire. And store-by-store, we really haven't seen issues in filling our new stores.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chethan Mallela from Barclays.","Chethan Mallela","So I just wanted to follow-up on the tariff situation and I know it's hard to give a precise estimate, particularly with close outs. But can you just frame how much your product inventory or maybe how many of your 8,000 vendors are based in China? And then how you think about the impact of the tariffs that have been announced to-date versus what the impact would look like if there's more sizable prevention?","Barbara Rentler","In terms of our 8,000 vendors, you have to remember the bulk of our business is a closeout business. So -- and we're buying close-outs, we're not tracking country of origin. The manufacturer of manufacturing goods wherever they manufacturer them and we're buying them. So in terms of answering your question about what percentage of the 8,000 vendors would impact, I really don't have that information. In terms of just tariff impact, in total, I think there is certain classification of business. Obviously, home has most impacted and some parts of accessories but really home. And I would say that the trade tensions have left a lot of uncertainty in the marketplace.","And it could lead to supply as we go down the road but impacts like to-date as of this minute, I think everyone's in the process of assessing what actions to take as it pertains to the tariffs. I don't really think -- we're not leave with a follow-of when it comes to something like this. And there is no clear vendor strategy, I don't think the vendors -- each vendor has their own strategy. So I think we are doing what we can do to assess our actions of what's appropriate for us. And then in terms of direct exposure for us to tariff, it really is for us in the home area and we don't disclose that percentage but is a relatively small piece of our total mix of sale. So I think there's just a lot of moving parts as it pertains to tariffs at this point in time.","Again, the vendor community I think doesn't necessarily have -- it's a vendor by vendor strategy. There's no comprehensive strategy, because I think there's just so much unknown. If the tariff were to move on to -- tariff were move on to apparel then obviously that's a much larger scale issue for everyone. Inflation in apparel, we haven't seen in many, many, many years. So I think there's certainly challenges attached to that and we'll cross that bridge when we get there.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Telsey","As you think about real estate, while I think occupancy was flat this quarter as compared to the leverage of 15 basis points last quarter. What are you seeing on renewals of leases and negotiations? And with the Sears boxes now available, does that provide you with locations that you may want either 4 dd\u2019s or even part of it or four Ross? Thank you.","Michael Hartshorn","Dana, I would say that in general we\u2019re happy with the availability of the implications we\u2019re seeing. We have a great real estate team and they\u2019ve done a great job over the last several years, finding locations for our store expansion. Certainly, store closures in terms of closures by other retailers have helped and contributed to that availability. But it depends on a specific retail. I mean some retailers are more based and that really isn\u2019t location we'd be interest in whereas you know we're respectable retailers. So I would say overall, we\u2019re pretty happy. But when you\u2019re looking at specific retailers and the impact that they have it really depends on what real estate prices they have.","Dana Telsey","And the fact that occupancy was flat this quarter. Is there opportunity to get leverage again or how do you think about it?","Michael Hartshorn","So Dana on the leverage point for the year for occupancy is 3%. Historically, that\u2019s been 4%. So we are in a better position this year. Remember that the comp sales and fiscal sales are two different metrics this year, because of the week shift. You got more leverage in the first half of the year, because fiscal sales were higher than comp sales and that reverse in the back half. But for the year, we think occupancy costs -- our leverage points around 3%. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Daniel Hofkin from William Blair.","Daniel Hofkin","Just a quick clarification again on the topic of the retail environment, I know the question has been asked. But you guys are typically conservative. You\u2019ve talked about every year being a little bit more promotional more intense. Do you see that trajectory steepening or is it just a continuation of that? That\u2019s my first question. And then my second question is as it relates to port bottlenecks related to tariffs. Are there any categories where even if you\u2019re not directly importing where you\u2019re seeing maybe some full price retailers have more disruption?","Barbara Rentler","Well on the retail environment, I think obviously, we think it\u2019s promotional every year. So I think it\u2019s that different from Q3 to Q4. I think we might see some movement between Q3 and Q4. But again every year is promotional, so that will vary by retailer based on their performance and their business model -- so I think in their performance. So I think we will see -- I think we will see more of that. In terms of the port bottlenecks and supply, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen any one particular place that has port bottleneck as it's led completely to supply. So one, you\u2019re saying is it one product. I think the port bottlenecks because everyone brought in goods many manufacturers bringing goods from China because of the tariffs and they\u2019re trying to get them into the country earlier, it has I think affected everyone. But we haven\u2019t seen it one pure classification of business that we'd say that\u2019s where it\u2019s going to be. I think if there's supply that\u2019s the result of the bottleneck, it'll be broad based.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Morris from D.A. Davidson. ","John Morris","You all have done a really good job managing expenses with the headwinds at freight and labor, and using offsets to help mitigate that. Wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on those offsets. What areas they're coming in from so we can get a magnitude feel for that and the categories? And then also second question would be your holiday initiatives with respect to marketing spending this year versus last year. Is it about the same in terms of that spend or maybe any color there? Thanks.","Michael Hartshorn","On offset there is no silver bullet on the offsets. I mean there's -- we look throughout the company whether its payroll related in DCs and the stores and how we become more efficient. It is -- we have a strategic sourcing group that looks on how we procure either products or services. And when I say products I mean non-merchant related -- merchandising related products. So we're always looking for efficiencies in our business. And it's a death by a 1,000 paper cuts and so lot of different things. And we have groups that try to stay ahead of the inflation curve and we'll continue to do that going into next year and beyond.","Michael O'Sullivan","So second part of your question on marketing, no material changes in the amount of marketing spend in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Kernan from Cowen. ","John Kernan","So just given the dynamic with freight, do you foresee any additional investments you might need to make around the store, D.C. network to maybe increasing efficiencies?","Michael O'Sullivan","On the DC Network, our investments there certainly with higher wages, it presents as an opportunity to invest in automation and we'll do that over time for efficiencies. The next reason to invest in the network is capacity related. Right now, we think we have the capacity and would start the next distribution center over the next couple of years.","John Kernan","And just one quick follow up. Have you seen any noticeable benefit from stores that are co-located with some of the recent bankruptcies? And certainly these don't seem like -- feel like it's going to be the end of some of the bankruptcies. So I'm just wondering if you are noticing any increase in traffic or any benefit from selling disclosures.","Michael O'Sullivan","Typically, I would say this is as a general observation. As a store is closing as it's going through out of business or going out of business period, we might actually see a bit of a negative in the local stores. But then once it's gone out of business, we typically see an uptick. And I think as I said earlier, in general store closures of competitors tend to be good for our business. But we typically don't have a material impact in any given year it's just over the long run store closures accumulate we tend to see -- that tends to be a tailwind for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from Omar Saad from Evercore ISI. ","Omar Saad","Barbara, wanted to ask you to dig in a little bit deeper on your earlier comments around your expectations that the holiday season will be -- continue to be very promotional holiday season. And we're hearing from a lot of retailers, the inventories are clean, you're seeing merchant margins rise and broadly speaking in this offline space, yourself included. Maybe give me a little color, gives us a little bit more color around what gives you that sense that it's going to be pretty promotional again? And then any update or color on new marketing strategy. I know you talked about the marketing spend being flat. But are you trying any new marketing strategies, digital or social that you care to share with us? Thanks.","Barbara Rentler","In terms of the holiday season, traditionally, the holiday season is promotional. And although, inventories might be leaner, we have the 53rd week, things are moving faster. And I think if we really look at it between online and brick-and-mortar, as online gets more aggressive and gets aggressive early, in the fourth quarter brick-and-mortar stores, we'll have to get more aggressive also. Plus I don't think all performances have been created equal in Q3 based on department store. So some department stores may promote more, some departments are may promote less. But overall, I would be very surprised if we come out of the quarter without it being promotional, especially the last week to 10 days as -- while the customer shopping. Thanksgiving is already -- it's here, it feels are always.","But again we've been walking -- there has been some more promotional increases in the last few weeks as people raise the POS. And so I put those pieces together and I recognize that there are potentially less inventory. But if you're trying to drive sales, ultimately at the end that's the drive sales and that's what history tells us. So that's where it came to that conclusion.","Michael O'Sullivan","And Omar your question about marketing, I would split it into two pieces. I think first of all in terms of marketing strategy and the marketing message, I think that\u2019s been very consistent over time, the message being that we offer the best values in apparel and from fashions that message isn't going to change. But what has changed is that the channels that we're using to reach the customer to get that message out have evolved. So we've always recognize that the best marketing for us is word of mouth marketing. And over the last few years, we have been experimenting and investing in various new forms of marketing, social media, et cetera. And we find that those tools represent a modern day version of word of mouth marketing. So I'd still describe some of the things we're getting there at certain stage, so definitely it's -- that's the direction our marketing is moving in.","Operator","That was our last question. I will turn the call back over Barbara Rentler for closing remarks.","Barbara Rentler ","Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores.

The call will begin with prepared comments by management, followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].","Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts and other matters that are based on the company's current forecasts of aspects of its future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today's press release and the company's fiscal 2015 Form 10-K and fiscal 2016 Form 8-Ks on file with the SEC.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer.","Barbara Rentler","Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Balmuth, Executive Chairman; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Vice President, Investor Relations.","We will begin our call today with a review of our first quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.","Earnings per share for the first quarter were $0.73 or a 6% gain on top of a robust 19% increase in the prior year period. Net earnings for the quarter were $291 million, up from $282 million last year.","Sales increased 5% to $3.89 billion with comparable store sales up 2% on top of a strong 5% gain in the first quarter of 2015.","Despite facing our strongest prior year comparisons, along with merchandising execution issues in ladies apparel, sales performed at the high end of guidance, while earnings per share were slightly above our targeted range.","During the quarter, home and shoes were the best performing merchandised categories at Ross, while ladies apparel underperformed. Geographically the Mid-West and Mid-Atlantic were the strongest regions. Although our first quarter operating margin of 15.4% was down from last year, it was slightly above plan mainly due to higher merchandised margins that partially offset the expected impact from the unfavorable timing of packaway related expenses.","As we ended the first quarter, total consolidated inventories were flat versus the prior year with average in-store inventories down slightly. Packaway as a percent of total inventories was 46% compared to 45% at this time last year. Both sales and operating profits at dd's DISCOUNTS were better than expected in the first quarter as customers continue to respond positively to dd\u2019s value offerings.","Our store expansion program remains on track as we opened 22 new Ross and six dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS stores in the first quarter. We continue to expect to add a total of 90 new locations in 2016 comprised of approximately 70 Ross and 20 dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS. As usual these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores during the year.","Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our first quarter results and details on our second quarter guidance.","Michael Hartshorn","Thank you, Barbara. Our 2% comparable store sales gain was driven by an increase in the size of the average baskets. As Barbara mentioned, first quarter operating margin of 15.4% was down 30 basis points from last year which was better than our guidance for a 50 to 70 basis points decline.","Cost of goods sold increased 10 basis points in the quarter mainly due to a 55 basis point increase in distribution expenses from the expected impact of a new distribution center; we opened in the second quarter of last year, as well as the unfavorable timing of packaway related costs that benefited this period in 2015. These expense pressures were partially offset by merchandised margins that rose a better than expected 35 basis points and 10 basis points in lower buying costs.","Selling, general, and administrative expenses during the period increased by 20 basis points due to a combination of deleverage from the 2% increase in comparable store sales and also higher wages.","During the first quarter, we repurchased 3.1 million shares for a total purchase price of $176 million. This keeps us on track to buy back as planned a total of $700 million in stock for the year which will complete the two-year $1.4 billion program authorized by our Board of Directors in February 2015.","Let\u2019s turn now to our second quarter guidance. We continue to forecast same-store sales for the 13-weeks ending July 30, 2016, to be up 1% to 2% on top of a 4% gain in the second quarter of 2015 with earnings per share of $0.64 to $0.67 compared to $0.63 last year.","Our guidance for the second quarter is based on the following assumptions. Total sales are projected to increase 4% to 5%. We expect to open 31 new stores during the period including 24 Ross and 7 dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS locations.","Second quarter operating margin is projected to be relatively flat at 13.8% to 14.0% compared to last year\u2019s 13.9%.","In addition, net interest expense for the quarter is estimated to be about $4 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 38% to 39% and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be above $397 million. Based on our first quarter results and the second quarter guidance, we now project fiscal 2016 earnings per share to be in the range of $2.63 to $2.72 compared to $2.51 last year.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments.","Barbara Rentler","Thank you, Michael. As mentioned earlier, even though we faced our toughest prior year comparisons and comparable store sales came in at the high-end of guidance with earnings per share performing slightly above our target range, we feel we should have done better.","In hindsight, we now know that we had some merchandised execution issues in ladies apparel during the quarter that are now in the process of being addressed. Looking ahead, we have plenty of open to buys, which gives our merchants the ability to select the best values from the large volume of products available in the marketplace today.","Being in this position will enable us to offer customers even more fresh and exciting new bargains as we move through the second quarter and the balance of 2016. As always, providing customers with the most compelling name brand values possible is a key driver of both our short and long-term success.","At this point, we would like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions].","Your first question is from Paul Lejuez with Citi.","Paul Lejuez","Hi, thanks, guys. On the last call, I believe you mentioned that you were holding back a little bit on some of your potential packaway buys because you thought the deals were going to get even better. I'm just wondering if that came to fruition throughout the quarter. And, if so, when do you plan to flow those goods into the stores? And also just kind of curious about performance in some of your larger states, California, Texas, Florida. Thanks.","Barbara Rentler","Okay. Paul, as it pertains to packaway, yes, we did buy packaway goods in the first quarter that we would use for second quarter and for fall. We\u2019re actually pleased with the packaway assortments that we have. And in terms of --","Michael Balmuth","I think your other question was on regions, so Michael do you want to comment on that?","Michael Hartshorn","Sure on the regions Paul, the Mid-West and the Mid-Atlantic as we said in the comments were the strongest regions. The Mid-West has been very strong over the last several years, while the Mid-Atlantic benefited from a favorable weather comparison versus last year.","In terms of other states, you mentioned California our largest region performed slightly below the chain average. Texas was above the chain average on top of a strong performance last year when it was also above the chain average. And then Florida, trailed the chain average we believe some of the merchandising issues that Barbara mentioned in her comments had a bigger impact to Florida as we transitioned spring product earlier there.","Paul Lejuez","And then just one follow-up -- what's the timing on when you feel like you might have the merchandising issues fixed on the ladies apparel side?","Barbara Rentler","At this point, we\u2019re working on -- we\u2019re working on the issues that were there on the process of being addressed. We\u2019re working to fix them as quickly as possible and it\u2019s embedded in our guidance for Q2. So we hope to do that.","Operator","The next question is from Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray.","Neely Tamminga","Great. I was wondering if you could elaborate a little more in the ladies apparel merchandising issues. Is it within the category or is it kind of more broad-based? We\u2019re just trying to better understand that issue. Thank you.","Barbara Rentler","Well what I would say is that we could have done a much better job of executing our merchandise game in ladies. And it was mainly in the transition to spring product that we made some execution errors.","Operator","Your next question is from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.","Ike Boruchow","Hey sorry guys, can you hear me?","Michael Hartshorn","Yes.","Barbara Rentler","Yes.","Ike Boruchow","I\u2019m sorry about that. I think this is the first time in the last four or five quarters that you didn't call out transactions as being up and a driver of comp. Is that all attributable? I assume that's not a real traffic number. Is the transactions not being called out, does that mean transactions were down? And again, is just that all related to the ladies apparel category?","Michael Hartshorn","Ike as we mentioned in our remarks that 2% comp was driven by the size of the average basket, transactions. Our proxy for traffic was flat during the quarter. The higher basket was driven mainly from higher units for transactions.","Ike Boruchow","Got it, thank you.","Barbara Rentler","What I would add Ike is that, that I believe in our assortments of ladies apparel are not up to the standards that our customers come to expect that probably makes us a little less compelling to shop.","Operator","The next question is from Daniel Hofkin with William Blair & Company.","Daniel Hofkin","Good afternoon. Could you may be quantify what comps might have been in other categories to give us some sense of what that impact would have been from ladies apparel and moving forward kind of how you see that, it sounds like you\u2019re in the process of fixing it, do you think it\u2019s realistically fixable by holidays third and fourth quarter? Thanks.","Michael Hartshorn","Sure. In terms of other merchandise performance we did have categories that performed well, home and shoes did very well for us. In terms of trying to understand the impact, it\u2019s always hard to do. That said our comparable store sales did slow one to two points from our trends in the back half of last year.","Barbara Rentler","What I would say is we\u2019re working to address the issues and to fix them as quickly as possible. No we\u2019ve been doing this for long time now, we\u2019ve made mistakes before and we\u2019re going to get it fixed.","Operator","Your next question is from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.","Stephen Grambling","Hey good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Just to clarify on an earlier question, as you think about the distribution headwinds as well as the packaway headwinds, can you just clarify how that should progress over the course of the year? Thanks.","Michael Hartshorn","Sure, Steven. So in the quarter distribution costs were 55 basis points higher than last year and that\u2019s split fairly evenly between anniversarying the opening of our distribution center in the second quarter of last year and also the timing of packaway related costs. As we get into the second quarter, the impact of that DC will be about half of what it was in the first quarter and will have it fully anniversaried when we get back to the back half of the year.","In terms of timing of packaway, if you recall last year, we got a benefit in the first quarter, we got a benefit in the third quarter, and took a charge in the fourth quarter. So we\u2019re up against those this year. So we had about half of the 55 basis points with a drag in this first quarter and our upcoming second quarter, the guidance assumes packaway relatively flat.","Stephen Grambling","That\u2019s very helpful. And then turning back to the top-line is there any comments that you can provide on the trend throughout the quarter especially as it relates to traffic, was it pretty consistent or was there any particularly strong changes as the quarter progress. Thanks.","Michael Hartshorn","Sure, Stephen. Sales were relatively consistent throughout the quarter. Comp sales for March and April combined which removed the impact of the Easter calendar shift were very similar to what we saw in February.","Stephen Grambling","Great, thanks so much. Best of luck in the back half.","Operator","Your next question is from Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Greenberger","Great, thank you. Barbara, I\u2019m not sure if there is anything else that you would like to share about just your observations on the trends, the spring transition in ladies apparel, if so obviously we would love to hear them. And I\u2019m wondering obviously that is impacting I would imagine to start here through the second quarter, do you think that there is an opportunity perhaps for that ladies business to get back on track by the time we get it to the July timeframe or do you really think that the full second quarter will be impacted, I would imagine that the issues here do not -- you would not expect them to continue into the back half of the year but I just want to make sure that\u2019s a fair assumption. Thank you so much.","Barbara Rentler","So let me start with in terms of the transition of ladies, the only other flavor I would put to it is that really what we found is that we had wrong fabrications and colors, they were not appropriate. So our assortment was I would off course. In terms of start to the second quarter, we obviously couldn\u2019t comment that in the quarter that we\u2019re in. In terms of the back half, so we\u2019re working on it, we\u2019re drilling in, figuring out what\u2019s wrong, working on it trying to fix things as quickly as possible but it\u2019s hard to forget. So we\u2019ve got it embedded in our guidance and we\u2019re hoping to do better.","Kimberly Greenberger","Great. Thank you so much. And just one last question, obviously this execution challenge relates to current in-season product that you got in the stores. Can you reflect on the product that\u2019s been put into packaway and do you think there is some risk that some of the products that\u2019s been put into the packaway could also have suffered from a similar execution issue or do you have different guardrail around the product as it goes into the packaway relative to what you got in the stores at this time?","Barbara Rentler","No we\u2019re comfortable with what we have in packaway; we don\u2019t think the two issues relate.","Operator","The next question is from Brian Tunick with RBC.","Brian Tunick","Thanks, good afternoon. Couple of questions. I guess number one from an in-store inventory reduction opportunity, can you may be just give us an update there on sort of what we should think about the rest of the year could look like obviously you\u2019ve made great strides, how you\u2019re thinking we should expect in-store inventories to play out. And then Q1 is usually choppy between the tax refunds and obviously there was the gas price relief, did you guys have any chance to parse out, I guess California saw the wage hikes first, you call that I think out underperforming the change. Just any perspective as you think about the tax refunds, the gas price relief the wage hikes for your consumer?","Michael Balmuth","So Brian, I will take the second part of your question first, may be Michael Hartshorn will respond on the expectations for reductions throughout the rest of the year. But in terms of some of the issues you raised like gas prices, wages et cetera. I mean our business is always affected by sort of external variables and when we came into the year, we did -- we raised some concerns about the economic and the consumer outlook.","It\u2019s difficult to as you say parse out of those different components and quantify their impact. The -- what I would say though is that I think we\u2019ve always acknowledged that our performance is more than anything driven by our own execution. So although many of those things that you mentioned were important in Q1, I think our own execution was most important thing that\u2019s why Barbara called it out in her comments.","Michael Hartshorn","Brian on inventory levels we came into the year expectations that after many, many years of inventory reductions that our expectation we\u2019re going to operate the business with slightly lower inventory this year and that expectation hasn\u2019t changed.","Brian Tunick","Okay. And then lastly on dd\u2019s does it have any of the same women\u2019s sportswear issues that Barbara is talking about it at Ross?","Barbara Rentler","No.","Brian Tunick","All right, thanks very much. Good luck for the summer.","Barbara Rentler","Thank you.","Michael Hartshorn","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew Boss","Thanks. So your forward-looking caution on the overall retail backdrop last quarter, I mean proved pretty spot on. I guess any changes to your larger picture outlook today versus where you were three months ago, how are you guys thinking about price competition in the back half and then just any categories of particular closeout opportunity that you\u2019re seeing right now in the landscape?","Michael Hartshorn","So Matthew on the first piece, again I will say the external environment is one of a number of things that affects our performance. If consumer spending goes down and that leads to a more promotional competitive environment and that\u2019s generally not good. But having said that, we certainly in the past that we can perform well in a tough -- even in a tough economic environment and again in Q1, we performed at the high-end but we feel like we should have done better but to the execution issue that Barbara described. So we remain cautious as we were when we came into the year in terms of the rest of the year and that again is factored into our guidance.","Barbara Rentler","In terms of supply, supply is very broad-based. There\u2019s a lot of supply in the market.","Operator","Your next question is from Bob Drbul with Nomura.","Bob Drbul","Hi good afternoon. I just had couple of questions. I think the first one is in the strength in shoes is it the women\u2019s shoes or is it athletic, can you talk a little bit about your trends in athletic overall and then strength in home, is it hard home or soft home, like what are you seeing in home and do you feel like that\u2019s a sustainable trend that should continue for the rest of the year?","Barbara Rentler","Actually our strength in shoes is broad-based both in brown shoe and athletics. As this was strength in home, it\u2019s broad-based between decorative homes and bed and bath. So both businesses are pretty healthy across the board.","Bob Drbul","Okay. And when you look at the wage pressures that your business is seeing, do you feel like that\u2019s still a containable issue for you as the year progresses or do you think it\u2019s getting any worse, how do you have that planned in for the rest of the year?","Michael Hartshorn","Bob we feel pretty good about our guidance with respect to the impact of wages this year. Obviously as you would expect we are looking at the longer-term as well and we\u2019re working on our various plans to sort of deal with wage pressures over longer period of time and more to come on that in the future but for this year we feel very comfortable.","Operator","The next question is from Richard Jaffe with Stifel.","Richard Jaffe","Thanks very much guys. Could you talk about the trends at average retail price at Ross and at dd? And then if you could just comment on the cash balance which seems to be growing and wondering if you perhaps don\u2019t want to get more aggressive on buybacks or dividend or what is your thought on the cash balance? Thanks very much.","Michael Hartshorn","AUR trend at both Ross and dd is pretty stable, pretty consistent with the prior year. In terms of the cash balance, we look at it time to time, we typically we\u2019re in the middle of a two-year authorization, we\u2019ll look at it next year in terms -- along with our longer-term plans and make a decision at that point.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Binetti from UBS.","Michael Binetti","Hey guys, good afternoon. May be I can ask about the -- from the inventory a little bit differently but this is I guess two quarters in a row where you\u2019ve commented I think that the inventory in store has been negative, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s related to the women\u2019s apparel call out. But are there any may be looking a little bit above that was there any other categories like maybe you are a little bit too light on inventory to drive the comp?","Michael Hartshorn","No that was unrelated and that\u2019s how we operate the business. That was our plan and surely we will execute.","Michael Binetti","Okay and then may be if I could just look a little bit longer-term, I want to think about may be 2017 if we just take a look at inventory in the past nine months and the channel or department stores have really missed their business plan by a significant amount. Looking -- I just see in your comps in the fourth quarter, you benefited from that and you just had your first quarter sound like inventory is fairly plentiful. If we assume a more rationale inventory ordering pattern from the department stores heading into this holiday and also fairly common theme from the brands like PVH and Ralph Lauren lately their big corporate strategies are just slow inventory flows into the department stores going forward. Do you have may be a point in history you could point to and say here is what a year like 2017 might look like as we will have the period of very favorable inventory situation?","Michael Hartshorn","No I can\u2019t really think of a period in the history that it would be analogous. So what I would say is many of the things that you just said Michael are things that frankly people said at the beginning of every year in terms of here\u2019s why supply is going to tighten up. And certainly we haven\u2019t seen any sign of that and but so far this year and so we\u2019re not expecting to see a major reduction in supply opportunities either for the remainder of this year may be it\u2019s too early to tell for 2017 but at least no signs of that at this point.","Barbara Rentler","Actually our history would show that the supply will keep the coming. As the department store sector even though they pulled back, their business is way off and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very difficult I think for vendor to get ahead of that, so history would show that, they would be plentiful supply as we go forward.","Operator","The next question is from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad","Thank you, good afternoon. I was wondering if you guys could talk a little bit about how you track your customer data, customer behavior and you never thought about something along the lines on loyalty programs or rewards program or even private label credits will be helpful to know, what are your thoughts on those things?","Michael Hartshorn","Sure Omar. We are -- we periodically look at various programs like loyalty programs, credit card et cetera. And it\u2019s something we will continue to look at but our experience and what\u2019s worked for us, I would say over many years is to keep it simple and to focus on having the right assortment and great values. And it\u2019s all about customer research tells more than anything else that\u2019s what customer -- that\u2018s what the off price customer cares about and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to drive our loyalty over time, quite apart from any sort of loyalty program on the side, it\u2019s clearly all about the right assortment and great values. And if I just think about the most recent quarter, it\u2019s clear that in Q1 we didn\u2019t miss opportunities because we didn\u2019t have a loyalty program, if we missed opportunity that was because we may have had some assortment misses.","Operator","Your next question is from Mike Baker from Deutsche Bank.","Mike Baker","Hi thanks, so as mentioned comps slowed 1% to 2% from the end of the last year. I guess what I\u2019m going to ask is how much of that do you think is because of the ladies apparel assortment issue and how much is that you mentioned a couple of times that you correctly predicted that consumer was a little bit soft. So is this all because of the ladies issue, is it a little bit of both and then I have a follow-up to that.","Michael Hartshorn","Sure. It\u2019s hard for us to say. I would say that what we typically try and do in our business is focus on what we can control. And so it\u2019s not very helpful for us to sort of delve on external things that we can\u2019t really do anything about. What we think we can do something about and what we could have done something about in Q1 is sort of making sure that we execute as well as possible and that\u2019s really the focus rather than any external issues.","Mike Baker","Did you see a similar slowdown that you saw in ladies apparel, do you see anything you even closed out or any kind of slowdown in any other major categories?","Michael Hartshorn","No.","Barbara Rentler","No actually we felt good about our home business, our shoe business and we\u2019re pretty pleased with our junior business. So it really was ladies apparel.","Mike Baker","Okay. So that would that helps trying like that but the follow-up question is in the past and I understand that these things happen, I mean you think it\u2019s buying right every time but how long does it typically take to fix it, is it just you look to buy for the season and then you hope to buy it better for the next season or candidly fix inter-season with some late buys right now?","Barbara Rentler","What I would say is that we\u2019re working to fix it as quickly as possible. So we are a 1,300 store chain, it takes a little bit of time but we\u2019ve done this before and so that\u2019s why we hadn\u2019t built in our guidance.","Mike Baker","Okay. Typically when we\u2019re going to last until the next season because that\u2019s a different buy presumably.","Barbara Rentler","Yes, obviously that\u2019s a fair assessment. You're saying just pure product to product.","Mike Baker","Correct.","Barbara Rentler","Yes I would that\u2019s a fair assessment.","Operator","Your next question is from Marni Shapiro with Retail Tracker.","Marni Shapiro","Hi good afternoon everybody. I just wanted to dig in a little bit to what was going on at the store level away from women's. Are you finding that when she\u2019s coming into the store, she\u2019s not finding what she wants in women\u2019s, she\u2019s moving into home and with that in mind or into non-apparel with that in mind could you shed any light on how the accessories business, handbags and jewelry and what how that business did? And any insights you have as to what might be driving up the UPT? Is it a function of fewer trips, buying more when she comes in or just great product that she has to have everything?","Barbara Rentler","Okay, Marni that\u2019s a few different things. I would say as she is coming into the store in Q1 if she wasn\u2019t buying ladies apparel based on our performance in home and in shoes and other areas of the company that she bought other products. And in terms of accessories, our accessory business is still visible really based on our handbag business in particular which is pretty actually industry-wide issue. In terms of UPT, Michael?","Michael Hartshorn","Yes, Marni that the UPT has grown for us for a while, it helped to drive our comp last year and our perspective is that the consumers coming in and we have great bargains in the store and buying more transaction, it\u2019s hard to delineate the thesis of that.","Marni Shapiro","Yes and it makes sense. And then just on like-for-like items, your pricing has remained, as I recall and I think you mentioned, sorry I\u2019m trying to do Q1 but your pricing has remained fairly stable like-for-like. Sweater for sweater, bag for bag kind of thing.","Barbara Rentler","The AUR.","Marni Shapiro","Yes.","Barbara Rentler","The AUR sweater for sweater might be the same, the value might be better. So when there is a lot of supply in market and you get close out on say better or branded product that you can put out at a lower retail, the AUR could be the same but the value could be significantly better.","Marni Shapiro","Fair and just one last follow-up on that note, are you finding that I mean there is a lot of inventory out there, have you been able to open new centers that you haven\u2019t been able to get into before over the course of the last couple of months and even six months?","Barbara Rentler","I would say that that the vendor community is pretty much open to doing business with us everywhere, I mean.","Marni Shapiro","Fantastic, all right. Best of luck guys for summer.","Barbara Rentler","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Roxanne Meyer from MKM.","Roxanne Meyer","Great, good afternoon. Two questions one I\u2019m just wondering what your 2Q guidance may be your 3Q guidance assumes about merchandised margins decline related to getting out of some of the women\u2019s apparel that\u2019s not working. And then secondly as it relates to the Mid-West markets, it\u2019s been not performing for the nine quarters now, just wondering what it is that\u2019s really driving the outperformance and whether or not you see that continuing? Thanks a lot.","Michael Hartshorn","Roxanne on guidance. So we only give one quarter at a time. We\u2019ll talk about Q3 after the second quarter but the second quarter guidance assumes some increase in merchandised margin for the quarter.","Michael Balmuth","And then on the Mid-West Roxanne as you say, we are very happy with how the Mid-West has performed not just in Q1 but over the last couple of years, it\u2019s been one of our top performing regions. When we enter the Mid-West in 2011, we said it would be a very successful business but it would take time and I\u2019m certainly very pleased with the progress so far. I think it\u2019s about having the right values in front of the customer. So we\u2019re very pleased with how we\u2019ve done in the Mid-West.","Operator","Your next question is from David Mann from Johnson Rice.","David Mann","Hi yes, thank you. In terms of the comment you made about the ladies issue being included in guidance, I guess I see that your full-year guidance seem to have gone up equal to the amount of the beat in the first quarter. So where in the guidance for the rest of the year would we see changes in assumptions for this ladies issue and what else might have you\u2019ve changed to offset any impact from that?","Michael Balmuth","So David what I think we\u2019re saying is we could -- we\u2019re going to -- we expect to achieve our original guidance despite the ladies issue.","David Mann","Okay.","Michael Balmuth","That happens for the full-year. We raised our full-year guidance by the penny in the quarter.","David Mann","And I guess, I\u2019m curious where and what would be some of the factors that might give you that confidence that you would be able to offset that?","Michael Hartshorn","So we were able to, in the first quarter. So in the first quarter we hit the high-end of our compound for 2% despite the issues that Barbara has described on the ladies side probably because there were other businesses that did very well. So if you keep play that out over the year, we feel good about our original guidance.","David Mann","Very good. And then one other question on the wages issue, do you have any initial thoughts on the potential impact on the new overtime regulation, how it might affect your business?","Michael Hartshorn","So we\u2019ve looked at it and any impact at all would be non-material and it\u2019s -- we're comfortable with our guidance as we go forward.","Operator","The next question is from Randy Konik with Jefferies.","Randy Konik","Hi quick questions. I just want to clarify when you make the comment the issues are embedded in the guidance, what does that mean exactly to the ladies apparel, does that mean that assumes it stays at the same trend it was in the first quarter or even assume some incremental degradation in the category. Just kind of get some I guess first color there. And then just a little bit more around the execution side comments, can you just give a little more clarity of what you exactly mean part of the execution, was it some sort of systems issue just bought the wrong thing, got it in the wrong source at the wrong time? Just a little more meat on the bone of what the actual issue is. Thanks.","Michael Hartshorn","Randy on the guidance, just to repeat what Barbara said earlier the issues are going to take some time to effect and we\u2019re focused on as an organization it\u2019s hard to get that done quickly. Despite that like in the first quarter, we obviously missed some opportunities thought we could have done better, thought we could have beat our original guidance. The guidance going forward is unchanged and we hope we can do better.","Barbara Rentler","In terms of the execution issues in Ladies, really it\u2019s a mix issue. We just -- we bought wrong product in fabrications, in colors, we just didn\u2019t transition into spring product appropriately.","Randy Konik","Okay. And then your outlook for merchandised margin already accounts for your potential issues around this category right. So everything you feel for the second quarter guidance, you\u2019re properly accounting for the issue to be this ladies apparel issue to say kind of confined; is that correct?","Michael Hartshorn","That\u2019s correct.","Randy Konik","Hello.","Michael Hartshorn","Yes.","Barbara Rentler","Yes, that\u2019s correct.","Randy Konik","Okay. And then I guess lastly how should we be thinking about some of the items that we\u2019re seeing out there in the marketplace around some different geographic performance, one of your competitor had I guess more strength in traffic trends versus your -- you just talk more about the basket size driving the comp. What do you think is a little bit of a difference in may be the desiring traffic trends you might have seen versus others?","Barbara Rentler","I think as I said before, I believe that when our assortments in ladies apparel are up to the standards the customer comes to expect that properly makes us a less compelling place to shop. And that would affect our traffic trends.","Michael Hartshorn","And also I mean there are some other factors; we are up against very strong prior year comparisons which I think you always have to look at that when you are comparing our performance with other retailers. And then you also factor in the point Barbara has been making about the ladies apparel business, being a pretty important business, and it\u2019s a pretty key driver of traffic, you take those two things together, I think that explains why traffic was held up a little bit in the first quarter.","Randy Konik","So you\u2019re able to commence -- are you able to lastly -- my last question here is, are you able to see that potentially in tracking let\u2019s say customer visits per quarter, where you are saying if a customer goes in the store month one of the quarter, she loves what she sees, she\u2019s probably going to be back a month later or something, is that you saw visits per store per person per quarter -- in the quarter accelerate the same person did you see that, were you able to see or track the credit card data to look at that?","Michael Hartshorn","No we can\u2019t. Our business doesn\u2019t lend itself for that kind of, sort of, it would be quite interesting but our business doesn\u2019t lend itself to that kind of scientific approach. When we measure traffic just to be clear, we are measuring number of transactions. So we\u2019re not looking at actual visits. We don\u2019t have the capability to track actual visits. We\u2019re looking at number of transactions and we use that as a proxy for traffic but it\u2019s an imperfect proxy.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Barbara Rentler for closing comments.","Barbara Rentler","Thank you for joining us today and your interest in Ross Stores.

The call will begin with prepared remarks by management, followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecast and other matters that are based on the Company\u2019s current forecast of aspects of its future business.","These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today\u2019s press release and the company\u2019s fiscal 2014 Form 10-K and fiscal 2014 Forms 10-Qs and 8-Ks on file with the SEC.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to the company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Barbara Rentler.","Barbara Rentler","Good afternoon. Joining me on the call today are Michael Balmuth, Executive Chairman; Michael O\u2019Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Wong, Director of Investor Relations. We\u2019ll begin with a review of our third quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the upcoming holiday season. Afterwards, we\u2019ll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.","As noted in today\u2019s press release, we are pleased with our better than expected performance in the third quarter. Our results benefited from our ongoing ability to deliver compelling bargains to our customers, which drove above planned sales gains and strong merchandise gross margin. Earnings per share for the third quarter of 2014 were $0.93, up 16%, from $0.80 in the prior year. Net earnings for the quarter were $193 million up from $172 million last year. Sales rose 8% to $2.599 billion with the comparable store sales up 4% over the prior year.","For the first nine months of 2014, earnings per share were $3.22, up 13% from $2.86 for the same year-to-date period in 2013. Net earnings grew to $676 million, up from $619 million for the first nine months of 2013. Sales increased 7% to just over $8 billion, with comparable store sales up 2% over the same period in 2013. Similar to Ross same store sales at dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS increased for the quarter and year-to-date period, as their customers also responded favorably to dd\u2019s value offering.","Juniors and home were the strongest businesses at Ross during the quarter, while the Midwest and Texas were the top-performing regions. Operating margin of 11.8%, was up about 55 basis points over last year, due to a 40 basis point improvement and cost of goods sold and a 15 basis point decline in selling, general and administrative expenses. Michael Hartshorn will provide additional color on these operating margin trend in a few minutes.","As we ended the third quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 5% over last year, while pack-away levels were 42% of total inventories, compared to 45% at this time in 2013. Average in-store inventories were down 2% at the end of the quarter. And we continue to target selling store inventories for the balance of the year to be down 1% to 2%. We also completed our 2014 store expansion program during the third quarter. After closing some older locations at year-end, we expect to end FY2014 with 1,210 Ross and 152 dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS location for a net addition of 86 new stores this year.","With respect to infrastructure investments, we closed on the purchase of our New York buying office property in September as planned, financing the transaction with proceeds from our recent public bond offering of $250 million. During the quarter, we also brought online a new distribution center in Rock Hill, South Carolina. While these investments create some expense headwinds in the short term, we are confident they will enhance our prospects with the continued profitable growth of our enterprise over the longer term.","Now, Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our third quarter results and details on our guidance for the fourth quarter and the year.","Michael J. Hartshorn","Thank you, Barbara. Our 4% comparable store sales gain in the third quarter was driven by a combination of slightly higher traffic and an increase in the size of the average basket. As Barbara noted, third quarter operating grew 55 basis points to 11.8%.","Cost of goods sold improved by 40 basis points, benefiting from a 55 basis point increased in merchandise gross margin and a 5 basis point improvement in distribution costs due to the timing of packaway-related costs. This was partially offset by 10 basis point increase each in freight and buying.","Selling, general and administrative expenses improved by about 15 basis points during the period, mainly due to leverage on the 4% same-store sales increase. During the quarter, we bought back 1.9 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $141 million. Year-to-date, we have repurchased a total of 5.9 million shares for an aggregate price of $418 million.","We remain on track in 2014 to repurchase a total of $550 million in common stock, which would complete the two-year $1.1 billion authorization approved at the beginning of 2013.","Let\u2019s now turn to our guidance for the fourth quarter. As noted in today\u2019s press release, for the 13 weeks ending January 31, 2015, we continue to project a 1% to 2% increase in same-store sales and earnings per share in the range of $1.05 to $1.09. This compares to $1.02 for the 13 weeks ended February 1, 2014.","For the fourth quarter of 2014, operating statement assumptions include the following: total sales are forecast to increase 5% to 6% on the previously mentioned 1% to 2% projected increased in same-store sales. If sales are within this range, we would expect fourth quarter operating margin to decline about 30 basis points to 50 basis points to 12.2% to 12.4% on relatively flat merchandise gross margin with some deleveraging on expenses.","As previously mentioned, buying and distribution costs are forecast to increase as a percent of sales due to the acquisition of our New York buying office and the ramp-up of our new distribution center in South Carolina. In addition, we are planning about $2 million in net interest expense in the fourth quarter, mainly related to our aforementioned bond offering.","Our tax rate is expected to be 37% to 38% and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are estimated to be about $207 million. Again, if the fourth quarter sales and margin perform in line with our forecast, and we project that earnings per share for the 52 weeks ending January 31, 2015 would increased 10% to 11% to $4.28 to $4.32.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Barbara.","Barbara Rentler","Thank you, Michael. To sum up, our ongoing focus on delivering compelling bargains on bargains on name-brand fashions for the family and the home have driven respectable sales and earnings growth in the first nine months of the year. It\u2019s important to note, we achieved these gains in a very challenging climate for apparel retail, especially given the ongoing difficult and volatile macroeconomic backdrop that continues to especially pressure the low to moderate income customer.","Looking ahead, we are pleased with our assortments as we enter the important fourth quarter. Our merchants have done a terrific job of acquiring a wide array of exciting and sharply priced name-brand fashions and gifts to appeal to today\u2019s value-driven shoppers. That said we believe it is prudent to maintain a cautious outlook as we have all year, given continued uncertainty in the overall environment and the likelihood of an intensely competitive and promotional holiday season.","To address these headwinds, we will stay focused on operating our business with lean selling-store inventories and tight expense control. As always, our most important priority is our unwavering commitment to offering our customers the best bargains possible. We are confident that the investments we are making in infrastructure, people, and processes will further strengthen our ability to deliver the value our customers expect. As we have said a number of times, consistently delivering on this mission will always be the key to maximizing our potential for future sales and earnings growth over both the near and the long-term.","At this point, we would like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson-Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you, good afternoon. Just wanted to ask about your fourth-quarter merchandise margin guidance of flat. Is there an opportunity there, given the decline that you saw in the fourth quarter of last year on the gross margin line and anything to call out as opportunities there?","John G. Call","Yes, Lorraine, this is John. As Barbara mentioned similar to how we\u2019ve operated during the year, we are entering the quarter cautiously, optimistic that if things go our way, we can do better. So I wouldn\u2019t read anything into the \u2013 in terms of how we have it planned flat, we think we do have some upside, if we can operate into what looks to be a very, very competitive fourth quarter.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson-Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marni Shapiro of The Retail Tracker. Your line is open.","Marni Shapiro-The Retail Tracker","Hey guys, congratulations on a great quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about, we heard a lot of noise about the weather. And I know it\u2019s not something that\u2019s usually a big deal for you. But now that you\u2019re in the Midwest and we\u2019re coming up against a very cold third quarter of last year, can you talk a little bit about the Midwest, and how you\u2019re thinking how the third quarter was, and how you\u2019re thinking about this winter versus last winter?","Michael O\u2019Sullivan","Yes. I guys Marni, it\u2019s Michael O\u2019Sullivan. Let me cover that with two points. First of all, in terms of weather, weather can always be more or less favorable, especially at this time of the year and going into the fourth quarter. Certainly, in the third quarter weather really wasn\u2019t a factor. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s ahead of us in the fourth quarter from the weather perspective. In terms of the Midwest more broadly though we\u2019ve been very happy with how we performed in the Midwest over the last few quarters.","And I think we\u2019d mentioned almost a year-ago, that we weren\u2019t happy with some aspects of the Midwest, particularly the assortments. And we don\u2019t those problems weren\u2019t caused by the weather; they were caused by internal issues in terms of how we plan those assortments. We\u2019ve corrected those, so we\u2019re hoping to do better. And as we go into the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll have to find out whether those things have paid off or not.","Marni Shapiro-The Retail Tracker","Fantastic, and if you can give us an update, as well, on the accessories part of the business? Any color around it?","Barbara Rentler","The accessories business in the first half of the year really struggled. What we saw in the third quarter is that we\u2019ve seen some improvement, it\u2019s still trailing the chain. We feel a little bit better about it in the fourth quarter, and we expect to be back on track by spring of 2015.","Marni Shapiro-The Retail Tracker","Fantastic, best of luck for the holidays.","Barbara Rentler","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Paul Lejuez-Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Hey, thanks guys. As you\u2019re thinking about store growth for next year, I\u2019m just wondering how you\u2019re thinking has evolved in terms of the optimal store size. As you continue to grow both in existing and new markets, have you thought any differently about what is the right size for any given store, considering that you\u2019ve been able to take a lot of inventory out of the stores over the last couple of years? Thanks.","Gary L. Cribb","Sure, Paul. I will take that. This is Gary. We have looked at our store prototype and we have a very flexible model that allows us to take advantage of real estate opportunities, as well as right-sizing it, in any particular location.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laura Champine of Canaccord. Your line is now open.","Laura Champine-Canaccord Genuity Securities","Thanks for taking my question. I\u2019m just wondering if you can let us know how you assess that the promotional environment will be more competitive this Q4 than it was a year ago? Is it just the pace of the promotions, or how do you look at your competitive set?","Barbara Rentler","We are anticipating that the promotional environment will be much more aggressive, and we look at two things. We look at the pace, the amount of times that our competitors promote, and we also look at the depths that they promote. Since we\u2019re in the value business, off of mainstream retailers, we\u2019re constantly monitoring that.","Laura Champine-Canaccord Genuity Securities","Got it, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Hofkin of William Blair & Company. Your line is open.","Daniel Hofkin-William Blair & Company","Good afternoon, nice results. One question I would have would be I know it is still somewhat early in this, but with gas prices coming down, how big a benefit do you think it was in the tail end of the quarter? And is that something that you think could be a potential source of upside in the fourth quarter if things kind of hold where they are right now, not assuming they continue to go down but?","Michael O\u2019Sullivan","Yes, Daniel, I guess conceptually, lower gas prices, in fact, anything that puts more money in the customer\u2019s pocket, is a good thing. But, it\u2019s very difficult for us to isolate a single variable like that, like gas prices. There are so many other factors, some good, like the decline in unemployment rates or the anniversarying of cuts in government programs, but some bad factors, as well, like the increase in part-time work or the lack of wage growth for low-income workers. So, we\u2019re not economists, so it\u2019s for us to sort of calibrate those things and create them off against each other. So we really don\u2019t know to what degree gas prices helped or to what degree they will help going forward.","Daniel Hofkin-William Blair & Company","Okay. And then can you talk about maybe some of the other regional performance? You talked about the best regions, what were, if there were any regions that are below the chain materially, and the same thing on the merchandise side, in terms of the other categories that maybe performed not as well or better than average?","Michael O\u2019Sullivan","Sure on the regions, as Barbara said in her remarks, the top-performing regions were the Midwest and Texas. Other than that, there were no other areas of regional performance that are worth calling out. And then on \u2013 in terms of businesses, our top performing businesses were Juniors and home.","Daniel Hofkin-William Blair & Company","Okay, and by the same token, nothing else was materially different on the other direction?","Michael O\u2019Sullivan","That\u2019s right.","Daniel Hofkin-William Blair & Company","Okay. And then, would you \u2013 I missed a little bit of the part where you discussed the gross margin, the components of the gross margin. Would you mind just repeating those quickly? Thank you.","Michael Balmuth","Sure, Dan. It\u2019s Michael. So for the quarter, merchandise margin was up 55 basis points, and that was offset by freight in buying, which was about 10 basis points each, and then distribution was slightly better due to the timing of pack-away.","Daniel Hofkin-William Blair & Company","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Randy Konik of Jeffries. Your line is open.","Randy Konik-Jefferies & Company","Great, thanks a lot. I guess my question is regarding the infrastructure in process improvements, investments are making. You talked about some of the near-term headwinds. When do those headwinds lift, and what are some of the measurable benefits you expect to see from these investments? Is it things like stronger inventory turns, or what should we expect in terms of the benefit of payout long-term on those investments? Thanks. Appreciate it.","Michael J. Hartshorn","So, Randy, it\u2019s Michael Hartshorn. So the infrastructure investment, as we mentioned, there are really about three things. It\u2019s opening two new distribution centers and opening \u2013 purchasing our New York buying office. In terms of the distribution centers, it gives us the capacity to grow into what we believe to be 2,500 stores. So that is a capacity play. Those investments tend to be a bit lumpy, but after we get through the two new distribution centers, the second of which will open mid-next year, we shouldn\u2019t need any capacity for the next couple of years.","Randy Konik-Jefferies & Company","And can I ask a follow-up then on the buying office?","Michael Balmuth","Sure.","Michael J. Hartshorn","Sure.","Randy Konik-Jefferies & Company","Can you hear me?","Michael Balmuth","Yeah [indiscernible]","Randy Konik-Jefferies & Company","Can you hear me? Okay, great. So do you expect to see any measurable change in the number of vendor partners you\u2019re using over the next five years? How should we think about the sourcing side of the business over the next five years and how that may change or not change? Thanks.","Barbara Rentler","We\u2019re always looking to increase our vendor base, and so that\u2019s why we continue to invest in the merchant organization. So that they can go out and build relationships to get better access to close outs and to add additional resources. So we expect it to grow.","Randy Konik-Jefferies & Company","Got it thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kimberley Greenburger of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Kimberley Greenberger-Morgan Stanley","Sorry, I just realized I was on mute. Thank you so much, and I\u2019ll add my congratulations on a really terrific quarter. Michael, just a couple of questions for you. Did you receive any benefit in the third quarter from your physical inventory in margin? Also, you mentioned that traffic was up slightly in the quarter. It sounds like you saw a bigger increase in the average basket. Is that coming from the average unit retail price or units per transaction? And then for Barbara, I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re buying team is starting to see any inventory dislocation from the disruption of goods flowing through the port? And if not yet, do you think that might be an opportunity for inventory acquisition in the future? Thanks so much.","Michael J. Hartshorn","Kimberly on shortage, so like last year, our physical inventory results were very similar to our ongoing shortage accrual, so there was no impact of a true up during the quarter when we took the physical inventory. Our results again improved on top of historically low levels, so we\u2019re very happy with the progress we\u2019ve made there. In terms of the composition of comp, as we mentioned in the remarks, our comp was up 4%, driven by a slight increase in transactions and a higher basket. The basket increase was entirely driven by higher units per transaction, as AUR was flat to last year.","Barbara Rentler","And as it pertains to inventory from the port, it is hard to tell. It is \u2013 it\u2019s a buyers\u2019 market, there\u2019s a lot of merchandise in the market right now. It\u2019s hard to differentiate what\u2019s from the port or not. But what I would say is that whenever there is a disruption like that in the marketplace, it definitely leads to supply. So you would expect that we would see supply sometime the end of this year into beginning of next year.","Kimberley Greenberger-Morgan Stanley","Great thanks, Barbara, and good luck for holiday.","Barbara Rentler","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Stein of Northcoast Research. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Stein-Northcoast Research","Good afternoon, everyone. A question on dd\u2019s. I\u2019m wondering are the same factors that are driving your performance at Ross also driving dd\u2019s with respect to traffic transaction? And also, maybe you can talk a little bit about some of the category performance there? Thank you.","Michael O\u2019Sullivan","So Jeff, as you know, we don\u2019t disclose dd\u2019s financials separately; it\u2019s just not material to the overall Corporation. But in broad terms, as Barbara mentioned in her remarks, dd\u2019s comp performance was strong in the third quarter, so we\u2019re very happy.","Jeffrey Stein-Northcoast Research","Any comment, can you comment at all, Michael, on category \u2013 just category performance at dd\u2019s?","Michael O\u2019Sullivan","No, we typically don\u2019t break that out separately for the dd segment.","Jeffrey Stein-Northcoast Research","I see, and then finally, can you just talk a little bit about your trend \u2013 your business trend during the third quarter? Was it fairly even throughout the quarter, or did it get better or worse towards the end of the quarter?","Michael O\u2019Sullivan","Sure, this is Michael again. Sales ran ahead of plan for us throughout the quarter. The strongest months were August and September when the back-to-school customer was motivated to shop. The trends slowed a bit in October with warmer weather.","Jeffrey S. Stein-Northcoast Research","Great, and Michael, CapEx for next year, do have any thoughts?","Michael O\u2019Sullivan","At this point, we wouldn\u2019t talk about next year. It will come down though based on the infrastructure investments we made this year.","Jeffrey S. Stein-Northcoast Research","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Mann from Johnson Rice & Company. Your line is now open.","David Mann-Johnson Rice & Company","All right, thank you, let me add my congratulations on a great quarter. Question about the SG&A line. I\u2019m just curious with the 4% comp, anything that held you back about leveraging that operating expense number a little bit more, which might have been expected on such a good comp?","Michael O\u2019Sullivan","David, it\u2019s Michael again. So I think what we\u2019ve said longer-term is that we usually lever around a three comps, so with the four comp and 15 basis point improvement, it\u2019s about in line with that longer-term model it is a bit worse than the second quarter, but as a reminder, we had about a 20-basis-point benefit from a legal matter.","David M. Mann-Johnson Rice & Company","And then in terms of inventories at the store level, what\u2019s your latest thought process about any ability to take those inventories down further?","Michael O\u2019Sullivan","Yes, David, as you\u2019re aware, we\u2019ve taken inventory down very aggressively over the last several years, something in the order of 40%. We continue to shave inventories and trim them where we can. At the end of the third quarter, inventories were down 2%. We\u2019re expecting them to be down another point or two at the end of the fourth quarter, and then we\u2019re putting our plans together for next year.","David Mann-Johnson Rice & Company","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow of Sterne Agee. Your line is now open.","Ike Boruchow-Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","Hi everyone, congratulations on a great quarter. Thanks for taking the question. Two quick ones: I know you\u2019ve already talked about this, but the merchandise margin increased 55 basis points, so sequentially better than Q2. I\u2019m curious, Michael, if you could just dig in what exactly helped drive the sequential improvement in the year-over-year margin gain? And also, it doesn\u2019t look like you bought back any stock in Q3. I can\u2019t remember the last time you didn\u2019t buy back stock in the quarter. Was there a reason for that? Just a timing thing? Just curious there. Thanks.","Michael J. Hartshorn","So first on the stock, we did buyback stock during the quarter, we bought it back the first half of the year by quarter, so. And then on margin gains, the improvement during the quarter was a combination of fast returns and lower inventory, and also our ability to take advantage of the buying opportunities in the marketplace, which customers responded favorably to. So, a little bit of markdowns and a little bit of markup to the margin performance.","Ike Boruchow-Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","Got it, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is open.","Dana Telsey-Telsey Advisory Group","Good afternoon, everyone. Can you give an update on the planning and allocation at the more local level and what you\u2019re seeing there? How is that going? And then if you think broadly about improving sales productivity over the next few years at dd\u2019s and at core Ross, where should it come from and how do you think of the size of the box? Thank you.","Michael O\u2019Sullivan","Okay, Dana. It\u2019s Michael O\u2019Sullivan. I\u2019ll take the first part of your question about more local planning and allocation. As you know, we\u2019ve rolled out a fairly major program, micro merchandising about three years ago. And the idea of that, the intent was that we would be able to plan and trend our business at a more detailed level, a more local level. Now it\u2019s impossible for us to isolate the impact just to micro merchandising, but certainly it\u2019s been a major enabler of our ability to reduce inventories over the last several years by making sure that we have the right product in the right place at the right time.","Dana Telsey-Telsey Advisory Group","Thank you. And then and then sales productivity.","Michael O\u2019Sullivan","The second part of your question, Dana?","Dana Telsey-Telsey Advisory Group","On the sales productivity, where do you think \u2013 what is an optimal sales per foot for dd\u2019s and for Ross, and what drives it there? Is it new categories? Is it ticket?","Michael O\u2019Sullivan","At a high level I think what really drives our sales productivity is having the best values we can in the store. And we, all the time, were looking across different categories, different areas of merchandise even new categories, to see whether we can drive additional productivity. That\u2019s the ongoing program.","Dana Telsey-Telsey Advisory Group","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Baker from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Michael Baker-Deutsche Bank North America","Hi. So my question is how do you guys think about what\u2019s going on with department stores and how that impacts your business? One thing we\u2019ve seen this quarter and even last quarter is that department store inventories are in much better shape and their gross margins look better. Does that raise the pricing umbrella for you? Make it easier for you to operate and not have to discount as much? Conversely, I guess one risk might be that there\u2019s less product available, although I think if you\u2019re getting less from department stores, you are getting more from vendors. How do those dynamics play out? Thanks.","Barbara Rentler","Well I would say there\u2019s a few things, Mike. One, first of all, in terms of availability there is a lot of product in the marketplace. In terms of department stores versus how they price, we really look at the value. So we look at where they are in pricing versus where we need to be in pricing so that we offer the customer great branded bargains, and so that\u2019s really how we look at it. The level of inventory that we promote usually increases with the level of inventory traditionally.","Michael Baker-Deutsche Bank North America","Right. So I guess that\u2019s the question: their inventories have actually \u2013 the year-over-year growth inventory is as low as it\u2019s been in five or six quarters. So, I would suspect that they\u2019re not promoting as much, and then because of what you just said, and because of that, I would think that you wouldn\u2019t have to promote as much. Has that had any impact on your business this quarter, or do you think it might going forward?","Barbara Rentler","So actually, Mike, they have promoted significantly this quarter, both in most department stores, particularly the mid tier. So there\u2019s been heavy promotions that have gone on this quarter, and we\u2019re expecting that to continue into the fourth quarter. Actually we\u2019re expecting that to get even more promotional. We don\u2019t promote. So we\u2019re in an everyday value business, so we have to anticipate where we think they are going to be, and then set our values based off of where we think they\u2019re going to bench their promotions. But in Q3, they absolutely promoted, and we are anticipating them to be even more aggressive in Q4","Michael Baker-Deutsche Bank North America","Okay. Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Roxanne Meyer from UBS. Your line is now open.","Roxanne Meyer-UBS Securities","Great, thanks and congratulations on a strong quarter. My question is about home. I\u2019m just wondering how far above the chain did home perform, and can you talk to the areas of home maybe that led in performance, and whether there\u2019s still opportunity for some niches within home to still ramp up? Thanks a lot.","Barbara Rentler","We were very pleased with our performance in home. It was better-than-expected performance. We feel the merchants really did a fine job of delivering exciting great product at great values. In terms of what areas performed in Q3, I really don\u2019t really think it\u2019s appropriate for me to talk through that. What I can tell you is that in Q4, we are very focused on gifts and home. And I would say our home performance was better than the chain, in terms of a measurement.","Roxanne Meyer-UBS Securities","Okay, great. Thanks and best of luck for holiday.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Jaffe of Stifel. Your line is now open.","Richard Jaffe-Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.","Thanks very much guys. And I know you\u2019ve talked about the opportunities out in the marketplace, and wonder if you would just comment further on that the port strike seems to \u2013 or the slowdown in the Port of Los Angeles, seems to have provided some opportunities, particularly not only for the season, but for pack-away. And I\u2019m wondering how you\u2019re thinking about those opportunities, and if you might get more aggressive, given what might be the unique nature of some of the opportunities this year?","Barbara Rentler","The way we look at that is pack-away is really, it is opportunity, so we look at each deal on a deal-by-deal basis. So we don\u2019t go out and say we want to raise our pack-away levels or contract our pack-away levels. The merchants are really out in the market constantly shopping to see what becomes available, and if the port could become available a little bit sooner than later, some we would flow this quarter, some we would move into 2015. It depends when we get them. But really, there \u2013 the science to it, it has to be a terrific branded great value to put it into pack-away so that the customer really feels good about it when it comes out the following season.","Richard Jaffe-Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.","So even though you\u2019ve operated in a pretty tight parameter of pack-away, sort of 38% to 42% roughly, you wouldn\u2019t, given the circumstances, allow that to increase, should circumstances as you describe them prevail?","Barbara Rentler","There is no target number up or down. Pack-away is really the results of what\u2019s available and how great the bargain is. So if we found pack-away that was terrific that we could \u2013 and a number would go above 42%, that would be fine. And when it drops, sometimes that\u2019s based on the quality of products that we see. It moves \u2013 it\u2019s kind of a moving target; it really becomes, it really goes to the value of the product and what we see and when we bring it back out to the customer, will she appreciate that\u2026","Richard Jaffe-Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.","Excellent, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul from Nomura. Your line is now open.","Robert Drbul-Nomura Securities","Hi, good evening. Congratulations on a great quarter. I guess the two questions that I have; can you give an update on your thoughts around the Internet and e-commerce and any potential interest internationally?","Michael O\u2019Sullivan","Sure. Bob, so on e-commerce, we\u2019ve looked at e-commerce a number of times. We continue to monitor what\u2019s happening in terms of e-commerce, but we don\u2019t have any plans to launch an e-commerce business at this point. We operate a $10 average unit retail business, and we just \u2013 every which way we\u2019ve looked at it, we just don\u2019t see how there\u2019s not an economically sustainable model at that kind of price point. There may be at a much higher price point, but then you\u2019re no longer in the moderate off-price business. So we don\u2019t plan to pursue e-commerce at this point. And in terms of international, no \u2013 no plans at this point to launch an international business.","Robert Drbul-Nomura Securities","Got it. And then on the category basis, can you talk a little bit about how you\u2019re positioned on an outerwear heading into the fourth quarter?","Barbara Rentler","Sure, our outerwear business, we plan outerwear and seasonally sensitive products in Q3 pretty conservatively. As we get into Q4, we plan it specifically by region. So from what we gather from the micro merchandising, which tells us which regions and which types of products, we take that along with the merchant instinct and what we see in the market. But overall, we feel that outerwear is an opportunity for us as we go forward.","Robert Drbul-Nomura Securities","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Montagna of Avondale Partners. Your line is now open.","Mark Montagna-Avondale Partners","Hi. A question about gift-giving versus last year. I\u2019m wondering, did you place a bigger emphasis on gift-giving this year? I think that\u2019s what you\u2019d mentioned on the last call and is that across all categories, or is it primarily in the home category?","Barbara Rentler","Yes. We have increased gift-giving this year. It is primarily in home, but it does go across the parallel into other categories, whether it\u2019s in sweaters or tops or men\u2019s fleece or across the board.","Mark Montagna-Avondale Partners","Okay. And just back to the outerwear question, did you bring it in earlier this year versus last year? Or just curious how it anniversaries versus last year?","Barbara Rentler","Seasonally sensitive product in Q3, we traditionally plan conservatively. And if it sells, since October is kind of a dicey month, if it sells, we go out and we chase it or we pull a pack-away if we have pack-away goods available.","Mark Montagna-Avondale Partners","I\u2019m referring more to Q4.","Barbara Rentler","Q4?","Mark Montagna-Avondale Partners","Yes.","Barbara Rentler","We feel pretty good about outerwear. Listen, outerwear is one of the areas where we are finding our way and learning as a Company, especially as we move into these colder regions. So our strategy for outerwear this year was really to expand the assortment and to try to really get the regionality correct of heavyweight versus midweight. So we feel pretty good about it.","Mark Montagna-Avondale Partners","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick McKeever from MKM Partners. Your line is now open.","Patrick McKeever-MKM Partners","Thanks. A question on new store productivity and just new stores in general, since you continue to open 80 to 90 stores. So the question is maybe you could just provide some general commentary around your new store performance. The way I look at it, the new stores are doing about 70% or so of a mature store volume in their first year. So wondering if that\u2019s accurate, and what you\u2019re seeing on the real estate front, those kinds of things?","Michael J. Hartshorn","So in terms of new store productivity, as we\u2019ve entered the new markets, they have fallen a bit, as expected based on customer recognition in those markets. In terms of how they\u2019re performing versus their plans, we\u2019re pleased with the performance. They actually run ahead of our initial plan.","Michael Balmuth","Patrick, your calculations are about right.","Patrick McKeever-MKM Partners","Okay. And then on the real estate, any changes in terms of what\u2019s out there? I mean I\u2019ve heard from a few retailers that the commercial real estate market is tightening up a little bit here as the economy continues to improve. Are you seeing that in the locations that you\u2019re targeting as well?","Michael O\u2019Sullivan","Well I would say, Patrick, we\u2019re happy with the availability of real estate locations that we\u2019re looking at. We have a very strong real estate team, and they\u2019re pretty well networked, so we don\u2019t see any major issues in terms of real estate availability at this point.","Patrick McKeever-MKM Partners","Okay, all right, well thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Stephen Grambling-Goldman Sachs","Thanks, good evening. So just a follow-up on one of the questions that was asked earlier on CapEx next year. Can you remind us of some of the buckets of incremental spending that you had over the past couple of years? And then I guess as a follow-up to that, what\u2019s the capacity that you have for pack-away at this point?","Michael J. Hartshorn","In terms of CapEx, Stephen, so a base level without the infrastructure investments is somewhere around $400 million to $450 million. This year we\u2019re projecting it to end about $700 million, and that includes the New York buying office for about $222 million and $150 million of BC infrastructure.","Unidentified Company Representative","And Stephen, if you go back to 2012, you can look at base levels there. We added 2013, 2014 we started building BCs that will complete in 2015.","Michael O\u2019Sullivan","I mean, the last part of your question, Stephen, on pack-away capacity, we operate a pretty flexible distribution infrastructure in terms of storage, so pack-away capacity is really not a gating factor in terms of how many \u2013 what the pack- away pounds can go to.","Stephen Grambling-Goldman Sachs","Great, thank you. And one other follow-up, if I may. And on your plans for, I mean, not necessarily e-commerce but just digital as a strategy into the holiday or any other things that you\u2019re doing differently as you described them more as you\u2019re anticipating a more promotional environment? Thanks.","Michael O\u2019Sullivan","Not a lot of new news in terms of marketing. We have over the last several years devoted more and more of our marketing budget to digital. We see digital as a good sort of proxy for word of mouth, which is kind of something we\u2019ve always relied on very heavily, that the customer will spread sort of the \u2013 will talk about the great deals they got at Ross with their friends and we see digital as a way of doing that. So we\u2019re doing more of that this year, but other than that, nothing else significant to call out.","Stephen Grambling-Goldman Sachs","Okay, thank you so much, best of luck.","[End of Q&A]","Operator","At this time, I would now turn the call back to Barbara Rentler.","Barbara Rentler","Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores.

The call will begin with prepared comments by management, followed by a question-and-answer session.","Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts and other matters that are based on the company's current forecast of aspects of its future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectation. Risk factors are included in today's press release and the company's fiscal 2013 Form 10-K and fiscal 2014 Form 8-Ks on file with the SEC.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Balmuth, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.","Michael Balmuth","Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Norman Ferber, Chairman of Board; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Wong, Director of Investor Relations. Also joining us today is Barbara Rentler, President and Chief Merchandising Officer of Ross Dress for Less.","As announced earlier this month, Barbara will become our new Chief Executive Officer and a Member of the Board of Directors, effective June 1. She will continue to work closely with Michael O'Sullivan, who will continue as President and Chief Operating Officer and also join the Board of Directors.","Barbara and Michael are talented executives with complementary skills and each has made extraordinary contributions to our company over the course of their long careers here. The Board and I are confident their successful partnership will enhance our prospects for continued increases in profitability and stockholder returns in the years to come.","As previously announced, I will become Executive Chairman on June 1. In my new role, I plan to stay very involved and continue to work closely with the entire Senior Management Team.","Now let's turn to today's financial results. We'll begin with a brief review of our first quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.","Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended May 3, 2014, were $1.15, up from a $1.07 in the prior year. These results represent 7% growth on top of 15% and 26% gains in the first quarters of 2013 and 2012, respectively. Net earnings for the 2014 first quarter grew to $243.9 million, up from $234.6 million in the prior year period.","First quarter sales rose 6% to $2.681 billion. Comparable store sales grew 1% on top of 3% and 9% increases in the first quarters of 2013 and 2012, respectively.","First quarter earnings per share performed at the high end of our guidance as strict inventory and expense controls offset the impact from unfavorable weather and a more challenging retail environment. Sales trends improved in April with more seasonal spring weather that coincided with the late Easter shopping period.","Merchandizing geographic trends were relatively broad based during the quarter, with the Midwest, the top performing region.","Operating margin for the quarter was better than forecasted, declining 25 basis points to 14.6% of sales. A 35 basis point increase in cost of goods sold was partially offset by a 10 basis point improvement in selling, general and administrative costs.","As we ended the first quarter, total consolidated inventories increased about 2% compared to the prior year with average in-store inventories down about 4%. Packaway as a percentage of total inventories was 45%, even with last year.","Comparable store sales at dd's DISCOUNTS increased in the first quarter, driving solid gains and profits. These results reflect that customers continue to respond favorably to dd's merchandize assortments.","Our overall expansion program remains on track with 26 net new Ross and seven dd's DISCOUNTS opening in the first quarter. We expect to add a total of 95 new locations in 2014, comprised of approximately 75 Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS. As usual, these opening numbers are before the planned closure or relocation of about 10 existing stores.","Michael Hartshorn will now provide further color on our first quarter results and details on our second quarter guidance.","Michael Hartshorn","Thank you, Michael. Our 1% comparable store sales gained in the first quarter was mainly driven by a low single digit percentage increase in the size of the average basket with the number of transactions down slightly to last year. Operating margin for the quarter declined by about 25 basis points to 14.6%, which was at the high end of our guidance.","The 35 basis-point increase in cost of goods sold was mainly driven by deleveraging on occupancy and buying costs, which increased 20 basis-points and 10 basis-points respectively. Merchandise gross margin declined 10 basis-points versus last year, while distribution cost improved by 5 basis-points.","Selling, general and administrative expenses improved by 10 basis-points, mainly due to strong cost controls. During the period, we repurchased two million shares for a total purchase price of $139 million. We expect to buyback a total of $550 million in stock for the year, which will complete the two-year $1.1 billion program authorized by our Board in early 2013.","Let's turn now to our second quarter guidance. For the 13 weeks ending August 2, 2014, we are targeting same store sales to increase 1% to 2% on top of 4% and 7% growth in the second quarters of 2013 and 2012, respectively. Earnings per share for the second quarter of 2014 are projected to be in the range of $1.05 to $1.09, up from $0.98 last year.","Our EPS targets for this year's second quarter are based on the following assumptions. Total sales are expected to grow 5% to 6%, driven by a combination of new store growth and as previously mentioned, same store sales that are forecasted to be up 1% to 2%. We plan to open 29 net new stores during the period, including 22 Ross Dress for Less and 7 dd's DISCOUNTS.","We are targeting operating margin to be flat to up 20 basis points on top of a strong 80 basis point increase in the prior year for projected range of 13.6% to 13.8%. We are planning net interest expense to be negligible and our tax rate is expected to be about 39%. We also estimated weighted average diluted shares outstanding of about $210 million.","Moving to our outlook for the year, as noted in today's press release, and based on our first-quarter results and second quarter guidance, we now project earnings per share for the 52-weeks ending January 31, 2015, to be in the range of $4.09 to $4.21, compared to earnings per share of $3.88 in fiscal 2013.","Now I'll turn the call back to Michael Balmuth for closing comments.","Michael Balmuth","Thank you, Michael. As mentioned earlier, we were able to maximize earnings during the first quarter, despite a modest 1% increase in same-store sales, which were impacted by unfavorable weather and a more challenging retail environment.","Looking ahead, we remain confident in the resilience of our off-price business model and our ability over time to successfully execute the proven strategies that have enabled us to deliver solid financial results in both favorable and more difficult climates.","By far, our most important priority is our unwavering focus on offering customers the best bargains possible. Consistently delivering on this mission, will always be the key to optimizing our opportunities for future sales and earnings growth.","At this point, we would like to open up the call in response to any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Brian Tunick with JPMorgan.","Brian J. Tunick - JPMorgan Chase & Company","Great. Thanks very much and Michael, best of luck as well to you. I guess two question, number one, you called out the Midwest as your best performing region. So I know the weather had been in impact the last couple of quarters, can you just may be talk about what's changed there? Are you happier now with how your new stores are performing and anything else you could add about the micro-merchandising that might be applying?","And then the second question, just sort of on this potentially new trend of the business, this more low single digit comp run rate, can you may be talk about what kind of be their marketing initiatives, what things you are going to be doing from a category perspective that could potentially reaccelerate the business back to a more mid single digit comp trend, or do you think we've seen may be the easy market share gains behind us. Thanks very much.","Michael O'Sullivan","Okay Brian, this is Michael O'Sullivan, I'll take the first part of your -- first part of your question about Midwest. Yes, we were pleased with how the Midwest performed in the first quarter. As Michael said in his remarks it has the highest comp performance of our regions, which is great, especially given the weather.","And we made some assortment changes to the Midwest, which I would say we're pleased about, but I caution you, it's really just a single quarter and we still think we have plenty of opportunity left to improve that region.","Let me take a step back though. When we entered the Midwest two years ago, we said, we expected to build a very successful business there, but it will take time. So we are certainly very pleased with the progress we've made so far, but I would say the recent performance just reinforces our confidence in the longer term.","Then on the second part of the question, in terms of changes to our marketing program, there'll be no radical changes, okay. We have a marketing program we've been running with for a long time. We think it's effective. We are experimenting with a little more social marketing, but that's the extent of it.","Relative a new run rate, I think -- first of all, I think we've adjusted well, we adjusted well in the quarter to the business trends. We were able to preserve our margins and run our business quite effectively at this level.","When our business gets tougher than we would like it to be, we use this as a very good time for really tearing apart all our businesses whether they are performing at a reasonable level but especially the ones that are underperforming. So if we do our work carefully during this timeframe when the customer is ready to shop, we'll be in a better position than we are today.","Operator","","Your next question is from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank","Thanks guys. I wonder if in general you just -- throughout the country, you could quantify for us a very good sense as to how much you think weather impacted and maybe one way you could do that is just talk about the trends. You said April was better, but any color on what February or March or even into early May, may've looked like as weather has gotten better. Thanks.","Michael Balmuth","Sure. So like other retailers, the unfavorable weather impacted our business early in the quarter. As we mentioned in our release, sales improved in April as the weather improved and also with the Easter shift.","It's difficult to quantify the precise impact of weather, but we are not immune to it based on our regional breakouts. Regionally the Midwest and Florida were the strongest markets, while the Mid Atlantic and Pacific Northwest trail the chain. California lastly was in line with the chain.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And if I could follow-up with one more, what are you seeing out of some of the partner stores, in particular I guess, I'll just specifically ask about JCPenney. They've gone from comping down 30 to comping up -- now comping up 6%; it's got to have some impact on your business. How you think about that? Is there any way to quantify or measure that? Thanks.","Michael Balmuth","Look, it's certainly not a plus. It's not -- we try to quantify it when they weren\u2019t doing as well and we had difficulty quantifying it, but we knew it was helping. So really the answer to your question is we really don't have a precise answer.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank","Okay, but probably to the previous question may be it makes it harder to pick up market share, is that fair to say?","Michael Balmuth","It's hard to tell until we get through a more stable weather quarter, okay. It will be such a radically unusual weather quarter. I would rather answer that on our next call.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank","Fair enough. Good point. Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","","The next question is from David Mann with Johnson Rice.","David Mann - Johnson Rice & Company","Yes, thank you. Let me add my congratulations to Michael and well deserved promotions to Barbara and Michael as well. I had a question about gross margin. Can you talk about the components of gross margin? How we should think about them going forward especially given that you -- it looks like your inventory to sales ratio is the best it's been in like five quarters?","Michael Balmuth","Sure David. So as we got into this quarter, we ended, last quarter remember January was the slowest month of that quarter, so underperformed a bit. We were kind of bit more clearance into this quarter. So we took a few more markdowns to clear that inventory this quarter.","Having said that, in the first quarter, April was our strongest month, so we were in a different position going into the second. I would comment that with inventories down, we should be able to pick up a slight amount in markdown lines, similar to what we've done over the past several years.","David Mann - Johnson Rice & Company","And specifically any comments to give us about the direction of merchant margin over the course of the year and the other components of gross margin?","Michael Hartshorn","For the year, I think the guidance was slightly up from a merchandise standpoint given the one the two comp guidance, we would expect a little bit of deleverage on expense lines. Having said that, during the first quarter, we were able to manage expenses pretty aggressively and we'll look to do the same throughout the back half of the year in the second quarter as well.","David Mann - Johnson Rice & Company","And on that issue, the 1% comp you were able to do that on a 1% comp, you haven\u2019t really been able to do that in the past, should that -- is that sort of a guide now going forward that you might be able to de-lever or to lever on a 1% type of comp?","Michael Hartshorn","No, on the expense David, long term, we think that number is still around 3%. So although we were aggressive during the quarter and as we look out at least in the near term, we were optimistic about where expenses will be, but I think for your long term modeling, I think it's just better to use a 3% leverage point.","David Mann - Johnson Rice & Company","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","","Your next question is from Daniel Hofkin with William Blair.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair","Hi, good afternoon. Nice job in the quarter. So, if I could just kind of following-up on an earlier question specifically about JCPenney may be just more broadly, can you talk about, I know going into the quarter, you were talking about seeing higher promotional levels broadly than the same time last year, how did things play out compared to what you thought and what are you seeing kind of going into this part of the year? That's my first question.","Barbara Rentler","For Penney, promoted through the entire quarter and obviously there are increased promotional activities for us -- a lot of positive for us from a competitive point of view.","Michael Balmuth","I would just add also when Penney is just taking this kind of action on their promotional positioning, okay, it's expecting other moderate resellers who are also becoming more aggressive, so that's really the domino that we look at, within what our price phases and so for us to get a handle on how people will be promoting in the future, we are usually pretty good at that and then we'll be able to adjust our prices into a zone that keeps the value differential between the two, between mainstream and us.","So I think Penney is really more rattling other mainstream retailers and then we'll figure it out.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair","Okay. And then\u2026","Michael O'Sullivan","The other point to make on that Daniel is we've lived through promotional and competitive periods before and we had -- we are very confident we have a buying model and we have an expense structure that allows us to succeed in those environments and frankly to compete fairly sustainably. When other moderate retailers promote, it's not necessarily sustainable for them to keep doing that.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair","And if that's the main factor kind of affecting the near term merge margin for you kind of above the pricing umbrella.","Michael Hartshorn","I think availability of merchandize has a lot to do with the merge margin. We think it's very good right now. We think that with their inventory controls in place, we'll be able to turn at the same levels or faster, so I think we feel pretty good about merge margin as long as we can deliver topline comp.","Michael O'Sullivan","Yes, I think Daniel, the impact of promotions is more on the topline rather than the margins, which is what you see in Q1, but the margins were actually pretty healthy with the topline.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair","Okay. That actually was my follow-up question on the availability side. So it sounds like that remains quite positive. Good to hear. Thank you.","Operator","","The next question is from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs","Good afternoon. And this is really just kind of a quick follow-up to that line of questions, which is on the merchandize margin versus competition, was it just harder to keep the pricing gap and as you think about weather playing an impact on gross margin, can you just elaborate on any impact that you saw whether as related to transportation or even just promotions by geographies?","Michael Hartshorn","So Stephen, back to gross margin, specifically in the first quarter, we came into the quarter carrying more clearance balances than we typically would based on a below plan January.","So that put pressure on the merchandize margins during the first quarter. Markups were more in line, but we had to take a little bit more markdown during the first quarter. So I would not attribute that to a trend or for the rest of the year.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs","That's helpful. And then just longer term as you think about the operating margin, I think in the last year actually in this quarter there was kind of a three prong commentary about the drivers over the past couple of years and as you look forward, maybe you can talk about how you think of margins and where they can go? Thanks.","Michael Hartshorn","Let me comment on that Steve. I think, when you look at what's driven our operating margin over the last few years, it really has been the three things that you referenced. It's been lower markdowns driven by tighter inventories. And we don't think that's going away, we're not going to loosen up inventories anytime soon. So we think we're going to hold those gains.","It's been secondly lower shrink based upon our shortest initiatives. And again we're not planning on taking our eye off the ball there. And then thirdly it's been margin and expense leverage based upon ahead of planned sales.","Now, if I look at which of those, we still have more opportunity on. It's really the third. It all depends on sales. If we're able to get ahead of planned sales, we'll get margin leverage.","I think there's probably limited opportunity left in markdowns and in shrink, some but limited. So going forward it's really about the topline.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thanks. Best of luck.","Michael Hartshorn","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is, we have, from Paul Lejuez with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo Securities","","Hey, thanks guys. Sorry if I missed it, but did you talk about the home category versus apparel and within home, I'm just wondering what's working and what's not.","And then also second, where is your AUR and your average ticket these days in both Ross and dd's. Do you see an opportunity there and what would be the driver? Thanks.","Michael Hartshorn","Paul this is Michael I'll take the transaction piece. As we mentioned in the comments, comp was driven by an increase in the basket, the transaction is down slightly. The increase in the basket was mainly driven by increase in units per transaction, but your question on AUR that was up slightly during the quarter.","Going forward, currently Ross is about 20% to 25% higher in terms of average AUR. And I think our focus is really on the price differentiation between department stores versus absolute prices.","Michael Balmuth","On the home aspect, okay, for the first quarter our home performance was well ahead of the chain. We're making progress there and we're making faster progress I would say on the -- on the parts of home that are really the more gift and functional end versus domestics.","Domestics is -- looks like it will be the section of the business that will come on last in terms of where we were trying to improve it. So, that's how I would divide it out to how it's going.","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","What's included in domestics?","","Michael Balmuth","","Sheets, towels, pillows.","","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","","Thanks guys. Good luck.","Michael Balmuth","Thanks.","Operator","","The next question is from Bridget Weishaar with Morningstar.","Bridget Weishaar - Morningstar","Good morning. Congratulations on the quarter. Just a question on SG&A, it seemed a little bit better than expected, could you identify where the savings came from? Did you pull back from any marketing giving the weather overhang and shifting it into a different quarter or is there something else in that line item?","Michael Balmuth","Bridget, specific on marketing, we didn\u2019t put anything back. We were more productive in stores in terms of some productivity initiatives that we had in place. Michael, if there was anything else?","Michael Hartshorn","No, I would say it was broad based. I would say in this competitive environment you should expect us to see very vigilant about controlling expenses throughout the year.","Bridget Weishaar - Morningstar","And do you see more room in there that you could cut back from or are you pretty close to running as lean as you can?","Michael Hartshorn","I would say, John mentioned that our long term model is really to lever SG&A at about 3%. I think there is a good opportunity for us to lever below that this year.","Bridget Weishaar - Morningstar","Great. Thank you.","Operator","","The next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.","Lorraine Hutchinson - Bank of America","","Thank you. Good afternoon. Given the strength of some of your new store openings throughout the Midwest, does this give you more confidence to look at other geographies that are perhaps under penetrated?","Michael Balmuth","Yes. Our geographic expansion strategy, going back way back when there's always been to when we move into a new market to try and build out our presence in that market before we move on to another market so to speak.","We thought it was well for us, because there are numerous benefits and synergies that come with that in terms of building awareness, building our operating team etcetera.","So, I think you should expect that most of our activities in the next few years with regard to new markets will be in that Midwest region. Even though, we're happy with the results, I don't see us jumping out of that region into other regions prematurely.","Lorraine Hutchinson - Bank of America","","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Oliver Chen with Citi.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc","Thank you. We just had a question regarding the planning and allocation side of the business. You've been great pioneers in micro-merchandising. What are your thoughts about what anything in there and if that's a potential driver?","Also just from a strategy perspective, we understand that the shipping costs are prohibitive from an online basis, but would there be a scenario in which a bigger online presence would make sense for you down the road?","Michael Balmuth","So, Oliver the team has done -- can you just repeat your specific question on micro-merchandising.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc","If there is a lot of opportunity in that than going forward in terms of further tailoring the assortments on a local basis?","Michael Balmuth","So, on that piece, on micro-merchandising, we've had the micro-merchandising processes and tools in place for about 2.5, three years at this point. And we're very happy with how they've been working for us, how they've been helping us. And I think we believe they've been a key enabler [of us] (ph) to turn faster in particular.","And therefore many of the inventory reductions that we've achieved and we've spoken about, I think you can tie back to micro merchandising.","Now one of the things that we described early on was that the micro-merchandising system we have sort of learned from experience. So the more years you have, the more years of accumulated data, the better it gets at projecting what sells and inventory levels we should plan to. So, yes, I think there is some incremental opportunity as we move forward.","Secondly, e-commerce, so, we continue to look at e-commerce. We run a business that has a $10 average unit retail. And when we put together the economics currently, we think it's very hard for people to make money. Not just shipping cost but return cost, processing cost, marketing cost etcetera.","Now, maybe things will change, but maybe someone in some way that leads us to change our mind. But at least as we look at the data right now, we don't, it doesn't seem very compelling to us.","So, our focus is really to put our resources against our bricks-and-mortar business, where we know we can be very successful, we know we can make money. And we have plenty of opportunity ahead of us.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc","Okay. Thanks. And would you mind just updating us on your thoughts on the help of the consumer in terms of pressures you're seeing. Do you feel like there is still a lot of volatility, or do you think housing has been a help or just your thoughts on where you think sentiment is with your customer base.","Michael Balmuth","We're not economists. But what we know is the customer - the customer who is the moderate base customer appears to have some difficulties right now and so, if you're -- the word is health, they seem to have a little bit of a health problem right now.","","Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc","Thank you. Best regards.","Michael Balmuth","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Ike Boruchow with Sterne Agee.","Tom Nikic - Sterne Agee","Hi. This is actually Tom Nikic on for Ike. Thanks for taking my call. I was just wondering about the packaway inventory, I guess we would have thought that, with the disruption that happened in the retails base that maybe the packaway as percentage of inventory would take up. But it's flat for a couple of years in a row now.","I was wondering if you could just discuss the packaway situation. Thanks very much.","Michael Balmuth","We've been pretty happy with our packaway availability, Tom. It does fluctuate, it can move around. And typically we see more packaway opportunities in the second half of the season, rather than the first half of the season. But I would say that availability has been recently strong and we are pretty happy with what we're seeing that we're packing away.","Michael Hartshorn","And what we're seeing, we're happy, we're happy in what we're seeing both in quantity and just their actual quality of what's out there these days. Okay. As you would expect, as mainstream retail is suffering a bit.","Tom Nikic - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","The next question is from Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley","Thank you. Michael, I'm trying to just understand a little bit more your weather comments, maybe you could help us by dimensionalizing perhaps the difference between Mid-Atlantic comps and some of your warmer weather markets, not necessarily Florida, because that\u2019s been a standout for a while, but just so we can understand the magnitude of the difference. And then did you say California chain I was just wasn\u2019t sure if I heard that correct?","Michael Balmuth","Kim, really we wouldn\u2019t talk about specifics on regional other than to say they are higher and lower than the chain. But on your California question, it was in line with the chain.","Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley","Okay, California is in line with the chain. Was the Mid Atlantic -- was the Mid Atlantic in the northwest area is the only area where you feel like you have some weather impact. Were there other things going on in the Rocky Mountain region or other places that you felt also hurt your business?","Michael Balmuth","I would say we had weather impact throughout many of our regions. And Pacific Northwest was up against very strong comps. It was their strongest performing region last year.","Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley","I\u2019m just trying to figure out how it was that the Midwest, which had really terrible weather, was one of your best performing regions. And is it just more experience in the market, better execution on your part that was able to overcome the weather headwinds or is there something else that would explain why the Midwest was quite good where the rest of the chain was hit by weather?","Michael Balmuth","Kimberly, I think the Midwest is a good case example of why retailers should never blame the weather. We mentioned the weather because obviously it was relevant in Q1. But when we look at the Midwest, there are lots of other things that can drive your top line certainly over the period of this quarter that can trump weather. And I think some of the changes that we're able to make in terms of assortment certainly had that impact in the first quarter.","So, I know you\u2019re trying to quantify the impact of weather, but I think it\u2019s very hard over the period of quarter. So, that like a single weather event like a hurricane, where a dozen stores close down, you can quantify the number, but over the whole of a quarter. The changes you can make in assortments and values you can offer in the store can trump the weather impact, that\u2019s what we think happened in the Midwest.","Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley","Okay, understood. Thank you. And then just looking at your second quarter guidance, you\u2019re talking about a 1% to 2% comp that\u2019s in line with the guidance you gave for the first quarter. Does that feel conservative to you, does that feel appropriate? I am just looking at to the second quarter and it doesn\u2019t feel like there should be much in the way of weather impact and I just wanted to get your feel for how you assess that view?","Michael Balmuth","Kimberly, I think it feels appropriate right now in this environment. As Michael said the moderate consumers have a tough time looking out and hearing other people report. I think it's pretty tough business out there. So we feel that it\u2019s appropriately said.","Michael O'Sullivan","Additionally, it\u2019s to be determined how the promotional environment will be, both in this quarter coming up and the rest of the year.","Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Laura Champine with Canaccord.","Laura Champine - Canaccord","Good afternoon. Could you comment on your sell through of seasonal women\u2019s apparel this spring versus last spring this time of year?","Michael Balmuth","Laura, I don\u2019t think the comfort going down to that level, like kind of category level. With women\u2019s apparel, I think what we would be comfortable to say is, non-apparel has performed better given the weather conditions and so our sell-throughs would be better in non-apparel areas than apparel areas season to date.","Laura Champine - Canaccord","I guess the point of question is, you mentioned that merchandise margin, you should get a little bit of a lift as we move through the year, should we expect most of that in back half or do we start to see it this quarter?","Michael Balmuth","I think you could expect to see it even throughout from this period going forward. Again, we\u2019re not -- the point of the first quarter is we are carrying more clarity for that period, so our markdowns were higher than we had targeted.","Laura Champine - Canaccord","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray.","Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray","Great. Thank you. Just a quick clarification on Q2 guidance. Michael, are you saying that you\u2019re looking for the underlying metrics to be comfortable for Q2 in terms of the number of transactions and average transaction size value or is there a shift that we should be looking for?","Michael Balmuth","We don\u2019t -- we typically Neely we don\u2019t plan the business based on the transaction size, really the overall comp. So based on a one to two, we\u2019d say it's going to somewhat consistent with what's going on with Q1 absent the weather.","Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray","Okay. And then just a follow-up question to Laura's question, I guess, not necessarily wanting you to get all the competitive away, but are you feeling good about the balance that you have in your apparel right now around active versus denim -anchored fashion looks? Thank you.","Michael Balmuth","You know something, I think we feel relatively okay. There are some mix issues underneath the lines, but our balance of how we\u2019re mixed across categories, we feel okay there.","Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray","Okay. Thank you very much. Good luck.","Speaker","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from John Kernan with Cowen.","John Kernan - Cowen","Good afternoon, guys. Just lot of good questions so far. I just wanted ask you on your real estate availability as you pushed out of the core markets in California, Texas and Florida, what you\u2019re seeing in terms of availability and quality of sight?","Michael Balmuth","We\u2019re pretty happy. We are one of the few retailers that\u2019s hoping 80, 90 stores a year. So we\u2019re out there. We\u2019re looking for locations. We have a very, very strong real estate team that have got lot of experience and they\u2019ve been able to find us some great locations over the last several years and we think availability continues to be good.","Obviously part of that has been driving by other retailers who've either gone bankrupt or out of business or retailers that has have closed down a lot of locations, so that's continuing to help us.","John Kernan - Cowen","Are you noticing any pressure -- you're obviously co-located with a lot of retailers that have been complaining about more meaningful declines in traffic then you\u2019re seeing. So are you worried that some of the collocation with some other stores and the lack of traffic there might be pressuring you as well?","Michael Balmuth","Who knows, the key implication for us in those locations, to make sure that we\u2019re offering the sharpest values that we can and therefore whatever traffic is coming to that center that we get more than our fair share of it. So, if that something macroeconomic that\u2019s going on that's affecting our center or more global that we can\u2019t control. There\u2019s not much we can about that, but when we focus on what we can control which is the value in the store.","John Kernan - Cowen","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Roxanne Meyer with UBS.","Roxanne Meyer -- UBS","Great, thanks, good afternoon and congrats on a great performance in a really tough quarter. My question is, wondering if you could comment on new store performance and how that has trended and then comment on the ramp to maturity of new stores, how long it takes and have you seen any changes in that ramp and also just comment on new store performance by classes over the last few years? Thanks.","Michael Balmuth","So Roxanne, yes. We\u2019re pretty happy with how new stores have been performing not just in the last quarter but over the last couple of years. In terms of new store ramp, we don\u2019t disclose the ramp but it\u2019s been fairly consistent over time, obviously when a store first opens up, there\u2019s sort of a period where it build awareness and for us though the awareness is mostly through word-of-mouth and that will take little bit of time. So after three or four years typically the store ramps up, but yes, that\u2019s how I would describe it.","Roxanne Meyer - UBS","Okay. Great, thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from Richard Jaffe with Stifle.","Richard Jaffe - Stifle","Thanks very much guys. Given your comment earlier about the tighter inventory resulting in fewer markdowns, that's been a real success story for you guys. I\u2019m wondering if -- as you mentioned there is less opportunity there, should we assume inventory levels will proceed at essentially a flat level year-over-year on a per square foot basis that there is no further pursuit to make your inventories leaner or turn more quickly?","John Call","I think -- Richard, this is John. We have obviously taken big chunks of (inaudible) over the past three, four years. We\u2019re still working at it. We think there is some marginal benefit. We think inventories will be down probably one or two points this year. So there's still some opportunity.","Richard Jaffe - Stifle","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters.","Michael Balmuth","Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores.

The call will begin with prepared comments by management, followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].","Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts, new store openings and other matters that are based on the company's current forecast of aspects of its future business.","These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. ","Risk factors are included in today's press release and the Company's fiscal 2018 Form 10-K and fiscal 2019 Form 10-Q and 8-Ks on file with the SEC.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer.","Barbara Rentler","Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President and Chief Operating Officer; Travis Marquette, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Vice President, Investor Relations.","We'll begin our call today with a review of our second quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the second half and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.","As noted in today's press release, we delivered respectable gains in both sales and earnings for the second quarter. Earnings per share for the period were $1.14, up from $1.04 last year. Net earnings were $413 million, up from $389 million in the prior year. ","Total sales for the second quarter increased 6% to $4 billion. Comparable store sales rose 3% on top of last year's strongest quarterly comparison of 5%.","For the second quarter, the best performing merchandise department at Ross was men\u2019s, while the Midwest and Southeast were the top performing markets. While the Ladies business continued to trail the chain, trends in this important area showed some improvement during the quarter. We continue to believe that the actions we are taking here will lead to additional improvements as we move through the balance of the year.","Operating margin of 13.7% was better than expected, mainly due to favorable timing of expenses that are expected to reverse in the second half.","For the first six months of fiscal 2019, earnings per share were $2.29, up from $2.15 last year. Net earnings were $834 million, up from $808 million in the first half of 2018. ","Sales year-to-date rose 6% to $7.8 billion with comparable store sales up 2% versus a 4% gain for the first half of last year.","As we ended the second quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 8% over the prior year. Packaway was 43% of total inventories compared to last year's 44%. Average in-store inventories at the end of the period were up 4% as we flowed receipts a little earlier to support the back-to-school selling period.","dd's DISCOUNTS had another quarter of strong growth in both sales and operating profit.","Turning to our store expansion program, we remained on schedule with the opening of 22 new Ross and 6 dd's DISCOUNTS locations in the second quarter. We continue to project adding a total of approximately 100 locations in 2019, comprised of 75 Ross and 25 dd's. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores.","Now, Travis Marquette will provide further color on our second quarter results and details on our second half guidance.","Travis Marquette","Thank you, Barbara. As previously mentioned, our second quarter earnings results benefited from the favorable timing of expenses that are expected to reverse in the second half. This benefit was worth approximately $0.02 to earnings per share.","Now, turning to the details of our Q2 results. As noted in today's press release, we have updated our earnings guidance for the second half given the recent announcement of 10% tariff on goods sourced from China, including apparel and footwear. Our projected impact is based on our present understanding of the timing of and the merchandise categories included in these additional tariffs.","Our sales forecast for the second half remains unchanged. We continue to forecast same store sales for the balance of the year to grow by 1% to 2%. If sales perform in line with this projection, earnings per share for the third quarter were forecasted to be in the range of $0.92 to $0.96 compared to $0.91 a year ago.","For the fourth quarter, earnings per share are projected to be $1.20 to $1.25 versus $1.20 in the prior year, which included a one-time per share benefit of $0.07 from the favorable resolution of a tax matter.","Now, I will provide some operating statement assumptions for our third quarter EPS. ","Projected sales \u2013 total Sales are projected to grow 5% to 6%. We expect to open 42 new stores during the period, including 30 Ross and 12 dd's locations.","Operating margin is projected to be in the range of 11.8% to 12.0% compared to last year's 12.4%. This forecast reflects our expectations for some pressure on merchandise gross margin from tariffs along with deleveraging on occupancy and other expenses if comparable sales perform in line with our guidance.","We expect net interest income of about $3.3 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 24%, and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about 360 million.","Based on our first half results and second half guidance, we now project earnings per share for the full year to be in the range of $4.41 to $4.50 compared to $4.26 in fiscal 2018, which included the previously mentioned one-time per share benefit of $0.07.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments.","Barbara Rentler","Thank you, Travis. To sum up, as I mentioned earlier, we delivered respectable sales and earnings growth for the second quarter on top of our strongest quarterly comparable sales comparison from last year.","While we've made progress in strengthening the Ladies apparel business, we still have a way to go until we're satisfied with our assortments in this important area.","As we move into the fall season, we'll work on our merchandising initiatives in Ladies and also throughout the entire store, so that we are delivering the right products and brands priced as sharply as our customers have come to expect.","We believe the additional tariffs may result in increased uncertainty in the apparel and footwear market. Historically, disruptions like this have benefited off-price. As always, our focus will continue to be offering our customers the most compelling values possible throughout our stores.","At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Boss from J.P. Morgan.","Matthew Boss","Thanks. And congrats on a nice quarter. So, with same store sales comparisons easing in the back half of the year relative for the front half and given the sequential improvement that you spoke to in the ladies business, anything you see constraining your ability to exceed the 1% to 2% comp guidance for the back half of the year or maybe where do you see top opportunities to potentially outperform?","Michael Hartshorn","Matt, hi, it\u2019s Michael Hartshorn. The way we thought about the back half, first, we were up against strong multi-year comparisons in both Q3 and Q4. With ladies strengthening, it is a smaller part of the business in the back half. On top of that, we think there's going to be continued uncertainty. Given the department store performance in Q2, we expect it \u2013 or could be more promotional. And on top of that, we think the tariffs are going to cause a bit of uncertainty in the back half. So, our point of view is we always like to be conservative and hope to beat it.","Matthew Boss","Great. And then maybe just to follow-up in larger picture, Barbara, I guess how best to think about the near-term versus intermediate term, the potential impact of tariffs maybe to the customer in the off-price sector in your view?","Barbara Rentler","Well, in the near term, I think what we have to do is recognize that we're not the leader in all of this, we\u2019re the follower. So, we're not going to be the leader in terms of raising prices. So, as the tariff comes on, it's early for us to know how retailers plan to manage through the costs, and ultimately what the customer is going to see in terms of pricing in front of them. So, we're studying that business. So, we're going to have to wait and see how retailers react to the higher costs, their approach on pricing, and then really the customers' reaction to potential price inflation.","So, in the near-term, it's a wait and see. We have to kind of watch what they're doing and then see where that puts us because we're clearly not the leader on pricing.","In the intermediate, I think it will \u2013 it historically would have given us an opportunity for supply in some changing markets. But I think until we understand \u2013 the near term and intermediate being defined as, I guess, part of 2020 \u2013 until we understand what the pricing is going to mean to the customer, I think there's going to be some challenges ahead particularly as department store business is difficult. And so, with that, we're going to wait and see and again. And again, as I said, we're going to hold on our pricing and see where we fit in the order because the most important thing, while all of this is going on, is that we offer our customers the best values possible. And so, there's going to be a lot of moving targets I think here, and so I think we need to study it.","Matthew Boss","That's great color. Best of luck.","Barbara Rentler","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you. Good afternoon. Just to follow-up on the tariffs, can you talk about what proportion of your product is affected? And then, are there any opportunities for mitigation as you look into 2020?","Michael Hartshorn","Sure, Lorraine. We don't disclose the specific percentage for competitive reasons. That said, as with most retailers, a good portion of our apparel and footwear comes from China.","So, with that said, in terms of the mitigation, so as we mentioned in the commentary, we think it was a prudent approach to make our best estimate of a potential impact, separating out what goes into effect in September and December. And for us, our best estimate at this point is we added $0.03 \u2013 or took $0.03 from EPS in the back half, but certainly hope it plays out more favorably, but that's our best shot at this point in time. ","We'll have to wait to see, as Barbara mentioned, how different retailers react to the higher costs, their approach on pricing, as well as how the consumer would react to increases in prices. That said, historically, disruptions like this have been beneficial for off-price.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Altschwager from Baird.","Mark Altschwager","Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Was hoping if you could give a bit more color on some of the gross margin drivers in Q2 just in terms of merch margin, freight distribution, and then if you're able to quantify perhaps just the level of merch margin pressure you expect from tariffs over the back half, that would be helpful. Thank you.","Michael Hartshorn","On merch margin piece, we wouldn't disclose the margin impact, but the $0.03 that we included in the guidance is largely merchandise margin.","Travis Marquette","And then, let me just provide a little bit more detail. So, during the period, cost of goods sold increased 10 basis points. Higher merchandise margin and lower distribution costs of 10 basis points each were offset by freight costs that rose 20 basis points and occupancy deleverage of 10 basis points. Buying expenses were flat versus last year. Selling and general administrative expenses for the quarter increased 5 basis points largely due to higher wage costs.","Mark Altschwager","Thank you. And best of luck.","Michael Hartshorn","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Greenberger","Great, thank you. I wanted to explore SG&A a little bit more. Wage is obviously still growing here in the second quarter. If you could give us any sort of order of magnitude on the wage growth headwind to SG&A here in Q2, that would be helpful. And will that change as we look out to the back half of the year? ","And on the cost \u2013 the SG&A cost shift out of Q2, do you have \u2013 I think you said that was $0.02 benefit to the second quarter. If you could give us the SG&A dollars benefiting Q2 and if that's expected to come in Q3 or Q4, just any color on that would be helpful. Thanks.","Travis Marquette","Kimberly, as you may recall, we increased wages across the board last year to $11. So, we are just now anniversarying that in the second quarter. When we entered the year, despite wage growth, our own $11 increase and the minimum wage increases in states like California, we guided the year for SG&A to leverage at the normal 3%. So, we've been able to offset those costs.","In terms of the $0.02 timing, that wasn't all in SG&A. Some of that's gross margin. And we wouldn't break out that specific. And as a reminder, the $0.02 timing benefit was versus our original guidance, not versus last year.","Kimberly Greenberger","Okay. Thanks so much for that.","Michael Hartshorn","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from Omar Saad from Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad","Thanks for taking my question. Could you talk about some of the women's apparel trends? I know it's improved a little bit, but still kind of lingering issues there. Is that more external fashion trends or external factors related to the category and environment or internal execution issues that you think you can address?","And I also would love to get your thoughts on some of the lower freight rates we're hearing about this year and into next year, if that's material to you guys. Thanks.","Michael Hartshorn","I'll start with the freight. So, generally, for us, freight has played out much as we expected at the beginning of the year. What we saw was 35 basis point deleverage in Q1, 20 basis points deleverage in Q2, and our guidance assumes that it will abate further in the back half.","Barbara Rentler","And as it pertains to the women's apparel trends, externally, there isn't any one major big trend driving ladies apparel. I think that's the first thing. But with that, our issues in ladies apparel really related to our own execution issues, for our assortments below our normal standards. So, we feel like we've been working through those issues, we feel like we've made some progress. Still trailing the chain. And as I said before in my comments, we feel like as the year goes on that the business will continue to improve.","Omar Saad","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Binetti from Credit Suisse.","Michael Binetti","Hey, guys. Thanks. Congrats on a nice quarter. Thanks for taking all our questions here. Just, Michael, a question on your comments on the near term. I think you mentioned that you flowed some inventory for back-to-school, maybe some color on whether you think that strategy seems successful in the early days. And then, you did make a comment on observing department store trends lately and your hunch that we could see promotions stepping up. Maybe just a little more color about how you're looking at the landscape and what you're planning your business for, given the competitive set that you expect in the back half. And I have a follow-up.","Michael Hartshorn","Sure, Michael. We wouldn't comment on kind of inter-quarter trends at this point. We would do that at the end of Q3. And my comments really on the department stores is based on their earnings performance. So, they obviously \u2013 the comps were certainly below the off-price and value performers, plus on top of that their gross margins which suggest they were more promotional and that could continue into Q3.","Michael Binetti","Okay. And I hate asking the most basic questions, but maybe a little color on inventories you're seeing available. Are you seeing things that excite you and, more importantly, maybe why? Is it better brands, new categories opening up? I'm a little surprised packaway was lower year-over-year given what we're seeing in the market and the rush to get product in before the tariffs this year. So, I'm wondering if your plan includes \u2013 are we going to see that total inventory number build into 3Q. Maybe any thoughts on that?","Barbara Rentler","So, in terms of supply, supply is very plentiful. It is broad across most classifications of business. In terms of the level of packaway, packaway fluctuates and the merchants buy that the way they see it in terms of the product, the timing, the pricing of those goods. And so, it's still in the 40s range, which is pretty average for us, but the merchants have to make that decision. So, as the season goes on, there will continue to see the additional goods.","The departments store business, if it continues to be difficult, you would expect that there would be more supply in the shorter term. And we're liquid and ready to take advantage of those opportunities once the merchants feel that it's at the right price and the right value as we're anticipating it being a very promotional fourth quarter. So\u2026","Michael Binetti","Got it. Thanks a lot. And best of luck.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alex Walvis from Goldman Sachs.","Alexandra Walvis","Good morning. Good evening, rather. Thanks for the question. The first question that I had is whether you can help us out with the breakdown of comp between traffic where you are and the basket.","Second question was a follow up on the inventory \u2013 the in-store inventory growth. Can you talk about the drivers of the decision to flow receipts earlier? Is that all of the reason for the slightly higher in-store inventory or is there anything else going on there?","Travis Marquette","This is Travis. In terms of the components of sales, the 3% comp was driven by slightly higher traffic and an increase in the size of the average basket. The higher basket was driven by higher units per transaction. AUR was down just a bit for the quarter.","Michael Hartshorn","And on inventory, it was a function of flowing receipts early, within our plan at the beginning of the year, and so that was strategic.","Alexandra Walvis","Great. Thanks so much. One follow-up, if I may. The men's business has been strong for some time. Can you talk about what's working there and where the continued strength is coming from?","Barbara Rentler","Sure. I would probably say the reason the men's business is good is because we have a solid strategy that the merchants have done a very good job of executing on. So, our level of execution there has been very consistent. And again, as has the strategy. So, there's not one particular thing that's really driving it.","Alexandra Walvis","Great, thank you. Appreciate all the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from Daniel Hofkin from William Blair.","Daniel Hofkin","Good afternoon. Just a couple of quick questions. And I apologize I missed a little bit. So, if you've already answered that, no worries. But as it relates to the \u2013 you talked a little bit about \u2013 it was SG&A and gross margin, both had a little bit of timing of expenses. I was just curious, did the inventory flow timing affect the gross margin? And if so, was that \u2013 how much roughly was that? And then, just if you haven't already given it, some additional color by region and category beyond just sort of a main ones, if you have that. Thanks.","Michael Hartshorn","Dan, on the inventory flow, it just happened at the end of the quarter. So, no, it did not have an impact on margins. Margin for the quarter was up 10 basis points. That was a little lower than the benefit that we saw in Q3 that was somewhat impacted by the tariffs that went into effect in June. But we were able to offset that with strong expense control. ","Travis Marquette","In terms of color and geographic region, as we mentioned in our commentary, the Midwest and Southeast were the strongest regions. Of our other major markets, California and Florida were slightly below the chain, while Texas and the Southwest were a bit better than the chain average. In terms of merchandise categories, we mentioned men's was the strongest category and children's was also pretty strong.","Daniel Hofkin","Okay, great. Thank you very much. Best of luck.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Morris from D.A. Davidson.","John Morris","Thank you. Congratulations on a nice quarter as well. Barbara, maybe can you give us a little bit more color on dd's and the progress that you're making there and what you're particularly pleased with and sort of how you're benchmarking it?","And then, two other kind of quick housekeeping questions. One is, we talked a little bit about inventory in the plan. But can you give us a sense of where inventory at the end of Q3 might be related to sales? Same kind of growth, about in line, I'm assuming.","And I don't know if you would answer this or not, I'm just kind of curious. We've talked a lot about freight. It's just a kind of quick one. Those freight contracts, when you're negotiating terms, is that an annual event with somebody or is it kind of a continuous thing? It just kind of helps us understand how it should flow through. Thanks.","Michael Hartshorn","Sure. So, to go through those, we don't give forward-looking guidance on inventory levels. And on freight, for us, we have already gone through our annual renewals. We did that earlier this year. So, we have some pretty good visibility at this point.","Barbara Rentler","And as it pertains to dd's, as I said before, we've had strong growth both in sales and profits. But for competitive reasons, we don't really get more specific than that, other than to say that dd's has a similar four-wall profit margins to Ross.","John Morris","Great, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell","Good afternoon. I'm curious to hear what you are seeing in terms of new store performance both on the Ross and dd's side.","Travis Marquette","Yeah, this is Travis. Our new store performance is pretty consistent with our historical averages of between 60% and 65% of an average comp. It fluctuates a little bit quarter-to-quarter depending on where the new stores are located. But, overall, the performance is pretty consistent.","Paul Trussell","Thank you. And just sort of \u2013 just a bigger picture, just curious if there is any thoughts around e-commerce as you look in the years ahead.","Michael Hartshorn","On e-commerce, our view on e-commerce has not changed. We think in the moderate off-price business, the economics are just not sustainable. Over many years now, we've posted comp sales at the high end of retail benchmarks and we've done this without e-commerce. So, rather than being distracted by what we view is unsustainable business, we'd rather focus ourselves on what's proven \u2013 proven to be very profitable opportunity in front of us.","Paul Trussell","Thank you. And congratulations on recent promotions.","Michael Hartshorn","Thank you, Paul.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo.","Ike Boruchow","Hey, good afternoon. Just on the CapEx spend, I think you guys guided it to $600 million this year. I'm just curious, is that still the right number? ","And then, I think there's a new DC build out embedded in there. I'm just trying to understand what maybe the run rate of CapEx should be into next year.","And then, to whoever wants to answer it, should there be some kind of supply chain pressure on margin at some point? I'm not sure if you're already seeing that or maybe something we should keep in mind for our models next year. Any color on that? Thank you.","Michael Hartshorn","So, the DC. I'll let Travis cover the capital, but on the DCs, next couple years we would expect to open. So, we would not expect any impact of that new DC as we move into 2020.","Travis Marquette","In terms of total capital spend, it hasn't changed. We're still expecting to spend around $600 million this year. About a third of that is related to distribution center build-outs, et cetera. In terms of going forward, again, I think we've said in the past, we expect total capital spending to be elevated for a couple of years.","Ike Boruchow","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jay Sole from UBS.","Jay Sole","Great. Thank you. I have a question about the $0.03 impact from tariffs. Is that a net number, meaning is there sort of like a $0.06 headwind is being offset with $0.03 of cost cutting or other mitigation factors? Or is it just $0.03 is what the actual impact of the tariff is?","Michael Hartshorn","Yeah, on that question, so, obviously, we had the tariffs. We started the year with 10% tariffs on Tranche 3 which was mainly in categories like home, cosmetics and accessories. That expanded to 25% in June. We were able to mitigate those tariff impacts with tightening our belts on cost. With this, this $0.03 is our best estimate on what the margin could impact \u2013 margin impact could be. And at this point, I don't think we can offset that with cost reduction. But, again, hope it plays out more favorably from this.","Jay Sole","Right. And then, Barbara, I wanted to ask you is, if apparel as a category is a little bit slow and there's some opportunities to do more business in categories like pet supplies or auto parts or food or some of the newer categories in the store, how did those \u2013 what's the interplay like between those categories and some of your more traditional categories like apparel and footwear? How does the customer experience change if they're coming in to buy apparel, if they're also kind of looking at auto parts and pet supplies and toys and food and other things that maybe they're not used to seeing in the store?","Barbara Rentler","Well, I do think the customer likes it because it enhances the treasure hunt, right? So, I come in, thinking I'm going to buy something in ladies today, and I go to ladies and I look at ladies, and this customer likes to touch and feel, likes to see new things and something that they didn't see the last time they were in the store. Average customer shops the store more than three times a month. So, we think it's exciting. And the customer enjoys having something new. The challenge is to keep continually adding new things to make the treasure hunt \u2013 make her come back again and again, with exciting new products.","Jay Sole","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Kernan from Cowen.","John Kernan","Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking my question.","Michael Hartshorn","Good afternoon.","John Kernan","Can you talk about any emerging competitive threat from the growth of resale? There's been some industry chatter about it recently. There's been some executives within that channel talking about the share that they're stealing from off-price. Have you seen any effects of that? Do you think that this is any type of a long-term competitive threat? Then I have one quick follow-up. Thank you.","Michael Hartshorn","I would say, over the long term, we've competed with \u2013 against many different types of retail concepts, brands, department stores, specialty stores, and have done extremely well. So, we don't see it as a long-term competitive threat.","John Kernan","Got it. And then, maybe can you just talk about the performance of home? It feels like the category in general has become a little bit more competitive recently. Can you talk about your specific performance? Thank you.","Barbara Rentler","Sure. Home for the quarter performed in line with the chain. We still continue to see this long-term growth opportunity because it's, obviously, a wide assortment of products. But a performance along with the chain, we're never fully satisfied with any part of our business. So, we would like to continue expand and to grow that business. But for competitive reasons, I wouldn't talk more about the specifics of that.","John Kernan","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Janine Stichter from Jefferies.","Janine Stichter","Hi. Just had a quick follow-up on the tariffs just for modeling purposes. Is there any major variation we should think about in terms of how the tariffs flow through and which comes through in September versus what flows through in December? Thank you.","Michael Hartshorn","Because we haven't given fourth quarter guidance at this point, it's hard to say other than we have embedded the $0.03 into the back half guidance. I think if you looked at the \u2013 it doesn't start till September. And I think if you look at the industry, I would say that there's more of the apparel and shoes in the September tranche than in the December tranche. So, that's the color I'd add to that.","Janine Stichter","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Laura Champine from Loop Capital.","Laura Champine","Thanks for taking my question. It's about the mechanics of getting to the $0.03 impact from tariffs. Since you've got such a significant open to buy, I'm wondering whether you just calculated that by looking at what you'd bought year-ago period from China.","Michael Hartshorn","Well, remember our business. So, there is a small portion of our business where we directly import. There is \u2013 our thought is that over the majority of the goods that we procure in apparel and shoes was originally sourced from China. That said, it's hard to know what's going to happen at this point. It just was announced several weeks ago in the markets. What I would say is, the majority of our business is close-outs. So, if you look at what we have left to buy year-over-year, we would normally have a lot of close-out in our receipt plan for the remainder of the year.","Laura Champine","And because you use packaway inventory so extensively, would that potentially delay any impact of tariff-related inflation beyond the time horizon when it would have hit some of your competitors?","Michael Hartshorn","Certainly a benefit for us.","Laura Champine","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group","Dana Telsey","Good afternoon, everyone. As you think about the expense timing shifts that went on, how much should go in each quarter as you think about in the third and the fourth quarter? And is there anything in particular that shifted from the second quarter to the back half? And just lastly, how you're thinking of marketing for the back half of the year? Any changes in what you're spending or what you're doing? Thank you.","Michael Hartshorn","In terms of the timing, I just want to reiterate that the timing difference is versus our original guidance So, that $0.02 flows into our back half guidance. And so, we wouldn't break that out between Q3 and Q4.","On marketing, our marketing strategy and message has been very consistent over the years and hasn't changed for us. The message is we offer the best values in apparel and home fashions. We think, frankly, that marketing can help support our business, but what really drives our business is great bargains in the store. If we have great assortments, then marketing can help support that trend.","Dana Telsey","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Roxanne Meyer from MKM partners.","Roxanne Meyer","Thank you. Good afternoon. And thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask two things. One about AUR, wondering if it was down slightly on mix or pricing.","And then, secondly, I'm wondering just in the context of the plentiful inventory availability, so far this year and going forward, if you are looking to change your mix or have the opportunity to change your mix, if you so desire between good, better and best product. Thanks a lot.","Travis Marquette","In terms of AUR, the decline was primarily driven by the change in mix of sell-through within categories.","Barbara Rentler","In terms the availability and the changing of our mix, we're going to take advantage of whatever we think the best deals are out there. We don't go in there and say, I want X amount of our purchases to be good, to be better and to the best. We go out to see what the best possible deals and values are for the customer, and that's how we purchase it. So, the merchants are out buying it the way they see it. It's not as much top-down as you might think. It's really more of bottom-up based on the deals, based on the value that they can deliver.","Roxanne Meyer","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And your last question comes from Paul Lejuez from Citi.","Paul Lejuez","Hey. Thanks, guys. Just going back to the ladies apparel, I think you said it's still performing below the chain. I guess, something always has to be below average. So, is there any color you can give on the comp ex that ladies business and how that has changed? Just trying to get a sense of the drag from that piece over the last couple of quarters that it has underperformed.","And then, second, in the first quarter, you talked about SG&A timing as well. And I'm just curious if this is the timing shift that we're talking about out of 2Q. Are we talking about the same expenses that keep getting pushed out or are we talking different expense buckets? If you could be maybe a little bit more specific about what's moving around.","Michael Hartshorn","Yeah, Paul. So, we always like to start the year with guidance. And then, as we move through the year, make sure we update you on how that impacts. So, for the second quarter, for instance, we were $0.03 above the high end of the range, but we only flowed $0.01 of that through to the full-year. And no, those weren't the same types of expenses. We have things \u2013 quarterly timing differences on projects that may be delayed or we may make decisions that delay projects until later in the year. So, that's all we're calling out in the guidance.","Travis Marquette","In terms of ladies comp, we wouldn't get into specifics of that \u2013 in terms of providing specifics","Michael Hartshorn","What I would say on the comp, though, obviously, we were up against \u2013 we went from a 2% to 3%, but we're up against a 5%. So, on a multi-year basis, there was acceleration across the division.","Paul Lejuez","Got it. And then can you just remind us, the issue of ladies is that a dd's issue as well or just Ross?","Barbara Rentler","Just Ross.","Paul Lejuez","Got you. Thanks. Good luck, guys.","Operator","I will now turn the call back over to Barbara Rentler for closing remarks.","Barbara Rentler","Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores. Have a great day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

The call will begin with prepared comments by management followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectation about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts and other matters that are based on the company's current forecast of aspects of its future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today's press release and the company's fiscal 2011 Form 10-K and fiscal 2012 Form 8-Ks on file with the SEC.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Michael Balmuth, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.","Michael Balmuth","Good morning. Joining me on our call today are Norman Ferber, Chairman of the Board; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Bobbi Chaville, Senior Director, Investor Relations.","We will begin with a brief review of our first quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year. We'll conclude with some comments about our longer-term growth prospects. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.","We are pleased with our much better-than-expected financial results in the first quarter. Our robust sales and earnings were driven mainly by our ongoing ability to deliver a wide array of fresh and exciting name-brand bargains to today's value-focused consumers. In addition, we believe that favorable weather across many of our markets also contributed to our above-planned performance. Our ability to operate our business with lower in-store inventories and strictly controlled expenses also continued to enhance both sales and profit margins.","Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended April 28, 2012 were $0.93, up from a split-adjusted $0.74 in the prior year. These results represent a 26% increase on top of a 28% gain in the same period last year. Net earnings for the 2012 first quarter grew 21% to $208.6 million. Sales rose 14% to $2,357,000,000, with comparable store sales up 9% on top of 3% growth in the first quarter of 2011. Merchandise and geographic trends were broad-based. Juniors and Accessories were the best-performing categories, while Florida remained the top region.","Earnings before interest and taxes grew to a record 14.4% of sales, up about 70 basis points on top of an exceptional 160-basis point increase in the prior year. Our improved profit margin versus last year was driven primarily by leverage on expenses from the strong gains in same-store sales and higher merchandise gross margin. John will provide some additional color on these operating margin trends in a few minutes.","As we entered the first quarter, total consolidated inventories declined about 3% compared to the prior year, mainly due to lower packaway levels that were about 45% of total inventories, down from 48% at this time last year. More importantly, average in-store inventory declined about 9%. For the balance of the year, we are targeting a mid-single-digit percentage decrease in selling store inventories compared to 2011.","Like Ross, dd's is also benefiting from our ability to flow a larger percentage of fresh product to our stores by operating on lower inventory levels. dd's above-planned sales and margin in the first quarter reflect that its merchandise offerings continue to resonate well with its value-focused customers. Our store expansion program is on track, with a total of about 80 locations scheduled to open during 2012, comprised of 60 Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS.","Now John will provide further color on our first quarter results and details on our second quarter 2012 guidance.","John G. Call","Thank you, Michael. Our 9% comparable store sales gain in the first quarter was driven by mid-single-digit growth in the number of transactions, combined with the low-single-digit increase in the size of the average basket. Again, operating margin grew by about 70 basis points in the quarter to 14.4%. Leverage on the robust 9% comparable store sales gain drove a 55 basis point reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses, while cost of goods sold as a percent of sales was 15 basis points lower than the prior year.","Merchandise margin grew by 35 basis points, including 10 basis points from a lower shrink accrual, while occupancy expenses levered by about 20 basis points. These favorable trends more than offset higher distribution costs of 20 basis points related to packaway timing and 10-basis point increases each in freight and buying cost. The 55 basis points of improved SG&A was driven mainly by lower store expenses as a percent of sales.","During the first quarter, we repurchased 2 million shares for a total purchase price of $111 million. We remain on track to buy back a total of $450 million in common stock during fiscal 2012 to complete the 2-year $900 million program authorized in early 2011.","Let's turn now to our second quarter guidance. For the 13 weeks ending July 28, 2012, we now are targeting in-store sales to increase 3% to 4% on top of a 5% gain in the prior year. Second quarter 2012 earnings per share are forecast to be in the range of $0.72 to $0.75. This represents projected EPS growth of 13% to 17% on top of a 20% increase in the prior --  in the second quarter of 2011.","Our second quarter 2012 EPS targets are based on the following assumptions: Total sales are expected to grow about 8% to 9%, driven by a combination of new store growth and as I just mentioned, same-store sales  are forecast to be up 3% to 4%. We plan to open about 28 net new stores during the period, including 21 Ross Dress for Less and 7 dd's DISCOUNTS. Comparable store sales are forecast to increase 4% to 5% in May, 3% to 4% in June and 2% to 3% in July. Last year, same-store sales rose 4%, 5% and 7% in May, June and July, respectively.","We are targeting operating margin of 11.9% to 12.1% for the 2012 second quarter, up 20 to 40 basis points from 11.7% in last year's second quarter. An increase in merchandise gross margin, combined with leverage on selling, general and administrative cost, is projected to drive the operating margin improvement. Net interest expense is planned to be approximately $2 million, and our tax rate is expected to be about 39%. We also estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding of about 224 million.","Now I'll turn the call back to Michael.","Michael Balmuth","Thank you, John. As noted in today's press release, we are raising our 2012 guidance, with earnings per share for the 53 weeks ending February 7, 2013 now forecast to be in the range of $3.26 to $3.37. This compares to our prior guidance of $3.12 to $3.27 and earnings per share of $2.86 in fiscal 2011. The 53rd week in 2012 is projected to add about $0.08 to $0.09 to earnings per share.","We are confident in our ability to meet these targets for a couple of reasons. First, we remain well positioned in the off-price space in the current retail environment. Equally important is our strong belief that we can continue to diligently execute the most critical strategic initiatives of our business. These include ongoing investments in our merchandise organization, further reductions to inventories in our stores and our continuing efforts to fine-tune and implement systems and processes that strengthen our ability to get the right merchandise to the right store at the right time.","In addition, we are pleased to report that our accelerated growth into new markets for Ross Dress for Less remains on plan. We initially entered Illinois last October with 12 stores in the greater Chicago area, followed by openings in Arkansas and Missouri. During the balance of 2012, we expect to add more locations in these 3 states while also entering Kansas, Kentucky and Indiana for the first time.","We also are now even more bullish about our total expansion prospects over the longer term. As noted in today's press release, we have increased our long-term projected store potential to 2,500 locations in the United States. Our current in-depth research and proven ability to cluster stores closer together indicate that we can more fully saturate existing and new markets. As a result, we currently believe that Ross Dress for Less can grow to approximately 2,000 locations across the country, up from our prior target of 1,500. We also continue to project that dd's DISCOUNTS can become a chain of about 500 stores. Combined, this means we have the ability, over time, to more than double the size of our company domestically, an exciting prospect.","At this point, we would like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Michael, I'm wondering what analysis, if you could share with us, you performed to assess the real potential of Ross Stores. And obviously, we can look at the map and the geographical exposure and see there's so much more potential here in the United States. But maybe you could just share with us a bit of the analysis behind how you determine the long-term potential for your store base and what was it that in particular drove the update to guidance today. That would be great.","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Kimberly, it's Michael O'Sullivan. I'll answer that question. There are really 2 sets of things that we did. The first was we looked at the market that we currently operate in, in terms of number of stores per population, and we looked at broader demographics in terms of in our target customer and how many of our target customer are within each market. And then, we tried to make an assessment of what the real estate opportunities would be in each market. And then, we built it up, so bottom-up market by market to come up with sort of the updated estimate, which, as Michael described, went from 1,500 stores to 2,000. The other point I would make though is we also -- we've taken a look at the success that we've had over the last several years in some of our newer markets, the Southeast and the mid-Atlantic that, again, that gave us confidence in terms of some of the density estimates that we've used to come up with the assessment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez from Nomura.","Paul Lejuez - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Just wondering when you look at the Chicago market and the 12 stores that you opened in Illinois, how many are hitting plan versus above plan? And I guess, I'm just wondering given that, that market tends to be a little bit more weather-sensitive than some of your other regions, how do you feel you guys did in terms of getting that right product in those stores at the right time?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","So Paul, as Michael mentioned, we opened 14 stores in October in new markets. 12 of those were in Chicago, and then we opened another 4 in new markets this past March. And so far, I mean, I would caution you, it's still pretty early. I mean, those stores have been opened 6 or 7 months. But so far, we're pretty happy with how the openings have gone. And I'm basing that not just in terms of sales, but also all of the customer research that we've done and feedback that we've had from the customers. So we're pretty happy with how those stores have gone so far. I think the more important point is everything we see in terms of what we've learned in that market sort of reinforces, for us, that we're going to be successful in those new markets long term. So we're feeling pretty good. The final aspect of your question, have we learned anything or seen anything in terms of were there patterns or assortment issues, nothing out of the ordinary. I think we've planned the market pretty well. We feel pretty happy about our plans. Now, there are some tweaks we're going to make to the assortments, but nothing different than what we would do with most new stores. But I think we're pretty happy with how things are going.","Michael Balmuth","And in terms of a great -- you asked about how we assess our assortments, right, give us a good -- okay, we see a lot of opportunity to keep improving there based on learnings that we've gotten so far, both statistically and visually.","Paul Lejuez - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Got you. And how many of the 500 incremental Ross stores should we look at as being fill-in and more part of a cluster strategy, as opposed to new markets?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","The break -- I think we need to go back and look at that breakout, Paul, in terms of which are in existing markets versus which are in new. So let us take a look at that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Patel with Bank of America.","Rick B. Patel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So packaway inventories declined on a year-over-year basis as a percentage of total inventory and in dollars. So can you just help us think about the implications of that? Are you seeing less compelling product in the marketplace than you did versus last year? Does it have to do with changes in product cost? And then, how do you expect the packaway inventories to trend as we go through the year?","Michael Balmuth","It's hard to say how they'll really trend through the year just based upon opportunities. We're seeing buying opportunities that are actually improving significantly as we move through the season. Part of the reason our packaway level is a little below last year is we're, so far, exceeding our sales plans that we've pulled some of that forward into our stores. So I think and some of the product also that might have went to packaway has flowed directly to our stores now. So packaway, keep in mind is some of the best product that we can buy and is close outs. And we expect, based on market conditions that we're seeing at certain levels of retailing, that there's going to be a sizable amount of product, and we're seeing that bust open at this point.","Rick B. Patel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And then, a question on your longer-term real estate targets, can you just drill down a little bit and talk about how much -- how many of these locations are A quality versus B and C? And then how should we think about the sales productivity and 4-wall margins of these stores that you can build out over the outer years?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","On the first part about breaking out by type of real estate, very hard for us to predict. Obviously, in order to make the cut, in order to sort of be included in our assessment, these would have to be locations that we believe we'd be successful in. Sorry, what was the second part of that, apart from the real estate ratings?","Rick B. Patel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, how should we think about sales productivity and 4-wall margins of your incremental stores as you think about the longer-term time horizon?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Sure, we would expect these stores, over the long term -- obviously, in our first few years, they take a few years to ramp up. But over the long term, we'd expect them to sort of hit our corporate targets and sort of be in line with sort of what we have today.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Klinefelter from Piper Jaffray.","Jeffrey P. Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Michael, I just had a question on some of the product trends. I mean, Juniors and Accessories standing out as top-performing, I think that's great and in some cases, in contrast to some of the other kind of moderate department stores' own trend. Just curious if that's -- any other context around it or any other detail around it? Tops versus bottoms, are you seeing it broad-based across those categories? And specifically on color, I think we're all hearing about color driving business right now in fashion and some others are kind of caught behind and chasing that color product. Just curious given your packaway business model, how you're dealing with that kind of quickly up-trending product category.","Michael Balmuth","Okay. Well, color is the key fashion component this season. And in our business, when we really want to get current in color, something like that, that really is done in more upfront product rather than packaway. It wasn't there last year. And in all likelihood, we probably would not be buying into that for packaway for 2 reasons: one, it would be less available; and two, it would be more risky. Of course, the successful colors today aren't necessarily going to be the right ones for next spring when you have the fashion shift that we're going through. So the color is driving the business in the areas you said and beyond in the store.","Jeffrey P. Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then, in terms of just keeping up with that and potentially chasing it into -- all the way through the summer, eventually into fall, that's something that you feel very comfortable you can keep up with, with upfront buys in your current market?","Michael Balmuth","To a degree, to a degree, okay? Those -- so where we've seen the fashion trends early enough and we're able to buy into it, the answer is obviously yes, and there are certain pockets where we didn't. Remember, the market is -- on color, there's a certain level of clothes out that are available, and it's probably not enough to fill everyone's pipeline. So we think we'll have an adequate level, okay? It's probably the best way to answer it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Evren Kopelman from Wells Fargo.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask about -- what's impressive is your ability to run your stores and comp positively with the lower inventory levels. Can you talk about what kind of changes you have made so far in your supply chain and distribution? Is there further investments you need to make to continue with the strategy?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Evren, it's Michael O'Sullivan. In terms of additional investments, I think we've mentioned before that over the next few years, we expect to open up a couple of major additional distribution centers to keep pace with our growth. So that's the forward-looking piece. In terms of the changes we've made over the last 5 or 6 years, we've made a number of adjustments to how we process goods in our DCs and how we flow those goods from the DCs to the stores to try and speed up that process and get that in-transit time down as low as possible. And I think that certainly contributed to our ability to carry that inventory in the stores.","Michael Balmuth","I would also add that the investment in dollars and processes and people that we put in place in planning at a more localized level also has helped to make our ability to turn our merchandise faster and have the right product in the right store at the right time possible.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adrianne Shapira from Goldman Sachs.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was just wondering -- I mean, we obviously saw a clear step function, higher in your comp growth this quarter to the 9% range. I'm just wondering if you could shed some light what you're seeing out there on the competitive landscape. Clearly, we're seeing some share shifts across the mid-tier department stores -- what you're seeing, and is there anything that you can read where you're getting a disproportionate share in terms of overlap with some key competitors?","Michael Balmuth","I think that overlap of share is hard for us to quantify. I think we're fortunate in our performance that we had for the first quarter. Certainly, weather aided us and as you said, some shifts that are going on in the mid-tier. We think about this, although it's hard to quantify.","Michael B. O'Sullivan","The one thing for sure, with a 9% comp we're obviously -- we are pulling in customers. We're pulling in business from someone. But as Michael said, it's hard for us to give you a breakout of where that's coming from.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then, just following on that, given that there does seem to be some shifting in the competitive landscape, what, if anything, are you seeing in terms of the pricing structure? Are you seeing a more intense, progressive response as everyone is looking to grab some of that available share?","Michael Balmuth","I think pricing is pretty aggressive out there. I think it's a fairly promotional time frame. I don't -- I think people are, as you said, trying to grab share from -- and trying to position themselves in the shifts that are going on.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And so then the follow-on to that is, given that aggressive environment, how do you think about merchandise margins going forward for the remainder of the year?","John G. Call","So we'd look to take our inventories down probably in the single-digit stature, and that should help us with turn and clearance balances, so you'll see a positive there. I'd also remind everyone that in the third quarter over the past several years, we have had nice baskets from our shrink results. We haven't planned any such benefit this year over and above our accruals. So having said that, those 2 elements for the remainder of the year -- for the year would see our gross margins being flattish. Merchandise margins being flattish, assuming we don't do better in shrink than we have planned.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laura Champine from Canaccord Genuity.","Laura A. Champine - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","I just had a question about the timing of the disclosure that you have more square footage opportunity than we'd previously thought. And also, Michael, you mentioning the new states where you're operating, should we be thinking about a step-up in the percentage growth for your store units as we move into 2013 and beyond?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","So Laura, I mean, right now there's 2 pieces. So in terms of the store potential that Michael referenced, the 1,500 stores to 2,000 stores. Obviously, that's our long-term potential, and we look at that periodically. And based upon a number of factors over the last few years, we felt that it was appropriate to raise that number. Now there's a separate issue which you're referencing, which is our unit count growth or our store count growth. And that's been running at around about 6% to 7% per year, so about 70 stores -- 70 new stores a year, which is what we'll open this year. And again, separately, we look at that periodically, and from time to time, we'd watch if we hit. I think it's unlikely that we'd make any radical changes to that number. For your modeling process, it's unlikely that, that would change radically. But it's certainly possible that it would get tweaked over time. But those 2 things are separate assumptions, separate issues.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Mann with Johnson Rice.","David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","In terms of the dd's performance, can you update any details of how they're doing and what kind of contribution we should expect this year?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Sure. So David, as you know, dd's has been fairly profitable for the last couple of years, it's been accretive to our earnings. And dd's in 2011 saw a pretty significant increase in profitability. dd's has benefited from a similar approach to what we've taken at Ross in terms of lowering inventory levels and using that to drive margins and drive sales. So given that improved profitability, we've seen that continue into Q1, and we expect dd's contribution to continue to improve in 2012.","David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","And John, the distribution cost issue tied to packaway, how should we think about that in the guidance for the rest of the year?","John G. Call","So we had a 20-basis point exposure in the first quarter based on the packaway timing. As we look to the year, we see costs being relatively flat, and we don't see -- again, if packaway comes in as planned, although we're optimistic about what those levels might be. But if it comes in as we have it planned, we see really no impact in any significant quarter throughout the year.","David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","And in -- one last question on freight costs, do you now expect that to delever this year?","John G. Call","Slightly. So we're up against some headwinds in freight. Fuel is up a bit. First quarter, we had some mix issues. But I think we've got some slight headwinds in freight.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marni Shapiro with The Retail Tracker.","Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker","If you could just -- I believe you mentioned that the basket was up. I was just curious if you're seeing that more in units or if its cost per unit -- the number of units or cost per unit. And if you can just talk a little bit about traffic. Are you seeing your core consumer come in more frequently? Or are you still seeing new customers come into the store?","Michael Balmuth","In terms of the first piece of that, Marni, we're seeing actually the basket of the FG [ph] in retails are up a little bit, but most of it is -- the preponderance of it is based on traffic.","Michael B. O'Sullivan","And in terms of the traffic itself, Marni, it's a mix. It's new customers and existing customers that are coming to the store more often or spending more when they come to the store.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Jaffe from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just as a follow-on, obviously, margins are improving despite a little bit of a decline in the packaway, your best business, as you described it, your highest margin merchandise category. And so I'm wondering what's changed in your buying methodology or what you see different in the marketplace that's helping you fuel some significant improvement in the merchandise margins, not only good but even better to offset some of the costs on the freight buying side.","Michael Balmuth","I'm not -- could you repeat that question?","Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Why are the merchandise margins up so much?","Michael Balmuth","That would be good bargain.","John G. Call","I think, also, Richard, inventories were down, turns are faster. So clearance is down and we had lower markdowns. So that trend has continued, and we expect it will continue in the future. As it relates to packaway, as Michael alluded to, we were chasing a nice comp in the quarter, so we used some of that packaway to chase back to that comp. Our philosophy around packaway hasn't changed.","Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I understand, it just -- it means that your buying was even better. And I'm just trying to understand at what end of the equation was it better, in the marketplace or in the stores, the faster turns.","Michael Balmuth","It's a combination.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Roxanne Meyer from UBS.","Roxanne Meyer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A couple of questions. I'm just curious, Juniors has been strong for a while now, and I'm just wondering if the spread has been widening lately between Juniors and some of your other categories. Or have you seen pretty much broad-based strength in your recent comp acceleration? And then, as it relates to your expansion strategy, are there any major markets included now that weren't there before? And do you have any plans to change average store size?","Michael Balmuth","Juniors has been strong for a while, and its distance from other business is relatively constant.","Michael B. O'Sullivan","And then in terms of expansion markets. The answer to your question is no, there's no additional markets that weren't there before. I mean, we're in -- we're currently in 29 states. As you can imagine, to get to the 2,000 stores that Michael described as our sort of estimated full potential, we have a plan to sort of over time expand into additional markets and additional states. But there's no real change to, I guess, that sequence in terms of which markets we're moving to first. And then in terms of the average store size, we frequently look at average store size, and we actually prefer [ph] to be flexible based upon real estate availability about store size that we'll take. But no major changes to average store size at this point.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Mark Montagna from Avondale Partners.","Mark K. Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","I've got 2 questions. Was wondering, regarding demographics, are you seeing any changes in terms of your customer demographic with regard to age and income? And then also, with the 2,000 store count, does that include any expansion towards more rural-type locations?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Sure. So Mark, in terms of demographics, we slice and dice our business all the time by demographic: age, income, ethnicity, et cetera. No real call-outs there. I think we're pretty happy with how we're doing across various demographic segments. What all of our customers have in common is they love a bargain, no matter what the demographics are. And consequently, our business has been driven -- has been broad based in terms of the customer mix. The second part of your question in terms of getting to the 2,000 store count potential, I would say that the mix of urban and rural stores would be much the same as it is for our chain at the moment. I mean, we're not -- it doesn't represent any kind of [indiscernible] in terms of that mix to get to the full potential.","Mark K. Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Again, by rural, what I'm talking about is more taking a step further out in your normal geography. So you're not taking any further step out to smaller towns than is normal?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","There's no assumption of that in the estimates that we've given, no.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Tunick with JPMorgan.","Brian J. Tunick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Two questions. I guess, was curious if you could maybe talk about the differences in the 4-wall margins between the dd's and Ross and sort of what would be the differences in margin there. And then, maybe also on the third quarter, are you guys updating your guidance at all on how you think the shrink will play out given how strong your inventory turns and your above-planned sales have been here in Q1?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Sure. On the dd's piece, Brian, dd's 4-wall contribution is very similar at a store level to Ross, and let me define 4-wall contribution as strictly 4-wall, gross margin, less store-related expenses. When you do that math for a dd's store and you do that math for a Ross store, you end up with a very similar number.","John G. Call","And Brian, as it relates to Q3 and quite frankly, the back half of the year, we would typically update that and review that with our second quarter earnings call when we have more visibility in that period.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick McKeever from MKM Partners.","Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Understanding that it is difficult to say where the market share gains are coming from, are you seeing stronger sales at stores that are located near a Penney store or in markets where Penney's has more stores?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","So Patrick, I think that's a good question. So that is something we've looked at. I go back to a point we were talking about a moment ago. With a 9% comp, we know we're taking share from somewhere. As we've looked at where it's coming from -- so think about the retail market, your power retail market, is it's very fragmented from a competitive point of view, so the customer has lots of choices, lots of places they can shop for value. So we know if we deliver value to the customers, we'll draw shoppers. We'll draw customers from a range of different retailers. To answer your question, as we've looked at our stores that are near a J.C. Penney or near other mid-tier stores, they're doing very well. So we also look at our stores that aren't near J.C. Penney and they're doing very well, too. So it's hard for us to give you an exclusive answer in terms of quantifying where we're getting our share gains. Suffice to say that with a 9% comp, they're coming from somewhere.","Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Have you or do you plan to do -- to make any adjustments in your marketing to pick up more share or to go more aggressively after those customers?","Michael Balmuth","No. Our marketing position is just working.","Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","And then, just a second quick one, product costs. I mean, we're hearing from other retailers about some declines they're looking into the back half of the year, maybe in the mid-single-digit area. I mean, is that consistent? Are you seeing any -- that same kind of dynamic? I mean does that...","Michael Balmuth","Of course, in many categories, not all. And in some cases, it can be a little better than that; other cases, not quite as much. I mean, labor costs are going up. Much of our product is going up. In some cases, that mitigates some of it. So it's a little bit of a mixed bag, but we are seeing some modest improvement.","Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","And you would view that as favorable to your model?","Michael Balmuth","No. Remember, we price off -- we have to price off of how mainstream retailers are pricing. So if they drop their prices accordingly, then it really doesn't mean much for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","You mentioned in the new store targets you're talking about that some of the stores are going to be put closer together. How are you modeling -- or size of stores, sales productivity of stores, how should we think about the breakeven cost to open stores in this new prototype for both concepts?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Dana, in terms of getting to that 2,000 store potential, we actually haven't made an assumption that stores will necessarily be denser in that style. What we've done is we've looked at places where we don't have stores or places where we have opportunity to backfill [ph] stores. And based upon what we already know in terms of how many Ross Stores a certain market can support and based on what we already know about Ross store volumes and the possibility of those stores, that's how we built up the 2,000. We haven't stretched it out and said can we load in even more stores than we currently operate in certain markets or can we achieve sales productivity levels that we don't currently achieve. We've really modeled it on what we've already achieved in terms of individual store performance. And then as I said, we looked at places where we don't have stores or places where we know we have backfill [ph] opportunities for additional stores.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Is there a time frame to get to this number?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Well, we have approximately 1,100 stores right now. Given that our pace of new store growth is around 70 stores a year, to get to 2,000, it's a long way off before we would -- before we hit that potential.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Hofkin from William Blair & Company.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I guess just one follow-up question to, I think, Brian's question about the guidance. Taking up the full year guidance by, I think, roughly $0.03 additional above and beyond what you beat the first quarter by from your original guidance, is that primarily just with a strong visibility here early in the second quarter? Or is there something else that's playing into that? That would be my first question.","John G. Call","Sure. So we guided the year to 1 to 2 comp. With our first quarter results and our anticipated second quarter comp, that would put the year to 3 to 4 comp. So it's really a function of first quarter results and our anticipated second quarter results that is informing us on what the total year may look like.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And with regard to margins and product costs and your comment earlier about the promotional pricing environment, are you seeing that -- you described it as intense, are you seeing it as more intense than, I guess, the preholiday period last year?","Michael Balmuth","No, no, no. Preholiday last year was a whole another world, okay? This is more intense than a year ago at this time.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","When I say preholiday, I guess, I mean prior to the fourth quarter of last year in other words.","Michael Balmuth","It's a little more intense than that, yes. Yes.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. But you feel like from a product -- given that you need to price on a relative basis compared to full price, do you feel like on a relative basis the product cost picture, the procurement cost is favorable enough that the spread is neutral, would you say? Or how would you describe that?","Michael Balmuth","It's neutral to favorable.","Operator","I'm showing there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn it back over for any closing comments.","Michael Balmuth","Thank you, all, for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores, and have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

The call will begin with prepared comments by management followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions]","Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts and other matters that are based on the company's current forecast of aspects of its future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today's press release and the company's fiscal 2017 Form 10-K and fiscal 2018 Form 8-K's on file with the SEC.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer.","Barbara Rentler","Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Group Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Vice President of Investor Relations. We'll begin our call today with a review of our first quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.","As noted in today's press release, despite unfavorable weather throughout the period, we achieved above-plan growth in both sales and earnings in the first quarter. Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended May 5, 2018 were $1.11, up from $0.82 for the 13 weeks ended April 29, 2017. Net earnings were $418 million, up from $321 million in the prior year. These earnings per share results include a $0.17 per share benefit from recently enacted tax legislation and a $.02 per share benefit from the favorable timing of packaway-related cost that we expect to reverse in subsequent quarters.","Total sales for the quarter increased 9% to $3.6 billion. Comparable store sales for the 13 weeks ended May 5, 2018 rose 3% over the 13-week period ended May 6, 2017. This growth compares to a same-store sales gain of 3% for the 13 weeks ended April 29, 2017. We estimate that unfavorable weather throughout the quarter reduced our comparable store sales by over 1%.","For the first quarter, the strongest merchandize category at Ross was men, while geographic trends were very broad-based when normalized for weather. Operating margin for the period of 15.1% was down slightly from the prior year as an improvement in merchandize gross margins and favorable timing of packaway-related expenses were offset by higher freight costs and wage-related investments.","As we ended the first quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 19% over the prior year, mainly due to higher packaway levels as our buyers were able to take advantage of numerous opportunities in the marketplace. Average in-store inventories are up 2% as planned, due to an earlier Mother's Day this year. While packaway as a percentage of total inventories was 49% compared to 46% last year.","We are also pleased to report that dd's DISCOUNTS delivered another quarter of solid growth in sales and operating profit. Our store expansion program is on schedule with the addition of 23 new Ross and six dd's DISCOUNTS locations in the first quarter. We remain on track to open a total of approximately 100 locations in 2018, comprised of 75 Ross and 25 dd's DISCOUNTS. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores.","Now, Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our first quarter results and details on our second quarter guidance.","Michael Hartshorn","Thank you, Barbara. Let's start with our first quarter results. Our 3% comparable store sales gain was driven by higher traffic and an increase in the size of the average basket. First quarter operating margin of 15.1% was down five basis points from last year.","Cost of goods sold improved 20 basis points in the quarter driven by 30 basis points of higher merchandize margin, and distribution cost that declined by 15 basis points mainly due to previously-mentioned favorable timing of packaway-related expense. Occupancy also levered by 15 basis points. These gains were partially offset by a 20 basis point increase in freight cost and 20 basis points in higher buying expenses.","Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the period increased 25 basis points mainly due to higher wage-related costs. During the first quarter, we repurchased 3.3 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $255 million. We remain on track to buy back a total of $1.075 billion in stock for the year.","Let's turn now to our second quarter guidance. For the 13 weeks ending August 4, 2018, we are forecasting same store sales to increase 1% to 2% over the 13 weeks ended August 5, 2017. Earnings per share for the second quarter are projected to be in the range of $0.95 to $0.99, which includes the benefit from lower taxes.","The operating statement assumptions for our second quarter guidance include the following. Total sales are projected to grow 5% to 6%. We expect to open 30 new stores during the period, including 22 Ross and eight dd's DISCOUNTS locations. If same store sales are in line with our guidance, then we project operating margin to be in the range of 13.3% to 13.5%. The forecasted decline from last year's 14.9% reflects the unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs, as well as our previously-announced wage and benefit investments. We expect net interest income of about $900,000. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% to 25%, and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be above 375 million.","Based on our first quarter results and second quarter guidance, we now project earnings per share for the 52 weeks ending February 2, 2019 to be in the range of $3.92 to $4.05, compared to $3.55 for the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2018. As a reminder, our fiscal 2018 guidance includes the benefit from lower taxes. In addition, last year's 53rd week added approximately $0.10 to earnings per share for 2017.","Now, I will turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments.","Barbara Rentler","Thank you, Michael. To sum up, despite unfavorable weather throughout the period, both first quarter sales and earnings per share outperformed our plan. Looking ahead, we expect the retail landscape, both brick-and-mortar and online to remain very competitive throughout 2018. In addition, we face robust multi-year sales comparisons as the year progresses.","With that said, we remain confident in the strength of the off-price sector and ongoing ability to perform well in this space. Our focus will remain on offering customers the outstanding values they have come to expect, which has allowed us to achieve profitable growth in sales, earnings, and market share over time.","At this point, we would like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Boss from JPMorgan. Go ahead please. Your line is open.","Matthew Boss","Great, thanks. On gross margin, can you speak to drivers of the 30 basis points of merchandize margins in the first quarter? Any change in freight? And then just larger picture, if we look through tax reform this year, I guess has anything changed with your double-digit bottom line algorithm if you are able to drive the 3% to 4% comp?","Michael Hartshorn","Sure. So, Matt, it's Michael Hartshorn. Let me answer those in pieces. On merchandize margin, as we mentioned in the comments, those were up 30 basis points in Q1. That was driven by better buying. In addition, we benefited from a very clean inventory position entering the quarter.","In terms of freight costs, freight has been a headwind for over a year. Our outlook has not changed. A number of factors are contributing to the increase. Like others, we had seen significant increases in market rates due to a very tight capacity. This capacity seems to be driven by driver shortages, impacts of increased regulation, and perhaps the stronger economy. In addition, diesel fuel costs were up about 20% from last year in the quarter. So we expect freight to be a headwind for the remainder of the year, and that is reflected in our guidance.","On your last question, certainly this year reflects the benefit of tax reform. Our current guidance reflects the 10% to 14% EPS growth that includes about a $0.69 benefit from tax reform. Going beyond this year, there is nothing that's changed our long-term model.","Matthew Boss","Great. Best of luck, I\u2019ll see you next week.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Tunick from RBC. Go ahead please. Your line is open.","Brian Tunick","Great, thanks. Good afternoon. I guess, curious as we sat here on the Northeast with all the - I guess the nor'easters to hear you guys talk about unfavorable weather, can you maybe give us a little more clarity on sort of what markets, was it just year-over-year in some of your key markets, just give us a little more color on the weather issues. And then curious on the packaway inventory growth, if you can give us a better sense of maybe what categories, or just a good\/better\/best situation, just give us a better feel for the packaway inventory growth? Thank you very much.","Michael O'Sullivan","Sure, Brian. On weather, as we've said in our remarks, we estimate the impact to overall chain was about -- was over 1%. For us, every major region actually had negative weather comparisons during the quarter, with one exception, that was the Pacific Northwest. So the areas as you can imagine that were impacted the most included the Mid-Atlantic and also the Midwest.","Barbara Rentler","And then as it pertains to packaway, what I would say to you is that there's an abundance of merchandize in the marketplace. So we were able to take advantage of those opportunities, and they're pretty broad-based in terms of different types of products, so it isn't just one classification. And I think the merchants have been out there in the market looking to see what's available, and felt that the timing was right to buy those goods as you know that's a big part of their job.","Brian Tunick","And will there be any implications for the back half regarding packaway or distribution expenses?","Michael Hartshorn","In terms of distribution expenses what we did -- so we had a $0.02 benefit in the first quarter based on how we capitalize packaway cost, and we'd expect that to reverse and be a negative impact over the remainder of the year.","Brian Tunick","Great, thanks very much, and good luck.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America. Go ahead please. Your line is open.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you. Good afternoon. Can you talk a little bit about the composition of the comp, how much of that was traffic versus basket, and what drove the basket increase?","Michael Hartshorn","Sure, Lorraine. As we mentioned in our prepared remarks, the 2% comp was driven by higher traffic and an increase in the size of the average basket. The higher basket was primarily driven by higher units per transaction with AUR was down slightly, and the decrease in AUR was driven by mix of business.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley. Go ahead please. Your line is open.","Kimberly Greenberger","Great, thank you so much. I wanted to just ask about the SG&A de-leverage, 25 basis points, obviously I think your guidance this year includes some ongoing de-leverage. Is there any guidance you have sort of on a quarter-by-quarter basis? How we should think about that? And then I just wanted to follow-up on the weather question. Could we assume that you are seeing some pick up here in May assuming that weather has normalized so far here in Q2? Thank you so much.","Michael Hartshorn","Sure, Kimberly. On SG&A, the 25 basis point increase reflects a couple of different things. It's the lapping of market-based increase, the wage increases that we made last year, as well as the impact of statutory increases that included California increasing to $11 in January. It also includes a piece of wage investments that we are making this year.","Our guidance for the remainder of the year would include further de-leverage as the year progresses as a result of the associate investments we announced at the beginning of the year, which includes going to $11 throughout the company, payment of one-time bonuses, and also improvements to our paid leave programs. And then in terms of weather, beyond the quarter our practice is not to comment about post-quarter trends.","Kimberly Greenberger","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo. Go ahead please. Your line is open.","Ike Boruchow","Hi, good afternoon everyone. I'm not sure who wants to take this question, but you guys have talked a little bit over the past couple of quarters around the beauty category becoming more of an opportunity for you to buy into. Any updates there on that category specifically to Q1, and then just updated thoughts as you move forward?","Barbara Rentler","Sure. The beauty category has been a growing category for everyone as the market has shifted around a lot. We feel good about beauty category, and you know ourselves as well as many other people in the industry feel that it's an opportunity as the market itself is shifting from department stores to other sectors.","Ike Boruchow","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank. Go ahead please. Your line is open.","Paul Trussell","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking our question. Just on the second quarter guidance, I believe you outlined EBIT rates in 13.3% to 13.5% range or so, which are -- down 140, 150 basis points or so at the midpoint year-over-year. Can you just kind of rank or quantify for us to what extent that contraction is wages versus freight versus the packaway expenses in 2Q, and any other puts and takes we should be mindful of?","Michael Hartshorn","Sure. On the components, we wouldn't break down the specific levels, but I will repeat, I think what you just said is there is three main drivers. Most importantly the wage and benefit investments, a portion of those will happen in the second quarter, so actually the de-leverage will increase as we progress through the year. So that's the first main impact in the second quarter. It also includes as we mentioned the negative impact of timing of packaway-related costs and freight will continue to be a headwind for us.","Paul Trussell","Okay, thank you. Best of luck.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez from Citigroup. Go ahead please. Your line is open.","Paul Lejuez","Hey, thanks guys. Going back to the traffic first ticket question, curious if you saw any difference in the Ross business versus dd's on those metrics? And then secondly, also curious if you track how your performance is at centers where you are co-located with another off price, if you can maybe share how those stores of yours are performing in the co-located locations with the TJ concept or Burlington versus those that are there in the separate center? Thanks.","Michael Hartshorn","Sure. I would say the dd's and Ross, they were proportional in terms of mix of transaction, AUR, traffic et cetera. On the - we're co-locating about a third of our chain with either TJ Maxx Marshalls or Burlington and those stores preformed in line with the rest of the chain.","Paul Lejuez","Thanks. Any comment on home versus apparel during the quarter?","Michael Hartshorn","Overall non-apparel was slightly above apparel, given the weather.","Paul Lejuez","Got it. Thanks. Good luck guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen from Cowen & Company. Go ahead please. Your line is open.","Oliver Chen","Hi. On the gross margin line, the buying expenses, do you expect that trend to continue? And what was underlying some of that? Also as you think ahead, particularly in the all the opportunities available in non-apparel businesses such as home, what are your thoughts about the opportunity you have ahead and how you can seek to maximize your store space as you look at different, new opportunities where customers still value in other categories? Thank you.","Michael O'Sullivan","Oliver, on buying, expenses can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. In the first quarter, there was some, I would say negative timing impact, but it also reflects mainly that we are going to make ongoing investments in the buying organization.","Barbara Rentler","And as it pertains to opportunities in non-apparel areas such as some, actually, Oliver, we think that our opportunities are very broad-based in addition to come in the entire box. So in terms of maximizing space in the stores, we really decide what businesses we want to drive, and then we figure out how it fits within the box.","Oliver Chen","Got it. So which businesses do you want to drive?","Barbara Rentler","Well, I think on this call I really wouldn't be saying which businesses we want to drive, I would just leave it with you know, it's broad-based, it's not just focused on winning.","Oliver Chen","Got it. Best regards.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marni Shapiro from Retail Tracker. Go ahead please. Your line is open.","Marni Shapiro","Hey, guys. I had a quick question about the size of the business. Historically this has always been a business you guys have done well with and you've had in your stores forever and there's quite a buzz around the business right now. So I'm curious just, you know, how it's done for you, are you finding availability starting to be more plentiful or easier to find and what you're thinking strategically about the business?","Barbara Rentler","Sizes business, Marni, you mean like woman's special prices\u2026","Marni Shapiro","Exactly. And even on the men's side, the big and tall business on the men's side as well?","Barbara Rentler","Sure. Listen, woman's world are plus sizes in the United States is a total growing business. So I think in apparel it's certainly an opportunity. In terms of availability, right now there's just a lot of availability, pretty much most classifications of products. So supply was pretty plentiful -- so supply is pretty actually supply. So from that perspective, there would be merchandize out there. In terms of opportunity, we grow as the customer base of what the customer is telling us, and those are the businesses that we go after.","Marni Shapiro","Fantastic, that's great. And there is any reason to believe that merchandize margins will be we pressured? I know you have headwinds as far as wages and freight costs and things like that, but there is a lot of availability in merchandize. It seems like generally the environment while competitive isn't in fire sell mode. So, is there any reason to believe merchandize margin shouldn't be okay rest of the year?","Michael Hartshorn","It's our guidance assumes that merchant margins are relatively flat\u2026","Marni Shapiro","All right, thanks guys. Best of luck.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laura Champine from Roe Capital. Go ahead please. Your line is open.","Laura Champine","Good afternoon. Just one more question on the weather, can you break down sort of the methodology that you used to determine that it was about a 1% hit? How do you get there, or greater\u2026","Michael Hartshorn","Sure. So we use weather services to do that. And also obviously storms are easier to calculate, that's a methodology. The only thing I would add is that includes both temperature and precipitation.","Laura Champine","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul from Guggenheim Securities. Go ahead please. Your line is open.","Bob Drbul","Hi, good evening. Just two questions; I guess that the first one is on the current marketplace or the competitive store closures, is that providing additional opportunity for you to get product from different vendors? And I think the second question is as you continue to expand stores and your store base with -- the ability to attract talent both whether it's managers or even the labor component in the associates within the stores, are you seeing any pressure there that you could talk to?","Michael O'Sullivan","So, Bob, it's Michael O'Sullivan. First of all, in terms of the store closures, it's hard to tell what contribution that's having to availability. Availability is driven by a number of a number of things. And it's possible. What's actually -- let me step back, I think the struggles that the rest of the retail industry is having certainly is helping to drive availability on store closure specifically account to kind of like that particular component.","In terms of availability of labor, we are very happy with our ability to attract and retain people throughout the level -- throughout all levels in the company.","Bob Drbul","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel from Nomura Instinet. Go ahead please. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey. This is Dan Stiller [ph] on for Simeon. Thanks for taking that question. Just wanted to know if there's been any notable change recently over the past several years in what brands your shoppers are gravitating towards, basically trying to figure out if your top selling brands really turned over much and kind of favor for newer up and coming brands? Thanks.","Barbara Rentler","For competitive reasons, we really wouldn't talk about brands on the call.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And on the consumer base, anything you're seeing in terms of frequency of visit of existing shoppers, or I guess customer acquisition and the initiatives there? That would be very helpful. Thanks.","Michael Hartshorn","So, we slice and dice customer data all the time, we're often out that doing research, and I would say there's nothing to call out in terms of any changes to consumer behavior or demographics or anything of that nature at this point.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti from Credit Suisse. Go ahead please. Your line is open.","Michael Binetti","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions here. Could you speak a little bit more to the change in AUR and the mix-based delta there? I think lot of the competitive sort of speaking to positive AURs at this point across both half price and department stores frankly. So I'm wondering if there's some kind of category divergence that you guys are pursuing that's causing some puts and takes on your AUR, and if you think that that continues remain a headwind through this year, if you see some reason why the categories that you guys have been inventory with the change in the inventory line there could take some pressure off on that line?","Michael Hartshorn","Yes. I would say -- so AUR obviously can change from quarter-to-quarter. So it's not something that's I would say strategic, but so as we look out for the rest of the year, it will be based on category performance. So, hard to say at this point, I'd said over the last couple years based on the categories they've done well, AUR has been down, but just slightly.","Michael Binetti","I mean I was a little surprised that AUR was still headwind in the first quarter with the weather citing maybe you didn't move into some of the categories in the spring that I thought about a little bit, there would've been a little bit higher AUR in the comp, was that a surprise to you all or not?","Michael Hartshorn","Not really. I mean our strategy, Michael, is -- over a long period of time has been to be a shopping price just possible to drive sales, and that's the approach we took n Q1 as we've historically taken, and basically that we're pretty happy with the 3% comp on top of the 3% comp that we got last year.","Michael Binetti","Sure. And then, if you just help us one last one on the model, I think any kind of calendar shift cadence that we should think to? I think in 2013 you said you had about one percentage point benefit sales in the first half, I mean sales not comps and then a one point drag in the second half. Is it a similar map this year that we should have in our models?","Michael Hartshorn","Yes, I would say it's similar, just sort of be clear, we reported on a restated basis, and you can see this in the difference between our total sales and our comp sales.","Michael Binetti","Right.","Michael Hartshorn","So for the year, I think it's accurate that the first-half has a larger negative impact than the second-half. So for us, the difference between restating that wage and not is worth about 200 basis points in the first quarter.","Michael Binetti","All right, thanks a lot.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Merriman from Bernstein. Go ahead please. Your line is open.","Jamie Merriman","Thanks. It's Jamie Merriman. My question is just about your marketing strategy. As you work on attracting younger consumers into the business, is that pivoting at all and if so, how? Thanks.","Michael Hartshorn","Sure. So Jamie, I would say that our marketing approach in terms of the types of media that we're using has been evolving over time, and will likely continue to evolve obviously moving to less traditional forms of media. Some of that's still experimental. We will see how those media perform, but I would expect that over time you can see more of that shift for us as in deed you'll see for other appetizers as well.","Jamie Merriman","And have you found that maybe able to be a little bit more targeted and therefore lower cost on an acquisition basis, so you're seeing -- too early to see benefits like that?","Michael Hartshorn","I think it depends on the market. It depends upon the individual type of media you're talking about. And what exactly we're trying to do in terms of who you're trying to target. So the answer is -- the answer can be yes depending upon the situation or it can be no depending on the situation. And that's kind of what I mean by saying that some of those channels are fairly experimental, and that's why we're sort of evolving into them rather than making significant changes at this point.","Jamie Merriman","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","There are no further telephone questions. At this time, I will turn the call back over to the presenters. I wanted to stop in. Your next question comes from the line of Sandra Parker. I think she's just removed herself again from the queue, sorry.","Barbara Rentler","Okay. Thank you for joining us today and for your interest on Ross Stores. Have a great day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions]","Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts and other matters that are based on the company's current forecast of aspects of its future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today's press release and the company's fiscal 2012 Form 10-K and fiscal 2013 Form 10-Q and Form 8-K on file with the SEC.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Balmuth, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.","Michael Balmuth","Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Norman Ferber, Chairman of Board; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Group Senior Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Wong, Director of Investor Relations.","We will begin our call today with a review of our fourth quarter and 2013 performance, followed by our outlook for 2014. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. Let me preface our discussion of today financial results by noting that our 2012 fourth quarter and fiscal year were 14- and 53-week periods, respectively, while our 2013 fourth quarter and fiscal year were 13- and 52-week periods. As a reminder, the 53rd week in fiscal 2012 added approximately $149 million in sales and $0.10 in earnings per share to both last year's fourth quarter and fiscal year.","Now let's turn to today's results. As noted in our press release, fourth quarter 2013 earnings per share were $1.02 on net earnings of $218 million. Sales for the quarter were $2,741,000,000, with comparable store sales up 2% on top of a 5% increase in last year's fourth quarter. Sales for the quarter performed in line with our guidance and earnings were slightly better than expected, mainly due to above-planned merchandise gross margin.","Despite a very promotional and competitive holiday season, customers responded favorably to the compelling bargains we offered on a wide assortment of fresh and exciting name-brand fashions and gifts.","For the fiscal year 2013, earnings per share were $3.88, up a solid 13% on a 52- versus 52-week basis over last year. This growth is especially noteworthy, considering it was on top of robust multiyear earnings per share increases of 20%, 24% and 31% in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In addition, fiscal 2013 operating margin remained at a record 13.1% despite the estimated 20-basis-point benefit from the 53rd week in 2012.","Net earnings in fiscal 2013 grew to $837.3 million on sales of $10,230,000,000. Same-store sales in 2013 rose 3% on top of a 6% gain last year.","For the quarter and the full year, Juniors was the best-performing merchandise category, while geographically, Texas was the strongest region. Michael Hartshorn will provide some additional color on our financial results in a few minutes.","As we ended 2013, total consolidated inventories were up 4% compared to the prior year, while packaway levels were about 49% of total inventories compared to 47% last year. Average in-store inventories were down approximately 4% at the end of 2013.","Like Ross, dd's continues to benefit from our ability to offer a wide assortment of terrific bargains, while also operating the business on reduced inventory levels. As a result, dd's DISCOUNTS was able to deliver another year of solid gains in sales and operating profits in 2013.","Now let's turn to our financial condition. Operating cash flows provided the resources to make capital investments to support our growth and fund our ongoing stock repurchase and dividend program. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares of common stock for a total price of $129 million. For the full year, we bought back 8.2 million shares for an aggregate price of $550 million. We expect to complete the $550 million remaining under our current 2-year $1.1 billion program by the end of 2014.","The board also recently approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.20 per share, up 18% on top of a 21% increase last year. The growth of our stock repurchase and dividend programs has been driven by the significant amount of cash our business generates after self-funding store growth and other capital needs. We have repurchased stock as planned every year since 1993 and this is the 20th consecutive annual increase in our quarterly cash dividend. This consistent record reflects our unwavering commitment to enhancing stockholder value and returns.","Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our 2013 results and details on our first quarter and fiscal year 2014 guidance.","Michael Hartshorn","Thank you, Michael. Let's start with our fourth quarter results. Our 2% comparable store sales gain was driven by an increase in the size of the average transaction. Operating margin declined by about 95 basis points to 12.7%, mainly due to the estimated 65-basis-point benefit to last year's fourth quarter from the 53rd week. In addition, we also experienced some deleveraging on occupancy, distribution, freight and selling, general and administrative costs, which was partially offset by higher merchandise gross margin.","Again, we were able to maintain fiscal 2013 operating margin at a record 13.1% despite the estimated 20-basis-point benefit from the 53rd week in 2012. For 2013, a 15-basis-point improvement in cost of goods sold was offset by a similar increase in selling, general and administrative costs.","For the year, cost of goods sold benefited from a 45-basis-point gain in merchandise gross margin, partially offset by occupancy costs that rose about 20 basis points and distribution and buying expenses had increased about 5 basis points each. Selling, general and administrative cost delevered by 15 basis points, mainly due to higher costs related to the relocation of our data center.","Let's now turn to the underlying assumptions that support the 2014 earnings targets we communicated in today's press release. Our fiscal 2014 earnings per share forecast of $4.05 to $4.21 represents growth of 4% to 9% over 2013 on a comparable store sales gain of 1% to 2%. This guidance incorporates some pressure on earnings from the infrastructure investments we have been making to support our longer-term growth plans. We are also projecting a higher effective tax rate due to the expiration of federal and state hiring credits.","The operating statement assumptions for the full year in 2014 are as follows. Again, comparable store sales are forecast to increase 1% to 2%; total sales are projected to grow 5% to 6%; we are planning to add approximately 75 new Ross and 20 new dd's DISCOUNTS locations. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores.","If same-store sales are up 1% to 2%, we would expect some deleveraging of expenses with merchandise gross margin projected to be up slightly from 2013. As a result, EBIT is estimated to be 12.9% to 13.1% in 2014. Net interest expense is expected to be about $7 million as we expect to finance the purchase of our New York buying office. Our tax rate is planned at approximately 38% and we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 210 million.","Capital expenditures in 2014 are forecast to increase to approximately $800 million, up from $550 million in 2013. This higher spending is primarily driven by the purchase of our New York buying office. Depreciation and amortization expense, inclusive of stock-based amortization, is forecast to be approximately $290 million to $300 million, up from $250 million in 2013.","For the 2014 first quarter, earnings per share are projected to be in the range of $1.11 to $1.15, up from $1.07 in the first quarter of 2013 based on the following assumptions. Total sales are forecast to increase about 5% to 6% over the prior year. Comparable store sales are projected to be up 1% to 2%. We plan to add 26 net new Ross and 7 net new dd's DISCOUNTS during the quarter. Operating margin is projected to be in the range of 14.4% to 14.6% or down about 30 to 50 basis points from the record 14.9% we reported in 2013. The forecasted decline is due in part to some deleveraging as same-store sales performed in line with our guidance for 1% to 2% increase. We are planning relatively no net interest expense in the quarter. The tax rate is projected to be 38% to 39% and diluted shares are forecast to decline to about 212 million.","Now I'll turn the call back to Michael for closing comments.","Michael Balmuth","Thank you, Michael. As we enter 2014, in addition to our own challenging multiyear sales and earnings comparisons, we continue to face an uncertain macroeconomic and retail climate. While we are well-positioned as an off-price retailer, these likely headwinds have prompted us to stay somewhat cautious in our outlook. That said, the strength of our business model lies in the flexibility of our off-price strategies. To maximize sales, we are staying liquid in our Open-to-Buy, which enables our merchants to capitalize on the best opportunities in a marketplace that is currently flushed with terrific bargains.","Further, operating our business with lean inventories has enabled us to increase the amount of fresh and exciting merchandise customers see when they shop our stores. This has helped in maximizing sales, while also driving faster inventory turns and the resulting higher merchandise margins we saw throughout 2013 and over the last several years.","Looking ahead, we still see significant growth opportunities for our company. As we've mentioned before, we believe that Ross can ultimately operate 2,000 locations across the United States and that dd's DISCOUNTS can eventually become a chain of 500 stores. As previously noted, we are in the process of making the necessary infrastructure investments to support this long term expansion that will ultimately double our store base. Our plans include the addition of 2 new distribution centers, one that will open in 2014 and another in 2015.","In addition, as mentioned earlier, we entered into an agreement last year to acquire a New York buying office building. This is a unique onetime opportunity that will enable us to continue to house all of our New York merchants together, which maximizes their cohesiveness and effectiveness of this critical organization. We continue to believe that keeping our primary buying office in the heart of the Manhattan garment district is a competitive advantage as this location makes it easier for our buying group to strengthen relationships with our large network of suppliers. That said, over the near term, higher costs related to these investments are expected to put some pressure on earnings.","For the longer term, we are targeting average annual earnings per share growth of 10% to 13%. The formula is based on a combination of unit growth, comparable store sales gains, flat to slight improvement in operating margin and our ongoing stock repurchase program. In order to achieve our financial goals, we must, most importantly, continue to invest in our merchandise organization. This is the only way to ensure that we can maximize our ability to deliver the best bargains possible to the consumer. In addition, we must also stay focused on strictly controlling both inventories and expenses, fine-tuning and upgrading our planning and allocation systems and developing and implementing further productivity enhancements and efficiencies throughout the business.","These are the strategies that have enabled us to reach our current record levels of sales productivity and profitability and also remain the key drivers of our future results.","In closing, I want to reiterate that we are favorably positioned in the current retail landscape. We believe off-price will continue to be a strong performing sector and are optimistic about the long term growth prospects for our business.","At this point, we would like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, the first. As we think about in-store inventory going forward, you've had several years of really pulling inventory out. Can you just provide some details on how we should think about this going forward? If there's any category or any place else where you plan on maybe even building back?","Michael Hartshorn","So as it relates to inventories into 2014 going forward, we think there's a bit room to take them down, maybe in the 1% to 2%, right?","Michael Balmuth","But as far as building back inventories, I don't think we'll ever get there. I don't think -- we'll certainly -- we're always listening to our customer and how they're reacting to our assortments. By my instinct says, we're comfortable at roughly the levels we've set out with some minor tweaks going forward.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And I guess, as a follow-up to that. Home has been an area of focus. Is there anything that you can provide in terms of details on that category in particular?","Michael Balmuth","Well, we continue to make progress in Home. In the fourth quarter, our progress is a little slower than we like, although they comped slightly ahead of the company. I think we have to execute better on what we know our strategies need to be there. And I think we'll get there. It's just been a little slower than we'd like.","Operator","And your next question comes from Brian Tunick with JPMorgan.","Brian J. Tunick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess, 2 questions. One on the positive comments on merchandise margins for last year and, I guess, your outlook for this year. Can you maybe just talk about, is the coming from the buy side of the picture, or is that coming from, again, better sell-throughs and lean inventories? And then maybe update us on sort of new market performance in 2013. And maybe just want to throw in dd's as well. Sort of where are we in that business sort of ramping up to get closer to a contribution margin similar to the Ross stores?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Okay, Brian. On your 3 questions, merchandise margin improved actually through a combination of higher markup and lower markdowns. So it's both. Secondly, in terms of new markets, I think as we've said before, we've been happy with what we've been able to achieve in new markets over the past couple of years, particularly with the open volumes. But in the fourth quarter, we were disappointed with the comp performance in the new markets in the Midwest. Part of that was the weather, but also, I think, we believe there are some assortment improvements we can make in that region as well. And then on -- I think, the third question was about dd's. And dd's had another solid performance last year and in the fourth quarter. And what was particularly notable was dd's continue to improve its profitability.","Operator","Your next question comes from Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray.","Neely J.N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just wondering if you guys had an evolution in your thought process around mobile engagement as you head into 2014? We've noticed -- actually seen sponsored links in Facebook just like in dd's and what have you. But just wondering -- obviously, on the commerce side won't be there. But how are you evolving this level in terms of engagement on the other side of holiday?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","So Neely, we -- I think as we mentioned before, we are experimenting with social marketing, with mobile marketing. We actually think that those are -- those avenues are actually very interesting for us. We -- historically, word-of-mouth has always been an important form of marketing, unpaid marketing for us. And we think that sort of social networking, social marketing and the link to mobile actually has some promise for us going forward. So we're experimenting in those areas and I think you should expect that we'll continue to grow those aspects on our marketing mix.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bridget Weishaar with Morningstar.","Bridget Weishaar - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I'm wondering -- I know comp sales you are guiding to decelerate a little bit to the 1% to 2% range and that makes sense in this promotional environment. But I'm wondering what you thought is, overall, on the trade-off between keeping the merchandise margins high and being a bit more promotional to be competitive and gaining higher volume?","Michael Balmuth","Really, if we do our job well as an off-pricer, we should be able to balance it, okay? As we assess market conditions, sometimes we pull back our spend, then we're able to give an edge of opportunities in the marketplace that should be able to provide us both well priced product, as well as margin, good solid margins. So it's a balance that off-price executed effectively, giving us an edge on versus other areas of retailing, I think.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Mann with Johnson Rice.","David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","The guidance percentage increase that you're giving for this year is a little more conservative than in past years. Can you just parse through the difference of that 4% to 9% from the 10% to 13%? I think Michael talked about some extra costs with the infrastructure rollout, but can you just compare to your paradigm for future growth against what you gave for this year?","Michael Hartshorn","Sure, David. I think the premise is we are projecting the 1% to 2% comp. Obviously, we did the 3% last year, but we're up against 5% comp over the last 5 years on a compound basis. So that presents a challenge. Also, Michael referred to the infrastructure costs that we're incurring. We will have a bit more interest, $7 million on interest this year that we wouldn't have last year. Also, our tax rate is going up in the absence of hiring tax credits that we have received in the past. So if you neutralize for those 2 items, you get back to a 6% to 11% growth rate, similar to where we were last year at this time.","David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then for a quick follow-up. The packaway level going into '14 is a little higher than it's been for the last couple of years. I'm just curious, what would that infer about the quality of the market in terms of goods for availability and for pricing? Can you just comment on that?","Michael Balmuth","Well, when our packaway creeps up, it's because we were able to take advantage of some very good opportunities. And if business still remains volatile as it's been through the last bit of time, I would expect that we'd be taking even further advantage. So it's essentially a good thing for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Kernan with Cowen.","John D. Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to get your thoughts on how do you see competitive environment evolving within off-price? I know you guys have been opening a lot of doors, more mass continues to open a lot of doors. In Burlington, certainly sees a lot of opportunity for additional doors. So how do you see the competitive environment evolving within off-price as a lot of the department stores get more promotional as well?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Sure. So John, I guess, I would say that our -- we kind of regard our competitive environment as actually much larger than just the off-price space, that we operate in a very competitive, very fragmented apparel and home merchandise market. And as a result, we are able to grow share and actually, I think other off-price competitors are able to grow share, as long as we continue to offer great value. So we think that's at least the outlook just to us. And that's going to continue for some time.","John D. Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just in terms of CapEx, there's been a multiyear ramp in CapEx due to some onetime items. What do you think CapEx looks like going forward after this year? Because I think, obviously, the share buyback has got to come down a little bit because of a ramp in CapEx. What does it look like next year and beyond?","Michael Hartshorn","So John, the share buyback is not going to come down because of CapEx spend. We plan to spend $550 million this year, similar to what we did last year. This should be the peak in CapEx spending. Once we get the distribution centers open in '15 going forward, it will come back down as we take that step-up in CapEx.","Michael B. O'Sullivan","I think we'd also -- a piece of that. As we've previously announced, the plan is to finance the purchase of our New York buying office building [indiscernible] to bring it up to grow the buyback and the dividend.","Operator","Your next question comes from Marni Shapiro with Retail Tracker.","Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker","So I guess, Michael or Michaels, if you can talk just a little bit more about dd's. Can you bring us up to speed like as far as your buying staff? At what level is it? Do you have any -- are you looking for anybody to hire within dd's? And are you guys running this fast out of New York and California the way you do Ross Stores? Just a little bit of color behind how dd's is working these days.","Michael Balmuth","Dd's has its own separate buying organization. We are essentially full, okay? We have no key openings. Our key positions are filled. We have -- as Ross does, we have a much bigger organization in New York than we do in Los Angeles. And dd's has the same complement of a New York and Los Angeles buying office. And what is the another piece, Marni, that you wanted?","Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker","No. Just curious. Things are pretty much fully staffed and running, just more a matter of opening stores and getting things at and getting the sales up to start leveraging all the expenses that are there?","Michael Balmuth","I think that's accurate and well-put.","Michael B. O'Sullivan","And just on the operating side, Marni. We have dd's and we have distribution capacity for dd's. We have a dedicated field staff for dd's. So really, it's just a question of over time expanding the business.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I'm wondering if you can just refer back to the infrastructure investments you talked about as presenting a little bit of a headwind for earnings growth this year. We've got the 2 distribution centers that you're adding, one this year and one next year. The acquisition of your New York City office. Are there any other infrastructure investments that you're making beyond those? And then if you could just talk about the state of your IT systems, do you feel like there's any investment over the next couple of years that you'd like to make there as well?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Okay, Kimberly. The 2 major investments that are worth calling out are the new distribution centers, 2 of them, and one this year and one in 2015. And then the purchase of the New York buying office. The nature of those types of investments is that, number one, they're lumpy. So you don't make those kinds of investments very often. And so there are some start-up costs associated with those investments, particularly ramping up the DCs. And that's really what's causing -- why we thought we would call out and there's a little bit of a headwind in earnings from those investments. I should say that as we grow into that capacity over the next 2 to 3 years, that capacity leverage will become immaterial over time. In terms of the second part of your question about IT, we are always making investments in our IT systems in different parts of the company. But nothing significant in terms of major projects that are worth calling out.","Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And just one follow-up question for Michael. I'm curious if you saw any impact in your business after the November 1 discontinuation of the SNAP benefit. I know clearly, obviously, Ross does not sell food, but theoretically some of those customers also shopped at Ross for their apparel wardrobe with less support on the food side, maybe they might want to cut back. I'm just wondering if you saw any sort of impact on your business at all?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Kimberly, we really didn't. My understanding is that the food stamp program was worth about $5 billion a year. And you just put that in order of magnitude. I think the payroll tax increase was like $100 billion last year. So although as the food stamp has always been very important to the people who receive them, as a whole, they really don't make a significant difference. And we didn't notice any trend current change after that point.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Sterne Agee.","Irwin Bernard Boruchow - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I guess, Michael, just a quick question. I think you commented on the gross margin line in Q4 that your merchandise margins were positive. Because you're -- maybe I missed -- I didn't hear it, what was the basis point change year-over-year in Q4? And then could you just walk us through -- obviously, it's a volatile Q4 for most everyone in retail. How you kind of played with the pricing architecture within the store during Q4?","Michael Hartshorn","Ike, this is Michael. As mentioned in the comments, overall, operating margins were down about 95 basis points. 65 basis points of that deleverage was due to the 53rd week comparison and that's mainly operating expenses. For gross margin, merchant margin was up about 30 basis points. Occupancy freight, buying and distribution costs combined, delevered by 75 basis points, leaving gross margin to down 45 basis points. And then SG&A was down 50 basis points, which gets you to the total of 95 for the quarter.","Irwin Bernard Boruchow - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then can you comment on how your pricing might have evolved as Q4 kind of played out just in terms of how holiday in January? Just kind of curious if you could give us any more color.","Michael Balmuth","Well, the color I give you is, we went into the fourth quarter with lot of Open-to-Buy availability and it gave us the ability to take advantage of a lot of opportunities in the market that helped balance pricing in our store at a very good margin product.","Operator","Your next question comes from Oliver Chen with Citigroup.","Maryana Pleskanka","This is Maryana filling in for Oliver Chen. Could you please provide us with some color regarding traffic and ticket size for the quarter? As well as what categories you see the most opportunity in?","Michael Hartshorn","In terms of the composition of the comp, as we mentioned, the 2% comp for the quarter was driven by a larger basket. This was mainly driven by more units per transaction, but also a slightly AUR. And then transactions were down a bit for the quarter.","Michael Balmuth","And your point 3 was what?","Maryana Pleskanka","What categories are you seeing the most opportunity in?","Michael Balmuth","I think we would really more, in this forum, speak to where we had the most opportunity in fourth quarter. Forward, we wouldn't talk about in this forum.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So 2 questions. First, in terms of the sales, if you look at the last 4-, 5-year comps this year, decelerated a little bit. Do you think that is more a function of just the economy and the marketplace, or do you think that's a function of the share loss with maybe some of the department stores being aggressive, some of the things that you talked about in the Midwest? And it sounds like one of your off-price competitors got some aggressive pricing this fourth quarter as well. So is that more just the market or the share loss?","Michael Hartshorn","I think, Mike, it's important to put it in context that we achieved a 3% comp last year that was on top of a 6% the year before. And before that, 5%; and before that, 5%; and before that 6%. So over 5 years, we've averaged to 5% comp. I don't think it's realistic to expect that we can sustain that kind of comp level. So we were pretty happy with our 3% on -- given those last year comparisons. Now the other points that you mentioned such as the economy, unemployment, cuts in government benefits, some of the struggles and other competitors. Those all play a part, of course, in how we do as a business. But I think put in context, we feel pretty happy with that 3%.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. Second question. Just so I'm clear on it so -- and I guess, this plays into that guidance of 4% to 9% instead of the usual guidance you've given of 6% to 11% growth. So to be clear, the difference is the higher tax rate, which is a slight difference. And then if the infrastructure investment and that's primarily start-up costs and also the D&A, which will be higher by somewhere around $25 million, maybe $50 million, that's the biggest impact in that guidance differential?","Michael Hartshorn","Yes, Mike. So operating margin, we mentioned, would be flat to slightly down 20 basis points based on the 1% to 2% comp. And so the differences are below the EBIT line, which is interest, which is about $7 million or 7 basis points and tax rate, which would be slightly higher.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So that -- but within that margin guidance, that includes a pretty significantly high depreciation number. Is that right?","Michael Hartshorn","That's correct, Mike.","Operator","And your next question comes from Daniel Hofkin with William Blair & Company.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just going back maybe a little bit to the outlook in 1% to 2% comp for the first quarter and the full year. What's your general expectation for traffic and ticket? And I guess, within ticket, what, if anything, are you expecting from benefits, if there is apparel costs, inflation, for example, as some expect? In the past, I think that's been a benefit for in terms enabling you guys to offer even more attractive relative values. What's your thought on that going forward?","Michael Hartshorn","I would say the factor guiding 1% to 2% for the first quarter and for the year is a combination of we're up against pretty tough performance, we're in a tough environment. We've been able to sell goods at full margin prices, so we're happy with the finance results. And to dissect it more that you'd into what the composition is as to traffic versus ticket, et cetera, we really run our business to provide the best bargain as possible with customers and it's kind of self-revealed. In other words, they come and buy the bargain. So I don't think we're expecting inflation in terms of apparel. We haven't seen that lately. So that won't be our expectation for the first quarter.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then just back to, obviously, there's some regional differences in terms of percent of store base between you and some other players. If you just look at -- obviously, you mentioned Texas. Can you talk about the -- your performance on the West Coast specifically?","Michael Hartshorn","Yes. So in terms of for the quarter, we mentioned Texas was the strongest. Florida was also strong. California performed in line with the chain and our weakest markets are where the weather was, the worst including Mid-Atlantic and Midwest.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And with that, would you say that, that was kind of most pronounced by far in January, as we're seeing with a lot of other companies?","Michael Hartshorn","I think that's true.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.","Heather N. Balsky - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is Heather Balsky calling for Lorraine. I just had a question with regard to your vendor base. You guys have been able to grow your vendor base every year, the past few years. I'm just wondering, looking ahead, where do you see opportunities to add new vendors? And how do changes in your merchandising organization allow you to also grow your vendor base?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","I heard the first part of it, how do we see -- could you repeat the second part of your question?","Heather N. Balsky - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, sorry. The changes in your merchandising organization, how does that also help you access additional brands and grow your vendor base?","Michael Balmuth","Okay. The more merchants you have, the more market coverage you can get, the more vendors you can see, the more doors you can open. And that leads to more vendors. We've grown our organization dramatically over the last 4 years and it's helped us grow our base of vendors. We expect it to grow significantly. Probably, it would grow across the company, probably more significantly in home and center core-type businesses and as apparel has become more centralized in fewer and fewer players.","Operator","And your next question comes from Laura Champine with Canaccord.","Laura A. Champine - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","On the CapEx front, after we see this ramp to $800 million this year, when we move into next year, you've got an another DC opening. Should CapEx stay at that elevated rate? And where do you think it settles out long-term as a percentage of sales?","Michael Hartshorn","This is -- Laura, this is Michael. It is -- this is our peak. As we mentioned, part of the spend this year was dealing IBO. But after we open that distribution center next year, I think it settles more similar to the 2012 levels.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Montagna with Avondale Partners.","Mark K. Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Michael, back last year in the second quarter, you were able to react to an expected rise in department store promotions for the fourth quarter. Wondering what your expectations for the department store promo levels are for this first half.","Michael Balmuth","I would say, based on how business conditions have been, I would expect it to be fairly promotional.","Mark K. Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","So would you say higher promotions year-over-year versus last year or and...","Michael Balmuth","I would expect it to be somewhat more promotional than a year ago. Yes.","Mark K. Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then can you give us a tally of maybe how many selling days might have been lost in the fourth quarter due to weather?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","It would be very hard to quantify that, Mark, just given we had, obviously, different weather in different regions. So I'm not sure how to give you a number that will answer your question now.","Mark K. Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just last question. I think, Michael, you were expecting strength in the fourth quarter on gift items. And was that just -- I think it was for the home category or was it also across other categories? And how do you feel that, that -- those gift items did during the fourth quarter?","Michael Balmuth","It was really across all the categories as well, as out of home. And I think it did pretty well. We were pleased with it, but we see room for improvement.","Operator","Your next question comes from Roxanne Meyer with UBS.","Roxanne Meyer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I was just wondering if you were able to provide us with some additional hindsighting as it relates to your third quarter performance. And looking back, what may have led to a slight miss hit to your expectations there? And have there been any adjustments made as a result of that?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","I don't think we have any additional intelligence, Roxanne, on the third quarter. Obviously, we're always looking at our business in terms of improvements we can make. And certainly, to the extent that there were merchandise categories that we thought weren't performing well in the third quarter, we have made attempts to improve those merchandise categories. But nothing other than that. That's kind of business as usual for us, but nothing under that now.","Roxanne Meyer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then I just had one quick follow-up. In terms of your new store growth for this year, what percentage of your new stores are going to be in newer markets? And are there any additional -- are there any new markets aside from those that you're currently in, in the Midwest?","Michael Hartshorn","So it's about 1\/3 of our Ross stores will be in new markets. And they'll be the same markets we've been in over the last couple of years.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bob Drbul with Nomura Securities.","Robert Scott Drbul - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Here's the question that I have, is much more on the succession plan unfolding. Is there any update to the time line of when we might be able to expect more definitive plans around your departure or retirement, Michael?","Michael Balmuth","Sounds like you want me out. But we announced in, I think it was May of '12, that I'd be stepping down, moving into Executive Chairman position as of June 1, '14. We'll be making that announcement in spring here, okay, over the next few months.","Robert Scott Drbul - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. I don't you want out. I was just serious in terms if there's any update.","Michael Balmuth","No update yet.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Stein with Northcoast Research.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","A question on your packaway business. I'm just kind of curious, what kind of mix you currently have? And perhaps, what kind of AUR might be embedded in that packaway? Given that it's such a high percentage of your inventory, would it yield a higher AUR compared to last year, the same or lower?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","It's fairly similar for last year, Jeff. And the mix is very similar for last year. We're very happy with what we have in packaway. We were happy with last year, too. So I don't think there's any major differences to call out on packaway.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","Okay. Have you guys disclosed how you're planning to finance the New York buying office? And how much of the purchase price will be financed?","Michael Hartshorn","No. We haven't announced how we're going to do that. That's probably a third quarter event. We're working on that currently. And we'd love to have financed the whole thing.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","Okay. And when is the new distribution facility open in 2014?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","Right about the middle of the year. We'll ramp it up over a couple of months and it will be fully operational by the end of the third quarter.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","So the heaviest start-up expenses from that facility will show up when? Will it show up in Q3? Or is it already beginning to show up?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","I think the biggest piece of the expense will start showing up when it opens in Q3.","Operator","Your next question comes from Richard Jaffe with Stifle.","Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Michael, just a question. Given this broad array of merchandise, a high-quality of merchandise that's available in the marketplace, are there any, I guess, opportunities to take advantage of this and then broaden array of product in stores with new categories, with new brands? And also, to experiment with price points, to try higher retails, higher-quality brands. Anything like that?","Michael Balmuth","A lot of that I wouldn't talk about here. But it's the various price points, the opportunities, it's really all over the place. So there are things that we will be experimenting with out of it, things that we might not have been in to quite as fast.","Operator","And your next question comes from Patrick McKeever with MKM Partners.","Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Just wondering if you might give us some updated thoughts on e-commerce. I mean, I guess, intuitively, one can see why that would not be as much of a threat to you as other retailers. But the largest player in the off-price space is moving forward there and talking very positively about the opportunity to reach more customers. So is there a chance that you might be missing an opportunity? And does the e-commerce factor at all into some of the distribution infrastructure investments that you're making?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","So Patrick, it's certainly an area that we've looked at very closely. Our assessment is that it's very hard for an off-price business to make money in e-commerce at the price points that we operate at. And most of the activity in the last few years seems to have been at relatively high price points in merchandise where we really don't compete. So to our focus, it's really on our bricks-and-mortar business. We know that we can achieve strong returns in that business. We know we have a lot of potential. Many, many more markets that we can expand into. But having said that, we'll continue to monitor e-commerce. And if things develop and we think it looks like a possible opportunity, we'll take another look.","Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","And then another -- a quick one on the new distribution centers. Will that change your basic distribution model, which, I think, is to distribute merchandise from all DCs to all stores? Will you move more toward a regional distribution model?","Michael B. O'Sullivan","It won't dramatically change our distribution model. We are -- our distribution network, at this point, is fairly mature and operates pretty effectively and supports our business very well. And the new DCs are intended to be integrated into that same model. So no radical change, no.","Operator","And your next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","As you think about the customer, both for dd's and for Ross, what opportunities do you see to expand the existing customer base to get more of the wallet share -- to expand the existing and get more wallet share from new and existing customers, how do you see the opportunity to grow that? And the pressures on them, whether it's food stamps, whether it's health care costs, how is it different now than it's been last year? Do you see anything different? And how much of your customer is impacted by any of those external pressures?","Michael Balmuth","Really, it goes back -- in getting more of their wallet, it goes back to the same thing that we've probably said numerous times is, if we execute and provide more bargains in front of customers, they'll come back more. And that -- I don't think that's changed in a while. I don't it changes as we go forward and it applies to these as well for us.","Michael B. O'Sullivan","And then on the second part of your question, Dana, about what impact economic trends, the factors, there's unemployment, the cuts in government benefits, what impact that might have on us. I think certainly, anything that takes money out of customers' pocket is not a good thing for retail and not a good thing for off-price. But having said that, logically, you would think that the greater extent that people need bargains, the better off we might be. So you could play it either way.","Operator","And we have no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to Mr. Balmuth for closing remarks.","Michael Balmuth","Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores. Have a great day. Thank you.","Operator","And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"19355":["Ross Stores, Inc.

The call will begin with prepared comments by management followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions]","Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts and other matters that are based on the company\u2019s current forecast of aspects of its future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today\u2019s press release and the company\u2019s fiscal 2017 Form 10-K and fiscal 2018 Form 10-Q and 8-K\u2019s on file with the SEC.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer.","Barbara Rentler","Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael O\u2019Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Group Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Vice President, Investor Relations. We\u2019ll begin our call today with a review of our second quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the second-half and fiscal year. Afterwards, we\u2019ll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.","As noted in today\u2019s press release, we are pleased with the above-plan sales and earnings growth for the second quarter. Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended August 4, 2018 were $1.04, up from $0.82 for the 13 weeks ended July 29, 2017. Net earnings were $389 million, up from $317 million in the prior year. The second quarter earnings results, including $0.18 per share benefit from tax reform legislation.","Total sales for the second quarter increased 9% to $3.7 billion. Comparable store sales for the 13 weeks ended August 4, 2018 rose 5% over the 13-week period ended August 5, 2017. This growth was on top of a same-store sales gain of 4% for the 13 weeks ended July 29, 2017.","For the second quarter, we saw broad-based strength across merchandise categories and geographic markets. So better than expected operating margin of 13.8% was down from last year as higher merchandise gross margin and leverage on occupancy and buying costs were more than offset by a combination of unfavorable timing of packaway-related expenses, higher freight costs, and this year\u2019s wage investments.","For the first six months of fiscal 2018, earnings per share were $2.15, up from $1.64 last year. Net earnings were $808 million, up from $638 million in the first-half of 2017. The year-to-date earnings results included $0.35 per share benefit from tax reform legislation. Sales year-to-date rose 9% to $7.3 billion, with comparable store sales up 4% versus a 4% gain for the 26 weeks ended July 29, 2017.","As we ended the second quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 6% over the prior year. Average in-store inventories were up 4%, due in part to the 53rd-week calendar shift, while packaway as a percentage of total inventories was 44%, compared to 46% last year. dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS also posted another quarter of strong sales growth, leading to solid growth in operating profit year-to-date.","Turning to our store expansion program remains on schedule with the opening of 22 new Ross and eight dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS locations in the second quarter. We also continue to project adding a total of approximately 100 locations in 2018, comprised of 75 Ross and 25 dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores.","In addition, as noted in today\u2019s press release, we are raising our long-term projected store potential to 3,000 locations, up from the previous target of 2,500. This is based on our research that indicates we can further increase penetration in both existing and new markets and as a result of a number of factors that include increases in population densities and [new or] [ph] large trade areas from suburban growth.","As a result, we now believe that Ross Dress for Less can grow to about 2,400 locations across the country, up from our prior target of 2,000, and that dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS can ultimately become a chain of about 600 stores versus our previous projection of 500 units. This higher store potential provides us with considerable long-term growth opportunities.","Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our second quarter results and details on our second-half guidance.","Michael Hartshorn","Thank you, Barbara. Let\u2019s start with our second quarter results. Our 5% comparable store sales gain was driven by higher traffic and an increase in the average basket. While second quarter operating margin of 13.8% was down a 110 basis points from last year, it was better than forecast.","Cost of goods sold increased 80 basis points in the period. Merchandise margin increased 15 basis points, while occupancy and buying costs levered by 15 and 5 basis points, respectively. These gains were more than offset by an 85 basis point increase in distribution expenses from the unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs and a 30 basis point increase in freight costs.","Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter also rose 30 basis points due to higher wage cost and the anniversarying of a 20 basis point benefit in the second quarter of 2017 from a legal matter.","During the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018, we repurchased 3.2 million and 6.5 million shares, respectively, of common stock for a total purchase price of $273 million and $529 million, respectively. We remain on track to buyback a total of $1.075 billion in stock for the year.","Let\u2019s turn now to our second-half guidance. Given our robust multi-year sales comparisons in the third and fourth quarters, we continue to forecast same-store sales for both periods to grow by 1% to 2%. If sales perform in line with this guidance, earnings per share for the 13 weeks ending November 3, 2018 are forecasted to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.88, up from $0.72 a year ago.","For the 13 weeks ending February 2, 2019, earnings per share are projected to be $1.02 to $1.07 compared to $1.19 in last year\u2019s fourth quarter, which included a per share benefit of $0.14 from a one-time revaluation of deferred taxes and $0.10 from the 53rd-week in 2017.","Now I\u2019ll provide operating statement assumptions for our third quarter EPS guidance. Total sales are projected to grow 5% to 6%. We expect to open 40 new stores during the period, including 30 Ross and 10 dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS locations.","Operating margin is projected to be in the range of 11.9% to 12.1%, compared to last year\u2019s 13.3%. This forecasted decline reflects our expectation for ongoing pressure this year from higher freight and wage investments, as well as some deleveraging on occupancy and other expenses if comparable store sales only perform in line with guidance.","We expect net interest income of about $2 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 23% to 24%, and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about $372 million. At the end of the quarter, we expect in-store inventory levels to be up versus the prior year, as Thanksgiving is a week earlier this year due to the 53rd-week calendar shift.","Based on our first-half results and second-half guidance of 1% to 2% same-store sales increase, we now project per share \u2013 earnings per share for the 52 weeks ending February 2, 2019 to be in the range of $4.01 to $4.10, compared to $3.55 for the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2018.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments.","Barbara Rentler","Thank you, Michael. To sum up, as I mentioned earlier, our results for both the second quarter and first-half of 2018 continued to exceed expectations. Looking ahead to the balance of the year, we hope to once again outperform our projections as we have for sometime now.","However, we face stronger prior year comparisons over the next six months in a retail landscape, both brick-and-mortar and online, that will likely remain very competitive That said, our confidence and the strength of the off-price sector and our proven ability to perform well in this space, continues to fuel our optimism about the future.","Finally, we are very excited about our updated longer-term growth prospects. Our new target of 3,000 store locations offers us potential 80% increase over our current base.","At this point, we\u2019d like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan.","Matthew Boss","Thanks, great. On the gross margin, so help us to think about the freight headwind that you\u2019ve embedded in the back-half of the year versus the 30 basis points this quarter? And then on the wage front, is it best to think that the wage pressure raises your 3% fixed cost hurdle until we fully lap this in the second quarter of next year?","Michael Hartshorn","Hi, Matt, it\u2019s Michael Hartshorn. On freight cost, obviously, there are a number of factors that are contributing to the increase, including higher diesel prices we were at a three-year high, up 20% in the second quarter. Trucker and driver shortage and increased industry regulation enforcement tracking drivers. Built into the back-half guidance, our freight pressure is similar or slightly above what we saw in the first-half of the year.","And then on wage pressures, we wouldn\u2019t comment on 2019, we\u2019ll comment on that at the end of the year.","Matthew Boss","Great. And then just a follow-up. As we think about multi-year and just given the change in the long-term store sequential, which sets a really nice positive today. Just any governor on the annual growth in terms of 5% to 6% historically with the square footage growth base? Just anything to think about as we think about maybe governors to your annual growth, given the increase in the sort potential long-term?","Michael O\u2019Sullivan","Yes, Matthew, it\u2019s Michael O\u2019Sullivan. I\u2019d be careful to distinguish between the long-term store potential number, which we released today versus the annual store opening number. The long-term store potential give us, I guess, sort of a longer growth runway if you like over the longer-term, but it doesn\u2019t change the way we think about the number of new stores per year.","The constraints on the number of new stores per year include real estate availability and also operational constraints and they really haven\u2019t changed. So from a planning perspective, I think, you should assume that we\u2019ll continue at a rate of about 100 new store openings per year.","Matthew Boss","Great color.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Tunick from Royal Bank of Canada.","Brian Tunick","Great, thanks. I\u2019ll add my congrats as well. Curious, Barbara, if you could maybe drill down a little more into the category performance for the quarter? And sort of what do you think are the biggest opportunities coming here in the back-half versus last year, if you hindsight that a little?","And then maybe, Michael, can you help us think through the drivers of merchandise margin expansion that you\u2019re seeing even though, I guess, in-store inventories are now growing? Thank you very much.","Barbara Rentler","Brian, from a category performance, as I said in the note, our performance was really was broad-based in the second quarter. Obviously, from the first quarter to the second quarter, apparel clearly improved. But that\u2019s really at this point how I see the back-half. I don\u2019t see it as one specific big opportunity, I see it as more broad-based. And obviously, when you get to the fourth quarter, there\u2019ll be more emphasis on gift-giving. But even within gift-giving, we see that within every business in the box. So we don\u2019t have it focused in one specific category.","Michael Hartshorn","Brian, specifically on inventory and margins. First of all, the inventory increases you\u2019re seeing this year are a function of the 53rd-week calendar shift. So in this quarter what happens is it drives back to school earlier, which means we drive earlier receipts to match the sales, which is the same that happens at the end of Q3 with the Thanksgiving holiday, which is closer to quarter-end.","In terms of the margin improvement, it was driven by a combination of better buying and above-plan sales that resulted in lower markdowns for the quarter. That will continue to be our biggest opportunity when it comes to merch margin.","Brian Tunick","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you. I wanted to follow-up on the 85 basis points of distribution pressure. I know you called out positive 15 basis points in the first quarter from timing of packaway. Can you talk about the timing of this particular expense increase? And when you expect that to come back into the gross margin? Thank you.","Michael Hartshorn","Sure, Lorraine. So we \u2013 our packaway accounting is we capitalize costs to procure store and process packaway merchandise and that includes fixed cost. What happened in the first quarter is packaway levels were up, so we got a credit to the P&L. In the second quarter, that completely reversed, and the D.C. 85 basis point deleverage was all driven by the packaway timing.","You\u2019ll notice from our guidance that we flowed through the $0.05 above the high-end of the guidance through to the year. So versus our guidance, there\u2019s no impact in the back-half.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Greenberger","Wonderful. Thank you so much and congratulations. Michael O\u2019Sullivan, I was wondering if you have any additional details you might be able to share with us on the analysis you did for the long-term store potential? Is that with the assistance of a sort of third-party outside, or do you have a team internally who looks at that analysis?","Secondarily, Barbara, you talked about a nice improvement in the profit profile or profit of the dd\u2019s division. And I\u2019m wondering if you can just talk about the profitability of dd\u2019s relative to the Ross division? And how that\u2019s tracking compared to your expectations?","And then lastly, Michael, on inventory. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible to look at the average in-store inventory, the balance sheet, for example, here at the end of Q2 had closed a week earlier. Would the \u2013 would that have changed your average in-store inventory at the end of the quarter? I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s a way for us to sort of understand it on an apples-to-apples basis versus last year? Thanks.","Michael O\u2019Sullivan","So, Kimberly, on the first part of your question, the modeling, our real estate team \u2013 our internal real estate team has a model, a fairly well tested and proven model that they used to analyze and assess individual store locations \u2013 individual new store locations.","They update that model based upon changes in our actual store productivity and experience. And also based upon external demographic trends, now periodically, we use that model to roll up and estimate our longer-term store potential, and it\u2019s been a little while since we did that. So that\u2019s what\u2019s really driven these updated estimates.","The other point I would make is, these estimates that were provided in today\u2019s release represent a roll up, looking at opportunities in existing and new markets. I would say, the demographic trends that are driving higher estimates are fairly strong and well-documented. And I think, given our customer base, you won\u2019t be surprised that the demographic trends are favorable to our business.","Barbara Rentler","And Kimberly, in terms of dd\u2019s profitability, all I would say about that is that, it\u2019s similar to Ross\u2019s four wall profitability.","Michael Hartshorn","Kimberly, on inventories. Inventories would have been up just slightly. The 4% increase is actually planned in the year to focus on that calendar shift and impact the earlier back-to-school with that calendar shift. So with \u2013 without the calendar shift, we would have been up slightly.","Kimberly Greenberger","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell","Good afternoon. I wondered if you could discuss the comp composition. I believe you mentioned that traffic lead, was there a major spread across regions due to weather? And how was apparel versus non-apparel in the quarter from a category standpoint?","And then lastly, I think, you also mentioned an increase in the basket. Could you discuss UPT versus AUR in the quarter?","Michael Hartshorn","Sure. So on the components, as we mentioned in our remarks, the 5% comp was driven by higher traffic and larger basket. The higher basket was entirely driven by units per transaction, AUR for us was flat compared to last year.","In terms of merchandise performance, as Barbara mentioned in her remarks, sales growth was broad-based across merchandise categories. Apparel and non-apparel were relatively similar for the quarter.","In terms of regional performance and weather, weather, no impact for the quarter versus last year. The \u2013 geographically, sales were strong throughout the country. Of our major markets, Texas and Florida were above the chain average. California was relatively in line, and then our Midwest newer markets continued to do well with comp sales in line with the chain average against very strong growth over the last several years.","Paul Trussell","Thank you for the color. Best of luck.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Lejuez from Citigroup.","Paul Lejuez","Hey, thanks, guys. On the 400 incremental Ross Stores in your new long-term plan, I\u2019m curious if you can talk a little bit more about the mix between existing markets and new markets, as you think about that long-term Ross potential? Are there any new markets that you can maybe share with us that you\u2019re thinking about today that we haven\u2019t heard about just yet? Also curious just during the quarter, performance of your urban versus suburban locations? Thanks.","Michael O\u2019Sullivan","So Paul, on the mix of existing versus new markets, if we would expect that that the \u2013 we\u2019ll continue \u2013 the existing markets will continue to be the dominant share of new store openings for several years. Beyond that, we wouldn\u2019t really comment about the timing of specific new market openings at this point.","Michael Hartshorn","And then, Paul, on urban versus suburban, I mean, we wouldn\u2019t breakout that detail. I will say, well, we track is how it trends from quarter-to-quarter, and we do not see a change in trend coming out of the first quarter.","Paul Lejuez","Maybe if I could just sneak one more. I\u2019m curious about your new store openings. What you\u2019re seeing this year and this year\u2019s class versus previous years and relative to your expectations? Thanks.","Michael Hartshorn","Sure, Paul. Our new store productivity continues to track at or above our real estate performance this year. And it\u2019s very similar to the last couple of years, where the average new store is about 60% to 65% of an average Ross store in the chain.","Paul Lejuez","Thanks, guys. Good luck.","Michael Hartshorn","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Binetti from Credit Suisse.","Michael Binetti","Hey, guys, thanks for taking our questions here. Michael, can we get a little help thinking about how I think, the guidance implies about 130 basis points of operating margin compression in the third quarter. Do you help us think about how that breaks down between gross margin and SG&A? And then if I could follow-up a little bit on Lorraine\u2019s question from before. I guess, it\u2019s a little harder for us to forecast changes in accounting around packaway. But since that line item swung a 100 basis points in the second quarter compared to first quarter, could you also help us think about what your plan for the back-half assumes related to packaway accounting?","Michael Hartshorn","Sure. So on the components, we don\u2019t breakout the gross margin versus SG&A. But the margin reflects ongoing pressure from freight. As I mentioned, we expect to be at or above the pressure we\u2019ve seen year-to-date. It also reflects wage investments and the wage investments for us will be heavier in the back-half the impact will be, because we went to $11 an hour in the second quarter and also paid one-time bonuses.","The one-time bonuses obviously only hit the second quarter. And then we would expect some deleveraging on occupancy and other expenses if comparable store sales perform in line with our guidance. And in terms of DC, packaway is the hardest thing to predict for us, because it\u2019s highly dependent on how we run on sales and what\u2019s available in the marketplace for modeling purposes, I assume that it\u2019s relatively flat in back-half.","Michael Binetti","So just to clarify the \u2013 you went to $11 an hour and paid one-time bonuses in 2Q. But the total wages will be more of a pressure in the back-half than the front-half even as those one-time bonuses aren\u2019t present in the back-half?","Michael Hartshorn","No, the one-time bonuses only hit the second quarter. The wages will have a bigger impact as we went to $11 in the second quarter. We also increased our lease benefits that will impact the back-half more than the first-half.","Michael Binetti","Okay. If I could sneak one in on AUR, you mentioned it was flat. Would you mind just helping to speak to that as a little bit more of how you\u2019re thinking about that. I know you generally take your queues from the customer on where to go with the merchandise mix and that influences it. But I know you have the different strategy from your competitors, but we are hearing some AUR increases around the sector. So would you mind just telling us how you think about AUR and if there\u2019s an opportunity there for that to improve through the back-half of the year? Thanks.","Michael Hartshorn","Sure. On AUR, it\u2019s completely a function of mix of business. Over the last several years and even the recent trend, it doesn\u2019t move a whole lot for us. It\u2019s been down slightly to up slightly, so flat for the quarters is our expectation and going forward, it\u2019ll be based on the mix of business.","Michael Binetti","Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bob Drbul from Guggenheim.","Robert Drbul","Hi, good afternoon. I guess, I was wondering if you could comment a little bit around competitive store closures and just a couple parts to it. But do you think that it\u2019s benefiting your business today? And I guess, how do you think about it in the back-half of the year? And have the competitive store closures at all impacted that new store opening plan that you\u2019ve discussed earlier?","Michael O\u2019Sullivan","So, Bob, I would say that like most of our retailers, store closures of other retailers are nice tailwind. But in any given year, they don\u2019t really have a material impact on our comp performance. And in terms of how we think about new store openings, no. I don\u2019t think the store closures have really changed how we think about or where we think about putting new store openings. Go ahead.","Robert Drbul","And has there been a variation on the dd comp versus the Ross comp, or are they both similar to the overall?","Michael O\u2019Sullivan","In the first-half and the second quarter dd\u2019s continued to perform very well in terms of sales above plan. And then actually, we announced this, but on margins, dd\u2019s sort of similar trends to Ross in terms of the packaway credit and the impact on margin second quarter, but overall for the year pretty happy with dd\u2019s from a sales and profitability point of view.","Robert Drbul","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Simeon Siegel from Nomura Instinet.","Simeon Siegel","Thanks. Good afternoon, guys, and congrats on the results. As you perform the new store analysis, were there any thoughts towards international and as you look to the larger dd\u2019s footprint? Just how does the average revenue for dd store, compared to Ross, if you can? Thanks.","Michael O\u2019Sullivan","Sure, Simeon. In terms of international, no. This was a piece of analysis focused just on the United States. We have 1,600 stores at this point, and we\u2019re saying the long-term potential is 3,000. So, obviously, a lot of growth there. So very focused only on the United States.","Michael Hartshorn","Simeon, on the average stores, so we don\u2019t disclose the specific on dd\u2019s. Suffice it to say, it\u2019s less. It\u2019s a newer concept or newer chain for Ross, the average store is about $9 million, so it\u2019s south of that based on the maturity of the chain.","Simeon Siegel","Okay. Thanks, Michael. And then just obviously, it\u2019s a moving number by quarter, and I think you mentioned maybe timing. But any other color on the decline in packaway percentage this quarter? Any color on the \u2013 any shift in the quality of available inventory in the market? Thanks.","Barbara Rentler","No. There\u2019s a lot of supply in the market, it\u2019s still plentiful and I think it\u2019s broad. The packaway number really fluctuated based off of what we see plus we fuels a lot of Q2. But there is a lot of availability and it\u2019s really the merchants decision to decide what to packaway? How much to packaway? And when to pack it away? So I would say, we\u2019re in our regular process. But again, there\u2019s a lot of \u2013 there\u2019s no change in availability in the marketplace.","Simeon Siegel","Okay. Thanks. Best of luck for the rest of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Marni Shapiro from Retail Tracker.","Marni Shapiro","Hey, everybody, congratulations on a great quarter and first-half.. I just want to get one clarification on the wages. Are you \u2013 did you take wages up in-store, as well as at the D.C. level and across the company?","Michael Hartshorn","Yes, Marni, we took it up across the company.","Marni Shapiro","Okay, great. And then just one follow-up as well on \u2013 of the new store expansion. Have \u2013 when you\u2019re looking across the Board, are there any new or shift in the mix of type of stores? Have you considered outlets or even shopping malls that are looking to expand into the off-price space that may be hadn\u2019t in the past and things like that? And I\u2019m curious if you\u2019re finding with dd\u2019s a similar scenario in the types of locations that do well or just dd\u2019s tends to do better more local family centers versus Ross Stores?","Michael O\u2019Sullivan","So, Marni, no, nothing to call out that in terms of different types of locations. The analysis was really based upon looking at the type of locations we already have, but how the demographic trends are increasing the number of those opportunities.","Operator","Your next question comes from Daniel Hofkin from William Blair.","Daniel Hofkin","Good afternoon. Just a question first on the environment. We haven\u2019t been hearing so much news in the last few years on the competitive promotional environment. And obviously, on the back of this very strong quarter for you and others, what are you seeing? What are you expecting for the second-half in terms of competitive promotion? Is your one to two guidance just your typical conservatism? Is there something else that you\u2019re seeing that causes you to be more cautious on the second-half?","Barbara Rentler","So the environment is still competitive, and we are thinking that it remains competitive in the back-half between online and in-store brick-and-mortar. And we are up against in terms of how we\u2019re feeling about that, but we are up against very strong multi-year comparison. So when we put those the multi-year comparisons, the competitive environment together, that\u2019s how we came up with the guidance.","Michael Hartshorn","And, Dan, so it\u2019s \u2013 this has always been our playbook. We think it\u2019s a prudent plan to plan the business this way. Barbara mentioned they were up against very robust multi-year comparisons. We were up against a seven comp in 2016 and a 4% comp in 2017 in Q3. And then for Q4, we\u2019re up against a 4% in 2016 and a 5% in 2017. That said, we hope to do better like we\u2019ve done in Q1 and Q2 of this year.","Daniel Hofkin","Yep, maybe safe to say that that\u2019s a bigger factor than the any sort of intensification in the competitive environment?","Michael Hartshorn","Yes, that\u2019s correct.","Daniel Hofkin","Okay. Maybe just if I could just follow-up on the gross margin topic one more time. What is it unit caps accounting, is that what causes what you have an increase in packaway that helps the gross margin in that period and then it reverses later. Is that what should play here?","Michael Hartshorn","Yes, that\u2019s exactly how it works.","Daniel Hofkin","Okay. All right. Thanks very much. Best of luck.","Operator","Your next question comes from Laura Champine from Loop Capital.","Laura Champine","Thanks for taking my question. It\u2019s about the expectation that you can grow your store base beyond what you previously said. Does that contemplate Ross being nationwide in all regions? And what would be a reasonable timeframe for us to think about for you to enter new regions like the Northeast, for example?","Michael O\u2019Sullivan","So, Laura, yes, it contemplates expansion nationally across the United States. As a reminder right now, we\u2019re in 38 states, and this assume that we expand nationally. In terms of timing of when we would enter new markets, we wouldn\u2019t comment on that for competitive reasons.","Laura Champine","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jamie Merriman from Bernstein.","Jamie Merriman","Thanks very much. I have a slightly maybe longer-term question. But in the past, you talked about soft of demographics and seeing an increasing number of new customers come from younger demographics. And I\u2019m just curious, are you seeing those customers purchasing the same brands that you\u2019re \u2013 maybe traditional core customer has purchased. Are they looking for something new from you in terms of either brand mix or category? Thanks.","Barbara Rentler","Sure. Yes, we think we do well with the younger demographic, and we feel we do well with millennials. In terms of brand mix, I would say, that customer is a little bit not quite as married to certain brands. It is more open to trying different types of brands.","But that being said, the very strong brands are still \u2013 very strong brands are still important to them. It\u2019s just I think that they\u2019re little bit more open to trying other brands and in some cases labels that perhaps are young on the curve that eventually would become bigger brands would be my guess. But they\u2019re not quite as traditional, but the big brands are still the big brands.","Jamie Merriman","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo.","Ike Boruchow","Hey, everyone. Congrats on a solid quarter. Michael, two quick ones for you. First is on the model. On the one to two comp you\u2019re laying out for Q4 just because the calendar shits are creating some noise, what revenue growth would that imply for the fourth quarter?","And then is it fair to say that your view on freight has worsened versus three months ago, just kind of curious the puts and takes there? And then, again, just to clarify, are you \u2013 have you been saying that the back-half, the freight headwind should worsen from where Q2 was, or from where your first-half impact was?","Michael Hartshorn","Sure, Ike. We haven\u2019t given specific revenue targets for fourth quarter. We\u2019ll do that at the end of the third quarter. The one thing I will say though is, the total revenue is impacted by the restated versus fiscal comparison in the first-half that from a total sales standpoint, that fiscal comparison helps us by a point in the back-half, It\u2019s off by a point and it\u2019s even more pronounced in the fourth quarter.","In terms of freight, it\u2019s very similar to how we plan the year. It is a slight increase and we found other offsets in the business to cover that. But we do expect it to be at or somewhat elevated to what we saw in the second quarter.","Ike Boruchow","And Michael, is there any visibility on that line item into 2019 just at a high level for us to understand?","Michael Hartshorn","At this point, no. We wouldn\u2019t comment until we give next year\u2019s guidance.","Ike Boruchow","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Telsey","Good afternoon, everyone. As you think about the new store long-term store target, how are you thinking about distribution capacity? And when the next distribution center needs to come up? How many do you need in order to handle that type of growth? And does this new store growth capacity does it entail an acceleration in terms of the number of new store openings? Thank you.","Michael O\u2019Sullivan","So, Dana, in terms of distribution capacity, we don\u2019t expect to need another major DC for another few years. And then beyond that obviously longer-term, we would need additional capacity as we open up additional stores. Last part of your question was about the pace of new store openings. No, I would not anticipate that the pace of new store openings will change. Over the last few years, we\u2019ve opened approximately 100 new stores per year. I would expect that it will stay around about that number.","Dana Telsey","Just one more question. Barbara, as you think about made for off-price merchandise, are you seeing any changes in that landscape? And is that becoming a more important part of your mix? Thank you.","Barbara Rentler","Close-outs are basically, the bulk of our assortments. The makeup portion of our business sits primarily in a couple of businesses, where it\u2019s on branded such as home. But again, the bulk of our assortments really comes from close-outs and we don\u2019t see any availability issues in the near-term. So we don\u2019t really see a mix changing.","Dana Telsey","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Janine Stichter from Jefferies.","Janine Stichter","Hi, thanks very much. Just wanted to ask about some of the newer categories you\u2019re pushing into. I think, you\u2019ve called up beauty before. Any color you can give on the performance there? And then maybe some color on categories, where you feel like it may be underpenetrated and there is still an opportunity? Thanks.","Barbara Rentler","I missed the first part of the question. Could you just repeat the first part.","Janine Stichter","Sure. Just on some of the newer categories that you\u2019ve pushed into, I think, you\u2019ve called out beauty in the past? Just any color you can give on the performance there?","Barbara Rentler","Okay, I missed of her beauty. Obviously, we feel that beauty is an opportunity as lot of the business has shifted out of department stores. So we think there\u2019s a lot of potential there. And from a real major growth, I think, that\u2019s probably the biggest one. After that, I feel like that most of our growth and I know sounds like it\u2019s always broad-based, but it is broad-based. Beauty happen to be, I think, a trend shift in the market. So we do feel good about that.","Janine Stichter","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Kernan from Cowen.","Krista Zuber","Good afternoon. This is Krista Zuber on behalf of John. Just two quick questions. Most of ours have been answered. I believe you previously guided to flat merchandise margin for fiscal 2018. So I was just wondering if that still holds? And then secondly, on the same-store sales, which has obviously been consistently beating guidance for the 1% to 2%. As you look into the second-half, what are you expecting from the traffic and basket components? Thank you.","Michael Hartshorn","Sure. On merchandise margin, we guided the year to be flat. We\u2019ve exceeded that in Q1 and Q2 and frankly, that\u2019s based on ahead of plan sales. The guidance for the back-half assumes it will be relatively flat. And if we exceed our sales plan, there could be some opportunity.","Your second question, oh, composition in comp. I\u2019d expect it to be very similar. It hasn\u2019t changed a whole lot. Traffic has \u2013 traffic and units per transaction have been the key drivers, and that\u2019s been through over the last couple of years.","Krista Zuber","If I could fit in one more, if I may. Just on the capital plans as it relates to your cash flow generation. And if we look at the model, the CapEx is generally been running up about 3% of sales. Should we kind of expect that type of run rate going forward? Thank you.","Michael Hartshorn","So on CapEx, this year, we\u2019re forecasting around $475 million. Over the next couple of years, we\u2019ll be starting construction on new distribution center capacity. And with that construction, the capital will edge up a bit.","Krista Zuber","All right. Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Barbara Rentler for closing comments.","Barbara Rentler","Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores.

While we are working diligently to improve our merchandise assortment, which are out of balance in a number of areas and ladies, plus strengthen our value proposition, it can take some time to correct issues like this in a chain of our size."," ","That said we do believe that the actions we are taking will lead to improved results as we move through the year. As we ended the period total consolidated inventories were down 4% over the prior year. Average in-store inventories were up 1% as planned or packaway as a percentage of total inventories was 44% compared to 49% last year."," ","As it has for some time now these discounts posted better than expected gains in both sales and operating profits for the quarter. Turning to store growth, our 2019 expansion program is on schedule with the addition of 22 new Ross and 6 dd's DISCOUNTS locations in the first quarter. We remain on track to open a total of approximately 100 locations in 2019 comprised of 75 Ross and 25 dd's DISCOUNTS. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 stores."," ","Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our first quarter results and details on our second quarter guidance. "," ","Michael Hartshorn"," ","Thank you, Barbara. Let's start with our first quarter results. Our 2% comparable store sales gain was primarily driven by an increase in the size of the average basket. While operating margin of 14.1% was down 95 basis points from last year, it was better than expected mainly due to above planned merchandize margin and favorable timing of expenses. Cost of goods sold rose by 85 basis points in the quarter. A 30-basis point improvement in merchandise margin was more than offset by a 60-basis point increase in distribution costs as we were up against last year's benefit from packaway related expense."," ","In addition, freight costs grew by 35 basis points and occupancy and buying expenses increased by 10 basis points each."," ","Selling, general and administrative expenses for the period increased 10 basis points as higher wage related costs were partially offset by favorable timing of expenses. During the first quarter, we repurchased 3.4 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $320 million. We remain on track to buyback a total of $1.275 billion in stock for the year. "," ","Let's turn now to our second quarter guidance. For the 13 weeks ending August 3, 2019, we are forecasting same store sales to increase 1% to 2% on a top of a 5% gain last year. Earnings per share for the second quarter projected to be in the range of $1.06 to $1.11, up from $1.04 in the prior year period."," ","The operating statement assumptions for our second quarter guidance include the following. Total sales are projected to grow 5% to 6%. We expect to open 28 new stores during the period including 22 Ross and 6 dd's DISCOUNTS locations."," ","If same store sales are in line with our guidance then we project operating margins to be in the range of 13.2% to 13.4%. The forecasted decline from last year's 13.8% mainly reflects headwinds from higher wage and freight costs, partially offset by the anniversarying of last year's negative impact from packaway timing. In addition, we would expect some deleveraging on occupancy if comparable sales perform in line with our guidance."," ","We expect net interest income of about $ million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% to 25% and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about $363 million. Based on our first quarter results and second quarter guidance, we now project earnings per share for fiscal 2019 to be in the range of $4.38 to $4.52. This compares to EPS of $4.26 last year which included a $0.07 per share benefit from the favorable resolution of a tax matter in the fourth quarter."," ","Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."," ","Barbara Rentler"," ","Thank you, Michael. To sum up, we delivered respectable results in first quarter despite difficulties in our Ladies apparel business. As I said earlier, we're working hard to improve our merchandise assortment and strengthen the values we offer in this important business. We do believe the steps we are taking in ladies will lead to improve performance over time."," ","At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have."," ","Question-and-Answer Session"," ","Operator"," ","[Operator Instructions]"," ","Your first question comes from the line of Matt Boss from JP Morgan."," ","Q - Matthew Boss"," ","Thanks and congrats on a nice quarter. I guess on the top line can you speak to Ladies apparel performance may be versus plan in the first quarter? And just how much do you attribute to company specifics execution versus relative category weakness as we've heard this trend from a number of retailers in the last couple quarters?"," ","A - Barbara Rentler"," ","Sure. Well, obviously I wouldn't talk versus plan. All I'll say is that Ladies on the top-line trail the chain. In terms of company execution versus relative performance in the outside world, we really feel that our execution was below our standards. And obviously there are other outside factors, there's weather and there was whatever but in terms of execution we felt that our assortment rather balance. There are value offerings were not as compelling as they should have been. And obviously you know price, the price value equation is critical and so we really feel like it's an execution issue and not necessarily based off of other factors in the outside world."," ","Q - Matthew Boss"," ","Got it. And then maybe just to follow up on the margin front on gross margins. What's your expectation for merchandise margin in the second quarter and then the balance of the year and the back half?"," ","A - Barbara Rentler"," ","Sure, Matt. We don't give specific guidance by quarter. I will tell you when we started the year we planned merchandise margin relatively flat for the year. And at this point that's what's embedded into our guidance for the remainder of the year."," ","Operator"," ","Your next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank for America."," ","Q - Lorraine Hutchinson"," ","Thank you. You've had a couple of your senior leaders leave over the past few months. And I was just hoping you could talk about the bench under them, if you're planning external searches or how you're thinking about the leadership team going forward?"," ","A - Barbara Rentler"," ","Sure. What I would say overall our ability to -- we have a very deep bench of talented and long tenured executive on the operational side and on the merchandising side. And so we have a strong succession plan in all of those worlds underneath. So we feel strongly that our bench at the senior level and the level below that is very solid. And as we know that certain executives where we knew that they were leaving we had transition plans put in place for them, so that we could have a smooth transition and not have disruption to the business."," ","Operator"," ","Your next question comes from Mark Altschwager from Baird."," ","Q - Mark Altschwager"," ","Great, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. With respect to the comp guidance of 1% to 2%, I think last quarter you guided 0% to 2% given some of the headwinds you identified in women's apparel. So is the fact that you're returning to that 1% to 2% range even with a tougher Q2 comparison, a reflection that you think the women's apparel issue is improving as you move forward or are there other categories that are perhaps making up the difference and giving you some more broad-based confidence in the trajectory of the comp? Thanks."," ","A - Michael Hartshorn"," ","Yes. I'd say on the guidance anyway we did it 2% in the first quarter. So the 1% to 2% is kind of in line on how we usually guide the business and that's all I'd read into it and that's the way I think about it."," ","Operator"," ","Your next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley."," ","Q - Kimberly Greenberger"," ","Great, thank you so much. I wanted to know if there's any color you can provide on just the monthly cadence in the first quarter? And whether you saw the same sort of headwinds in February this year from delays in tax refunds that you had seen perhaps two years ago? And then secondarily, Barbara, I'm wondering if there's a good basic way to help us understand the out of balance in women's, we're all-- many of us are finance people and not merchants so just maybe in simple terms how would you explain to a non merchant person what the what is the out of balance issue? And then is the lack of the value proposition you talked about or lack of compelling value, is that a function of the availability of goods in the market? The price that those goods are available for or perhaps maybe just some mistakes in the buying process. Any insight would be really appreciated. Thank you so much."," ","A - Michael Hartshorn"," ","Kimberly on the trends during the quarter, sales strengthened as the quarter progressed and as frankly as weather improved and obviously also with the later Easter that was three weeks later last year. Like others we -- the delay in tax refund did have a short-term impact until they got caught up pretty quickly. I think overall the tax refunds were slightly down for the kind of tax filing year, but hard to understand if that's any impact to us for the entire quarter."," ","A - Barbara Rentler"," ","And then, Kimberly, in terms of out of balance, I mean that some of the simplest examples would be I own not enough shorts, too much denim to be out of balance by classification. It could be out of balance by price point, I mean those are the kind of --the kind of things I've been talking about out of balance to give you a couple of examples to put sides around it. In terms of offering the compelling value, it has nothing to do with availability of goods. If there's a lot of merchandise in the market. There continued to be merchandise in the market. I would say that the overall merchandized offerings just weren't where they needed to be, and really it was execution issues that were really were below our standard."," ","Operator"," ","Your next question comes from Michael Binetti from Credit Suisse. "," ","Q - Michael Binetti "," ","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking our question. I wanted to maybe Barbara asked a similar question what Matt asked before, but you know when you think about how to isolate your comments to your business versus what's going on more broadly in the marketplace. Obviously, there's quite a bit going on out there right now. But how much do you -- how do you assess your comment that Midwest was the strongest market relative to your own company's performance versus externals like the big Bon-Ton bankruptcy a year ago. Do you -- have you guys tried to measure how much that's helping add to the Midwest?"," ","A - Michael Hartshorn"," ","Sure. On the Midwest, Michael, on the Midwest, Midwest has been comping well for us for frankly since we entered the market in 2011, has been one of our strongest performing comp and continues to be a place that we're adding stores. So it's a newer store based and have been continued to be successful there in gaining market share."," ","A - Barbara Rentler"," ","And then in terms of difference, I'm sorry, there was little echo here. In terms of our business is inventing to comments people have made on the outside. We look at a number of metrics, ladies to plan, other apparel businesses to plan and key classifications, churn, I mean there's a variety of metrics that we look at to make that assessment overall. I mean isn't just one metric, it's a series of metrics."," ","Q - Michael Binetti "," ","Got it, and if I could follow up quickly, I think you said the merge margin was up 30 basis points in the quarter but you think flat for the year. Michael is there a point on the horizon where we see a minus sign in front of that? And if so, any reason why that's the planning or just erring on the side of conservatism?"," ","A - Michael Hartshorn"," ","Well, when we entered the quarter we were actually able to take -- be able to remain very flexible. And so our merchants were able to take advantage of close out during the quarter, which helped the margin. I would also say that we entered and exited the quarter with healthy inventory positions and therefore there wasn't marked down exposures."," ","Operator"," ","Your next question comes from Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank. "," ","Q - Krisztina Katai"," ","Hi, good afternoon. This is actually Krisztina Katai on for Paul. I was just wondering if you could just maybe talk a little bit more about the weakness that you continue to see in ladies apparel. I know you've discussed it earlier but just wondering what are some of the steps that you have taken to improve these results and maybe the timeline to remedy it. And then just on -- and then just if you could just discuss some of the categories. What you saw there? I mean you call that men's outperforming but what about some of the other categories such as home and beauty? If you could just share anything there. Thank you."," ","A - Barbara Rentler"," ","Sure. First as it pertains to ladies issues, as I said before, we're working diligently to improve the assortments in this important area, but it's going to take time to completely address all the issues for chain of our size. That said we believe that we will see improved performance as we move through the year. In terms of other categories, home and beauty, home was relatively in line with the chain and Beauty outperforms the chain."," ","Operator"," ","Your next question comes from Simeon Siegel from Instinet. "," ","Q - Simeon Siegel"," ","Thanks. Good afternoon. Just given your comments on the inventory and the supply in the market, just any help on understanding why the inventory decline and guess specifically packaway, I would have thought you would have had nice opportunity there. So just any thoughts on that and then the comfort in the ability to comp with the down inventory. Thanks."," ","A - Michael Hartshorn"," ","So inventory was down just slightly at the end of the quarter. So we think we can continue to operate at that level of inventory and turn faster. On packaway, we are actually up against a very large number last year. Packaway tends to be between 40% and 49% of the total inventory. And that can vary over time, but I think we're happy with the level and the content of our packaway inventories as we ended the quarter."," ","A - Barbara Rentler"," ","Right and in terms of supply in the market, there's an abundance of supply in the market just based off of Q1 performance and just traditional department store. So supply -- supply is not the issue, buying it at the right price in the right time is really a merchant judgment call."," ","Operator"," ","Your next question comes from John Morris from D.A. Davidson."," ","Q - John Morris"," ","Hi, thanks. Congratulations on good quarter. Very briefly I'm just curious why the shifting of the timing of the expense. Why that was particularly or generally happening currently in the current quarter? And then on the merch margin, the merch margin was up women's, however, women's underperformed. So was --maybe if you can dive a little bit deeper to help us understand the differences there? Is it all men's or should we look at it from a different --with a different filter in terms of why you were able to have that merch margin up despite women's under performance. Thanks."," ","A - Michael Hartshorn"," ","Sure. On the timing it was really broken to two pieces. It's part of -- it's just a packaway timing an issue and all these timing by the way is not versus last year's versus our original guidance. And so what you've noticed we did is we beat that first quarter by $0.04 and then up the full year by $0.02 on the top end of the range. So we're just trying to call that out but part of it was packaway related and part of it was SG&A cost that we expected to happen in the first quarter that will happen later in the year. And then just kind of on the merchandise margins, the reason we didn't have -- we're able to operate with higher merch margin and what's very important when you have a businesses underperform is that you manage the inventory. And with ladies and overall inventories, we entered both entered and exited the quarter with healthy inventory positions. So I think that's an important part of the margin improvement."," ","Operator"," ","The next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo."," ","Q - Unidentified Analyst "," ","Good afternoon, everyone. This is Laurie for Ike. Wanted to ask about the margin dynamics in the core just around freight. Since I know that it's been such an outsized drag on your cost. How are you thinking about that dynamic for the balance of the year and in Q2? Thank you."," ","A - Michael Hartshorn"," ","Sure. So maybe it's best to go through last year, last year the freight cost escalated as we move through the year. So in our initial call this year we said that we thought Freight would be a negative impact for the first half of the year, and then as we are we round some of the increases we had in the last year second half that the cost would abate. So that's our thoughts continue to be that first half of the year we'll have freight pressure and then we'll have a lower cost versus last year in the back half. "," ","Operator"," ","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez from Citigroup,"," ","Q - Tracy Kogan"," ","Thanks. It's Tracy filling in for Paul. I just had a follow-up question on packaway. I was wondering if you're seeing more availability in certain categories versus others and maybe perhaps in categories that are already being impacted by tariffs. Thanks."," ","A - Barbara Rentler"," ","Availability is pretty broad based in terms of categories where the tariff is. As I'm sure you've properly read in first that a lot of vendors brought merchandise into the country even starting a few months ago to get ahead of the 10% tariff even before the 25%. So I would say there's in certain pockets of those classifications there are vendors who own inventory. And then there are some that really don't own excess inventory. So that's kind of a mixed story based on classification. And then in terms of apparel availability is broad based."," ","Operator"," ","Your next question comes from the line of Marni Shapiro from Retail Tracker. "," ","Q - Marni Shapiro"," ","Hey, guys. Great job in a cold and very late Easter first quarter. I'm not going to ask about your ladies apparel. I'm actually curious about your real estate. You are one of the few net openers of stores out there and in a space where there are a lot of people vacating. So if you could just talk to us a little bit about the tone of your-- of what you're seeing out there for your leases and are you able to go back to some of your existing leases and renegotiate or what percentage of your leases are coming up for a renewal each year? If you could just put some color around that?"," ","A - Michael Hartshorn"," ","So we have seen closures with other retailers and that's been going on for quite a while. We tend to look two to three years out and feel pretty confident that we'll be able to achieve our store opening targets, wouldn't really comment on the leases but whenever there's closures this generally means good news for everybody."," ","Operator"," ","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Sole with UBS. "," ","Q - Jay Sole"," ","Great, thank you. A couple questions ago the word tariff was mentioned. Can you just talked about how the company is planning to handle the situation if there are new tariffs applied to apparel and footwear? And can you talk about what percent of your merchandise is imported from China? And if it's stores directly. Thank you. "," ","A - Michael Hartshorn"," ","Sure. So like everybody else we're closely monitoring the trade talks and tariffs. And at this point it's too early to say what the potential impact could be on the industry. Now our focus is to maintain a pricing umbrella versus traditional retailers and offer the best values to the customers. At this point, it's unclear how the industry would react with increases to apparel and shoes, and but we certainly would not be the price increased leader in that regard. The silver lining is we have a flexible business model. And can react to the price increases and disruptions like this have historically meant supply opportunities for off-price. And then we wouldn't comment on the direct sourcing question, what percentage is directly sourced from China."," ","Operator"," ","Your next question comes from the line of Laura Champine with Loop Capital. "," ","Q - Laura Champine"," ","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. It is on the underperformance in the women's apparel. Were there any changes in staffing for senior merchants or any significant changes in your relationship with vendors or any quality issues coming up with vendors that were unanticipated? I'm just trying to diagnose better what's going on and how long it might take to fix?"," ","A - Barbara Rentler"," ","Okay. In terms of the team, no, there were no significant changes. We have a very large and talented merchant team, very tenured. And it's the same team that has delivered results for many years and being able to deliver value to the customer. In terms of relationships in the market, no, we have again, we have a very large merchant team whether in ladies or in the entire company. So out there we've constantly out there building relationships and trying to do more business. So I don't see any relationship shifts or quality issues. The issues are really they are internal. They are execution issues and we're working diligently as I said before to correct those issues. But because of our size, we believe we'll see improved performance as we move through the year but the issues -- the issues are not external. The issues are internal. It's our execution."," ","Operator"," ","Your next question comes from Alexandra Walvis with Goldman Sachs."," ","Q - Alexandra Walvis"," ","Hi there. Thanks so much for taking the question. And I had a question on the category you mentioned in response to a prior question that was tracking in line with the chain. I think that represents a little bit of a deceleration in that category from prior. Some of your peers and other retailers have called out some softness in the home category and some difficulties with the competitive environment. I was wondering if you could comment on your experience there. How you're seeing demand pricing and so forth? Thank you."," ","A - Barbara Rentler"," ","From the -- just from the general, the general classification of home, some of our businesses are far better than other --I'm sorry go ahead. Well, go ahead continue. Why don't you continue with the question?"," ","Q - Alexandra Walvis"," ","Yes, sure. I was just wondering if you could comment a little bit more on your experience in the general home classification and if you have any comments that beneath at level in terms of what's performing well. As well and how well the market is in that category that would also be really helpful."," ","A - Barbara Rentler"," ","Okay. Generally some businesses in home are better than others. I really wouldn't go into the specifics of that on the call. I think the home categories as a general statement for the market is that's where a lot of people have absorbed increased cost. And so I think the market may be depending upon a classification of business event, the market may be a little bit more disruptive than others, [some pluses] more than others and therefore in some of the businesses there's more opportunity for us. And some of the other businesses there is less opportunity. And so and then you know so the balance of it may be a little bit different than it's been probably for everyone in the last few months. Without getting into any more specifics on the call I mean that's kind of the general gist of what's going on."," ","Operator"," ","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Merriman from Bernstein."," ","Q - Jamie Merriman"," ","Thanks very much. I think in the prepared remarks you mentioned that the driver of the comp performance was the basket size increasing. But I was just wondering if you could speak to what you've seen in traffic over the last quarter? And also maybe break that basket size down into price versus unit. Thanks."," ","A - Michael Hartshorn"," ","Sure. So as we mentioned in the remarks the 2% comp was driven by the increase of the basket. The basket was driven by higher units per transaction, AUR was down slightly and with traffic given the performance in ladies apparel we think that had an impact on traffic for the quarter. And again the way we measure traffic is through a number of transactions we actually do not have traffic counts. "," ","Operator"," ","Question comes from the line of Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group. "," ","Q - Dana Telsey"," ","Hi, good afternoon, everyone. As you think about just the state of the consumer, anything you're picking up that in this first quarter was different than in quarters past that would have made a difference in top-line? Whether it is delayed tax refunds or obviously the comparisons. And did you see a difference in performance of dd's versus Ross? Thank you."," ","A - Michael Hartshorn"," ","With the consumer there's nothing I'd call out. With tax refunds, the refund cycle was completed in the quarter. So perhaps there was timing differences within the quarter, but there's nothing really that I call out. I mean first quarter has been tough for us in other retailers versus the rest of year for a number of years. And dd's versus Ross, yes, dd's actually, we were pleased with the performance and we're ahead of last year. So we're pleased, as we said in our commentary we're pleased with their results."," ","Q - Dana Telsey"," ","And on the real estate front, what are you seeing in terms of the opportunity for relocation? And as you're renewing existing leases, is there opportunity for occupancy cost improvements?"," ","A - Michael Hartshorn"," ","So we tend to relocate on average about 10 relocate or\/and open about 10 stores on a year. And we're always looking to improve stores that are underperforming for various reasons. On the second question was an opportunity to improve leases. Occupancy overall on leases, I mean we've seen a pretty good market for the last number of years. And so I think it's remained pretty stable to that to what it's been like over the last several years."," ","Operator"," ","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul from Guggenheim Securities."," ","Q - Bob Drbul"," ","Hi, good afternoon. I was just wondering if you could give us an update just in terms of what you're seeing on your labor costs and the outlook for the year. Is there been any change from that perspective? And then second question is just around dd's versus Ross. Can you give us an idea and sort of vendor overlap and sort of how that might be trending over the last few years? Thanks."," ","A - Michael Hartshorn"," ","On the wage front, our most recent national increase the $11 we did in the second quarter last year. We believe it keeps us competitively positioned. That said we always take a market-to-market approach in determining our wage rates and that will not change. And in fact many of our markets are well above the $11. And as we always have done, we'll make the necessary adjustments to ensure we continue to attract and retain talented associates."," ","A - Barbara Rentler"," ","And it pertains to dd's versus Ross with vendor overlap; the dd's customer is a lower income customer, so there is some overlap for us but not a large overlap for us."," ","Q - Bob Drbul"," ","Got it. And dd's, as you open up more stores are you able to open them up in a closer proximity to Ross stores? Can you give us an idea just in kind of like the trade areas or how you really see that developing as well?"," ","A - Michael Hartshorn"," ","I think we look at it market by market; there are some markets where Ross alone makes sense and other markets where the two of them really enhance having them close by. So we take a market-by-market approach and you'll find locations where we're next door to each other."," ","Operator"," ","Your last question comes from the line of John Kernan from Cowen."," ","Q - Krista Zuber"," ","Good afternoon. This is Krista Zuber on for John. Thank you for taking our questions. I just wanted to follow up on two previous questions. One on inventory and one on freight. Just in terms of where you're thinking your inventory positioning or levels will be at the end of the year? And then secondly on freight, you mentioned that sort of your guidance or your thinking was unchanged. Is that a reflection of the renegotiations you would expect it to have this year for the rate? Thank you."," ","A - Barbara Rentler"," ","Sure. On inventory at the end of the year that's a long way out, but the way we have a plan is store positions to be relatively flat at this point. On freight, we have pretty good visibility on our renegotiations with over freight again a recap last year, the cost escalated as we moved through the year. And so in the front half, we've continued to see wage pressure but freight pressure just based on rates and market to inflationary cost in the freight industry. And then in the back half, we're up against those larger increases. So our viewpoint at this point is that they will abate as we move through the year."," ","Q - Krista Zuber"," ","Thanks. And if I could just add one more follow-up. Just kind of looking at your free cash flow generation. I think you stepped up the CapEx this year to about $600 million when you gave guidance at the end of the fourth quarter. I'm just curious is this how we should think about the run rate of CapEx as a percentage of sales going forward? Thank you."," ","A - Travis Marquette "," ","Yes. This is Travis. Yes, we're still planning CapEx around $600 million for the year. And as you may recall that includes the initial investments in our next distribution center. In terms of spending going forward, we wouldn't be too specific for the future, but suffice it to say it takes a little while to build the distribution center. So we expect CapEx to be elevated for the next couple years."," ","End of Q&A"," ","Operator"," ","I will now turn the call back over to you Barbara Rentler for closing comments."," ","Barbara Rentler"," ","Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores.

While first quarter operating margin of 15.2% decreased relative to last year\u2019s 15.4%, it exceeded our expectations. ","Cost of goods sold was flat for the quarter. Merchandise margins improved by 15 basis points while distribution and occupancy costs declined by 15 and 5 basis points respectively. These improvements were offset by a 35 basis point increase in freight expenses. ","Selling, general, and administrative expenses during the period increased by 20 basis points mainly due to higher wages. Earnings per share for the quarter also benefited by $0.01 due to favorable expense timing that is expected to reverse in subsequent quarters. ","During the first quarter, we repurchased 3.3 million shares for a total of $215 million. We remain on track to buy back as planned a total of $875 million in stock for the year, under the new two-year $1.75 billion program authorized by our Board of Directors in February of this year. ","Let\u2019s turn now to our second quarter guidance. For the second quarter ending July 29, 2017 we are forecasting same-store sales to be up 1% to 2% on top of a 4% gain last year with earnings per share of $0.73 to $0.76 compared to $0.71 last year. ","Our guidance for the second quarter is based on the following assumptions: total sales are projected to increase 4% to 5%. We expect to open 28 new stores during the period, including 21 Ross and 7 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. Second quarter operating margin is projected to be 13.9% to 14.1%, down slightly from last year's 14.4% reflecting our forecast for higher freight costs and wage costs. ","In addition, net interest expense for the quarter is estimated to be about $3 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 37% to 38% and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about 387 million. Based on our first quarter results and second quarter guidance, we now project earnings per share for the 53 weeks ending February 3, 2018 to be in the range of $3.07 to $3.17 compared to $2.83 last year. As a reminder, our forecasted EPS for 2017 includes an approximate benefit of $0.08 per share from the 53rd week. ","Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments. ","Barbara Rentler","Thank you, Michael. As I said earlier, we had a solid first quarter despite the challenging external environment. Looking ahead we have plenty of liquidity and are open to buy to take advantage of the terrific opportunities in the marketplace and offer shoppers the best bargains possible. That said, we also face our own increasingly difficult prior year comparisons along with political macroeconomic and retail climates that are likely to remain uncertain. So while we hope to do better we are maintaining a somewhat cautious outlook for the balance of the year. ","Over the longer term, we are confident the off-price sector will remain a strong performing segment of retail as consumers continue to seek value. In addition, we believe our operating strategies and ongoing investments in people, processes and system should enable us to drive respectable growth in both sales and earning in 2017 and beyond. ","At this point, we\u2019d like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ","Lorraine Hutchinson ","Thank you. Good afternoon Last year in the first quarter you had some challenges with the women's apparel business. Can you talk a little bit about how that performed and perhaps your learnings from last year and how you\u2019ve made changes? And then lastly, what opportunities do you see for the second quarter in that division? Thank you. ","Barbara Rentler","Okay, ladies comparable sales for the first quarter were positive. We feel that the changes we made, we no longer have those lingering execution issues that we had last year and the challenges, we feel that those are behind us. We\u2019ve made the appropriate changes, a lot of those issues were around seasonality and color and execution. So we feel that that we made progress during 2016 that we made additional progress in Q1 and that we\u2019re going to continue to move forward. And there are opportunities as we improve our assortments in the second quarter. ","Operator","The next question is from Oliver Chen from Cowen. ","Oliver Chen ","The in-store inventories are really attractively down -- it really seems like there could be opportunities for you to explore optimization of space within your stores, or the new categories or continuing to enhance the cash drop. Could you speak to some guardrails or frameworks you're thinking about as you embark on just making sure you maximize the real estate space that you have, or what you'll think about square footage to maximize ROIC given that there could be some opportunities there? Thank you. ","Michael O'Sullivan","Oliver, it\u2019s Michael O'Sullivan. It\u2019s a good question because as you know over the last several years we've reduced average inventory in-store by about 40%. So this is a question we've actually been working on for some time and we've been using the extra space that we've created, if you like, in stores to really look at three things. One is make the stores easier to shop just by organizing the store in an easier shop way. Secondly, expanding into faster growing or new categories, and then thirdly, when it comes to new stores, be more flexible in terms of the store size of the new store openings. So I would say we\u2019re actually pursuing a mix of all three in terms of, as you say, optimizing how we're using the space. ","Operator","Your next question is from Marni Shapiro from Retail Tracker. ","Marni Shapiro ","Hey everybody, congratulations on a great quarter, especially given the environment out there. As you guys are looking out, you\u2019re one of the few opening stores still and there are a lot of people closing stores. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing on the rent and I guess even the relief side beyond 2017 and I suppose even part of 2018 for your stores? ","Michael O'Sullivan","Sure, Marni. We're very happy with the availability of the real estate locations that we've seeing. And if you will appreciate, typically the real estate locations we're seeing now really feed the pipeline for the next two or three years. So we're pretty happy with that outlook. As you say, there aren't many retailers out there who are opening 80 to 90 new stores a year. So therefore landlords are pretty happy to see us. We have a great real estate team, a great network and they have done a nice job of finding new locations. ","In terms of rents and occupancy costs, we're certainly taking opportunities where they exist to negotiate and renegotiate those. But I would say that for the most part, rents and occupancy are fairly stable at this point.","Operator","The next question is from Lindsay Drucker Mann from Goldman Sachs. ","Lindsay Drucker Mann ","Thanks; good afternoon everyone. Coming off of the first quarter was especially challenging for a number of large retailers, department stores specifically with that negative traffic and tough comps. Barbara, can you talk about how that affects your business, what you're seeing in the marketplace or in your business that might be a spillover related to the broader macro?","Barbara Rentler","Sure. What we're seeing in the marketplace is there's a lot of availability. It's pretty broad based and as you know availability is often the result of department stores not making their plan in their forecast so that's the one thing we\u2019d see in the immediate. In the future obviously it gives us an opportunity as the department store business is challenging to gain more market share. ","Lindsay Drucker Mann ","And if I could follow up, I think as we started -- as we exited in 4Q and you were looking at 1Q, you had a cautious tone given at what seemed to be a slower start to the quarter. Could you talk a bit about how the quarter played out and ultimately allowed you to beat your initial target?","Michael Hartshorn","Sure, Lindsay. In terms of trends during the quarter certainly like you saw I think across the retail landscape, sales strengthened as we moved through the quarter. ","Operator","The next question is from Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley. ","Kimberly Greenberger ","Great, thanks so much. I was wondering, looking back to February, did you have any sort of impact on your business from the delay in tax refunds. And I wasn't sure if you might have had an opportunity to quantify that or not. And then Barbara, you talked about sales gains were relatively broad based across most merchandise categories and regions here in the first quarter. Were there areas where you saw some, let's say, improving momentum in your business where you see opportunity to really maximize in any of those categories as we go through the rest of the year? Thank you. ","Michael Hartshorn","Sure, Kimberly, it\u2019s Michael Hartshorn. The delay in tax refunds, it certainly wasn't a positive for the quarter, the volatility made it a little bit more challenging to plan and operate the business. It's hard to say, though, if there was a negative impact to the overall quarter from the refunds. I'll give you some stats also on regional performance for us, Southeast, Florida and the Midwest were the top performing regions, the Midwest continues to be very strong region for us as it's been a top performing region for over three years. I\u2019d call out other major markets; California was slightly below the chain average given the unfavorable weather with the storms during the quarter. Texas performed in line with the chain and that's an improvement from the second half of 2016 when it was below the chain average. ","Barbara Rentler","And then Kimberly in terms of areas that are improving the momentum, the sales really were pretty broad based throughout the company. Ladies continues to make progress, the ladies business is always a challenging business and there's really no major sales trends or the fashion trends out there unless you really have weather to drive it particularly in Q1, ladies continues to be a challenge, but we do feel like we're improving on our execution and so we continue to do -- we need to do, our expectation is better, we would improve it as we get into the second quarter but again there is -- one of the real problems in ladies is there is no real overriding fashion trends to drive it. ","Operator","The next question is from Bob Drbul from Guggenheim.","Bob Drbul ","I was just wondering there's a lot of discussion around certain vendors that are trying to pull back from the off-price channel, and are you seeing any of that in your discussions and can you maybe just talk to any other new brand opportunities that you're seeing or categories that are becoming more available to you?","Barbara Rentler","Sure. Yes, I know there's been a lot of discussion about vendors wanting to pull back. But we haven't really seen that. We continue to see plenty of branded bargains in the marketplace and quite frankly vendors have strategies that have fluctuated over time and we do business with over 8000 vendors so we've been able to successfully navigate over the years through all of these changes. ","In terms of new brands, we really wouldn't talk about brands, specific brands on the call and same thing pretty much for new categories where we are testing. ","Operator","The next question is from Paul Lejuez from Citigroup. ","Paul Lejuez ","Can you talk about how wages impacted your earnings growth this quarter versus what you expect over the next several quarters and even looking out beyond 2017? Thanks. ","Michael Hartshorn","Sure, Paul. We expect wages to abate in the second half of the year as we anniversary the most recent wage increases that took place in last year's second quarter for us. So our guidance, though, still for the year assumes an SG&A leverage point at about 3% which is in line with historical averages. ","Michael O'Sullivan","Further out, I think you asked about beyond 2017, it\u2019s hard for us to be precise beyond the current year, but we've taken the view that wage pressure is probably going to be around for the next several years. Certainly in some of the major states that we're in as legislation that's already been passed that pushes up the minimum wage over the next several years. So we're expecting continued wage pressure but it's hard to be precise about that. ","Paul Lejuez ","I think you guys are looking for a flattish merch margin for the year. Has the first quarter experienced or buying environment changed that view at all? Just curious what your outlook is on merch margin specifically. ","Michael Hartshorn","No, we haven't changed our outlook, Paul, even though we exceeded merch margins by 15 basis points during the quarter, though that was primarily driven by above plan sales which allowed us to leverage markdowns and drive the business with close-outs. Just after one quarter we wouldn\u2019t change our outlook for the year. ","Operator","The next question is from Matthew Boss from J.P. Morgan. ","Matthew Boss ","So I guess just to piggyback on that, as we think about the gross margin line longer term, you've taken the inventory down 40% as you outlined. Do you see further opportunity on the inventory front and is it best to think about at this level of comp flattish gross margins as a whole? And then just one micro on the freight, what is the headwind, what's the magnitude in the second quarter? I know you outlined that.","Michael Hartshorn","So we didn't say specifically on the basis point impact though, beginning in Q4 we did -- have seen a tightening of carrier rates as well as fuel costs that are up against some very low levels last year. Right now we expect freight cost to be a headwind for the remainder of the year and that's reflected in our guidance. ","Michael O'Sullivan","In terms of your question about the outlook for gross margin, there are really three things that have helped us drive gross margin improvement over the past several years. The inventory reductions we've taken have obviously helped us to drive down markdowns that's been an important component. Improvements in our shortage control, the investments we've made there again have helped to drive up gross margin. And then the third component has been ahead of plan sales driving obviously ahead of plan terms. As we look forward, of those three, I think there's limited opportunity left in the first two, the inventory reduction and the shortage control. We'll continue to manage those tightly but I think realistically there's a limit to what more we can do. So most of the growth on gross margin going forward is going to have to come from the sales line in terms of ahead of plan sales. ","Operator","The next question is from Adrienne Yih from Wolfe Research. ","Adrienne Yih Tennant ","Good afternoon and I'll add my congratulations, nicely done. My question is on the home category. I was wondering there's obviously some of your competitors are expanding into that category more aggressively and actually wanting a secondary concept here in the United States. I was wondering what your plans are with your home sales. You obviously have a better quarter, your sales coming from there, if you can help us with the strategy there. Thank you very much.","Barbara Rentler","Sure. Home has actually been one of our strongest categories over the last couple of years and we believe that there is further opportunity to grow the business. But for competitive reasons we wouldn't disclose the specific target. ","Operator","The next question is from David Mann from Johnson Rice. ","David Mann ","Question about your distribution centers, you made a lot of investment I guess in the last couple of years. You're starting to see some benefit. Where are you in terms of the opportunity to leverage those investments and improve productivity? How much longer do you think you can get gains there?","Michael Hartshorn","Sure, David. So in the first quarter DC is levered by about 15 basis points and that was all due to both efficiencies in the DCs and also fixed cost leverage. So we would certainly over the next couple years expect to see \u2013 add some ability to lever the fixed costs there as we don't expect additional significant investments for the next couple of years. ","Operator","The next question is from Laura Champine from Roe Equity Research. ","Laura Champine ","Thanks for taking my question. In California where you\u2019ve got your highest density of stores, do you think that market is maturing? And along those lines as we look at next year store openings, will those be more focused in the Midwest or other lesser penetrated markets?","Michael Hartshorn","In terms of California, we continue to see comps there certainly over the last couple years, I mean we've obviously been in the market for thirty years and we continue to comp. So we continue to believe we have the opportunity to comp stores there. ","Michael O'Sullivan","In terms of the breakdown of our new store openings, I don't think that's going to change materially. I mean, from year to year you could see a small adjustment. But I don't expect to see a material change. So the way to think about it is about a third of our new stores, more or less are in the Midwest, about a third are in sort of existing, if you like, Ross markets outside the Midwest. And then the remainder are dd's new openings. ","Operator","The next question is from Brian Tunick from RBC. ","Brian Tunick ","I was curious regarding your stores located near the liquidation areas of Macy's or Sears and Kmart. Just any comments regarding how your stores performed in those areas and have you thought about doing any kind of proactive marketing events with what J.C. Penney will be doing coming up in the second quarter? Thanks very much. ","Michael Hartshorn","Sure, Brian. The closures were fairly recent and late in the quarter, so the impact would have been barely minor to the quarter. Over the long term, though, fewer stores, fewer competitors certainly create more market share opportunities for us which should be a positive factor for the business. ","Operator","The next question is from Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo. ","Ike Boruchow ","Michael, just to close the loop on gross margin, I mean the compares get a little bit more difficult as the year progresses. How should we -- is there anything we should keep in mind in our models on the gross margin line and do you expect flat to up the remainder of the year? And is there something embedded in your fiscal year guide just on the gross margin line? Just to help us out.","Michael Hartshorn","No, I wouldn't change anything that we said in our initial call, Ike, earlier in the year that we expect going into the year that we expected merchandise margins to be relatively flat. And to call out at this point that we think freight will be a headwind to the remainder of the year. ","Ike Boruchow ","[Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Mike Baker from Deutsche Bank. ","Michael Baker ","I wanted to ask about the online competition and I think it's clear that you guys are taking share from department stores and online may not be impacting you, you can see the comp. I guess how do you know that your customers wouldn\u2019t buy from you online? What have you done to ask your customers, perhaps you\u2019re losing some share or leaving some sales on the table without the online? But I know economically it doesn't work right for you but are your customers demanding it at all?","Michael O'Sullivan","We haven't had any -- we certainly haven't had any communication from customers that they are demanding e-commerce from Ross, and that's mainly because of the type of business we run. I mean it's important to keep in mind we're a moderate off-priced retailer, a low average unit retail round about $10. So as you mentioned, Mike, the economics really don't work. We offer a very broad assortment which again is hard to replicate online and a treasure hunt environment which again is very difficult to replicate outside of a bricks and mortar format. So overall we feel like it's very difficult for an online retailer even if that retailer was us, to sort of compete with what we offer in our stores. That's not to say that it's not important for us to monitor what's going on online and to monitor online competitors and we do that all the time. ","Michael Baker ","If I could just follow up, so you said you haven't had any communication with your customers. But have you asked them, in what way would you ask your customers, I guess if we did have an online site, is that something that would be attractive to you?","Michael O'Sullivan","I think it is hard to know how you would actually get asked that question other than looking at our business, and if we saw our business start to fall off and we diagnosed that and found the customers were buying online rather than coming into our stores, buying online from other people rather than coming into my stores, I mean that would be a clear indicator for us. Clearly based on the strength of our business we're not seeing that trend. ","Operator","Your next question is from Simeon Siegel from Nomura\/Instinet. ","Simeon Siegel ","Has the concentration of your top vendors changed at all over the past year or so? Do you expect any shift in their percentage composition going forward? And then just to your point about the macro challenges and tougher compares, any color on what you'd expect the comp cadence to look like in the back half? Thanks. ","Barbara Rentler","On the concentration of top vendors, I would say probably similar year over year without having that exact number in front of me. The supply lines have been pretty broad based development but I think that there aren't any real challenges there. And can you just repeat the second part of the question on the macro economics \u2013 ","Simeon Siegel ","Yes, just thinking -- what you expect the comp cadence to look like in the back half, I think at the end of your prepared remarks, I think you mentioned the tougher compares and just the macro environment for the rest of the year. ","Michael Hartshorn","No, we will give \u2013 we will update the back half comp when we give our release in August. I\u2019ll just you to, when we started the year we expected one to two, so it would be pretty similar across the rest of the year. ","Operator","And next question is from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group. ","Dana Telsey ","As you are thinking about inventory, how do you think about the composition of packaways going forward and what your outlook is for it? And then when you think about real estate costs and new store openings, given the current real estate environment, is rental cost or lease expense at all more flexible today than it was in the past? Thank you. ","Barbara Rentler","I\u2019ll talk about packaway first. So in terms of packaway going forward, packaway are our opportunistic purchases, so it\u2019s kind of hard to predict where the packaway will come from or what the composition will be. What I would say is that the criteria for putting goods into pathway, the values that we want to put out later on in the year after we sell the goods, is really the main criteria. So it's kind of really hard to predict the classifications or the amount quite, frankly, it fluctuates. ","Michael O'Sullivan","And then on the second question, Dana, on real estate. I would say truth is that store closures in the strip mall environment have been a feature for several years now, whether it's office supply retailers or sporting goods retailers or electronics retailers going out of business. So I would say that it's really more of the same right now. I would say that rental costs and occupancy costs have stabilized but I think a lot of the impact that you've seen from store closures has actually happened over the last few years. ","Barbara Rentler","And just to add one thing about packaway, we feel very good about the content of our current packaway that we own today. ","Dana Telsey ","And as you think about diversification of the merchandise mix, over the next few years what do you -- how do you see the mix diversifying? ","Barbara Rentler","Between the different types of products you mean, home \u2013 ","Dana Telsey ","Yes exactly. ","Barbara Rentler","But we feel good about home, we feel that we have growth at home but the past that I wouldn't talk about that on the call. What I would say is that we think there's opportunities broad based throughout the entire box.","End of Q&A","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Barbara Rentler for closing comments. ","Barbara Rentler","Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores. Have a great day. ","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
