My name is Dennis, and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call.","[Audio Gap]","call is being recorded today, Tuesday, October 16, 2012. Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.","Dane Holmes","Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Director of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call.","Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm's belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain and outside of the firm's control. The firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 2011.","I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets and Global Core Excess. And you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that is posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com.","This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent.","Our Chief Financial Officer, David Viniar, will now review the firm's results with Harvey Schwartz who will assume David's role at the end of January. David?","David A. Viniar","Thanks, Dane. I'd like to thank all of you for listening today. I'll give an overview of our third quarter results and Harvey will review our business performance.","Net revenues were $8.4 billion and net earnings were $1.5 billion. Earnings per diluted share were $2.85 and our annualized return on common equity was 8.6%. Year-to-date, our annualized return on common equity was 8.8%.","The third quarter operating environment included continuing concerns about the outlook for the global economy, particularly as it relates to the situation in Europe. The uncertainty surrounding economic prospects has weighed on the psychology of corporate leaders and investors, negatively impacting the current operating environment in 2 principal ways.","Corporate client activity continued to be relatively weak in the third quarter. Industrywide, announced M&A volumes declined 16% sequentially and IPO volumes were nearly cut in half. In addition, New York Stock Exchange volumes were down 13% sequentially, while LSC volumes were down 23%.","An additional impact of economic uncertainty and weak investor conviction is the tendency for investors to transact in the most liquid and commoditized portion of the market. This dynamic is evident within both the FICC and equities franchises, as demonstrated by the significance of index product volumes in credit and equities.","Although client activity remains muted, there were some favorable developments during the third quarter. The United States Federal Reserve announced a further increase in monetary stimulus, and the ECB stated that it would support the euro and was prepared to make outright purchases in the secondary bond market to address severe distortion in government bond markets.","Since the ECB's pronouncements, Spain and Italy's 5-year CDS spreads have each tightened by over 200 basis points, reflecting the market's diminished view that a tail event will emanate out of Europe. While these positive developments have created some optimism in the marketplace, we as a management team remained focused on guiding the firm through a continued difficult operating environment. We are serving our leading client franchise, managing our risk profile prudently and being disciplined about capital usage and operating expenses.","Harvey will now review each of our businesses. Harvey?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Thanks, David.","Investment Banking produced third quarter net revenues of $1.2 billion, down 3% from second quarter results. Third quarter advisory revenues were $509 million, up 9% from the second quarter. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in announced and completed M&A globally. We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the third quarter, including Amylin Pharmaceuticals' $7 billion sale to Bristol-Myers Squibb; NDS group's $5 billion sale to Cisco; and CGI Group's $3.2 billion acquisition of Logica. We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the third quarter, including Nexen's $19 billion sale to CNOOC; Amerigroup's $4.9 billion sale to WellPoint; and Fraser & Neave's $4.5 billion sale, with interest in Asia Pacific Breweries, to Heineken.","Third quarter underwriting net revenues were $655 million, down 11% sequentially. Equity underwriting revenues of $189 million were down 21% from the second quarter, reflecting weaker IPO activity. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs was ranked first in global equity and equity-related and common stock offerings. Debt underwriting revenues decreased 6% to $466 million.","During the quarter, we participated in many noteworthy underwriting transactions, including Whole Logic's $3.5 billion combination term loan and high-yield notes offering; Dollar General's $2.1 billion follow-on offering; and Seadrill's $1 billion high-yield note offering. Our Investment Banking backlog decreased slightly from the end of the second quarter levels but remains higher than the end of 2011.","Let me now turn to Institutional Client Services which is comprised of FICC and equities client execution, commissions and fees, as well as security services. Net revenues were $4.2 billion in the third quarter.","FICC Client Execution net revenues were $2.2 billion in the third quarter and included a DVA loss of $225 million. Excluding the impact of DVA, revenues were up 11% sequentially. Our rates business benefited from improved client risk appetite related to central bank activity during the quarter. Mortgages was aided by improving housing fundamentals and strong customer demand. Credit results reflected solid client activity levels. Commodities and currencies were both negatively impacted by continued low levels of volatility and volumes.","Turning to Equities which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and securities services. Net revenues for the third quarter were $2 billion and included $145 million in DVA losses. Excluding the impact of DVA, revenues were up 26% sequentially.","Equities client execution revenues increased 66% sequentially to $847 million, reflecting a more benign market-making environment. Commissions and fees were $721 million, down 7% from second quarter on lower volumes. Securities services net revenues of $392 million were down 4% from the seasonally stronger second quarter.","Turning to risk. Average daily value at risk in the third quarter was $81 million, down 12% relative to the second quarter.","Let me now review Investing & Lending, which produced net revenues of $1.8 billion in the third quarter. Our investment in ICBC produced a gain of $99 million in the quarter. Other equity investments generated net revenues of $824 million, reflecting gains that were primarily driven by private equity investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $558 million, largely driven by a more favorable credit market, with tightening credit spreads and interest income. Other revenues of $323 million were primarily driven by the firm's investment in consolidated investment entities.","Switching to Investment Management. We reported third quarter net revenues of $1.2 billion, down 10% sequentially as the firm booked onetime incentive fees related to the sale of our client's remaining investment in ICBC in the second quarter. Management and other fees were consistent with the second quarter at $1 billion. During the third quarter, assets under management increased $20 billion to $856 billion due to market appreciation.","Now moving on to our expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as payroll taxes and benefits, was accrued at a compensation-to-net revenues ratio of 44%. This is consistent with the firm's accrual for the first half of 2012.","Third quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.4 billion. We continue to be focused on our cost-saving initiatives, and year-to-date, our non-compensation expenses are running 10% lower than the first 3 quarters of 2011.","Total staff at the end of the third quarter was approximately 32,600, relatively flat with the second quarter of 2012.","Our year-to-date effective tax rate was 33.5%.","During the quarter, we repurchased 11.8 million shares of common stock for a total cost of $1.25 billion. Today, we also announced an increase in our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.46 to $0.50 per share.","Now let me turn it back to David to make some concluding remarks.","David A. Viniar","Thanks, Harvey.","As a management team, we are keenly aware of the fact that we cannot control the broader economic environment in which we operate. As we've said many times in the past, the firm will perform at its best and our shareholders will benefit to the greatest degree when we're in a more robust economic environment. However, a difficult operating environment does not absolve us from our responsibility to manage everything that is within our control to create best-in-class returns over the long term.","We must be disciplined in managing both our operating expenses and capital levels. As it relates to operating expenses, we have to balance lowering costs and maintaining high levels of client service. In the second quarter of 2011, we announced a $1.2 billion expense reduction initiative. Since that initial announcement, we've increased the target expense savings by nearly 60% to $1.9 billion. We believe that we've been able to undertake these initiatives without materially impacting our client franchise. And as a consequence, we should be well positioned to create operating leverage in an improved economic environment.","Regarding capital management, we've been extremely focused on balancing the competing objectives of returning excess capital to shareholders with the prudence associated with maintaining conservative risk-adjusted capitalization in a difficult operating environment with undefined capital rules. Since the onset of the financial crisis, our risk-based capital measures have remained at or near the top of the industry. While Basel III capital rules are not finalized and will not be fully phased-in for many years, our best estimate from what we know today is that, at the end of the third quarter, our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio would be approximately 8.5%. We expect that we will ultimately operate with a capital cushion in the proximity of 100 basis points versus our regulatory requirement.","We've remained committed to maintaining a conservative financial profile and have a deep appreciation for the strategic benefits, both opportunistically and defensively, that come with maintaining robust capital levels. While not wavering from that view, we've been able to repurchase $9.1 billion of common stock since the beginning of 2011 and have reduced our basic share count by 11%. As Basel III rules have started to be finalized and we are closer to implementation, we've begun to focus on optimizing our balance sheet in preparation for these changes. We've previously announced that we expected $88 billion of risk-weighted assets to passively roll off by 2015, and we have begun to roll out the necessary tools to facilitate a more active approach to mitigating risk-weighted assets.","We're committed to managing our operations, with a focus on serving our clients effectively. As a result, we manage our expenses and capital, with the understanding that our shareholders have invested in this franchise, with the expectation that we will outperform over the long term.","With that, we'd like to thank you again for listening today. And now, Harvey and I are happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So I -- you noted the 11% share count reduction since the end of '11. I just want to ask maybe semantics on the quarter. Share count was down almost 2% in the quarter, but it's only down about 2% year-to-date. Is that a function of the stock going back up and just that fully diluted options count?","David A. Viniar","I think it -- that's partially what's in it. And the way diluted and basic share count work is a little bit different, Glenn, as I think you know. Basic is a point in time, diluted is an average over the period. So you -- and diluted is what we use for EPS, basic is used for book value per share. So you just have to be a little careful when you're comparing those numbers. And we're happy to get you the breakdown of all of them, if you like.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","That -- no problem. I'm -- the question is more of, you've been buying back at a nice pace and it's made a good dent in the share counts over the course of the last 2 years. You just saw less of it. And I know I'm doing apples and orange. I'm asking specifically in the quarter, I would have thought the fully diluted share count might have been down more year-to-date, and I just don't know if that's just a function of more shares going into the fully diluted count just because of improvement in the shares.","David A. Viniar","Why don't we do the calculation and we'll come back to it?","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","No worries. On Investing & Lending, anything you can tell us on realized versus unrealized because I heard your comments about private equity on the equity line, but just curious on what's realized versus unrealized.","David A. Viniar","I don't have the exact numbers. There was more unrealized than realized. Many of the private was unrealized. And we told you it was primarily -- although a lot of that -- part of that was based on performance, part of that was based on the markets and part of that was based on events happening even within private companies, but it was more unrealized than realized.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then on the $1.9 billion, I mean, to me this is maybe a little more art than not, but how much of that is actually been able to make its way to the P&L yet? Because a lot of this comes through headcount-related items that kind of linger as that phases through. So what is still on the COM [ph] on that $1.9 billion into the P&L?","David A. Viniar","Most of that has been realized or, if not, will be realized by the end of the year. Virtually all of it will be realized by the end of the year. Now remember, part of that is non-comp, part of that has to do with people. And it's not -- and that -- it doesn't include reducing compensation, right? It would only be reduction of the compensation of people who are no longer here. But all of that either has been or will be realized by the end of this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Roger Freeman with Barclays.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just -- I guess, on -- your liquidity levels are still running kind of right up around record levels. And just thinking through the still-cautious approach to managing balance sheet, capital, it feels -- is this level something that over time comes down meaningfully or we going to see as the sort of permanently higher level of liquidity? I assume -- I mean, I assume this is a peak level, but at -- what kind of range relative to where you used to run, which I think was like 1\/4 or 1\/2 of this, do you think it may eventually get back to?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Well, this is Harvey, Roger. So what I'll say is, if you think about the current environment, well, David, in our opening remarks, highlighted the fact that there's certainly been some positive events globally. It's still a market environment where we're remaining pretty defensive. So I think it'd be really difficult to give you a sense of how the forward liquidity profile would look. But I think you should assume that we'll stay conservative for the time being, certainly.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just your -- you said, I think, you'd anticipate running, on a Basel III capital ratio basis, your Tier 1 common at 100 basis points or so, a sort of buffer to your requirement. Is that to -- should we assume that you kind of build to that buffer and in the meantime kind of remain at your -- I guess, your pattern of not buying in excess of the net income before you were to do anything more meaningful, if you chose to do that?","David A. Viniar","Look I think it's a fair assumption that we will build to that buffer. Remember, the full Basel III requirements are not in until 2019 so there's a long time till those requirements are in. Now it's not to say we're not going to get there till then. I'm sure we'll get there well before that. But yes, I think it's fair to assume that we will build to that buffer, and I think it's also fair to assume -- you can't look at any quarter, or even any year, but over time, it's not likely that we're going to buy back more than our net income. That would -- that's not a prudent way and you can't really operate on that basis. In any quarter, we might. In any year, we might. But over time, we're not going to.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then on the -- still staying with the private equity portfolio: Where do you think you are in terms of wanting to monetize a lot of that? Because it's probably pretty seasoned at this point. And obviously, other private equity firms are trying to, where they can. Should we see -- expect to see that pick up?","David A. Viniar","I -- we will monetize as opportunities arise. I don't think -- we're not in a mode of forcing monetization before it makes sense, but when opportunities arise and we think there's good transaction that can be done, then we'll monetize them.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And lastly, maybe Harvey, the Equities business had a nice sequential comparison. I suspect a lot of that was equity derivatives. Can you talk a little bit to how sort of broad-based that was or if that was -- if it's pretty sort of chunky-structured equity derivatives? Any color there?","Harvey M. Schwartz","There was -- it was a more benign environment for trading in terms of risk management. So that was certainly prevalent in the numbers, but overall, it was really broad-based performance. And we really benefited from the global footprint and diversification of the businesses from brokers all the way through execution.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","David, Harvey, just on the risk-weighted asset mitigation. David, if I look at the backdrop, on one hand, there appears to be a really strong bid for credit, mortgage. Other things will be higher rated. And then on the other hand, we're seeing some clarity to Basel 2.5 and III rules coming into focus. So I was just hoping you could comment on the environment and maybe your appetite to perhaps accelerate risk-weighted asset optimization or other opportunities, maybe dispose of them, given those 2 dynamics, if you agree with them.","David A. Viniar","I think the real answer, Howard, is we're just going to have to see over time. As I said, we're just beginning to roll out the tools to do it. In the quarter that we've really just started, our Basel III ratio, again as best as we can calculate it, there's still a lot of assumptions, up by 0.5%. And I'm not saying that's going to happen every quarter. But I think, when we give our traders the tools to optimize and figure out what securities or what derivatives are better to hold, what things are better to hedge with, some things that don't make sense they will sell, some things they will keep and just keep in different forms, I think we'll probably start making some substantial progress.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then a follow-up on the revised Basel III guidance -- that's very helpful. Just 2 follow-up questions. Does the 8.5% and the 100 bps buffer, does that incorporate the G-SED [ph] buffer? And then how does internal model approval factor into that guidance?","David A. Viniar","Well, the 8.5% is where we are approximately today and the 100 basis points buffer will be from whatever our full requirement is which, as you know, we don't know yet. But whatever that is -- yes, and again, don't hold me to it. It's not going to be exactly 100 basis points. It will be in that range and it will bounce up a little higher and a little lower and -- but that's around where we're going to run.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then I just wanted to revisit this one last time. Just if we look at this quarter's results, the firm remains in that \"liquidity high, risk low\" type of profile. I mean the pressure around the central bank actions, the progress in Europe that you noted, David. Is there -- was there any change in that outlook as you exited the quarter? And if not, what are you specifically looking for to make that call to maybe rebalance and remix a little bit between the liquidity and the risk?","David A. Viniar","So first thing, most important thing, is what our clients do. And so again, there's -- as our clients get more active, we will have more opportunities to take risk, and we probably will to some extent. But there's still -- the -- while activity might have picked up a little bit towards the end of the quarter, it was certainly not a very, very large increase at all. And second of all, the traders themselves have to be more comfortable that the market environments are being driven by economics, as opposed to by politics, and I think maybe you've had a slight shift to that but not a big shift at all. So I think those are the things to really look for.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan.","Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I -- on your Tier 1 guidance of 2013, you said 10%. Now you're running at 8.5% at the moment.","Just wondering if there's any change to that 10%. And second question on capital in that respect is regarding the $89 billion (sic) [$88 billion] of runoff that you've indicated between 2011 to 2013 in one of the presentations earlier this year. Was wondering if you could give us an update of how much of the $89 billion (sic) [$88 billion] you've done. And how would this $89 billion (sic) [$88 billion] look like, including additional active mitigation?","David A. Viniar","Okay. So let me just clarify, Kian: What we said for the end of 2013 was not that we were going to run at 10%. This is just pure math. We said, if you take where we are now, if you assume the consensus estimates for us and you assume just the passive roll-off of assets, so no active mitigation, that would get us to 10% with nothing else: no buybacks, no equity issuance through comp. So just pure math, that gets you to 10%. So that's what the 10% number is, I just want to clarify. And as far as the roll-off, again, that $88 billion is through 2015. That's what all the roll-off would be through 2015 and that was largely from basically 6 securitized assets from tranche credit in the correlation book and the mortgage book. So again, that's just to clarify what those numbers were. As far as the active mitigation, we're going to have to see. I mean, that's -- it's hard to put a number on that. As I said to the last question, we've just started to roll out the tools for that. We made a lot of progress in one quarter, and we'll see. History tells us that we do a pretty good job of optimizing these positions as the rules get more clarified and as our traders have the right tools, but we'll see over time.","Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And in terms of internal models, are your internal models all at approval stages? Or are there still outstanding internal models for your calculation? Are you giving us a number including internal models that you assume will be approved or -- by the Fed, or is that excluded and that could be on top? And if it's on top, how much would that be in terms of risk-weighted asset decline?","David A. Viniar","Again, it's very hard, very hard to calculate. There are some models that have been approved, there are others that are in process and there are many more that we will then go to the Fed. And as they get approved, if they get approved, then it will help the ratios. And if they don't, then we'll have to do more mitigation. And we'll just have to see over time with what, as well.","Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","What's your thought on CoCos, on top of the regulatory requirement and the 100 basis points? Do you think you need CoCos or you will participate in CoCos?","David A. Viniar","Those are not included in any of the numbers that I gave you. And again, we'll have to see what regulations are and what's allowed and what's not allowed, and then we'll make our decisions at the time.","Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Lastly, investments. Where do you see investment opportunities in terms of staff numbers and in terms of capital?","David A. Viniar","Well, look, we've said this before. In the -- certainly, in the medium term, we think that there are -- although it will be far from a straight line up, we think that the growth markets continue to provide very good medium- to long-term opportunities for the firm. As you know, we do best where there is good growth, where there's good economic growth. It is pretty clear that there's going to be better economic growth in some of the growth markets than in some of the developed markets, and so those are places where we will continue invest. It's not going to be a straight line up. That's not to say we're not going to invest in the developed markets as well. The U.S. market, the European markets where we think, despite some of the economic issues, there are very good near-term opportunities for our business are places that we will invest as the markets get better over time. But certainly, over the longer period of time, I'd say the growth markets probably will have more investment.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of questions, one on the equity line. I'm just wondering, how much did Knight contribute to the line this quarter?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So as I said before, the equity line in the business was quite diversified. As reported in the press, we did execute the Knight transaction and we were quite pleased to be able to work with Knight to help them manage that risk profile. But at this stage, we won't speak specifically about that transaction or any other transactions as it relates to its contribution to the line.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then your equity VaR efficiency obviously went up significantly in the quarter, right, since -- given the revenues. And then the equity VaR was down Q-on-Q. So should we -- you're kind of suggesting that, that level of VaR efficiency should persist into the future. Is that a fair takeaway?","David A. Viniar","That is a very hard question to answer. We -- I bet you, if you looked at our revenue-to-VaR, it was different every quarter since we've been a public company. So I -- so it can be very hard for me to say it's going to continue at that level. Clearly, it was a better environment, that's why we said it's more broad-based, but there will be quarters when it will be better and some where it won't.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then on the -- just one more question on the Basel III. So you indicated that you were -- 8.5% has some model approval in it, and if the regulators have not approved your models, then that is not embedded within the 8.5%. Is that an accurate representation of what you said?","David A. Viniar","Yes. That is largely accurate, yes.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And the CRM model approval, is that -- has that been approved or...","David A. Viniar","Betsy, how about, if you want a lot of details about this, we get back to you and go through it with you?","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, fine. And then just lastly on the share count. The Buffett-related warrants came back into the share count this quarter, isn't that right?","David A. Viniar","To some extent, yes. That -- again, that goes with share price. The way that works is, as the share price goes up and gets closer to $115 and, obviously, above $115, they start to come in and then they continue to come in more as the share price goes up.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I know David, you've often said, \"Live to fight another day,\" over the past year or so. And I noticed that your VaR went down from $92 million to $81 million, link quarter. So -- and Harvey, if you have anything to share on this too -- are you still conducting with an attitude \"Live to fight another day?\" Is reduction in VaR evidence of that, or is reduction of VaR evidence of simply lower volatility? And when are you willing to take on more risk?","David A. Viniar","So I'll answer, Mike. I mean, the answer to both those questions are yes and yes and yes -- I guess, to all 3 of them. There was somewhat-lower volatility that contributed as well. But I think that, really, it's back to what I said before: Our clients are not that active and so there aren't that many opportunities. And as far as the people on the frontline too aren't actually taking the risk, there's still so much political uncertainty out there that's driving markets. A speech by politician x or politician y drives markets up or down as much as any economic situation. And in that environment, it's very hard to have conviction and very hard to take risk both for our clients and for us. And I think, until you see that change a little bit, you won't really see our risk go up dramatically.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","If you were to neutralize the effect of lower volatility, would your VaR have gone down or would it have been flat?","David A. Viniar","I believe it still would have gone down somewhat. And I can come back to you with the exact amount.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","But just, conceptually, you pulled back risk even more than you had last quarter. Did anything get incrementally worse that caused you to do that, then?","Harvey M. Schwartz","No. As David said, what really drives risk-taking in the franchised businesses is the client activity. And if you think back to the beginning of the quarter, there was still a fair bit of uncertainty that clients were dealing with and, even now, the discussions around fiscal cliff and everything else. This is a difficult environment for clients because they're very happy to transact and execute on fundamentals, but positioning their own capital against a backdrop of high policy risk creates a conservative environment. So there's certainly no specific efforts to drive down risk-taking, it's really a reflection of the volumes and client appetite, as David said.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And then lastly, so far this quarter, client activity, you've mentioned, started last quarter, pulling back risk. Are you maybe thinking of taking more risk? Or are flows better now than they were for last quarter?","Harvey M. Schwartz","I think it's too early to really extrapolate much from the first couple of weeks. But as we've seen in the U.S., equity volumes have been down a touch, and we'll just have to see how the quarter progresses.","David A. Viniar","So far, it's largely been more of the same.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.","[Technical Difficulty]","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","small, but it was the second one this year, so...","David A. Viniar","Brennan, we missed the beginning of what you said, so maybe you could start over?","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So I know that dividend increase was small, but it was the second increase this year. So I guess I was just curious whether or not that was part of the CCAR plan initially. Or was it a choice to shift a small amount of money from buybacks to the dividend? And if that's any kind of indication of anything...","David A. Viniar","No, it was consistent with our CCAR approval. And again, while it was small, it was -- we've gotten feedback from our shareholders that they would like it, but I think you should expect, going forward, that much more of our capital planning will be around buybacks. Not to say we won't increase dividends again, but the big portion of our capital planning will be around buybacks.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, okay, great. Also, is there any way -- or could you give us any updated way to think about core or recurring revenue within the I&L line? I know it's tricky, but any color you could give there might be helpful.","David A. Viniar","It's very hard to do. It is somewhat driven by markets, by credit spreads, also by the performance of our specific investments matters. So I think that one is very, very hard to predict, going forward. If I gave you a number, I would really be making it up.","Harvey M. Schwartz","The way I would think about it is, as a result of the Business Standards Committee, when we reframed the financials, it was really an effort on our part to give you more transparency.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Sure. I was just trying to think of whether or not there's -- there were a certain amount of income that kicks off from the dividends and yield and such that you could think about as sort of a baseline number.","David A. Viniar","There's a few hundred million dollars of interest income that's in there, and something like that will be every quarter. But I think that will largely be overwhelmed by some of the movements in the other positions. That's in there and that will be in there, plus or minus a little bit, every quarter.","Harvey M. Schwartz","It's really going to be -- it's really more driven by asset prices.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Sure, okay. And then last one for me is, as far as the pending swaps clearing rules, when you guys are thinking about this coming into effect here in the next few quarters, do you think that the buffering current pricing of the product works given the enlargement in capital requirements? And how do you see this playing out? How are discussions with your clients going as far as changing? Do you think that the change will be more on the product innovation side, or the pricing side? How do you think about that?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Well, when we think about clearing -- as you know, we've been big supporters of clearing. We think it's fundamental to systemic risk reduction. So we've been big proponents, moving clearing forward as quickly as possible. And against that backdrop, we've been building and developing in our business the ability to provide client clearing and the tools and technology and appropriate staff. I'd say that it's probably too early to tell ultimately where we come out with pricing. Like a lot of things, I think there'll be a fair degree of early competition. But we're really in the early innings of this so we'll have to see how the revenue model evolves. But I think the biggest issue is that it fundamentally makes the system safer. And I think -- over time, again difficult to speculate, I think -- as we get clarity around regulatory reform, I think all of these pieces, as they come together, could contribute to greater volumes. So again, difficult to model the revenue outcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","David, you mentioned that the backlog is down a little bit quarter-over-quarter. I guess I'm just curious as to -- if you can -- if you would provide some color as to what's driving that.","David A. Viniar","It were -- when I -- you should just -- I should emphasize the word \"slightly\" when I say it was down quarter-over-quarter. But it really was a very slight decline. As I said, it's still higher than it was at the beginning of the year and it's a very, very slight -- it's a slight decline in the underwriting part, a slight increase in the merger part, and the underwriting decline is a little bit more than the merger increase. But these really are small numbers when I tell you, \"up and down.\"","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just one question on I&L balances. Now that you've had a little bit more time to think about the NPR that came earlier this year, do you have any more thoughts on potentially pairing some of the I&L balances?","David A. Viniar","As I said before, I think we're going to -- when there are good opportunities to sell -- again, some of these things will season naturally. It will be time for them to be sold, and we will sell them. And these things will naturally roll off over time kind of as the Basel rules kick in.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Sipkin with Susquehanna.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. First, I've noticed you guys have introduced preferred stock back into the capital structure, it's modest. But any color on the rationale? I think it's been 2 quarters in a row where that's increased.","David A. Viniar","Well, those were -- we had these Apex transactions which needed to be remarketed. So these were kind of the end of transactions that were done several years ago. There was nothing new there.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Got you. Okay, so then there's no really change in thought process of capital management, it's just a function of the expiration of those.","David A. Viniar","That was what those were in there. We'll continue to monitor the markets and see when is the right time to do things and when it's available. But for -- those transactions were older transactions.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Got you. Second question. I picked up that you mentioned there was maybe some improvement throughout the quarter, but I guess it wasn't that significant, in terms of activity levels coming in versus leaving the quarter. Any particular products, it sounds like mortgages was one of them, where there was a noticeable improvement versus -- coming into the quarter versus leaving?","Harvey M. Schwartz","What we saw over the quarter, particularly as the central bank activity picked up, is you really saw capital moving into things like treasuries and mortgages. There was certainly, as we've all seen, a desire to focus on yield-offering products so we've seen the calendar in the debt markets be quite active. Away from that, I wouldn't make any significant comments about the terms of the flows.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Got you. Okay. And then sort of -- I think I know the answer, but with respect to cost cutting and headcount levels, it feels like the most recent initiative will take you guys to where you want to be, given the environment that we're in.","David A. Viniar","It'll take us where we want to be for now, and then we'll see kind of how things unfold. And we'll decide if we need to grow, shrink or stay the same based on how the environment feels.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Got you. And then just last question for me. It feels like we get close to seeing a stronger M&A environment, but then it peters out. How much do you think the fiscal cliff uncertainty is weighing on CEOs' confidence and, if somehow we can get past this with everyone feeling good, it would serve as a catalyst? Or are there bigger issues with respect to bigger M&A tickets?","David A. Viniar","I think the political uncertainty out there has been a big part of what's kept the M&A calendar as low as it's been, with the fiscal cliff, uncertainty in Europe, just general political uncertainty which has caused people to be less confident about growth. I think it's been weighing very heavily on those markets. There's been a -- as we've said before, a lot of dialogue, a lot of companies talking to each other, but CEOs are all hesitant to pull the trigger until they get a little more clarity. And I think, if you saw some clarity, I think you could see a pretty big uptick in volumes.","Operator","And gentlemen, at this time, there are no further questions.

(Operator Instructions) Also this call is being recorded today, July 16, 2013. Thank you.","Mr. Holmes, you may now begin your conference.","Dane E. Holmes","Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. Today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm\u2019s belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain and outside of the firm\u2019s control.

This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent.","Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz will now review the firm\u2019s results. Harvey?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Thanks, Dane, and thanks everyone for dialing in today. I\u2019ll walk you through our second quarter results and then take your questions.","Net revenues were $8.6 billion, net earnings $1.9 billion, earnings per diluted share $3.70, our annualized return on common equity 10.5%. For the first half of the year our return on common equity was 11.5%. All in, a solid outcome and what continues to be a dynamic market environment.","On our earnings call last quarter, we discussed how the evolving economic outlook impacts client activity. Narrowing economic data and substantial central bank actions during the quarter caused our clients to continually reassess their expectations from global growth. As a result, our clients risk appetite in activity levels fluctuated over the course of the quarter.","At the beginning of the quarter, our clients remained focused on the European economic outlook. As the quarter progressed, solid economic data out of the U.S. began to moderate economic concerns. Client activity, risk appetite, and asset prices improved as a result of the increased confidence in the U.S. economy. Macro concerns emerged again towards the end of the quarter and refracted \u2013 reflected in lower activity levels and risk appetite in certain businesses. In addition, the market volatility created more challenging periods within the capital markets for managing client flows.","As I previously mentioned, central banks around the world were particularly active during the second quarter. This activity was a key driver of market sentiments during the quarter. In Japan, the Central Bank undertook unprecedented monetary action to stimulate their economy. During the second quarter, the yen declined by approximately 5% versus the U.S. dollar and 7% versus the euro.","The marketplace tried to weigh the potential near-term benefits for the Japanese economy against the relative headwinds for other parts of the world. In the U.S., commentary from the Federal Reserve about potentially tapering its bond buying program led to a significant rise in interest rates. Market participants continue to debate the timing and impact of tapering on both the market and economic activity.","Clients were also concerned with the potential slow down in China during the quarter. Ultimately our clients are assessing the broader global economy, specifically whether a recovering U.S., will offset potentially slower growth in other economic regions.","I\u2019ll now run through each of our businesses. Investment banking produced second quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion, roughly consistent with the first quarter. Second quarter advisory revenues were $486 million, consistent with the first quarter. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&A. We advised on a number of important transactions that closed in the second quarter, including News Corporation approximately $9 billion spin-off of its publishing business. Hess\u2019s 2.1 billion sale of its Russian subsidiary to Lukoil and Siemens 1.7 billion British pound acquisition of Invensys Rail.","We are also an advisor on a number of significant announced transactions. They include Canada Safeway\u2019s CAD$5.8 billion sale to Sobeys. Springer Science and Business Media\u2019s \u20ac3.3 billion sale to BC Partners and Lender Processing Services $4 billion sale to Fidelity National Financial.","Second quarter underwriting net revenues were $1.1 billion, relatively consistent with a robust first quarter. Debt underwriting revenues were very strong at $695 million and represents a record quarter. While the pace of commercial mortgage related activity slowed, leverage finance activity remains strong. Equity underwriting revenues of $371 million were down 5% compared with the first quarter. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in global equity and equity-related common stock offerings and IPOs.","During the second quarter, there were several noteworthy transactions. Apple\u2019s $17 billion first ever debt offering. Valeant Pharmaceuticals $9.6 billion debt and equity financing and J.C. Penney\u2019s $2.3 billion term loan. Our Investment Banking backlog was consistent with first quarter levels.","Let me now turn to institutional client services. Total net revenues were $4.3 billion in the second quarter. FICC Client Execution net revenues were $2.5 billion in the second quarter, lower than the first quarter, but higher than the second quarter a year-ago. This quarter results continue to reflect a broad contribution across businesses and reinforce the benefits of having a diversified franchise.","While activity levels in our currency business remains strong as clients reacted to increased volatility, particularly in Asia, resulting other businesses were lower than the first quarter. As you would expect during the period of increasing interest rates and widening credit spreads, client risk appetite declined at rates, credit and mortgages and inventory management was a bit more challenging during the later part of the quarter. Commodity results increased relative to the first quarter as volatility remain low in many of our core products and client activity was lower as a result.","Turning to equities, net revenues for the second quarter were $1.9 billion, down modestly from the first quarter. Equities client execution revenues were $638 million, down 21% sequentially; largely reflecting the impact of the sale of our reinsurance business. Commissions and fees were $836 million, up 5% from the first quarter due to improved market volumes.","Security services net revenues of $376 million were 18% higher sequentially due to seasonally stronger client activity. With respect to risk average daily VaR in the second quarter was $81 million, up 7% from first quarter levels due to higher volatilities mainly in currencies. Adjusted for volatilities, VaR was relatively unchanged quarter-on-quarter.","Let me now review Investing & Lending. We produced net revenues of 1.4 billion in the second quarter. Investing & Lending includes direct investing, investing due to funds as well as lending activities. These activities occur across a diversified set of asset classes, including both equity and debt.","Equity securities generated net revenues of 462 million, primarily reflecting gains from private equity investments. This increase in fair value was driven by company-specific events and strong corporate performance. Also, we sold our remaining stake in ICBC during the quarter.","The net gain over the quarter was a modest $7 million. Net revenues from debt securities and loans was 658 million, driven by company-specific events and interest income. Other revenues of 295 million were driven by the firm's consolidated investment entities.","Switching to Investment Management, we reported second quarter net revenues of 1.3 billion, roughly consistent with the first quarter. Management and other fees were 1.1 billion, up 4% sequentially. During the second quarter, assets under supervision decreased 13 billion to 955 billion primarily reflecting net market depreciation and fixed income assets.","Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior-year equity awards and other items such as payroll taxes and benefits was accrued a compensation to net revenues ratio of 43% which is consistent with the firm's accrual in the first quarter.","Second quarter non-compensation expenses were 2.3 billion, 5% lower than the first quarter, largely due to the sale of our reinsurance business. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 27%, driven by earnings that were permanently reinvested abroad. Year-to-date, our effective tax rate was 30.4%.","On capital we repurchased 10.5 million shares of common stock for a total cost of 1.6 billion during the quarter. Our basic shares outstanding were 468 million at the end of the second quarter, down close to 6% over the last four quarters. At the end of the second quarter, our estimated Basel III tier 1 common ratio under the advanced approach was approximately 9.3% and reflects the final Basel III rules that were issued by the Federal Reserve on July 2nd. Obviously, we are still reviewing the final rule but this is our best estimate subject to change depending on regulatory clarifications.","Now, over the quarter, we took a number of strategic actions to bolster our capital position. As you will recall, we announced the potential sale of a majority stake in our reinsurance business even the Basel III capital charges that we incurred as a 100% owner of the business. We completed the sale of our reinsurance business in the second quarter. The sale includes our Basel III capital ratio by approximately 50 basis points and reduced the firm's balance sheet by $17 billion. This benefit was partially offset by implementations of the final Basel III rule set.","Now, at 9.3% we are close to having achieved our previously-stated target of the 8.5% requirement plus an approximate 100 basis point buffer. Regarding the leverage ratio, we also received the NPR last week. Even it's in the proposal stage, it's hard to speculate on how it will ultimately be finalized. However, we have significantly reduced our leverage since 2007. Since then we've reduced our assets by roughly 180 billion while increasing our equity base by over 80%. As a result, we feel reasonably well positioned for the new leverage requirements at both the holding company and the bank's subsidiary. But once again, it's a proposal so we will work with the regulators over the coming months.","Effectively managing the firm requires us to comply with a variety of different regulatory measures. Just as we've improved our Basel III capital ratio, we will have to continually adjust to any new regulations as they are finalized. As we have said in the past, a high level of risk-adjusted capital not only provides protection against tail events to all of our constituents, it also creates the foundation for capturing opportunities.","With higher risk-adjusted capitalization, we are better positioned to help our clients navigate on uncertain economic environments and we can provide them with risk capital where capacity is diminished. An essential part of our role as managers on behalf of you, our shareholders, is to manage our capital effectively and efficiently in order to generate superior long-term returns.","Now in closing, we are cautiously optimistic about the outlook for the operating environment. Nevertheless, we remain vigilant regarding expenses and risks. Given the dynamic nature of the marketplace it's natural for people to become somewhat short-term focused. However, everyone at Goldman Sachs remains keenly aware that our success will be measured over years as opposed to weeks or months.","To that end, we are going to continue to invest in deepening and expanding our client franchise, building relationships that will pass the test of time. We will continue to invest in our people, recruiting and retaining a group of professionals who are committed to providing solutions to our clients and driving value for our shareholders.","With that, I'd like to thank you again for listening today. And I'm now happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). The first question comes from the line of Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Hi, Howard. How are you?","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","Well, thanks. How are you?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Great, thanks.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","The more challenging conditions that you spoke to in the back half of the quarter with respect to client risk appetite and inventory management, was hoping you could comment how those difficult conditions persisted as we rebased it at new higher levels of U.S. benchmark rates or have they abated a bit?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So, I'd say we don't feel like they've abated a bit. I mean you see in the day-to-day volatility and that really is about I think the adjustments to people basically recalibrating to both a somewhat wider credit spread environment and obviously higher absolute interest rates and you can see that obviously it's quite visible, for example, in movements in a 10-year. So I think people are adjusting. What I would say is that it's now a very information-centric environment. And what I mean by that is people \u2013 all of our clients are going to be very keenly watching data, economic data whether it's nonfarm payrolls in United States, GDP growth in Europe, Japan, China, really trying to form their view because for the very long period of time, I think there was an expectation that this unusual low rate environment would persists. And to some extent people could build expectations around that. And now that we might be entering a different regime, you'll see people probably respond more to data but then again it's hard to [grade]. But I would say to answer your question the short way which is it does feel like people have recalibrated at this stage. And by the way and some of this, Howard, is returning to kind of normal interest rate levels, it feels good in some respects in terms of economic activity.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","There's where I was hoping to go next. It feels like we've been talking for a couple of years now about this wall client liquidity that's out there and your interest rates creating more of a one-way market in certain clusters like credit and mortgages. Have we seen enough of a move in your mind to see more two-way flow in some of these businesses that we've been hoping for?","Harvey M. Schwartz","I think it's too early to tell which I why I highlighted the sensitivity to economic data. People are going to form their own impressions over the next several months and certainly everybody will be watching \u2013 clients are basically sitting on the edge of their seat for every communique out of the Federal Reserve and so there will be some sensitivity. But it feels like we're tracking more back to a period of normalcy.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","Great, thanks. And then I was hoping you could just update us on all of what the firm experienced as we progressed through phase 2 of U.S. mandatory clearing not only in all of what you're doing with respect to centralized clearing efforts but also maybe just broad health, liquidity, bid out spreads of the over-the-counter markets as we went through that transition?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Right. So, obviously from a Goldman Sachs perspective and this is an industry participant, we're thrilled to see clearing really coming into vogue now. And as we talked about in the last call, while it's taken a while and people could be frustrating at the pace of things, the reality is that I think the regulators and market participants have done really an excellent job of the progression of phase 1 and phase 2. And as you saw, there was lots of concerns in the marketplace and for all intents and purposes it went through without any hiccups. I think as it relates to sort of any material move in bid out spreads or volumes, there are no material change there and it's too early for that. I think, to the extent to which clearing had a long-term impact on market structure it will happen over many months and years like we\u2019ve seen in other market places.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","Okay, thanks. And then just finally for me, thanks for the color on Basel 3 preparation, but just given the brightest steps you took with the reinsurance business and ICBC stakes, I was hoping if you\u2019d just update us on your current Basel 3 RWA breakdown and just where you\u2019re on passive and active mediation? Thanks.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Sure, so it's been a while since we\u2019ve updated this audience on risk-weighted assets, so I just want to walk through this a little bit carefully. The last time we talked to you last year we gave you a number of $728 billion in terms of risk-weighted assets. That number is now $600 billion. I\u2019m going to break it down and then I want to come back and reference the $728 billion I just mentioned. So the $600 billion our best estimate giving the final rule is $180 billion for market risk-weighted assets, $340 billion for credits, $80 billion for operation. Now you can obviously do the math, but that translates into $56 billion of Tier 1 common. The reason why I want to draw everyone\u2019s attention to the comparison of the $600 billion to the $728 billion is because the way the final rules came out it was certain deductions that we were previously assuming would be risk-weighted assets which actually became deductions to capital. And so the $600 billion versus the $728 billion is not really apples-to-apples, the best way to think about our current position under the final rules is the 9.3% which obviously as I said during my prepared remarks is 20 basis points within range of the buffer. In terms of passive, you should be thinking about roughly $35 billion in risk-weighted assets that will roll off between now and the end of 2015.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","Thanks, Harvey.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Roger Freeman with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Roger Freeman - Barclays","Hi, good morning, Harvey.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Good morning. How are you?","Roger Freeman - Barclays","Hey, good, thanks. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess one just, maybe bouncing off couple of things Harvey was actually the -- so the market quality in rates and credit; would you characterize that as more normalized now in July. It sounds like in June that lack of for the dealer liquidity provision since maybe you contributed somewhat to the gapping and spreads, and I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s kind of part of the new world we live in now with new regulatory environment where assets prices move -- and moves and dealers are less apt to sort of take positional risks?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Yeah, so I think I would describe it more as things are episodic. In other words I don\u2019t think there is a massive transition that\u2019s occurred in terms of four weeks ago till today clearly when you get big moves in interest rates all market participants are going to adjust their risk profiles and you\u2019ll see flows for example out of fixed income assets into other assets. I think that, as I said I think it's quite normal for us to see this and people are nearly in a position of reassessing their risk profile, but in terms of Goldman Sachs I can\u2019t speak for the rest of the street. Goldman Sachs is we feel quite well positioned in terms of our ability to make capital for our clients.","Roger Freeman - Barclays","Okay, thanks. And in I&L, I wonder if you can, and you have talked a lot about this in the past, but just help us think about maybe the average age of maybe buckets within there, I\u2019m trying to, you\u2019ve been coming in ahead of expectations obviously it's the tough one to forecast, but I think you like a lot of public private equity firms we have aged portfolios and there\u2019s a realization process going on, and I wonder if you can kind of help us think about kind of really where you\u2019re at in that cycle?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Well, as we\u2019ve guided every one in the past generally speaking for the equity portfolio or reasonable guide it could be the MSCI, obviously there are divergence in this period. And as we\u2019ve always told people it's really just a guide and there are going to be periods where idiosyncratically there\u2019s elements of the portfolio where we under perform, there\u2019s going to be periods where we over perform, obviously relative to that kind of benchmark in this quarter we outperformed and it really is a combination of things like debt repayments and adjustments obviously interest income is in there, and again idiosyncratically components of the portfolio. In terms of aging, I didn\u2019t bring specific numbers with me Roger, but the private equity portfolio obviously trend to have sort of a longer term frame on it relative to the debt portfolio, but we can follow up with you and give you more detail if that\u2019s helpful.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Okay, all right thanks, and just maybe lastly just the liquidity levels can either run high and again it's kind of early days and thinking about leverage ratios and how some of the liquidity assets are yet sort of calculate into that; does that kind of change just thinking about how much liquidity you want to run with?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So, we\u2019re always going to run with an amount of liquidity which is really designed to protect the firm and at the same time put us in a position where we can provide capital and liquidity to our clients. With respect to the sort of metrics out there things like the liquidity coverage ratio and we feel very comfortable with respective things like that. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going there, but in terms of the, since you mentioned leverage ratio, the only comment I\u2019d say that, we\u2019re not -- we\u2019re going to modulate our liquidity down because of a given metric that\u2019s in the market place even if an incentive exists with that.","Roger Freeman - Barclays","Okay, great. Thanks a lot, Harvey.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead","Harvey M. Schwartz","Hi, Michael.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America","Hi. First question, maybe just back on the leverage ratio some of your unit piers have put out some guidance in terms of kind of a first take. If we look at Goldman and what you\u2019ve done on the Tier 1 common ratio, and there\u2019s obviously some mitigation that can be done, so I mean if you\u2019re below 5%, how are you guys thinking about achieving that whether it's through areas of asset mitigation that won't have a significant impact on the earnings power of Goldman or raising preferred or just what are the leverage that you guys have to get there?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Again this is a rule that just came out; it's in proposal form. And as I said, our first assessment is we\u2019re very comfortable with where we are. Now and again there probably shouldn\u2019t be a surprise to anyone given all the work that\u2019s been done on the balance sheet since 2007 with an 80% increase in shareholder equity and a decrease of $108 million in the balance sheet as I said that\u2019s the kind of metric that we should be really well positioned for. Having said that it's in proposal form, so we\u2019ll have to see the final rule, and the only reason I\u2019m not being more specific about numbers in this stage is our team really hadn\u2019t had a time to building the kind of diligence that we would normally want them to, but as I said first we feel comfortable, lets see how the final rule is, we\u2019ll work with the regulators.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America","Okay, got it. And then the fixed side of the business there\u2019s a lot of I\u2019d say uncertainty or debate on what the outlook is. You\u2019ve just given higher rates and potentially a decline on the down rating side and then fund outflows in certain products. On the flip side though you basically have market growth and then if Centrum Banks are less are backing out and are not as intervening in the market. It seems like volatility levels particularly in rates and FX could resume to more normalized levels. So when you look at that, the longer term outlook of FICC, it doesn\u2019t seem as if it\u2019s that simple, that rising rates should be in a more negative to the business, but just wanted to get your take on, when you think about the headwinds versus the potential for a more normalized market environment in some of the product areas, what could we potentially see over the next couple of years?","Harvey M. Schwartz","It's a good question, but obviously exceptionally difficult to answer. Time will tell on that and we as a firm have had to navigate multiple rate regimes. If you just think about the rate regimes that we\u2019ve experienced since 2000 and the volatility associated with that and not because just we haven't been on unprecedented period of sort of globally coordinated decline in rates, but I do think that the -- to the extent at which rates are a proxy for the thing about the fixed income business from a forward view, I think it really depends on what the driver is. I think even though it seems exceptionally unlikely if rate increases were due to things like inflation, then I think it's a different scenario than if it's as I said kind of a returning to a normal world of more steady economic growth. I think that's a reasonably attractive opportunity set not just for [FX] potentially but obviously across the entire firm. And so that's what we're routing for. Now in terms of strategically positioning the business and we benefit from the fact that it's diversified, we can interact with our clients across the full suite of their interest, whether its currencies, mortgages, interest rates and we have the global footprint required to do that. So, in a quarter like this where Asia becomes particularly interesting, we can deliver for our clients because we're positioned and we're strategically connected to do that.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America","Okay. That makes sense. And then just finally, so on the expenses, I think you mentioned non-comp impacted on the reinsurance business. On the compensation side, anything \u2013 it just seems like the pickup in activity, you get some higher competitive environment gets a little bit tougher. Just any update on that front? And then just on the tax outlook, when you said the earnings permanently being directed outside, is there something that's going to be more, like, ongoing in terms of the tax rate or was this more of a quarterly benefit?","Harvey M. Schwartz","No, it relates to the tax where you could just think of this as a quarterly benefit. The [war for] talents, it's something we do every day. I would say that there's nothing that we see in terms of sort of a shift. Goldman Sachs people are always in high demand and our competitors are always looking to take them over to their firms. I will say over the past several months, we've always felt like we're well positioned to recruit; we'll say its stealth like, we've had some recruiting tailwinds this year. Whether this is sustainable we'll see.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America","Okay, all right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Hi, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Hi. How are you?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Good.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","A couple of questions. One just on the leverage ratio when you say you're comfortable, what's your definition of comfortable?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Comfortable? So I'm not trying to be cute with you. Look, it's just come out. Our team has looked at it. Our early read is all the things we've done in the balance sheet over the past several years has left us reasonably well positioned. And so I know that perhaps you'd like me to get more specific into the [number] at this stage, I just want to give the team the final time to really dot the i's and cross the t's. But as I said, we think we can manage without any major adjustments certainly.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay, just to get \u2013 by year-end '18 to get to the 5% and 6%, is that --","Harvey M. Schwartz","Sorry, by comfortable I don't mean that timeframe. But again, I want everyone to really know this is a proposed rule. So let's see how the dialogue evolves with the regulators.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Yeah, I get it. Okay. On the RWA walkthrough which was helpful, I guess I'm wondering \u2013 you mentioned the 56 billion on the common tier 1 and that there were incremental deducts, right, relative to what was in the proposed rule. So, could you help us understand what you think you can do to mitigate those deducts going forward?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Well, right now as it relates to the ratio we're pretty comfortable. As we stated before, we plan to run with 100 basis point buffer and putting us in range of 20 basis points of that given the incredibly long [flight] path to compliance in 2019, we feel pretty comfortable. And one thing I do \u2013 you didn't ask specifically about this, but one thing I do want to give people a sense for is we talked about this 100 basis point buffer so that we can give people an estimate of where we thought we would ultimately land. Of course that was operating under a proposed set of rules, not finalized. So the way we typically work with metrics at Goldman Sachs is we introduce our own metrics for example is we'll work with them, we'll monitor them; we'll see how they move. And so we're going to do the same with this final Basel III rule now that we have it. And so in that sense, we feel quite comfortable. Now in the terms of the specific deductions, it mostly relates to financial institutions and at the specific deduction we can get into the [ways] offline if you'd like, but it relates to investments in funds and other things on balance sheet. Now it has to be the case that that sort of coincidentally runs parallel with sort of mitigating actions that we're taking under the \u2013 what we think the vocal rule is going to be when finalized. So we feel pretty good about that too.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Yeah. I was just wondering what you \u2013 the optionality you have to reduce those deducts? It sounds like there's some and you'll work on it and you'll address it as it happens? Is that fair?","Harvey M. Schwartz","It's always been the case and we like to build it into the muscle memory of the firm that everyone knows we're going to have to adapt. I think if you look at what we've done over the past 18 months as it relates to the Basel III ratio and now we have the final rule we can really discuss it with you in clarity which is nice, I feel very good about our team's ability to continue to make progress.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","On the tax rate, you indicated in the press release and on the call that you made elections to permanently reinvest some earnings overseas. Does that imply a tax rate going forward that's different from what it's been in the past? I mean the first half was 30%. Is that what we should be using going forward?","Harvey M. Schwartz","No, I answered that question just a second ago, Betsy. You might have missed it. You should just think of it as a one-time event for this quarter.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay, all right. And then lastly on the reinsurance business, did you go through how that's going to be impacting \u2013 I mean you indicated the capital impacts, but I'm just wondering is there more to come with buybacks since it is positive for your Basel ratios or did you do everything with the buybacks that you were going to do this quarter with the reinsurance business? The reinsurance business changed, it freed up capital. Would you finish doing what you wanted to do with buybacks relative to that this quarter or is there more to come in the forward quarters?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Okay, I think I understand the question but if I don't you should correct me. We don't think about the capital management necessarily as being specifically linked to one individual asset disposition. So, it's a much longer timeframe in terms of how we think about the capital management. And so an easier way for me to say that would have been based on the quarter that we just went through, if we ended up selling the reinsurance business in the third quarter, you would have seen the same repurchase activity. Am I getting to your question, Betsy?","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Yeah, I got it.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Okay. So actually on the reinsurance business \u2013 again, I would say it was a business that we liked in Goldman Sachs. It didn't make sense obviously under the new rules and so we're in a position where quite frankly a win-win for us and our clients in the investing division because we're able to take the action that we did.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","All right, thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank","So a follow-up on Mike's question. If sort of the market is a big more data driven, does that mean that you guys would expect that the rates business should remain strong as clients continue to adjust and reposition based upon incremental data points going up?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Very difficult to tell, and we don't run the business week-to-week in terms of how the market's responding. Obviously we stay very focused on the risk dynamics in the marketplace when we go through the risk committee and obviously in the trenches. But strategically the way you have to interact with clients whether it's for example long-term investors that are managing pension obligations or insurance companies and the flipside this might even be more market sensitive to our total return business. So we just have to make sure that we stay very, very focused on our clients and it's a good opportunity because it's a content differentiating world right now. And so we have an opportunity to do that. We just have to deliver.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank","Okay. And then I guess when you think about in that context thinking about your business and how you guys are approaching it given what you're seeing, we're seeing some slowing growth out of China strengthening dollar. How do you think about positioning of the commodities business in that context and while certainly it might not change strategic perception to the business, maybe does it have an impact on your thinking from a tactical perspective?","Harvey M. Schwartz","I think it's actually to say it literally had zero impact on how we think about the data and management of the commodity business and I emphasized that zero only because we run that business for the long-term. We entered that business in 1981 it's been core to our clients and core to the entire integrated strategy of the security division which includes both fixed income and equities. And so those kinds of near term adjustments in the market place super relevant for the conversations that our people on the ground are having with their clients all around the globe, but not a dictator to us in terms of how we think about our multi-decade commitment to the commodity business.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank","No, sure. I just was curious about whether or not it might impact more short-term tactical decisions for those capital allocations and the like.","Harvey M. Schwartz","No the capital -- we don\u2019t dial down the capital to the business. The client demand and the client activity levels will drive the capital needs that we provide.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank","Okay, that\u2019s fair. And then last one for me, it looks like there were some a moderate issuance of some preferred this quarter. Did that have anything to do with the leverage ratio coming out or was that something else driving that issuance?","Harvey M. Schwartz","No, that was part of our long-term capital plan. We had no insight into the leverage ratio.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank","I had to given one last parting shot for the leverage ratio there, you know.","Harvey M. Schwartz","I like the persistence.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Hi, Kian.","Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan","Yes, hi. The first question is regarding [SEF] platform, we had some clarity in respect to the submission of [SEF] platform, just wondering how you\u2019re preparing for this, how you\u2019re positioning yourself, if you can give us a little bit of color in that respect?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So, we have a long history of adopting and participating in platform developments, obviously it goes all the way back to trade web and we both developed our own internal platforms and we participate in external platforms. So, I don\u2019t think this represents any specific hurdles in terms of participating in that. I do think it will be quite interesting as trading moves over to swap execution facilities later in the year maybe to the beginning of next year, I think it will be quite interesting to see the market dynamic around that and particularly as we interface the finalized rules how the business evolves.","Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan","And in terms of technological platform, is there anything that you\u2019re developing new, now that you have a bit more clarity in terms of a technological platform is there anything you can add in respect to how your response to that, how you try to differentiate to keep flows or gain new flows?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So once you have evolved, the way and we talked about this before. One of our competitive advantages assuming we execute is the fact that no we have SecDB, which is our internally developed platform. It is the platform that we use across all of our businesses whether you\u2019re trading currencies in Asia or if you\u2019re trading stocks in United States and so that should give us some advantage in terms of how we vision our self and our speed and our ability to adapt. But I think the early stage of this, I can\u2019t -- maybe I\u2019m wrong, but I think the early stage of this is somewhat similar to clearing and that it's all about educating the clients, interface with the clients and making sure that connectivity works for them, it's a big adjustment in terms of execution protocol for them. And then what we\u2019ve just \u2013 really the differentiating thing is the content, and we just have to keep providing content.","Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan","Okay, that\u2019s helpful -- that\u2019s really helpful. Just on securitization, we clearly heard from some of the banks that at the current level of interest rates production of mortgages could decline, thus wondering and it could have a material impact. Now just wondering since you\u2019re such a big securitization player especially on mortgages, so wondering how do you see that business developing assuming that yields do stay the higher level, and would you call that material?","Harvey M. Schwartz","You have a better view on the competitors and their exposure to securitization. We\u2019ve never really been big in securitization as it relates to sort of the new issue pipeline of for example residential mortgages, obviously we\u2019ve been a big participant over the past several years in our ability to connect capital for clients, moving portfolios -- secondary portfolios. For example people would be risking out of Europe and connecting investors in the U.S. But I don\u2019t know necessarily that I would attribute any concern to higher interest rates for us as it relates to the securitization activity level. Now that may translate into less activity for the entire industry. And it's really I think to some degree a bit of, of how it evolves over the next six months in terms of peoples expectations. Again if it's a particular volatile period it could have a different impact if we settle in and people feel a certain confidence around economic activity, it could clearly translate quite differently.","Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan","Okay, that\u2019s quite helpful. And the last question is, on the securitization consultation document by Basel that came out quite a while ago, now six months ago. I am sure you had the chance to look through it and just wondering if this could have a material impact on your risk-weighted asset changes that you just outlined, assuming that it comes as it's -- assuming it becomes as discussed in the paper?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Yeah, so I don\u2019t have any specific comments as it relates to the details of the paper. What I would say is, I think the really important takeaway as it relates to all of these regulatory processes is it's all about an ability to adapt. All firms are going to operate in the same rule sets. And so historically we\u2019ve done a pretty good job of adapting and we just need to continue adapting. And one of the things I\u2019ve said is, and I like to think of a bit of as an operating principal is a very, very low premium on trying to predict the outcome of rules. But it's huge, huge premium on adapting once you see them. Predicting rules and responding can be incredibly costly, you can get widely misdirected and you can lose track to your clients. Responding to rules, once they\u2019re finalized that really is a differentiating factor and we have to execute.","Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Thanks, Kian.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Good morning.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Good morning.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","A follow up question to your comment to the pipelines were relatively stable versus the end of last quarter, and I know it's early in the quarter here, but just any thoughts in terms of a change in the mix. I think a lot of people view that if rates increase like the way they did that\u2019s in the debt issuance for dry out, I mean as we know that\u2019s not always the case, but has there been any change in the mix in the pipeline maybe even within the debt business a mix change in terms of like away from high yield towards certain things?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Well, as I said in the opening the backlog was basically unchanged quarter-over-quarter from first quarter to second quarter, and just to give you a little bit of color, it was down a very small amount of advisory at the end of the quarter and it was up in underwriting. In terms of where it is, it's too early in the quarter to see how things will revolve, so I wouldn\u2019t take any material takeaways from any changes over the past two weeks.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay, and then the sales of the reinsurance business was there a gain or a loss?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So, there was nothing material with the sale of the reinsurance business. Just to give people some context on that business, obviously I have come through a lot of detail already, but since you\u2019re asking the question it represented just under 2% of last years pre-tax income.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then just separately, if we back out some of the revenues from the reinsurance business, you just have a stub piece this quarter, if you back that all out, I mean it seems like the equity derivative business is doing pretty well, and we\u2019re seeing that in some other banks as well. Just wondering obviously volatility had been low -- lowed out a little bit, sometimes that can be good, sometimes not. Just what's driving some of the good trends in the equity derivative area?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Yeah, so as you mentioned last year second quarter 2012 there was $259 million from revenues in the reinsurance business obviously significantly less, 80 plus million in this quarter. So when you adjust after that you\u2019re right a strong performance in the equity business. Part of that equity derivatives I will say there was \u2013 there were \u2013 I'd say two other drivers; one is there was some good opportunities to provide our clients with capital around index rebalancings and other areas where we could really lean into the strength of client relationships, technology and capital committing in a way that I think leaves us quite well positioned, and obviously I noted that our performance in the equity derivative business broadly. But there's a little bit of a \u2013 everybody keeps talking about the rotation out of fixed income into equities and who knows how that will play out over the next decade. But certainly a lot of activity in equities space, particularly in Asia.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thank you very much.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of [Jim Miller] with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research","Hi. It's Jim Mitchell.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Hi, Jim. Sorry about that.","James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research","It's okay. On the Central Clearing, just a follow-up. Have you done any work, and I know it's early days, in terms of what the potential capital benefits could be and moving to more of the business to Central Clearinghouse and what that may mean also with respect if anything benefit with respective leverage ratios that relates to derivatives?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Yeah, we haven't \u2013 it's early days so we haven't spent a huge amount of time in terms of the capital benefits. As these leverage ratios unfold, one of the things I'm sure we'll get a lot of debate in the proposal process is the extent to which custody of client assets. Effectively people just putting money in a safe or holding collateral, how that plays out in a leverage ratio but we haven't done a huge amount of work as it relates to capital benefit at this stage.","James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research","I think it's fair to assume it should have some of that benefit but you just haven't really put your arms around it.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Yeah, we would expect over long term, a capital benefit but I think more importantly we've always been quite conservative we feel relative to the broad marketplace as it relates to the extension of credit and the extent to which more activities is cleared, obviously that levels the playing field and removes the ability of our third or fourth quartile more marginal competitor in a specific space to compete on terms. They have to compete on content and execution. But look, again early days and not seeing any tailwinds or headwinds at this stage.","James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research","Okay, thanks. And one quick question on the asset management business. You guys have seen pretty consistent outflows in alternatives the last year or so. What's driving that I mean if you look at the industry and you've seen pretty much inflows and alternatives, is it just a performance or it is a mix issue, how do we think about the alternative space for you guys?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So we're very focused on it. In terms of the trend obviously it's been a very important component of our business. Nothing specific there. The only thing I would say is that obviously as we previously announced, in anticipation of adjusting for that component of the vocal rule which we think will be in the finalized rule, we have been removing our own capital.","James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research","And that would show up as outflows?","Harvey M. Schwartz","No, not as third party.","James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research","Okay, all right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous. Please go ahead, sir.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Hi, Guy.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP","Good morning. This is a slightly different kind of the question that was asked a minute ago on OTC derivatives. As we transition to a regime of much more of what used to be OTC being centrally cleared, is it the right way to think about the existing OTC derivatives portfolio as essentially being a run-off portfolio in a way and therefore sort of a source of passive release?","Harvey M. Schwartz","No. I want to make sure I understand your question clearly. The things that for example that we think are [indiscernible] businesses, for example, pre-crisis businesses like correlation books and things like that which just aren't relevant to our clients today and are quite capital consumptive under the new rule sets. So as it relates to clearing, given the number of instruments we have cleared now, I don't think the two really overlap. I do think that \u2013 I'll speculate a little bit here. I do think that as these rules get finalized and we're only living with really clearing for a couple of months now and then when we come into swap execution facilities, the venture \u2013 very interesting to see the impact that has on client activity which as best we can tell was a little dampened for the industry given the uncertainty around the rule sets. And so as we get certainty, it could be a little bit of a tailwind for volumes.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP","Yeah, that was helpful. But the question really was sort of around as you think about for example leverage ratio and I'll stipulate to the fact that all my numbers show that you guys are pretty much where you need to be. But as you think about ways of mitigating down to where you might want to be if you weren't where you wanted to be and the add backs to the denominator of that ratio include a lot of off balance sheet OTC derivatives driven assets. Won't those be coming down quite significantly naturally over the next several years if in fact the regulatory shift towards centrally cleared derivatives really takes hold or am I thinking about that the wrong way?","Harvey M. Schwartz","No, I think you're right. The extent to which [indiscernible] leads to depending on the metric that we're observing, reduced notionals or other things then that's a natural tailwind for the industry. I think more importantly one thing we're all subject to having sort of kneejerk reactions to these proposed rules when they come out. I will say the regulators consistently, as least so far, have been very thoughtful about the glide path. So the adjustment process if we needed to make one, the way we would approach that is the way we've approached all the other rules that we've lived with as they've come into place, which is we evaluate the rule, we deploy tools to our people and in that context of delivering to our clients and at the same time maximizing the return to the shareholders, we'd adjust. So that's how we would handle it. But I think the nuance question around whether clearing is a tailwind to reduce I think the answer is yes on that. But I'm not [keeping the weeds] on that specific issue but we will get back to you on it.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP","Okay. That would be great. Just a couple of quick housekeeping type questions. Have you spoken to the RWA that was associated with the reinsurance business?","Harvey M. Schwartz","No. And the reason why I didn't do that is not because I'm not happy to have the conversation but the way the sale to reinsurance has worked, it actually is it's a bit of adjustments to equity and it's also adjustments to RWAs, so I think the best way to frame it for all of you is just to say the net outcome is 50 basis points.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP","Okay, that helps. And then the final one would be you talked about your 9.3% estimated core tier 1 under Basel III under the advanced approach. Can you tell us what it would be under the standardized approach?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So with respect to the standardized approach, we're still finalizing the numbers there but our first review is we're comfortably over the minimum requirements. But at this stage it's sort of the same with the leverage ratio, I want the team to really finalize the numbers before I cross the i and dot the t's on that, but we're comfortably and hopefully in excess.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP","Okay, fair enough. Thanks very much for taking my questions.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.","Hi. You mentioned some inventory management in June. Can you give us some sense for what sort of marks were involved?","Harvey M. Schwartz","No, there's nothing specific to comment on that. I was just trying to give you a little bit of extra color on how the quarter wrapped up, but I'm sure it wasn't surprising to anyone given the volatility in markets.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.","Can you give some sense of break down between the U.S. and non-U.S. sort of revenue gross you're seeing and are you still as fully committed to the BRIC strategy as you've always been?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So no change in commitment and the mix hasn't changed significantly. It's down a little bit in the Americas, up a little bit in Europe but there are no material changes. But the core part of your question, which I think is the most important part is in terms of the strategic approach of the firm, very, very committed, very focused to those markets.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.","All right. And I think the word of the day is comfortable and so I'll ask prior to the sixth or seventh question on the leverage ratio, but it just seems \u2013 you're comfortable with where you are which is I think what I hear you saying is trust us, we'll be there. On the other hand, you're not disclosing a number like your peers have done and perhaps other peers will do. So, on a disclosure basis, you\u2019re behind peers. I\u2019m just trying to reconcile the two thoughts?","Harvey M. Schwartz","You know when we look at NPRs, our approach might be a little bit different and you\u2019ve seen from the peers, look \u2013 I suspect you could have said the same thing about Basel III process where I think you probably felt the same way in terms of being behind peers in terms of level of disclosure. Look one of the reasons that is, is because if we give you $728 billion and we update it quarter to quarter to quarter and then it dropped to $600 billion, I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re giving you a lot of value in that. I think there is much more value in sharing the process with you. Now when we have real confidence in the exact number, then we will be fine to share with you. But as I said, may be comfortable is the word of the day, we\u2019re comfortable.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.","Can you give us a sense of its above some number and give us that number?","Harvey M. Schwartz","You\u2019re looking for shades of gray in comfortable?","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.","Yes.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Pretty comfortable.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.","Pretty \u2013 now just \u2013 last follow-up on that, because it goes \u2013 someone had said by 2018 you will get there or by 2015 or you will pass the Fed\u2019s stress test or will you be able to buyback shares as quickly as you\u2019ve done. That\u2019s really what it comes down to I think.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Yeah, I wouldn\u2019t extrapolate too much information from the proposed rule set with respect to 2018 is miles away, if that gives you some context of how we\u2019re thinking about our initial review of the ratio. I\u2019m not trying to be flipping with you. When we really finalize the numbers, I\u2019m happy to come back to on it.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC Capital Markets.","Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets","Hi. Good morning. I just had questions in two areas. Sorry to come back to the 9.3% Basel III, but I was trying to understand the movement in the quarter. I think you mentioned some offsets to the 50 basis points. So it was really I thought ICBC would also being positive and you made a little bit of money over and above the buybacks. So could you explain where it was the rules got tighter versus your original expectations? And the second area was just generally there seem to be lots of discussion about wholesale funding, particularly secured. I wondered if you could discuss whether you\u2019re doing anything to change your weighted average maturity or what your kind of view is on the wholesale funding area.","Harvey M. Schwartz","So, with respect to the first, there are always going to be pluses and minuses when you get a final rule set in terms of things that impact your ratio. But the reality is that I think the key driver here and we\u2019re happy to spend more time with you offline is what referred to as the financial institutions deduction, and as I said before it comes \u2013 it\u2019s a deduction from capital and it relates to both investments and funds, and also financial institution assets that we hold on balance sheet as part of our liquidity provision to clients. And so we\u2019re happy to walk you through that in more detail. The rest of its kind of pluses and minuses back and forth.","Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets","So just a follow-up, the $600 billion number that you gave for Basel III, has that been relatively consistent excluding the insurance kind of noise over the last couple of quarters?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Well, the one reason why I tried to draw the distinction between what you brought out in the fourth quarter of last year the 728 is just the change in the rule set. So, obviously there is passive things that occur, there is incremental capital built up during the quarter. But I think the primary takeaway should be the headline number of 9.3%.","Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks.","Harvey M. Schwartz","And now that \u2013 now we have the final rule, we will keep up updated with respect to how the RWAs move.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Douglas Sipkin with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group","Yes, thank you and good morning. Just wanted to drill down actually on some of the operations, specifically debt, just curious for your perspective, I think it was touched on earlier, I mean, what do you guys think if rates start to move up, obviously debt underwriting has been a real nice area for you guys, my first question. And then, secondly it does look like within that you guys are maybe out punching. I\u2019d be curious to hear where you think you\u2019re gaining some market share by product or geography with respect to debt underwriting? Thanks.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Sure. So, in terms of the recalibration of interest rates, I think very difficult to predict, near-term what impact that have in terms of the debt market\u2019s appetite for new issues and the issuers ability or desire to pull the trigger on a particular transaction. I will say that, I think one of the most frequently asked questions we got at the end of the fourth quarter was the ability of the debt performance to continue and it was the same question at the end of the first quarter. So, obviously we will see how things unfold.","With respect to how we position the business, I listed off some of the transactions that we executed during the quarter, and really leveraged finance was a significant driver and this is all about again staying extremely focused on our clients. Particularly in our Investment Banking franchise where we\u2019re working with CFO's and CEO\u2019s and how they think about their balance sheets or how they think strategically about merger activity.","But again, the core message here is we\u2019re less focused on the quarter activity and much more just focused on the client long-term.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group","Great. Thanks for answering.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Christopher Wheeler with Mediobanca. Please go ahead.","Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca Securities","Yes, good morning.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Good morning.","Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca Securities","Perhaps I could go back to the leverage ratio without actually asking a direct question about that. But it was really about the other components of your Tier 1 capital; clearly apart from your core Tier 1 you have 7.2 billion now preferred stock and I think about 2 billion at the end of the last quarter in junior subordinated debt. I\u2019m trying to get my head around how much of that is Basel III compliance and whether or not any of that is going to have to be replaced if you go through the amortization, which obviously is important in terms of the leverage ratio. And also perhaps whether you\u2019ve already considered part of your efforts to improve the leverage ratio, not improve it, but to reach the number is to actually start to issue some of this additional Tier 1 capital, which is going to be compliant with [Basel] and whether the regulators have given you any clue yet, your regulator as to what exactly are the characteristics of that new debt would have to be?","Harvey M. Schwartz","No, we don\u2019t have any specific insight in terms of any of the new debt proposals that you would have seen. As far as observation about the capital structure obviously preferred are fine. Trust preferred are being looked at, but we\u2019ll circle back to you with respect, but there is no change in anything as it relates to capital planning. By the way, I\u2019d say that with respect to how we\u2019re thinking about share repurchase too. No changes in respect to capital planning as a result of any of the finalized proposed rules that we see in the marketplace.","Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca Securities","Have you looked at all what the cost of boosting your Tier 1 capital might be? Because clearly that\u2019s an issue a lot of banks are looking at certainly in the European markets at the moment.","Harvey M. Schwartz","We evaluate the cost all the time, but it\u2019s not a question of cost so much. It is a question about basically positioning the firm to run it conservatively and position it for clients. So, it look \u2013 I think if you were on a discussion with our treasury team and myself talking about how we should think about cost at the margin, we\u2019re much more concerned about the stability of the capital structure and less about cost.","Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca Securities","Okay. That\u2019s encouraging. Thank you very much. Thank you.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Hey, Matt.","Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Good morning, Harvey. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of quickies I think. Your long-term unsecured debt at least according to the press release is down roughly 5 billion quarter-over-quarter. How are you thinking about debt levels going forward and have you changed your thinking at all on OLA and how that will affect your debt balance going forward?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So, just Orderly Liquidation Authority just for everyone dialing in, obviously any wall set that conceptually is designed to create order, in principal, we don\u2019t have any issues with. We haven\u2019t seen the detail in the weeds on that. And it gets back to what I said earlier, we\u2019re not going to adjust the capital structure of the firm based on a discussion or where we kind of guess things will come out. That\u2019s not the way we\u2019re going to think about or manage the capital structure. So, no changes and now at best we can tell. Again, these are all in discussions, so we don\u2019t have details. So as best we could tell given the amount of debt we have at the Holdco, one might say that we\u2019re reasonably well positioned, but again, really big caveat on that. We haven\u2019t seen any details.","Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Let me come at the same question from a different direction. Are your capital markets team and debt underwriting looking positively at that idea or is that \u2013 or they of the same opinion?","Harvey M. Schwartz","I think we need more details. There is \u2013 we\u2019ve seen a lot of views in the marketplace.","Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Let me switch the question to activity levels across your broad geographic groups; Europe, Asia, U.S.\/North America, were there any meaningful improvements in activity level maybe outside the U.S. this quarter that helped the revenue side of things or were there any areas of particular weakness?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Well, certainly the activity levels in Japan and when I say Japan I don't necessarily mean specifically Japan geographically but activity that's driven around Japan. So, given the global nature of our clients one of the most important things that we need to do across the entire firm is make sure that we connect geographically in a way to deliver content. So it might be clients in Europe that are very focused on events in Japan, same as the U.S. So a lot of capturing that is making sure that they content mechanism works and a transmission mechanism works. And so I'll say Japan was a driver certainly of increased activity but not just isolated to Japan that's not on benefits.","Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","And would you characterize Europe as still being a little bit below Asia and the U.S. in terms of activity levels given the economic conditions there?","Harvey M. Schwartz","I mean that's fair. I think there's more upside in Europe and I think there's more upside specifically \u2013 and again, this could play out over many years. I think there's more upside specifically for U.S. based firms like ourselves Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, thanks for your time.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead, sir.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Hi, Chris.","Christoph Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.","Hi. My questions were asked and answered. Thank you.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Okay, Chris. Thanks for dialing in.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. Do you have any closing remarks?","Dane E. Holmes","No. We'd like to thank everybody for dialing into the call. Obviously, if people have any questions they should feel free to direct them to us in the Investor Relations department. Otherwise, enjoy the rest of your day and the week. Thanks.","Harvey M.

My name is Dennis, and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, October 15, 2019. Thank you.","Ms. Miner, you may begin your conference.","Heather Miner","Good morning. This is Heather Kennedy Miner, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. Today, we will reference our earnings presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.gs.com. No information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures appear on the earnings release and presentation. This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced, or rebroadcast without our consent.","Today, I'm joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon; and our Chief Financial Officer, Stephen Scherr. David will start with a high-level review of our financial performance and the operating environment, he\u2019ll then provide a brief update on several strategy items including key investments we are making to drive future growth, the significance of the Applecart launch, specifically, as it relates to other technology innovation at the firm and recent personnel changes to align with our longer-term strategic priorities. Stephen will then cover third quarter results across each of our businesses. They\u2019ll be happy to take your questions after that. ","I'll now pass the call over to David. David?","David Solomon","Thanks, Heather. And thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. I\u2019m happy to be here with you. Let me begin on Page 1. We reported third quarter 2019 revenues of $8.3 billion, down 6% versus last year. Net earnings were $1.9 billion, resulting in an earnings per share of $4.79. Year-to-date, we produced an ROE of 10.4% and an ROTE of 11%. Our business performed well against an uncertain geopolitical backdrop characterized by increased volatility and shifting client\u2019s sentiment.","A few highlights worth mentioning. In investment banking despite lower results versus a strong third quarter in 2018, we continue to have the world\u2019s leading franchise, ranking Number 1 in global announced and completed M&A and Number 1 in equity underwriting year-to-date. In ICS, we generated year-over-year growth demonstrating the breadth of our client footprint, including progress across both fixed income and equities.","We produced record net interest income in debt investing and lending, which annualizes to $3.6 billion. In Investment Management, our assets under supervision increased by over $100 billion to another record of $1.8 trillion, and we generated record quarterly management and other fees. Lastly, we successfully launched a new and innovative credit card with Apple.","Turning to Page 2, the operating environment in the third quarter remained mixed and slowed the pace of activity by many of our corporate clients. During the quarter, trade war concerns contributed to a risk-off sentiment and sharply lower global interest rates, particularly in ","August. Markets were also impacted by turmoil in Argentina, Brexit headlines in Europe, and a temporary spike in oil prices in September.","Throughout the quarter, responses from central banks, including the Federal Reserve and ECB, remained accommodative supporting both capital markets and the sustainability of global economic growth. Looking forward, our economists continue to expect global GDP growth in excess of 3% for this year and next. That said, global growth is not without risk as trade issues remain challenging. ","In Europe, growth is decelerating in part due to trade and manufacturing weakness with notable challenges in Germany. In China, while trade has been a headwind, both monetary and fiscal stimulus support growth estimates of roughly 6%.","Here in the U.S., growth continues to run at about 2% with strong labor markets, low inflation and healthy wage growth. Economic conditions have also been bolstered by the Fed\u2019s two mid-cycle rate cuts. Importantly, in monitoring the data, consumers continue to show resilience and remain a meaningful source of strength in the U.S. economy. That said, recent data suggest slowing manufacturing and industrial production. Mindful of that, we remain vigilant of where we are in the economic cycle and conscious of it as we manage risk across our firm.","In my regular conversations with CEOs, there is considerable focus on the duration of the current economic cycle. While most CEOs remain focused on growing their businesses and capturing opportunities amid the disruptive forces of new technologies, geopolitical issues continue to give rise to some caution. That said, equity valuations remain relatively high. Financing markets are generally open and attractive to issuers, particularly given the low-rate environment and historically low borrowing costs. In addition to corporates, financial sponsors remain active with significant capital to deploy. ","Switching gears, I'd like to spend a moment discussing our ongoing strategic investments; a topic Stephen has covered in prior calls and will expand on in a moment. These investments reflect our deliberate and disciplined approach in building new scalable businesses to serve a broader set of clients, including our markets consumer business, the recently launched Apple Card and a new transaction banking platform.","Our broader consumer business \u2013 on our broader consumer business, we are very pleased with our progress in building a modern digital consumer bank. Our competitive advantage is that we have no legacy, branch or technology infrastructure avoiding channel conflicts, and yet we are a bank with a sizeable balance sheet and a well-recognized brand, which is needed for successful disruption. Our strategy is to acquire customers under our own proprietary brand and to leverage Goldman Sachs relationships to embed our products into the eco-system of our partners.","In three short years, we have raised $55 billion in deposits on our market\u2019s platform; generated $5 billion in loans; and have built a new credit card platform and launched Apple Card in partnership with Apple and MasterCard, which we believe is the most successful credit card launch ever. ","In addition, we're making a number of important infrastructure enhancements across our incumbent businesses to better serve our clients and to operate more efficiently. These include investments in our institutional client platform Marquee where we have seen strong growth to over 50,000 monthly active users and over 1 million API data requests every day. ","We are also investing to develop the next generation of electronic trading platforms in both FICC and equities. Taken together, these investments draw on our returns in the short-term, but are critical to expanding our capabilities and our competitive position, and we believe we\u2019ll be highly accretive in the medium-to-longer term.","Next, let's discuss the recent Apple Card launch, which was an outstanding effort by the teams involved. Since August, we\u2019ve been pleased to see a high level of consumer demand for the product. From an operational and risk perspective, we\u2019ve handled the inflow smoothly without compromising our credit underwriting standards. ","Beyond the launch, we are proud of the successful platform build, which was completed in short order. This is a testament for the quality of engineering at Goldman Sachs and the collaborative engagement of our business and control functions in developing, building, and launching a true platform business. This success positions us to attract top-notch engineering talent as our most recent technology hires demonstrate and to execute our plan to build digital platforms across firm.","Before passing over to Stephen, I would like to take a moment to talk about some of the recent leadership changes across the organization. As a management team, John, Stephen and I are very focused on creating opportunities for the next generation of leaders at Goldman Sachs. As we set forth an ambitious long-term strategic plan for the firm, it is natural point in time for some of this transition to occur.","We are fortunate to have an exceptionally people with talent as many of our new business leaders are also 15 or 20-year veterans of the firm, and as we execute this transition, we invigorate and empower leaders across the businesses in the federation. Going forward, I am confident that we have an outstanding team in place to serve our clients and achieve the long-term strategic goals we are setting.","Lastly, I would like to briefly address our upcoming strategic update. We\u2019ve been actively working to finalize the date and the format for our strategic review and will provide additional details to the market in the coming weeks. Our target timing remains late January. I look forward to that session as an opportunity for us to engage with you on a number of topics, including our strategy, investments in new initiatives, forward plans across each of our businesses and a variety of other key issues.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Stephen to walk through the results in each of our businesses.","Stephen Scherr","Thank you, David. As David noted at the start, our franchise performance was solid this quarter against a mixed backup in the market as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities. Let\u2019s move through the numbers in detail.","Starting on Page 4, Investment Banking produced net revenues of 1.7 billion, down 9% versus the second quarter and down 15% versus a strong year-ago quarter. Financial Advisory revenues of $716 million were down 22% versus last year. Our performance is consistent with a roughly 20% decline across the industry and the number of M&A transactions completed during the quarter as measured by deals over $500 million in value, which as a category is an important driver for revenues.","That said, we advised on 8 of the 10 largest M&A transactions this quarter and continue to demonstrate a strong leadership position. Year-to-date, we participated in more than $1.1 trillion of announced transactions and closed on just over $1 trillion of deal volume contributing to our Number 1 M&A league table rankings.","Looking forward, as David noted, the ingredients for continued M&A activity remains solid. Client dialogues are healthy, financing markets are open and we continue to see active interest across sectors, including natural resources and healthcare.","Moving to underwriting, equity underwriting net revenues of $385 million declined meaningfully versus a strong second quarter, which included a number of significant IPOs and were down 11% versus last year. Year-to-date, we ranked Number 1 globally in equity underwriting supported by nearly $50 billion of deal volume across more than 280 transactions. While the recent market reception for certain companies has been less favorable, over the long term, we believe investors will continue to invest in growing, innovative, and disruptive businesses that create value for customers and shareholders.","Turning to debt underwriting, net revenues were $586 million, down 7% from a year ago reflecting a decline in industry-wide leverage financed transactions and in-line with a decline in M&A related financings. Nonetheless, our franchise remains well-positioned evidenced by our Number 2 high-yield league table ranking year-to-date.","Against the backdrop of the quarter's performance, it is important to point out that our Investment Banking backlog increased versus the second quarter as we saw improvements in both advisory and financing. Given our healthy levels of strategic dialogues, our expanding client footprint, and the nature of our corporate relationships, we continue to be optimistic that our clients will remain active in executing transactions supported by well-functioning and liquid capital markets.","Moving to Institutional Client Services on Page 5, net revenues were solid at $3.3 billion in the third quarter, up 6% versus last year, driven by growth across our diversified FICC and equities businesses, and as David noted at the start, reflective of progress made across our businesses in terms of our clients and business mix and the development of electronic platforms.","FICC client execution net revenues were $1.4 billion in the third quarter, up 8% year-over-year, driven by higher client activity in a mixed operating environment. Four of our five FICC businesses posted higher net revenues versus the prior year reflecting the continued strength of our client centric model and improved diversification of our business mix.","Our rates franchise generated solid client activity in both the U.S. and Europe and saw increased hedging flows from corporate, pension, and insurance clients amid the significant rally in government bonds.","In commodities, our business was diversified and produced higher net revenues on higher activity in natural gas and power, as well as in oil, where we supported clients during the September price volatility.","We also delivered solid performance in credit and mortgages where net revenues increased amidst improved activity from our broadening client base. These results reflect our continued focus on improving the velocity of risk inventory supporting more efficient capital management in the business.","Lastly in currencies, net revenues declined driven by a more difficult geopolitical backdrop in emerging markets as volatility in Latin America and in particular Argentina offset strong performance in Europe. ","As we\u2019ve discussed previously, we were investing to expand our capabilities to automate workflows, serve our clients electronically and deliver structured solutions in efficient formats. In our credit business, we are making considerable progress utilizing our systematic platforms to efficiently price, risk manage and execute trades. For example, this quarter, we executed a number of sizable trades in U.S. investment-grade credit providing key financial and insurance clients access to our broad risk intermediation capabilities.","Additionally, we recently enhanced our electronic execution capabilities for commodities by leveraging the infrastructure of our Marquee platform. These efforts ultimately improve client experience, execution and pricing, while at the same time, provide us access to serve a broader client base on a more cost-efficient basis.","Turning to equities on Page 6. Net revenues for the third quarter were $1.9 billion, down 6% sequentially from a robust second quarter, but up 5% versus a year ago. Equities client execution net revenues of $681 million were flat versus a year ago as stronger cash results offset lower derivative revenues. Net revenues from commissions and fees were $728 million, up 8% versus a year ago aided by higher client activity. Security services net revenues of $468 million were up 7% year-over-year. Over the course of 2019, we continue to benefit from new prime balances and a rebound in average balances. ","Moving to investing in lending on Page 7, collectively, our activities in I&L produced net revenues of $1.7 billion in the third quarter. Given market movements, particularly in certain public investments, it was a very clear divergence in the performance of equities relative to debt securities and loans.","Our equity investments generated net revenues of $662 million, down significantly versus last year, driven in part by a reduction in market value on our public investment portfolio. As we discussed on our last call, we hold a number of publicly traded equity investments with customary lockups following IPOs.","Our public portfolio currently includes large investments in Uber, Avantor, and Tradeweb. These three positions, in particular, saw significant price pressure during the quarter and were the primary drivers of the $267 million of mark-to-market loss in our public investment portfolio. Taken together, these investments continue to represent approximately 40% of our $2.3 billion public investment portfolio.","The performance of our private investment portfolio was also lower versus last year, but showed positive results and continued to perform well, given the diversity of our investments. Private equity net revenues of $929 million were driven by strong underlying corporate performance and events such as sales or additional capital raises. Against that strength and performance, our private investment portfolio was also burdened by certain negative revaluations, including an approximately $80 million mark associated with our position in the [We] company.","Turning to Page 8, net revenues from debt securities and loans were $1 billion and included $891 million of net interest income and modest mark-to-market gains. Our total loan portfolio was approximately $100 billion, up approximately $2.5 billion sequentially with the increase driven by loan growth across the portfolio, and we note as we have in the past, that 84% of our total loan portfolio remains secured.","Our provision for loan losses was $291 million, up $77 million versus last quarter, driven by idiosyncratic impairments. Importantly, provisions related to our Marcus portfolio were relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. Our firm-wide net charge-off ratio decreased by 10 basis points to approximately 50 basis points and remains relatively low. While credit costs continue to normalize from this cycle\u2019s low levels, our overall credit exposure remains appropriately sized. ","On Page 9, turning to investment management, we produced $1.7 billion of revenues in the third quarter, driven by our diversified global asset management business and leading private wealth franchise. Net revenues included record management and other fees of $1.5 billion, which were up 5% versus last year, reflecting continued growth in assets under supervision. We also saw significantly lower incentive fees and modestly lower transaction revenues from our PWM client trading activity versus a year ago.","Assets under supervision finished the quarter at a record $1.8 trillion, up by $102 billion versus the second quarter, driven by $86 billion of net inflows and $16 billion of market appreciation. The $86 billion of net inflows included $58 billion from the acquisitions of S&P's Investment Advisory Services business and United Capital; $12 billion from organic long-term net inflows, primarily from alternative investments and fixed income; and $16 billion of organic liquidity inflows.","Now, let me turn to expenses on Page 10, our total operating expenses of $5.6 billion were roughly flat versus the third quarter of last year. This reflected lower compensation expense concurrent with lower revenues and higher non-compensation costs. On compensation, as I have said in the past, our philosophy remains to pay for performance. The reduction in the year-to-date ratio to 35% is a reflection as always of our best estimate of the appropriate accrual for the firm, which for the full-year 2018 was just below 34%.","Also, as we have noted previously, as we grow more platform-driven businesses, we expect compensation to decline as a portion of total operating expenses making our total efficiency ratio a more relevant metric for the firm. Platform businesses should carry higher marginal margins at scale and be less reliant on compensation. ","As David discussed earlier, we continue to invest in a number of important initiatives across the firm both to build new businesses and digital platforms, as well as to enhance the firm's infrastructure. To provide you some measure of that investment, a meaningful driver of the year-to-date growth in non-compensation expenses relates to firm-wide technology spending and expenses related to four key projects, Marcus, Apple Card, Transaction Banking, and United Capital.","We continue to expect the depth of that investment cycle will be in 2019 though investment spending will continue into the future years. Year-to-date, the total pre-tax impact of our organic projects, Marcus, Apple Card and Transaction Banking is approximately $450 million, resulting in a drag of roughly 60 basis points on our ROE. As these businesses scale over the coming years, we expect this drag to reverse becoming accretive to the firm's ROE.","For the year-to-date, our efficiency ratio was 66.2%, up 200 basis points versus a year ago, driven by lower revenues and ongoing investments, partially offset by lower compensation expense. Next on taxes, our reporting tax rate was 22% for the quarter and 21% for the year-to-date. We expect our full-year 2019 tax rate to be approximately 22%.","Turning to capital on Page 11. Our Common equity tier 1 ratio was 13.6% using the standardized approach and 13.4% under the advanced approach. The ratios decreased by 20 basis points and 10 basis points respectively versus the second quarter, driven primarily by increased credit risk-weighted assets and roughly 10 basis point impact from our acquisition of United Capital. Our SLR was 6.2%, down 20 basis points sequentially. ","In the quarter, we returned a total of $1.1 billion to shareholders, including stock repurchases of $673 million and $466 million in common stock dividends. Our basic share count ended the quarter at another record low of 369 million shares. Our book value per share was $219, up 11% versus a year ago.","We note that our $673 million of share repurchase amount this quarter was less than our $1.75 billion quarterly CCAR authorization. During the quarter, we elected to suspend our open market repurchases as we had begun discussions with certain U.S. governmental authorities with respect to the resolution of the 1MDB matter. We have since resumed our repurchases under an existing 10b5-1 program, and given our incremental disclosures, we are now resuming additional open market repurchase activities as resolution discussions continue. ","To be clear, our decision to step away from the market was not motivated by capital concerns as we remain confident in our strong capital position. As this was the first quarter of our fourth quarter CCAR cycle, we will carry forward the unutilized authorization and will continue to balance our priorities of prudent capital management and return of capital in excess of growth investment via share repurchases.","Turning to Page 12 for our balance sheet, our balance sheet was just over $1 trillion, up $62 billion versus last quarter, driven by client demand in Repo and equities. On the liability side, deposits increased to $183 billion, including consumer deposits of $55 billion, which more than doubled since last year to become our largest deposit channel.","Before taking questions, a few brief closing thoughts. While our third quarter performance was solid given the market backdrop, we continue to invest in driving the firm forward and aspire to delivering high returns in the future. As David discussed, we are executing on a number of fronts and are making real progress across several of our strategic priorities.","Overall, our client-centric strategy remains simple and unchanged. First, to serve our clients with excellence thus growing and strengthening our existing business. Second, to diversify our business into adjacent and new areas by expanding our offering of products and services. And third, to operate more efficiently and effectively across the entire firm. As we continue to make progress on our efforts, we are confident that we can deliver leading long-term returns for our shareholders and we look forward to providing a more comprehensive update in January.","With that, thank you again for dialing-in. I will now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Glenn Schorr","Thanks very much. Big picture question, during the quarter, you know, we saw the funding markets get all discombobulated, still not standing on their own, we also saw the liquid markets temporally get hurt whether it be recent broken IPOs \u2013 recent IPOs being broken or resetting of some private valuations, so of the big picture of question I have for you is, I'm listening to you talk and you don't sound that concerned like the plumbing's broken. I know we\u2019ve seen these things come and go before, but I just wanted to see if you could talk specifically towards those two big issues and just see if hopefully just overstating a short-term impact on the market?","David Solomon","Sure. Thanks, thanks Glenn and I appreciate the question. You know I\u2019d say at a high level, I don\u2019t think the plumbing\u2019s broken, although I do think that you\u2019ve pointed to two places where there are certainly adjustments and changes in evolution. There\u2019s no question that the short-term funding markets experienced a combination of factors that led to the need for some intervention. I would say some of this is market structure and kind of supply and demand, the liquidity in the market and some of it is the impact of regulatory change over a period of time combining with those things.","We actually saw some opportunity to work with clients in the context of that and deploy balance sheet, and I think you framed it correctly, there's still work to do to move forward with respect to the short-term funding markets. But I don't think it's fundamentally broken, but I think that will be an evolutionary process of finding the right balance. With respect to private capital formation, you know, again, I think the IPO process is alive and well in the United States. I do think \u2013 or actually globally to put it in that context, I do think that we are going to see a rebalancing of this process of private capital formation, the size and the magnitude of that private capital formation and the period of time with respect to which people get the public markets.","I think one of the things that public markets do is, public markets provide discipline and process around companies, and that the public markets are very efficient in doing that, and I think the transparency around some of this private capital formation is going to increase over a period of time not that we are more disciplined against it, but I don't fundamentally think that its broken, I actually think that it\u2019s a healthy adjustment for rebalancing. I\u2019d like Stephen to maybe to make a comment or two around our balance sheet deployment in the context of some of these changes on short-term liquidity, but on the high level, those are the comments I\u2019d make on those two issues. ","Stephen Scherr","You know Glenn, just to pivot up David\u2019s comments, you know, I would say that we obviously are mindful and watch all of the attending risks that sort of present themselves systemically, near-term, short-term liquidity, what happened in the Repo market is obviously one that we\u2019re focused on. I would say that in our case, as an intermediary, we saw an opportunity to source liquidity and to provide liquidity to clients. And so, for us, this is a lot about the elasticity of balance sheet to serve our clients in terms of what we did in stepping in during dislocation, you know, in the Repo market. It had no negative impact to us from a liquidity point of view. We had sufficient liquidity to do it, but I think from the perspective of our firm, stepping in to serve clients, it was a lot about flexibility and balance sheet and growing balance sheet so as to provide liquidity as an intermediary in the market more broadly.","Glenn Schorr","Awesome! I have one little follow up on your comments about the 8K, which I saw on 1MDB. So, I heard a comment on the stopping and starting of the buyback and I saw the $47 million reserve taken, which I think a lot of people would say is not that much, so I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth, but just how does that make you feel \u2013 should we feel like you're fully reserved for 1MDB? Where are we in the process? What\u2019s your RPL? If you could talk to those issues that\u2019d be awesome.","Stephen Scherr","Sure, sure. So, I think you should feel comfortable because we feel comfortable that we've gone through, you know, an appropriate process in assessing both the situation involving 1MDB and other legal matters, and in that context, both with internal and outside counsel. You know we have fixed our RPL and our reserve at the level that the accounting standards require in both of those respects. On the RPL, bearing in mind this number is as good as it is till we get to the 10-Q when it's formally set up, but we have that set now at $2.9 billion. That\u2019s up roughly $300 million from where it was in the last Q.","There was, as you pointed out, a modest adjustment in reserves, and in the context, obviously, both carry a very different accounting threshold and standard, one being reasonably possible, the other being probable and estimable, and in that context, we feel comfortable with where we are, you know, given the standing of legal circumstances both relating to 1MDB and otherwise.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Christian Bolu","Good morning, David and Stephen. David, as you transition to franchise to your target operating model, is there an ROE flow you'd like to maintain while you\u2019re at the transition phase? I guess is the 9% ROE this quarter are sort of a good way to think about the flow? Or you\u2019re willing to sacrifice, you know, the near-term profitability for the longer-term vision?","David Solomon","Thanks for the question, Christian and I \u2013 you know I think, I understand, I\u2019d try to put it in, you know what, through the cycle context and also short-term context. If you look at our \u2013 if you look at our, you know, ROE year-to-date, our ROE year-to-date is over 10%. But as Stephen clearly articulated on the call, there has been about a 60-basis point drain on our ROE year-to-date given the investments that we\u2019re making across our three principal projects, the card, our markets digital consumer banking platform and also transaction services.","We continue to make investments to drive our firm and the returns of the firm higher in the medium and longer term and we are willing to sacrifice some short-term returns to make these investments, better position and strengthen the franchise and allow us to better deliver for our clients in the long run.","Christian Bolu","Great, thank you. And then, Stephen, maybe a couple of questions on the credit provisions, on the impairments, maybe it be more color, I think you mentioned it was not Marcus, so just to be more color on what it was? And then, on CECL, I think you disclosed that the day one here to be somewhere like $400 million to $600 million, of which half of that is about the consumer book, but as we look forward, we think about the Apple Card, broader plans to grow consumer, how should we think about the day two impact? Sort of any ongoing CECL impact through 2020 and beyond?","Stephen Scherr","Sure. So, maybe I\u2019d take the second part of your question first. In terms of CECL, just to be precise, the guidance we've given is a $600 million to $800 million adjustment. I\u2019d also point out that as the portfolio around Apple Card grows in throughout 2020, obviously we\u2019re building that reserve from, you know, a base of zero as it relates to the credit card portfolio itself. And so, those reserves will be built in the context of the CECL requirements, so there\u2019s no adjustment to reflect in as obviously the reserves are not yet been taken.","On the first part of your question, I\u2019d point out that we took $291 million loan loss provision, which itself was up $77 million quarter-over-quarter. That related to a couple of things. One was four idiosyncratic corporate impairments, each of which was less than $30 million, none of which would give rise to any sort of perceptible trend or impact as it relates to the broader portfolio itself. And net charge-off, I think as I noted in the prepared remarks, that ratio was down 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 50 basis points.","I\u2019d say as it relates to, you know, the markets unsecured portfolio, the provisions there were relatively flat quarter-on-quarter. That portfolio is now performing much more in line with our initial modeled expectations. You\u2019ve heard me talk before about some of the earlier vintages performing at a worst loss rate. Those now have come back in. This is performing more in-line with the model. And so, what\u2019s reflected in the provision is not a reflection of any degradation in that portfolio. I should point out though that, you know, provisions will grow as it relates to growth in the portfolio itself. That includes credit cards, that includes unsecured loans, but there\u2019s no reflection embedded in that to the quality and the performance of the portfolio itself.","Operator","Your next question is from line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Michael Carrier ","Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. Maybe the first one, just given the lighter equity I&L revenues in the quarter, you mentioned some of the public, you know, pressures. Can you give us maybe some color on the portfolio in terms of the sector breakdown, maybe the current value versus costs? Just trying to get, you know, some context to some of the pressures that we're seeing on private valuations and if we could see that, you know, kind of, you know, bleeding into the future or, you know, most of that, you know, was right size this quarter?","Stephen Scherr","Yes. So, let me start with the public portfolio, the public portfolio, I think as I mentioned, has a carry value of $2.3 billion. The names that I had mentioned, Uber, Tradeweb and Avantor comprise about 40% of that portfolio, and those were the largest contributors to the downdraft if you will in the public portfolio itself where we mark those is obviously the observable market less some form of the liquidity discount, particularly in situations where there's a lockup or these are other circumstances that warrant it.","In the private portfolio, you know, the size of that I should say is just shy of $20 billion, $19.7 billion and there, we mark as I\u2019ve said in the past, mostly on an event driven basis, meaning, we look at circumstances where there's another round, there's been a sale. We look at the underlying performance of those names and, you know, we make \u2013 we set our marks, you know, in that regard. I\u2019d called out, you know, the [We] company in particular because it obviously got quite a bit of notoriety in the press.","As I mentioned, the revaluation there was in the neighborhood of $80 million in terms of our loss. Our carry value there, I should point out, is approximately $70 million, which I would tell you is meaningfully higher than where our embedded cost is in that particular name. So, if there was further downdraft, there\u2019s still embedded profit in the name itself, but I called that out just given the nature of the press and the notoriety around the name itself.","Michael Carrier","Okay. That\u2019s helpful color. And then, just as a follow up, you guys are, you know, fairly significant in the alternative asset managed business. You\u2019ve created some changes, you know, in that platform. Just wanted to get, you know, your perspective on like how you\u2019re thinking about that business going forward in terms of third-party funds? What that could mean for a fee growth? But then also any shift, you know, in balance sheet usage, you know, over time?","David Solomon","Sure. Sure, Michael and, you know, I think we talked about this a little bit on the last call, but we see the opportunity for us as a significant manager of alternative assets both for ourselves and for our clients at the time \u2013 at the current time, an opportunity for us to meaningfully grow the client fees that we have. Our teams are working hard at developing a medium and long-term plan. With respect to that growth, we\u2019ll certainly communicate more about that when we have our strategic update and review. But I think it's fair to say that the growth of those assets and the development of that business will happen more over time in the medium or longer-term.","As I think we stated publicly before, and we talked last time that we were on the call, we will continue to invest balance sheet capital and people should not see or expect in the short-term a change in with respect to the way we deploy balance sheet, but over time the medium and long-term as we evolve this business and grow other revenue streams, we\u2019ll certainly reconsider that and we evaluate what we think is appropriate.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Steven Chubak","Hi, good morning. So, I wanted to just start with a follow up to one of Christian\u2019s earlier questions, it\u2019s one that we\u2019ve been fielding from a number investors as well, which is this concern that you have a long timeline before some of the newer growth initiatives achieve scale, suggesting it could, a lot of time can pass before we actually see the benefits to the P&L. And so, I was hoping you could speak to higher balancing the need to execute on the longer-term initiatives while still delivering improved near-term profitability? And where could that near-term profitability improve and ultimately come from if you could cite a number of the potential sources that would be really helpful?","David Solomon","Sure, and I\u2019ll talk about this, and look, this is a balance and I think it starts from the fact that we have \u2013 you know we have an institutional business. We\u2019ve historically had an institutional business that\u2019s very capital market sensitive. We\u2019re taking the opportunity to grow more fee-based durable recurring revenues, but that will take some time and we\u2019re thinking about building those businesses in the medium and long term for Goldman Sachs over a long period of time.","We\u2019ve been around for a long time and we look back historically the way we built our asset management business, the way we built our other international business, the way we built our investing businesses. These are businesses we\u2019ve built over a long period of time organically and that is our thought process with respect to a number of these. When you say a long time, you know, a long time is a subjective word. You know we think about getting real contributions from some of these investments that we\u2019re making over the next three to five years, but I understand in the context of short-term catalysts that that might feel like a long time.","In the meantime, though, we are very, very focused on our, what I\u2019ll call, short and medium-term performance and we\u2019re particularly focused on efficiency in the organization and where there are cost and efficiency opportunities. And we think over the next 12 to 24 months, we can make meaningful progress on that and when we get a strategic update, we will probably quantify that more specifically.","In addition, we are making investments in platforms and some of our clients where we think we will see tangible benefits in the next 12 to 24 months. That can be with respect to footprint expansion, that can be with respect to technology platforms inside our securities business with a lot of better connectivity, you know, to our clients. And so, I think there\u2019s a mix of things that both enhance or move us along in the next 12 to 24 months. And then, we\u2019ve been talking on this call and otherwise about some of what I\u2019ll call the bigger tentpole investments where we will see the benefits over a three to five-year period and we have objectives to build bigger businesses over the next decade.","Stephen Scherr","Steven, the one other thing I'll add to David\u2019s comments is around funding optimization and liquidity management, which I think will yield much shorter-term benefit to the firm overall and that work, you know, has already begun. And so, there I'm talking about funding substitution to lower cost retail deposits relative to wholesale. It is being more diligent about overall liquidity management in the firm and sizing liquidity appropriately. I think all of those in addition to what David was speaking about in terms of efficiency and overall operating expenses will be two near-term elements that I think people can look to, you know, in the context of a longer-term profile to some of the bigger investments.","Steven Chubak","Thank you both for that helpful color. And just one follow-up for me on the election, certainly encouraging to hear that you're seeing your backlog grow. I was hoping if you could speak about the election certainty, how that\u2019s impacting CEO confidence, and maybe just bigger picture as it relates to some of the growth initiatives given the heightened scrutiny of the private equity business by some of the more progressive candidates? How does that inform your decision to deploy more resources towards that expansion, particularly on the alternative side?","David Solomon","Sure, and I appreciate that question and, you know, as you would expect as I travel around and talk to people, people are interested in talking about the election. The election cycle started, but I would just highlight that we are very, very early in the process and I think to speculate on where we wind up with candidates and also depending on which candidates we wind up with, what we wind up in the context of an election, what we wind up in the context of a legislative process after the election and how some of what\u2019s going to get discussed in election cycle turns into policy, I still think there\u2019s a lot of ground cover.","We\u2019re building \u2013 to the second part of your question in investment platform for the long run, private investment \u2013 private investment, alternative investment activities, whether it's private equity or credit or infrastructure or growth capital, I think despite the fact that there can be dialogue around evolutions in that business or potential regulation of certain aspects of that, that will not change the opportunity in those businesses for us over a long period of time. In addition, I\u2019d just also highlight that I think one of the virtues of our organization is that we\u2019re agile, nimble, responsive and adaptive.","We\u2019ve been around for 150 years. There\u2019ve been a lot of different political regimes. There\u2019ve been lots of evolutions in markets, and I think this organization has always proven that it can adapt and it can respond. And so, we\u2019re watching the environment like everyone else. I think it\u2019s early to draw conclusions, but we\u2019ll always be thinking from both a client standpoint, a strategic standpoint, and a risk management standpoint as we have more information how to best position the firm for returns for our shareholders.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good morning.","Stephen Scherr ","Good morning.","David Solomon","Hi, good morning, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","Two questions, one you cited the deposit is $55 billion, you know, obviously a very large number that you\u2019ve been able to generate over the course of last couple of years in Marcus and others. Just wondering how you are thinking about redeploying that and the growth you are expecting from here into your businesses? Is it all into loans? Or, you know, can you do more than just loans with the deposits?","Stephen Scherr","Sure. So, thanks Betsy. On deposits, obviously they\u2019ve doubled. Retail deposits have doubled in the year and our anticipation is to continue to grow it across the U.S. and the UK platform by about that $10 billion a year. What that does for us is it enables us to fund a variety of different businesses not limited to loans in the context of that, which sits in the bank. And so, you know, as much as we\u2019re raising deposits, we\u2019re equally mindful of businesses that can be brought into the bank into these so as to avail ourselves for the deposits we\u2019re raising.","And so, there are a number of businesses, including our rates business and equally the movement of our FX business, which is much more suited to consume, you know, short-dated retail deposits than longer duration wholesale funding. And so, we are moving more businesses into the bank, both U.S. and UK bank, you know, so as to take advantage of the growth and the more attractive, both term and pricing on those deposits themselves. ","Betsy Graseck ","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then, as you think about the reconfiguration of how your, you know, presenting Goldman\u2019s, you know, earnings to the Street in January where does the value of those deposits get allocated? Does that get allocated to a consumer bank? Does that get allocated to, you know, the top of the shop to the federation? Just trying to understand how you\u2019re thinking through the value of that deposit creation and who gets credit for that?","Stephen Scherr","Sure. So, I think it would be a little early to get into that granularity. You know our objective as we get toward the end of the year and certainly at the end of January when we present to the market, you know, our objective is to have enhancement to our disclosure, you know, which will give people a much better sense of how we manage the business, and therefore, how we talk about the business and equally providing all of you, you know, what\u2019s kind of the right lens through which to look at our business more broadly.","We've been taking commentary and perspective from investors and from you in the context that where there's been some frustration. I hear it loud and clear on the context of frustration with I&L as an example. And so, you know, we\u2019re going to guide ourselves in the direction of segments, you know, to meet some of what all of you have been asking for and just on that particular issue, you know, I think only to wait till we finalize some of what we do.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Mike Mayo","Hi.","Stephen Scherr","Hello.","David Solomon ","Hi, Mike.","Mike Mayo","If you could just give a little bit more color on the technology investments? I mean you\u2019re your stock trades below tangible book value for a company that\u2019s grown book value twice the pace of the S&P 500 over the last two decades? So, somebody\u2019s not convinced about your investments and the eventual payoff. So, as a side note, you know, how \u2013 when does that drag of 60 basis points to ROE become positive over, you know, how many years? But more importantly, what are the external milestones that we can monitor to see if you\u2019re on track or not? Or do we just have to wait three to five years and say, okay, you made it or not? And in my \u2013 I know in my career I've covered other companies. They say it's on track then five years sometimes 10 years later your go, oops, it didn't work. So, how do we know that you'll be that \u2013 the good version instead of the bad version? And then if you want to add in some governance changes that you're doing, David, it seems like from a tire to be the destination workplace for technologists.","David Solomon","Okay. So, there\u2019s a lot there in the question, but let me, Mike, get a couple of things at a high level. And first look, I certainly expect us to be on the good end of what you're saying and one of the reasons that we\u2019re working toward the strategic uptick in January is one of the things that we expect to layout for you is targets that will be held accountable to that can also give you a better sense and more transparency on what we\u2019re doing and how you should hold this accountable over a period of time toward doing it. And I\u2019d just say and I noticed this might be in some way, you know, not moving as fast as you like or not moving as quickly, but the lens I'd like you to consider, you know, looking through as we started on this journey a year ago and in the context of the year, we\u2019re meaningfully increasing the transparency. ","We\u2019re moving in the direction of doing this and it just takes some time, but I understand the question and the demand that you have that we need to lay out some clear objectives and better metrics and more transparency and I think we\u2019re on our way to doing that. I can\u2019t comment on, you know, why the firm, you know, values us, you know, where it does, but what I do believe that if we continue to compound our book value on both in absolute basis, you pointed out, you know, over 20 years, I\u2019d point out that our book value growth over one-year, three years, five years, 10 years has outpaced the peer set.","If we continue to do that over time and if over time because the investments that we make add more fee-based or durable revenue to our business mix and we\u2019re able therefore to move all the turns higher, I do believe over the time the market will reward us. Now, Stephen, do you have anything else that you would add based on some of the questions that Mike laid out?","Stephen Scherr","No. I think, Mike, maybe to address the question of timeline, so, you know, not all of these initiatives, you know, operate in the same set of time sequence. So, as an example, I think that consumer initiative is one, you know, that will be over the medium to long term. You know what we've built to this point in three years, you know, is effectively a bank that has $55 billion of the deposits and $5 billion in loans and a new credit card platform that\u2019s begun with Apple, but that can go in a variety of different places and partnerships. I think that will take some time to sort of see that investment payout.","Shorter-term, I would say you could look at, for example, transaction banking, where, you know, that platform is one where, as we\u2019ve said several times, we are the first customer. We\u2019re a current customer of that. So right now, you know, we\u2019ve processed more than $250 billion of payments for Goldman Sachs through that platform and equally we are on schedule to bring very consequential corporate clients to the firm onto that platform and I think given the nature of that spend, its ability to borrow on some of the technology that was built on the consumer side, you know, we\u2019ll have a much faster sort of payback, if you will, relative to the longer cycle around consumer. And so, I think these will vary. But David is 100% right. We will present to you metrics by which you should measure us and we\u2019ll hold ourselves to it as we execute along this path.","Mike Mayo","And then, just one follow-up then, I mean if you're in Silicon Valley, you\u2019re saying what you're doing is just phenomenal. I mean they\u2019re just saying this is fantastic. If you're a competitor of Goldman, I\u2019d have to say they are not taking this too seriously based on my conversation. So, what is it that your universal bank competitors are under appreciating and by consequence, the shareholders are under appreciating in terms of how they expect the payoff from these investments?","David Solomon","I understand the question at a high level, Mike. But what I'd say here is one way to think about it. Over the course of the last three years, we\u2019ve built a digital consumer platform that\u2019s only beginning to evolve that has $55 billion of deposits; it has $5 billion of loans; it is 4 million to 5 million customers. We've also built the first credit card platform at a meaningful period of time and have launched a partnership with it and what we believe is one of the most successful credit card launches, if not, the most successful credit card launch ever. If \u2013 we\u2019ve spent on that, you know, over $1 billion, a little over $1 billion. If you were asked, would you spend $1 billion to get that? You would say, sure, you might spend more.","Certainly, someone could have justified our study meaningfully more to kind of acquire that inorganically. We\u2019re very focused on proving what we do over time. I think this firm over time has a good track record of building businesses that are successfully integrated into the firm and really succeed all the time. I pointed this out earlier in the call when I highlighted our asset management business that was built over a long period of time or international business that was built over a long period of time, our investing platforms that were built over a long period of time. And so, we\u2019re focused on proving ourselves over time; we\u2019re focused on our clients and we\u2019re less focused on competitor views on these issues.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one, you guys have done some smaller opportunistic deals recently, but with the potential, it sounds like you are closer and in active discussions on 1MDB in putting that behind you, which is great. Once you're able to have clarity on that does that open you up for -- to consider some larger deals? And one place that investors have recently started to focus on would be a discount broker space. It\u2019s been hit recently with the commission cut; it seems to fit with your new strategic direction. And so, when you think about a deal, I know you probably wouldn\u2019t want to talk about anything specific in a particular space, but how would you balance assessing tangible book regulatory capital hits versus long-term growth and maybe attractiveness of low-cost deposits and other benefits like that?","David Solomon","Sure, and I appreciate the \u2013 I appreciate the question, Bren, and we\u2019ve talked a little bit about this, you know, over time. I think one of the things this management team is trying to do is to think broadly both about our organic growth, but also potential opportunities over time for inorganic growth. I\u2019ve said on this call and previous calls, the bar for us to do something inorganically, especially something significant inorganically is very, very high. At the same point, it\u2019s the job of this management team to have a point of view and to be doing work and to be thinking about opportunities that can expand our franchise.","The online or the discount brokerage area is not one that we\u2019re particularly focused on. We are focused on the growth of our wealth management business and the wealth management channel through the acquisition of United Capital that we just made, which we think fits very nicely into our Ayco platform and our access to corporation as the unique and differentiated channel through which to access mass affluent wealth. And so, we\u2019re much more focused on the build-out of that of ultimately tying digital capabilities to that and I think that\u2019s in the wealth management area where in the near term you'll see our primary focus.","Brennan Hawken","Thanks, David. That\u2019s very helpful color. And then, my follow-up, provisions, you guys spoke bit about it, idiosyncratic which makes sense. One book is largely commercial, so, you know, provision build tends to be idiosyncratic, how should we think about that over time though that portfolio is beginning to season? Should we generally think that the trend is generally upward and do we use this as a starting off point or because, you know, you labeled it idiosyncratic, we should adjust for a bit normalize it and then grow it from there? Is there any color on how to think about that?","Stephen Scherr","Well, it\u2019s difficult to predict kind of the forward trend because obviously, you know, we\u2019ll be mindful of where the markets are and what risk looks like in the context of taking on accretive lending opportunities. You know in the last year the run rate of net interest income that we are taking in on the book has gone from $2.8 billion on an annualized basis to $3.6 billion looking at the near $900 million that was generated in the quarter. We\u2019re doing that on the basis of a secured or largely secured book and we\u2019re experiencing very little in the way of NIM compression in the context of, you know, where we\u2019re lending.","And so, you know, I would say we\u2019ll be driven by client demand, we\u2019ll be driven by opportunities that are presented more broadly, but we\u2019re going to do it only in the context of ensuring the we\u2019re mindful of risk, we\u2019re embedding appropriate covenants into our lending. We\u2019re lending into a diversified book and we\u2019re trying to achieve as much as we can know, you know, to kind of the 84% secured book, you know, that we\u2019ve been on and I think, you know, you should take that as the general direction we\u2019ll go in terms of overall, you know, corporate lending.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Jim Mitchell ","Hi, good morning. Maybe just a quick follow-up on the Apple Card. David, you\u2019ve mentioned a couple of times that that\u2019s been potentially one of the most successful launches ever. Could you share any kind of \u2013 and I know its early days, but any kind of initial success whether its lending balances, card \u2013 number of cards out there? What kind of trend are you seeing with usage that kind of stuff?","Stephen Scherr","Yes. So, I\u2019d say a couple of things on the card. We\u2019re not a position to share kind of detailed information about it. What I would tell you though is that we have seen a pretty spectacular reception to the card as a product. The approval rates early on have been lower and I\u2019d say that that\u2019s a decision obviously Goldman Sachs is making as the bank, but we\u2019re doing that in concert with Apple and it is because we\u2019re quite vigilant from a risk point of view, but not being negatively selected out-of-the-box, meaning over time, we\u2019ll start to see better credits appear, the approval rates will go up, but we\u2019ve seen an enormous inbound. We've issued a considerable amount of cards.","We've just been through our first bill cycle, which went smoothly. And so, from an operational point of view, it\u2019s gone well. Too early to tell in a shorter period of time as we\u2019ve launched this as to sort of what the revolver transactor mix looks like, it's just too early. But from an operational point of view, from a risk perspective, you know, skewing to the higher side of FICO bands, I think we\u2019re very, very pleased as is Apple with this sort of early month or two or three into this, and, you know, we\u2019ll have more to say as we get further into the development of the portfolio itself.","Jim Mitchell","Right, okay. That\u2019s helpful. And maybe just switching gears on a follow-up on just sort of the whole efficiency discussion on the legacy business. You talked about whether it\u2019s funding efficiency, expense efficiency. Is there anything left to do on sort of capital efficiency standpoint? Do you see material opportunities there as well to boost returns? Or is it mostly expense and whether its interest expense or? ","Stephen Scherr","Well, I would say it was in \u2013 I think the opportunity sits across all of the categories to be honest. I mean, you know, you\u2019re never in a position where you should be satisfied that you\u2019re at a static point in capital is always an opportunity to optimize across a range of different businesses and to look to take capital on a consistent basis and deploy it to even higher returns than where its deployed, you know, at any given moment in time. I\u2019d also say that we\u2019re constantly looking, and as David said, we\u2019ll share more with you when we present in January at a fairly aggressive, you know, opportunity set to look at expenses and equally and as I talked about, you know, looking at funding opportunities and liquidity, you know, overall.","Some of what we've done, you know, on that score, particularly with as it relates to expenses, is as you know in the context of our front-to-back initiative, which was to take operational and technology resources and put them by in large into the businesses that are consuming what it is that those individuals are up to, keeping back a very central and strong core, both in technology and ops, but part of that is to have the businesses in much better, greater, more proximate control to the expense base in the context of both operations and technology, and we\u2019re going to continue to look around the organization, you know, to do that and in the course of it, you know, lower operational risk and raise our overall efficiency.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Chris Kotowski","Yes, good morning. I just wanted to get clarification from Steve on two items. One is, when you talked about the pace of investments you said something like that kind of \u2013 or the message I took from it is that kind of you\u2019re at the run rate of investments now and that it doesn't necessarily increase in 2020, was that the right way to interpret that?","Stephen Scherr","Well, the way I would consider it is that, you know, the rate of growth is going to decrease, right, in subsequent years on the static book of initiatives that we\u2019re looking. Obviously, there are other opportunities that present themselves that we deem to be accretive to the overall \u2013 you know to shareholder value, we\u2019ll pursue them. But against the book of initiatives that we\u2019re up to, you know 2019 should be the depth of what you see.","Chris Kotowski","The depth meaning \u2013 okay. And then, on the buybacks, you know, you mentioned the [673] versus kind of that 1.75 pace that, you know, would have \u2013 one would have assumed from the CCAR, you said you would come or come back into that. I mean does that mean we should expect the pace to go back to 1.75 or are we going to catch up what you weren't able to do this quarter through the rest of the year?","Stephen Scherr","Sure. So, let me be clear. We pulled ourselves out of the market, you know, in the context of what I had cited, which was discussions on going with respect to 1MDB. On the back of the disclosures that we've made and just an assessment that we always make about the prudence of being in or out of the market on any number of different variables, including 1MDB, we are now back in the market. We\u2019ve been back in the market based on an existing 10b5-1 program that we put so as to avoid the vagaries of being in or out, but equally we\u2019re now in a position to be back repurchasing in the open market.","I mentioned that, you know, it was in some sense fortunate that this was the first of the four quarters within the CCAR cycle, therefore, we have the opportunity to carry forward what we did not use in the context of this last quarter, and our intention as we sit here given from a position of capital strength is to continue along, you know, the strategy and philosophy that we\u2019ve had, which is to return capital back to shareholders as into the extent that there\u2019s not other deployment that\u2019s accretive in the context of growth and shareholder value. We\u2019ll continue to do that, obviously now with the benefit of the unused capacity from last quarter now to put against what we can do this quarter.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.","Devin Ryan ","Great thanks. Good afternoon, David and Stephen. I guess a couple of follow-ups here to some of the newer growth initiatives. In transaction services, you\u2019re testing your own platform. It sounds like that's going well, but I just want to dig in a bit since you\u2019re moving closer to on-boarding clients, so the question is if you can talk a little bit about just the early feedback from customers, and, you know, how you\u2019re framing the competitive advantages, and really just how you expect that business is going ramp, meaning, you know is the expectation that you\u2019re going to win kind of a small piece of customers\u2019 wallets initially and then potentially it could scale from there? Or are you expecting, you know, some chunky mandates early on?","Stephen Scherr","Sure. So, as I said, we are now using the platform operationally. And so, it's not in sort of small amount testing. We've been through that period. Now, we\u2019re using it, you know, as I said, to tune of more than $250 billion of payments being made for Goldman Sachs. In terms of the forward end clients, you know, we have been engaged as early as the diligence around the idea with a number of very large corporate clients so as to ascertain a couple of things. One, what if they think was missing from that which they are using currently; and secondly, what could we be building so as to satisfy the needs of what they want.","Many big corporates have a platform that carries three or four banks on that platform much as our longer-term ambition is to be a major player in the place \u2013 in the space, and to sit in one or two. You know, our early ambition is to be in the three or four slot, and work our way into the platform, and we will start across the five major currencies. What I think and what we're hearing, many large corporates say about the attractiveness of what we\u2019re building is two-fold.","One, that the technology fees is much better, much newer, not nearly as manual in terms of reconciliation as what clients have been accustomed to use for technology that largely has not changed over the last many years. Second, in the context of funding and operational deposits, obviously Goldman Sachs is a good buyer of incremental deposits. ","We\u2019ve shown that in the context of retail deposits, it will be true around sticky operational deposits and what we\u2019re not intending to lead with cost, you know doubling if you will want big commercial banks are paying in terms of 1 basis point or 2 basis points to sort of 3, 4 or 5 basis points, I can assure you we will be meaningfully accretive to the firm in terms of funding substitution.","So, I think a function both of the technology interface, the spend or what we will payout for operational deposits, I think our two elements in terms of what\u2019s driving the attraction of certain corporate clients into what it is that we\u2019re building.","Devin Ryan ","Thanks for all the color Stephen appreciate it. And then just a follow up here, you know almost exactly a year ago you announced Ayco\u2019s high-profile partnership with Google to provide financial wellness to kind of the entire employee base, I know some of the recent initiatives in the United Capital transaction are going to be synergistic there, is it like David mentioned in the prepared remarks, I'm just curious how you are going to market as you focus more broadly on kind of the full employment employee basis of firms and really whether you are aggressively marketing the platform to some of the larger organizations that I know Goldman has relationships with or if it makes sense to or is there any logic behind trying to connect more into kind of your consumer offering essentially waiting to really push hard so you have a broader platform before you really kind of go through kind of all those relationships that you have on the, at the firm level? Just trying to think about kind of how to gauge what you're doing with kind of the full employee basis of the firms that you're working towards on the wealth management side?","David Solomon","Yes. So, I\u2019d say, we obviously think we have a uniqueness distribution channel through Ayco and our corporate relationships as you highlight Devin, and we've started the process of going after that, but I would say we saw a lot of upside, I would say you know the footprint of Ayco\u2019s connectivity to the Fortune 100 is high. The footprint of connectivity to the Fortune 1000 there is an awful lot of upside. And one of the things that the acquisition of United Capital does is it allows us to accelerate the penetration in those corporations and one of those things we've found is if you deliver a good product and service to the top of those organizations or the most senior people in those organizations, the ability then to next step leave it to the organization follows on quite clearly. ","So, we see a good opportunity and a lot of upside to expand the channel. That\u2019s why we're very, very focused on it. Over time, I do think as you highlight there can be digital connectivity as we build a more digital two market platform, but that\u2019s still something that\u2019s often the future, and so we continue to focus on really penetrating a broader set of corporate clients where we have good relationships and access to their employee base.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital. Please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good afternoon Stephen and David.","David Solomon","Hi.","Gerard Cassidy","Question I have is, obviously as you guys pointed out in your numbers, your number one year-to-date in global equity underwriting, can you guys give us some color on what your views are about the direct listing that was apparently a big meeting out in California and you probably saw, written about in the third quarter or possibly even in October, but can you just give us your thoughts on the threat to the equity underwriting business possibly from these direct listings?","David Solomon","Sure. At a high level I would say that the utility of direct listings and the number of direct listings that we will see over time is still something, but I think there is a lot of question. There have been two direct listings. We\u2019ve participated as a lead advisor on both those direct listings. I think the companies were in some way unusual in the context the way they approached the market, but I still think that whether or not this is the best path or a path that could be open to lots of companies approaching the market is still something that\u2019s questionable.","One of the things that the IPO process does generally is, you raise capital and therefore there is a price discovery around creating depth of liquidity because people are actually raising capital. Obviously the two companies have gone through a direct listing process did not need to raise capital. It is interesting to note where those companies are at the current point. We are engaged as others are in dialogue about this. We are very, very open to helping our clients if they are interested in considering a direct listing, and so we are participating actively in those discussions.","I'd say, I think the noise around this really disrupting the IPO market or potentially disrupting the economic opportunity for the leading banks like ourselves and a handful of others in the IPO market is overstated at this point, but I do think that they will continue to be evolution in these processes and there are ways that we can so clients better or find ways to get them to market more efficiently. We're certainly willing to do that. I like where we sit as the leading firm or one of the leading firm\u2019s because whether a direct listing or a traditional IPO process, we benefit from both those channels.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good and then moving over to the equity markets business, clearly, we\u2019ve all seen on the consumer side, Charles Schwab, Fidelity bring their commission rates down to 0, when we know in cash equities institutional rates have fallen and electronification has helped everybody manage that decline in rates. Do you guys ever envision that we could get to 0 commissions in cash equities similar to what we see in the retail side?","David Solomon","Look, I think it is a more complicated equation because I think the leading franchises and the equity business you really have an integrated platform at scale on a global basis that\u2019s providing value in a variety of ways. And it\u2019s very hard to pull that apart entirely. So, the answer to your question is, scale really benefits us and the other people that are in a leading position. It is not just execution, but it is also financing and those things get lumped together. I think it\u2019s unlikely that it goes to 0, but I do think to a degree that is more pressure on commissions, which there has been and they will probably will continue to be.","The organization\u2019s that have global scale and ability to use financing and balance sheet as an integrated capability I think should continue to do well. If you actually go back and look at the market share or the wallet share that the top three platforms have over the last 5 years to 10 years, they have actually gained wallet share in that period of time and you could really see the benefit of scale.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Yes. I just have one quick question. Now you are giving some of the pluses and minuses around expenses and some of the growth investments that you are doing this year, but if you think about it, is it right way to think about this, if you had a flat revenue environment you still should be able to see expenses decline, therefore generate positive operating leverage? Thanks.","Stephen Scherr","Sure. I mean, I think much of the investing we are doing is consuming operating leverage that exist in the business, and the forward initiatives that David and I have talked about in terms of funding rationalization and expense reduction are all initiatives that need and must go on and they will continue to create operating leverage in the business, which will be put toward growth opportunities in the firm or shareholder return in the absence of them.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.","Marty Mosby","Thanks. Couple of questions. When you look at your net interest margin 43 basis points can you kind of parse out, what you get from the markets and what that margin looks like and what the net interest margin looks like in your banking business because as you are growing, the banking side, you should be able to see the margin kind of widen out, and we hadn\u2019t really seen as much of that, so I\u2019ve been kind of counting on that as part of a business mix is that your higher margin business is growing faster and just was wondering if that\u2019s something we should be able to assume over the next year or two?","David Solomon","Well. The one thing I would say is, I would be careful to sort of look at NIM across all of our businesses as kind of the relevant metric for how well we are producing. So, for example, it is less relevant metric or element in for example our trading business. Rates have moved up and down, there is higher turnover et cetera, et cetera. I think the relevance to NIM is more in our debt INL line because that looks and is more like the extension of credit and the margin you harvest on credit extension more broadly and because I think I responded earlier, our NIM has been very steady, literally marginal compression in the overall NIM in the book and I say that in the context of that book growing to an annualized basis of something on the order of $3.6 billion a year.","Again, with all the attending vigilance to risk and the like. So, I think NIM is more relevant in the context of debt INL, less relevant in terms of observable metrics about the performance of our business most notably within the trading business itself.","Marty Mosby","And could you give us some feel for what level of margin is in that business? Is it more relevant to that particular business?","David Solomon","Well. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m in a position to sort of give out the margins for each of the businesses. I would say that as you look across our businesses it wouldn't surprise you that on a segment basis investment banking and investing and lending carry with them very high margins, lower margins in the context of certain of the other businesses most notably in FICC and equities. So, I think that\u2019s probably a good survey if you will of sort of general direction of margin as and among the segments themselves.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.","Stephen Scherr","Okay. Since there are no more questions, I would like to take a moment to thank everyone for joining the call. On behalf of our senior management team, we hope to see many of you in the coming months. If any additional questions arise in the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out to Heather, otherwise enjoy the rest of your day, and we look forward to speaking with you in January.

Harvey?","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks Dane and thanks to everyone for dialing in. As many of you are aware, Marty will be assuming my position in April. As you would expect, we\u2019re already working side by side to ensure a smooth transition in the coming months.","Over his career, Mary held positions of increasing responsibility in investment banking, institutional client services and then most recently as our Chief Information Officer. During that time, Marty established a track record of creating tremendous value for both our clients and our firm. Having worked closely with him for over a decade, I have full confidence that Marty will continue that track record as our Chief Financial Officer.","With that Marty would like to make a few comments.","Martin Chavez","Thanks Harvey. Just a few brief words from me. I have really enjoyed the opportunity to meet many of you in my prior role as CIO. I look forward to building upon existing relationships and building new ones in the months and years ahead. I have always found our conversations to be extremely insightful and valuable to effectively managing our firm. Goldman Sachs has a long tradition vigilantly focusing on risk management, operational excellence and maintaining a conservative financial profile. In my new role, I have every intention of continuing that focus and tradition.","With that I will turn it back to Harvey.","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks Marty. Okay, now let\u2019s walk through the fourth quarter and full year results then Marty and I are happy to answer any questions.","Briefly on the fourth quarter; net revenues were $8.2 billion, net earnings were $2.3 billion, earnings per diluted share were $5.08 and annualized return on common equity was 11.4%.","With respect to our annual results, we had firm-wide net revenues of $30.6 billion, net earnings of $7.4 billion, earnings per diluted share of $16.29 and a return on common equity of 9.4%. We grew book value per share by 6.7% year-over-year.","When reviewing 2016, it\u2019s helpful to contrast the performance between the first half of the year and the second half. The year began with a number of challenges but ultimately ended with a lot of positive momentum.","For example, the start of the year which has historically been a period of high activity, which instead impacted by significant concerns regarding the economic outlook, equity markets posted substantial declines and credit spreads wide and materially at the start of the year. This combination of factors translated into a difficult operating environment for our clients and by extension for our firm.","In the second quarter concerns regarding global economic growth moderated but other concerns including the potential implications of the Brexit vote surface. Ultimately, net revenues in the first half of the year declined by 28% year-over-year with a vast majority of that declining occurring in the first quarter.","Switching to the back half of the year, the global economic outlook improved reflecting solid economic reports particularly in the U.S. The prospect of diverging monitory policy and more pro-growth policies in the United States drove both activity levels and asset prices higher.","For example various fixed income market volumes in the second half of 2016 rose double digits year-over-year.","U.S. investment grade credit spreads tightened by nearly 40 basis points. U.S. high yield spreads tightened by over 150 basis points. And the MSCI World index climbs 6% during the period.","Ultimately this drove improved client sentiment and better environments. As a result, net revenues in the back half of the 2016 increased by nearly 16% year-over-year and included two consecutive quarter of 11 plus percent returns on equity.","In short, we ended the year with positive momentum and a significantly improved operating environment. With that as a back ground, let\u2019s discuss the individual business using greater detail.","As it relates to the quarter, investment banking produced net revenues $1.5 billion, 3% lower than the third quarter. A pick up in M&A was more than offset by a decline in underwriting. For the full year investment banking net revenues were $6.3 billion, down a 11% from 2015 and a decrease in equity underwriting and financial advisory revenues, which was partially by record debt underwriting revenues of $2.5 billion.","Our franchise remains very well positioned. We ended the year as a leader in global announced and completed M&A and as a leading equity and debt underwriter globally.","Breaking down the components of investment banking in the fourth quarter, advisory revenues were $709 million. The 8% improvement relative to the third quarter reflects an increase in a number of completed M&A transactions. We advise on a number of significant transactions that closed during the fourth quarter including Procter & Gamble, $12.5 billion merger with beauty business into Coty. Fortis Inc\u2019s $11.8 billion acquisition of ITC Holdings Corp. And Rackspace Hosting\u2019s $4.3 billion sales were of Apollo.","We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the fourth quarter including Qualcomm\u2019s $47 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors, B\/E Aerospace\u2019s $8.3 billion sales for Rockwell Collins and Capsugel\u2019s $5.5 billion sales for Lonza Group.","Moving to underwriting, net revenues were $777 million in the fourth quarter down 12% sequentially as debt and equity issuance slowed. Equity underwriting net revenues up $212 million were down 7% compared to the third quarter as follow-on offerings decreased.","Debt underwriting net revenues decreased 13% to $565 million from robust issuance levels in the third quarter. During the fourth quarter, we actively supported our clients' financing needs, participating in energies \u20ac4.6 billion IPO to Soros $1.6 billion high yield bond offering and it seems [indiscernible] $1.2 billion IPO. Our investment banking backlog improved from the third quarter, it was lower compared with very strong level at the end of 2015.","Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and equities businesses, net revenues were $3.6 billion in the fourth quarter down slightly compared to the third quarter. For the full year $14.5 billion of net revenues were down modestly compared to 2015.","FICC client execution net revenues were $2 billion in the fourth quarter, up slightly quarter-over-quarter as many businesses benefited from increased client activity. This more than offset typical year end seasonality.","Commodities increased significantly during the quarter as higher energy prices drove better market making conditions and more client activity. Currencies were higher compared to the third quarter increasing client activity. Rates were down slightly relative to the third quarter, client activity was solid driven by diverging monetary policies. Credit and mortgages decreased in an environment that included lesser issuance and generally tighter spreads.","For the full year, FICC client execution net revenues were $7.6 billion. This translated into a 6% increase year-over-year excluding DVA gains from 2015 results, given the difficult market conditions in the first quarter of 2016, 6% growth particularly notable. In equities, which include equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.6 billion down 11% sequentially. Equities client execution net revenues were $459 million, down significantly across both derivatives and cash products.","Commissions and fees were $736 million, up slightly relative to the third quarter as global client volumes increased modestly. Security services generated net revenues of $398 million, up modestly on a sequential basis","For the full year, equities produce net revenues of $6.9 billion down 12% year-over-year. In 2016, we were impacted by less favorable market conditions and lower client activity and equities client execution. This compared to a relatively robust performance in the first half of 2015.","Turning to risk, average daily VaR in the fourth quarter was $61 million up from $57 million in the third quarter.","Moving on to our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter. Equity security generated net revenues of $1 billion, reflecting corporate performance as well as sales and gains in public equity investments.","Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $457 million which was largely driven by net interest income of roughly $300 million. For the full year, investing and lending generated net revenues of $4.1 billion driven by $2.6 billion in gains from equity securities and $1.5 billion of net revenues from debt securities and loans. Our net interest income within debt securities was more than $1 billion for the year.","In investment management, we reported fourth quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion. This is up 8% from the third quarter primarily as a result of $224 million in incentive fees largely from alternative investment products. For 2016, investment management net revenues were $5.8 billion, down 7% year-over-year largely due to lower incentive fees. For the fourth quarter assets under supervision finished at a record $1.38 trillion.","The $32 billion increase versus the third quarter was driven by $17 billion of long term net inflows, $31 billion of net inflows into liquidity products, partially offset by $16 billion of market depreciation. On a full year basis, we had $42 billion of long term net inflows primarily driven by fixed income and $52 billion of liquidity product inflows.","Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits was down 8% for 2016 reflecting the decline in net revenues. This translated into compensation in net revenues ratio of 38.1%.","Fourth quarter non-competition expenses were $2.3 billion. The quarter included a $114 million donation to Goldman Sachs gives our donor advised charitable fund. For the full year non-compensation expenses were down significantly due to a decrease in provisions for litigation and regulatory matters. Excluding litigation provisions, non-competition expenses would have been down slightly year-over-year.","Now I'd like to take you through a few key statistics for the end of the year. Total staff was approximately 34,400, down slightly from the third quarter. Our effective tax rate for the year was 28.2%. Our global core liquid asset ended the fourth quarter at $226 billion and our balance sheet was $862 billion.","Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.5% using the standardized approach. It was 13.1% under the Basel III Advanced approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 6.4%. Our prudent approach to capital management is demonstrated by the strength of our capital ratios and had supported our return of excess capital to shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 7.6 million shares of common stock for $1.5 billion. For the full year, we repurchased $6.1 billion at an average purchase price of roughly $166 per share.","As a result, we reduced our basic share count by approximately 27 million shares for the year reaching a new record low. In addition, we paid out approximately $1.1 billion dollars of common dividends over the course of the year. In total, we returned $7.2 billion of capital to shareholders in 2016.","Before taking questions, a few closing thoughts. As we've said many times before, we have a healthy respect for the dynamic nature of our industry and we have an established track record of being responsive to changes in operating environment.","As we discussed, the first half of 2016 was challenging. In response, we undertook and completed a $700 million expense initiative in the first half of the year. We continued those efforts in the second half of the year and ultimately generated nearly $900 million of run rate savings. When undertaking any expense initiative all about finding the right balance, you want to protect near term results without impacting long term prospects.","We believe we found the right balance in 2016. This can be seen in our ability to effectively serve our clients as activity picked up in the second half of the year. It also reflected in our continued investment in technology and infrastructure including our launch of Marcus.","Most importantly our expense discipline and the strength of our client relationships leaves as well positioned to deliver significant operating leverage to our shareholders in a better operating environment.","In summary, we entered 2017 from a position of strength. We have a robust financial profile ending the year with $226 billion in liquidity more than a quarter of our balance sheet. All of our risk based capital ratios are well in excess of regulatory requirements well our share count sits at a record low. Importantly, this means we have the flexibility to navigate shifts in the operating environment including the positive scenario where we experienced a significant increase in client activity.","Finally, our global franchise remains as strong as ever reflecting our commitment and investment to serve our clients. Meeting their core objectives, we\u2019ll continue to be the basis for our long term success.","Thank you again for dialing in. Marty and I are happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Glenn Schorr","Hi thanks.","Harvey Schwartz","Hey good morning, Glenn.","Glenn Schorr","Good morning. So I have a fixed income related question. Back in the first quarter of 2015, the Swiss re-pegged and things went bonkers for a couple weeks and you guys made a ton more money but then things die down for like six quarters. This quarter, we obviously had the election and a couple other events and things went bonkers, but it feels very different to me and more permanent and client needs are changing and we have monetary policy diversion, so I'm leaving the witness here, but does it feel different to you guys and does that equate to this could be the first year in many that the fixed income fee pull could grow?","Harvey Schwartz","Yeah you know it's a great question. I mean the quarter you're reflecting on obviously the first quarter of 2015 very strong quarter for us, we had nearly a 15% ROE. That was the quarter as you point out, there were monetary policy announcements and I think there was a little bit of a relief activity there because that was viewed as increased monetary policy QE and that was a trend now.","As we all saw over a period of time that ultimately led more to concerns about lackluster growth and it led to concerns about deflation and then it led to concerns ultimately that actually QE policies at the limit may not be effective and may actually present risks. I would say you could look at our fourth quarter, but I think it\u2019d be better to look really at the second half of the year and what we saw from clients in the second half of the year was basically a build of confidence and expectation that we might see stronger fiscal policy, divergence of interest rates that we weren't heading into a deflationary cycle more confidence about economic growth, and so I would say there was increased optimism around the world.","Now those are the kind of things that always drive our business, our clients are very sensitive to that it changes sentiment. So I would say that that felt more like a trend across the past six months of the year.","Glenn Schorr","Okay, maybe some of yours ex-colleagues consensus more tweets and increased activity levels, kidding. Let last question on INL. I - we got - it's good to have that reprieve in terms of the INL funded divestments. I'm curious if it changes at all how you approach the way we asked you every quarter about what's left in equity, what do you need to divest, and that whole game plan I\u2019m curious on your thoughts there.","Harvey Schwartz","No, so I\u2019m happy to walk you through it. So I mean in order flow I walk you through every quarter, longer cover fund $106.7 billion you take out an amount that confirms that's $200 million that leaves you with $6.5 billion. Of the $6.5 billion, $1.8 billion of that is inner fund but those entities are already public, they're trading publicly on exchanges. So they are already liquid, they are just in a process of being sold down. So now with respect to Volcker as was more that's expected by the marketplace because you remember under the original construct of Volcker, it was never designed to force sales, it was obviously very encouraging of compliance. So there was an expectation everyone would do what they could save to comply. But again there was no there's no desire for fire sales and so the expectation here is that we've now submitted for the extensions, we'll go through the extension process, but we've been a good say that during if you read their communication, you expect extensions to be approved broadly across the industry.","For us, it hasn't changed the approach of the business. It's always been about ensuring that we provide the best returns for our clients because as you know, we're invested alongside our clients in these funds. Apply more than you wanted, but I just try to cover the whole thing.","Glenn Schorr","I appreciated, thank you. Go ahead we can go on to the next person. Thanks.","Harvey Schwartz","All right, thanks Glenn.","Operator","The next question is from line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Christian Bolu","Good morning, Harvey. And then welcome on board Marty. So hate to nit-pick in a strong quarter, but performance in equities was noticeably weaker than peers. I\u2019m curious if there were any onetime items in the quarter or anything that you think drove underperformance, and then maybe more broadly if you could update us on how you're feeling about the competitive position in that business.","Harvey Schwartz","So look I think you're right to point out it wasn't our strongest quarter. I mean in terms of the franchise, we feel great about the franchise at this stage and certainly we feel quite good about the competitive dynamic. No matter how you look at the business, whether you look at it as our global footprint, prime services, our ability to make capital our position underwriting, we feel incredibly good about it. Quarter-to-quarter there were always going to be one offs, there are a handful of things that we\u2019re less than probably this quarter, but I wouldn't read anything into it.","Christian Bolu","Okay. And then as soon as your last one, I'll give you a pretty one accounting question here, but the accounting standards for the tax impact of shared based compensation, I believe this schedule to change this year. I'm giving share based comp is a meaningful part of the income statement curious if that has any impact on your kind of forward the way your incomes may looks going forward?","Harvey Schwartz","Yeah, so it's a very detailed question. It's great that you're asking it actually. So as everyone not might not be as aware as you are Christian but under a gap change, basically the change requires us to recognize the tax impact of the difference and the value of shares that we grant which a grant date versus delivery date and our tax expense line on the income statements. Now prior to the change that would happen and shows equity.","So there is two observations here, so at best we can estimate it today, it could be in a range of $400 million, $500 million in terms of a reduction in the tax rates, but this is just a geographic realignment under gap, this has no impact to capital where the strength of our capital, but you will see a shift in the recognition. And obviously anyone can feel free to follow up more with Dane if you really want to get into the details of the gap stuff.","Christian Bolu","Okay, it's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Harvey Schwartz","Mike, you there? Michael, you there?","Operator","Michael, check your line to see if you\u2019re on mute. One moment. Michael, are you there?","Michael Carrier","Yeah, can you hear me?","Harvey Schwartz","Yeah, we can hear you now Michael, but we couldn\u2019t hear you before, so the asked question we didn\u2019t get it.","Michael Carrier","Okay, no problem. Thanks a lot. First one just on expenses, so you guys have been doing a very good job on controlling the expenses and we saw the operating leverage in the quarter. Just wanted to get a sense depending on what potential changes happened with policy and regulation, is there some way to give us some context on the amount that has been spent whether it's on regulation, compliance, technology it maybe since 2011, 2012 that could either shift around depending on the outlook, obviously there\u2019s a lot of core and that\u2019s going to stay in place, but just wanted to get a sense on what that increase has been despite you guys imaging the overall expense base well?","Harvey Schwartz","Yeah. Difficult to quantify that for you obviously it's been a huge investment in terms of risk, technology, compliance and we continue invest. I think the thing that we've been able to do is as we've invested and as we\u2019ve comply with the rules, we never be use technology and training across the teams to be as efficient as possible which is why this year you would have seen that non-compensation expense was the lowest expense since 2007 and we were able to also execute the $900 million run rate savings, but who knows where we\u2019ll end up in terms of the rule set, but obviously we\u2019ll always look to comply and comply in the most efficient way possible over time.","Michael Carrier","Okay, and then just as a follow-up. It's been a while since we've been in an environment or people may more positive on like the growth outlook, and just wanted to get a sense and this is somewhat Glenn's question and you answer it, but maybe broader on trading and banking. What do you guys look at in terms of seeing that pick up in client engagement, I know you mentioned the IB pipeline is up quarter-over-quarter but even on trading in terms of balances, investment management maybe inflows, just wanted to get some sense on how we can kind of see the follow through or the impact of better economy in that translating into in a stronger revenues?","Harvey Schwartz","Yeah, that\u2019s a great question. Look the thing that informs us the most is the work that all of our people do whether they are in banking, asset management, whether they are in equities or fixed income all around the globe engage with their clients every day. So these are relationship that build up over decades, they are invested in over decades, you know our teams of sitting with CEOs, they are sitting in board rooms. And the best way for us to get a pause on that globally is the feedback we get from clients every day.","And as you know over the past several years there\u2019s been a general sense of concern with respect to global growth that was reinforced by a lot of the monitory policy around the world. And so I would say as we come into 2017, activity levels are quite high. You know we can\u2019t - we\u2019ve come out of a very low volume, low volatility environment for a number of years. We\u2019re happy to see how this year progresses. But with the shipping policies around the globe, it\u2019s an extraordinary catalyst for client dialog, for decision making and for content and that\u2019s really where as a firm that\u2019s where we really want to drive value and drive value with content.","Michael Carrier","Okay, thanks a lot.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O'Connor","Good morning. Just give us some of the increased optimism that you\u2019ve talked about on this call and the pipelines, just kind of big picture, how do you think differently about staffs, call it how much you lean forward versus trying to optimize, it\u2019s like a last several years you and the industry have been focused on optimizing to kind of lower pool of revenues got for regulatory environment. And just how do you think about you know it\u2019s not going to be a complete 180 going to maybe been aggressive, but how do you think maybe about leaning forward a little bit more, whereas the too loaded think that way?","Harvey Schwartz","Yeah. So look, this is all - this is all just about balance. So we are in a cyclical business within a pro-cyclical industry. And so as we make decisions about investing and controlling expenses, you know these things are mutually exclusive. So if you just look at the past year, obviously we responded very quickly to the tough first quarter. As I mentioned we finished with $900 million of run rate savings completed in the year. But at the same time, we never stop hiring. We launched Marcus. We acquired the digital lending platform. And so we stayed very front footed and we feel well positioned.","Now to the extent to which there were more demands on the firm by creating efficiencies to this part of the cycle, it gives us the flexibility to invest in an improved part of the cycle. That\u2019s the best thing about having capital ratios as strong as our capital ratios are right now are having liquidity levels where they are because to extent to which there is demand, we can respond to it. So you can be well positioned and you can be efficient at the same time.","Matt O'Connor","Okay, thank you very much.","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks Matt.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Mike Mayo","Hi.","Harvey Schwartz","Hey, good morning, Mike.","Mike Mayo","This is the first change since the announcement about Gary Cohn, so you know Harvey, how do you kind of approach your new position and then for Marty, how does your past experience you know help you or maybe present a challenge for you in the CFO role going from CIO to CFO is somewhat unique?","Harvey Schwartz","Right so - well obviously we\u2019re all going to miss Gary. It\u2019s fantastic that he is willing to contribute all of his experience to a country and it\u2019s a long tradition of senior leaders that Goldman Sachs doing that. So we\u2019re - again we\u2019re all going to miss Gary but we\u2019re all quite proud on what he is decided to do.","In terms of the transition in my role, I\u2019ve obviously been CFO for a bit over four years. You David Solomon and I, we\u2019ve been on management for years. We found the same floor for years and you know which have affinities based on our experience. David spent more time in investment banking. I\u2019ve spent more time in institutional client services. But I think it lays out pretty easily actually in terms of how he and I will work across the firm. It\u2019s big place with lots of clients. So we\u2019re both pretty excited about it. And that transition is already underway.","In terms of the transition with Marty, we\u2019ve already been working side by side. Marty has been shadowing me for a couple of weeks and then he is working on his transition. For those you met Marty, I don\u2019t know he about 150 pounds less than I am. So following my shadows sounds like a strange thing. But that\u2019s how we are approaching. And we got - and look we have a deep bench Mike, so we\u2019ve done these things across the firm for years.","Mike Mayo","And can we hare - I mean Mary you are ready to talk?","Martin Chavez","Sure Mike. I\u2019ll just add, going to continue to firm\u2019s traditions and risk management and maintaining funding profile fortune to inherent such a talented team. And in keeping with the times and industry, applied maths and software to these problems or risk management but continue to do, we\u2019ve always done.","Mike Mayo","And just one last follow-up for you Marty, so coming from CIO, is that what it\u2019s about applying maths and software and how else can you apply your part experience to the new role?","Martin Chavez","Well, there is maths and software and everything that we do and so that\u2019s just a perspective - particular prospectively but really it\u2019s risk management. And that\u2019s what I\u2019ll keep doing as I\u2019ve always done, been let the firm for a long time, worked in many of our businesses always with an emphasis on risk.","Mike Mayo","Alright, thank you.","Martin Chavez","Thanks Mike.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good morning.","Harvey Schwartz","Hey, good morning, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","I wanted to ask a little bit about for productivity inset, we\u2019ve had conversations in the past where when we are in a world or at least what we\u2019ve discussed is in a rising rate with an established trend you know upside rate environment. In the past you\u2019ve had improving our productivity and I am wondering how you think about that, at this stage do you feel like you\u2019ve captured what you think you would capture overtime you know step function 4Q versus 3Q or is there more to go here?","Harvey Schwartz","Well I think it\u2019s difficult to me forecast. I would say the following I think if rates continue to rise and it\u2019s a reflection of optimism and concerns around deflation abate and concerns around economic decline debate and they are replaced with expectations of economic growth and activity and confidence and client sentiment continues to shift. I think there is meaningful upside in terms of the activity levels we could see in fixed income. So we\u2019ve been pretty optimistic now. We\u2019re positioned for a number of scenarios obviously given all the steps we\u2019ve taken over the years. And whether it\u2019s risk or capital, obviously we have a lot of capacity.","Betsy Graseck","And then secondly on INL, in the equity\u2019s line even I saw 2Q, 1Q obviously the market overall was up a little bit, certain factors up significantly and I had thought that your focus in many of the activities you have is a bit more of an industrial versus a services angle. So I am wondering if there is some - could you give us some color as to on the INL equity side how much of that was realized versus just a mark and what you still have left in the bag for realizations going forward.","Harvey Schwartz","Yeah, so one thing I really want to point out because I know this question comes up about realizing and better you ask it but everybody asked it realize versus mark. The most important thing is the portfolio was always mark-to-market. So I think what you mean by realize is monetization activity. Obviously in the past year, monetization activity wouldn\u2019t have been as high necessarily as in prior years. We don\u2019t talk to it that way as much.","You know the INO balance sheet, you didn\u2019t ask it but the INO balance sheet is roughly $98 billion and nearly 80% of it is lending related activity. And so it\u2019s $21 billion what we call equity. But it\u2019s idiosyncratic and what you generally see over a period of time is a portfolio has outperformed markets because of the quality of the investment professionals and asset selections. But I wouldn\u2019t say necessarily that it\u2019s one category or another. I think you are right to say that obviously industrials are representative but it\u2019s very idiosyncratic and a year like this where equity issuance is down. You wouldn\u2019t expect to see lots of monetization.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And then last on fees and asset management you know across the industry been some chatter on see pressure seeing some industry leaders cut season more of the passive oriented products but maybe you could just give us a senses to how you are thinking about that business and managing it for the several years?","Harvey Schwartz","So I think as a management for us among other things also a bright spot. As you saw assets under supervision finish at a record was up 10% for the year. I think we benefit from a number of things, I think we benefit from a fact we have a very unique well franchise. Obviously it was a mix of strong flows underneath that 10% rise. And this reflects a couple of things, obviously the performance we\u2019ve delivered to the clients but I do think it\u2019s the nature of the capabilities that have built over a number of years.","So I think so far if you look at as in terms of asset flows, we\u2019re a bit of an outlier. We benefit from scale to your point of fees because we\u2019re certainly not immune to the general shipped in lower fees across the industry whether it\u2019s conventional pure competitor or competitive that\u2019s only dedicated to the asset management space, we are immune to that, but we benefit from having scale in our operation have been near $1.4 trillion on assets.","Betsy Graseck","Great, now I am wondering on the fee rate side is here a bit of uniqueness you have in the high network client relationship versus institutional \u2026?","Harvey Schwartz","No, I think we have strengthened both client segments but our fees are obviously competitive with the rest of the world.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, I appreciate it. Thanks.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning, Harvey; Marty, welcome to the party.","Martin Chavez","Good morning.","Brennan Hawken","So quick question, I know it\u2019s been touched on a couple of times, but it\u2019s one that\u2019s definitely I think front of investor\u2019s minds here, so hopefully you don\u2019t mind me touch it on it again. And you spoke a little bit of it Harvey with shifting policies globally, we need a better dialog which certainly is positive. But when we think about is especially in the U.S. seen down administration and the themes of the potential for reduced regulation and taxes seems like it could have both a first and second derivative impact on Goldman and so not only the direct impact of you but the clients and clients feeling better and improvement risk apatite. So how do you think about that opportunity assuming that plays out, is there a particular way in which investors should think about that opportunity and is there any historical context or other periods that you think are particularly relevant or helpful and trying to consider that?","Harvey Schwartz","Well I guess I\u2019d say a few things. I think when you say indirect and direct you mean direct obviously we\u2019ve been relatively high tax payer and so tax rates come down. We\u2019re a beneficiary but obviously changes in tax policy can be a huge catalyst for how all of our clients think about deploying their capital strategic decisions and so that\u2019s board room dialog which obviously we\u2019re always front and center to. So I think that\u2019s what you meant by direct and indirect. So I would agree with that.","I think it\u2019s very difficult to quantify just like it was difficult to quantify in 2012, 2013, 2014 how concerns around deflation and low economic growth will impact activity in a number of businesses. I think it\u2019s very difficult to quantify how increased optimism. You know we like to say in some respects, confidence is the best stimulus. And the extent to which we enter a period of increased confidence with respect to economic growth, physical policy, you mentioned tax policy, I think there could be a lot that happens. Now we\u2019ll have to see all these policies of ours. But who knows we could be at the beginning of a long term trend, we may not be. Again it was difficult to predict things in 2012 and how they will be in 2013, 2014 and 2015.","Brennan Hawken","Yeah, now that\u2019s fair Harvey and yeah that was exactly what I was pointing on not only direct impact on you but the clients and the optimism. So okay, that\u2019s helpful. You\u2019ve touched also on the operating leverage, so maybe I want to hit on that a bit. It seems like up taking comp ratio in \u201816 was probably more of a revenue story, so want to confirm that\u2019s true and then when we think about maybe the other side of that blade or the other blade of that knife if we start to see revenue environment improve, how should we think about operating leverage at Goldman given all of the work that you\u2019ve done on the expense front which you\u2019ve talked about a couple of times?","Harvey Schwartz","Well, I appreciate you are recognizing the work. Obviously over the last several years, whether it\u2019s around expenses, de-risking the firm and growing the capital ratios, returning the capital all that work has really been about positioning the firm, while at the same time obviously maintaining all of our connectivity to clients with really, really significant operating leverage. Now this year revenue is down 9%, compensation expense down 8%, obviously that translate into a small uptick in a compensation ratio. But I would say at this stage, the center which we see hail wins in activity and increases in revenue will see that translating even more so now than we would have before to the bottom line in terms of operating leverage.","And so I can\u2019t quantify for you but if we see a big uptick in revenues, certainly you should see a decline in the compensation of ratio at which of course again as an output we\u2019re committed to delivery in this result.","Brennan Hawken","Terrific, thanks a lot.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Guy Moszkowski","Thanks.","Martin Chavez","Good morning.","Guy Moszkowski","First question is - yeah, good morning and Marty nice to meet you.","Martin Chavez","Thank you.","Guy Moszkowski","Question on equities related to follow-up one of the earlier questions that was asked, you talked about maybe there were some things that weren\u2019t quite so perfect. I was wondering if you could characterize that a little bit further were there some episodic block losses that were significant in the quarter, anything that as we think about sort of what\u2019s achievable going forward.","Harvey Schwartz","There were a handful of transactions that\u2019s it\u2019s always going to be the case in a marking making business when you are providing liquidity to clients that could have an impact that was the case this quarter. Some other things that are normal quarterly contributors and index rebalancing were more neutral and there were impact. Again I wouldn\u2019t read a lot into it from quarter to quarter.","Remember we break out equity client execution from the whole business, so that\u2019s a different level of disclosure then you are going to get from anybody else. So you should expect given at that\u2019s the line where we are most interacting with clients and capital commitments, you should expect that to be more volatile. I just don\u2019t think any of our other competitors whenever break that, so you don\u2019t see it.","Guy Moszkowski","No, that\u2019s fair.","Harvey Schwartz","But that\u2019s not - it wasn\u2019t the greatest quarter but there is nothing in there.","Guy Moszkowski","Okay. And I noticed that when you are doing a full year comparison there you talked about Asia for the full year but not for the fourth quarter, so it was - it was either more of a domestic issue in the fourth quarter or just more broadly global?","Harvey Schwartz","Remembering the first half of 2015, there was a huge uptick in activity in Asia and then basically there wasn\u2019t replicated. You know the client connectivity remained robust in Asia as ever but this year just not as active as it was last year.","Guy Moszkowski","Got it, and then a much broader question, I know you don\u2019t like to set ROE targets but I was wondering if in the context of what you might call for example unshackled interest rate sort of in a post QE environment and more broadly some other things that we talked about in terms of the new administrations goals and expectations thereof, can you speak to a realistic but aspiration ROE?","Harvey Schwartz","Well, again we don\u2019t say targets because that\u2019s not the way we run the business. We run the business through thoughtful and efficient deployment of capital managing expenses and making sure we have the best people and we\u2019re focused on our clients. I guess you saw some of this in the second half of the year right, we had two plus quarters back to back of 11% plus ROEs and that wasn\u2019t on a huge uptick in activity. And again it\u2019s one date point but it\u2019s one all point two you know in the first quarter 2015, we had a 14.7% ROE, again that feels like a long time ago. We\u2019re actually more efficient now with more operating leverage now than we had then. What we feel as front footed in terms of our franchises we ever have, so we feel well positioned which is that we see the activity.","Guy Moszkowski","And just final follow-up on that point about the activity levels and I know we\u2019ve had all of ten trading days as we get started here, so with all the necessary caveats, how are those activity levels starting the year?","Harvey Schwartz","Way it\u2019s too early to count Guy.","Guy Moszkowski","Yeah, fair enough. Okay, thanks so much. Thanks for taking my questions.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you, have a great day.","Guy Moszkowski","You too.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Jim Mitchell","Hey, good morning. Maybe just talk about the revenue side of regulatory change, I know it's not an easy question to answer, but I think there's been a lot of I guess hope and talk about sort of an easing of regulation what that could mean on the revenue side. So I don't know if there's a way to just sort of talk about it generally in terms of where do you see the most constraints right now and what would potentially benefit you the most whether it's easing of market making rules, whether it's some changes like we saw in the UK around exempting cash from the leverage ratio, if you could help that would be great?","Harvey Schwartz","Yeah, I wouldn't point to any one rule. I think what we've seen and one of the things I think gets lost in the global dialog around regulation is that you know eight years past the crisis, the body of work that's been created by the regulators whether it's Basel capital ratios, the implementation of CCAR, stress testing broadly globally, the leverage ratios, the requirements around liquidity, all those things that were designed to address points to systemic risk, clearing, margin requirements, all of that data reporting, I think sometimes gets lost in the narrative and have to step back and look at the past eight years and realize that and it\u2019s a credible body of work that regulators, the industry participants and the clients have actually created.","I think long - I think the dialog around regulation and whether or not there should be some degree of pause and stepping back, I think that started really at the beginning of last year maybe a little bit before you saw some of that in the Basel Committee across the second half of the year, and obviously I think market participants regulators and also it seems like a very reasonable point in time to step back and assess we obviously have gotten some great benefits out of the regulation and the question is, is there a cost in economic growth. So this seems like a pretty normal part of the process in terms of taking a step back and evaluating it.","Now specific rules I don\u2019t know we'll see what happens, it will change, we\u2019ll adapt however they change, I think we demonstrate our ability to do that.","Jim Mitchell","But you can't, you don't feel there's one that's been more constraining than some others in terms of business?","Harvey Schwartz","No, I mean if you actually look at our - if you actually look at our capital ratios they're strong across the board, liquidity is 25% of the balance sheet, and so there's not one thing that we would look at it. I think the bigger question for all of us is it's very difficult to measure the combined impact and the interaction of all these rules, and that's why it makes sense to take a step back.","Jim Mitchell","Now that's all fair. And maybe just a quick one on banking, I think there's been chatter that while I think quote Animal Spirits are better and that's good for the outlook for banking I think there's some concern at least in the near to intermediate term with policy uncertainty that might hold things back a little bit in the shorter term. Are you seeing that it seems like M&A activities continue to be pretty solid, but not sure what you're seeing in terms of activity levels around uncertainty short term policy uncertainty?","Harvey Schwartz","Dialog with - dialog in boardrooms remains quite high for us. I think it's fair to say that anytime you have a shift in administration which may present new policies that can have an impact on timing of transactions, because that could be a component. But it's really - it's a timing issue, dialog remains very high.","Jim Mitchell","But you do see timing being pushed out, what you're seeing or?","Harvey Schwartz","I think it could be a little bit, when you start having discussions around tax policy, tax policy obviously will have an implication for how people think about strategic transactions. But again it's an economic important to strategic transaction. It's not the strategy itself as discussed in the boardroom. And so but it could delay some transactions. Remember the transactions coming through from the pipeline before that will be closing. So again I think we're just talking about a timing issue, I actually think the environment is pretty robust in terms of dialog.","Jim Mitchell","Okay that's great. Thanks a lot.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Chris Kotowski","Yeah, good morning.","Harvey Schwartz","Hi Chris.","Chris Kotowski","Hi, on these calls Harvey, you always talk about FICC trading activity in terms of volumes you know like commodities and currencies were up and credit mortgage down and so on. But whenever I speak with fixed income investors they always kind of be mown the lack of available liquidity in the markets, they complain that it's very hard to get anything done. And I'm wondering with between the kind of increased activity that you talked about and retrenchment of some of the competitors have bid ask spreads moved are they widening or is that not yet been part of the equation and do you ever expect that to be part of the equation?","Harvey Schwartz","Yeah, that's a good question. I think, I think it's - I think you have to parse it a bit, to be just you mentioned commodities well pick up on commodities. If commodity prices are going to be quite stable or just take energy and they're stable at a level for a period of time that is not necessarily a catalyst for big client segments for us producers of commodities, consumers of commodities, in the institutional investors that invest in energy that's honestly catalyst for decision making.","Because they may have very determined levels at which for example a producer wants to hedge future oil production or project that they want to bring online. And so when you then see a big move in oil prices one way or another that's a catalyst for activity for our various client constituents. In terms of liquidity, I think it's fair to say that feedback from clients and it\u2019s not reason it's happened over the last several years across the industry. Is they feel like their ability to execute isn't what it was prior let's say to 2008 as a period it was perceived to have almost limitless liquidity.","I think this activity picks up and volume begins volume you get improvements in liquidity, but every day we come in the door and we're offering our balance sheet, our clients in the best possible way that we can.","Chris Kotowski","Okay and then I guess maybe as a follow up to that, I mean to the extent I guess I'd say consensus expectations build in two or three rate hikes a year, at what point does that become you know the kind of catalyst that you talked about in relation to commodities for activity?","Harvey Schwartz","I can't predict it for you, again in the fourth quarter alone obviously but if you just - if you just look at fourth quarter of a fourth quarter, and I won't talk about necessarily obviously activity was high and it translate into an up 78% year-over-year for us in fixed income, but the catalyst of activity are pretty obvious, right you have the oil policy, interest rate shifts, movement in currencies, all those things are catalysts for activity. I think again it goes back to the broad question what's the driver of that activity, if the expectation is more progress moving away from deflation not inflationary, but not deflationary more inflationary in a normalized period of interest rates. Those were all positive catalysts what they'll be like quarter-to-quarter very difficult, but again coming out of eight years of declining interest rates, I think would - none of us really wanted to get used to that. And so I think getting into a period of normalized economic growth would normalize policy of normalized interest rates, I think that be a good catalyst over the forward for a number of years. Quarter-to-quarter that who knows.","Chris Kotowski","All right. Thank you. That's it from me.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Harvey Schwartz","Hey Steven.","Steven Chubak","Good morning, hey Harvey, hey Marty. So I have follow up just to Jim's earlier question, specifically on tax policy and a comments Harvey that you made on M&A, you said that you view the changes really as more of a timing issue, but one of the constraints that we've been hearing from a lot of folks, is that efforts to broaden the tax base might in fact include restrictions on interest expense deductibility and could increase financing costs and reduce appetite for future debt.","And what I'm wondering is if interest expense deductibility is in fact eliminated we do see reduced appetite from debt from corporates, as I inform your outlook not just from the M&A side, but even for DCM and it might even touch on corporate private equity as well?","Harvey Schwartz","Well, but always puts and takes obviously that would be a very significant change in policies so would have implications for the way issuers would think, investors would think capacity, I think there's a lot of what's in the details around that. But I think it's too early to tell in terms of what the necessary predictions would be.","Steven Chubak","Understood and maybe just sticking to changes in the GOP regime and the implications I could have, but focusing more on the regulatory side there's been a lot of discussion on the prospects of possible repeal or less strict enforcement of Volcker, and Harvey I know you touched on some of the change in terms of just broader messaging, but it just remains to be seen how that might impact your business, I know it's a little bit early, but I just want to get a sense as to if we do see an explicit repeal of Volcker how that would change your strategy, not just on the trading side, but would it in fact how you deploy capital within INL as well?","Harvey Schwartz","Yeah, so it\u2019s a good question. Look as we said before, we don't make any decisions before we see a rule or rule change there be no difference here. I think most of the discussion around will go over the last several years by regulators and industry participants and clients going back to the earlier question is what impact has it had on market making capabilities across the industry, which is obviously the most important part of our business we're providing liquidity to our clients.","I think in terms of the sort of the micro components of Volcker. We would take a look at it, if it changed in terms of our activities, proprietary trading we haven't been in that business in a long time, it was never a material driver and so we would look at it and whatever in the best interest of our clients and our shareholders that's how we evaluate it just like we devaluate any rule change.","Steven Chubak","Thank you very much.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Matt Burnell","Good morning, Harvey, good morning Marty. First a specific question then maybe a larger picture question. Harvey could you give us the updated common equity to one ratios for the fully phased in side of things, and just curious what the driver of the reduction in RWA this quarter was it was down about 5% quarter-over-quarter?","Harvey Schwartz","So I'll just run through you, I\u2019ll just run through them both transitional and fully phase just the level side even though I went through them before. So under advanced 13\/1 transitional 12\/7 fully phased standardized again 14.5 I know I said that before fully phase 14. On the RWAs in advance 550 standardized 497 there were a number of drivers again we continue to focus on being efficient with our capital and sort of risk reduction across the number of items, operational risk in advanced was down from 126 to 115 and not just - that just reflects our continued focus on as best we can I mean zero operational risk events. Obviously that's our goal, and so we're starting to see an operational risk as you're starting to see the benefit of our focus flow through as older items roll off albeit as you know that that's a very slow process.","Matt Burnell","And then for my bigger picture question one of your competitors suggested that there was on a year-over-year basis, but a mid teens decline in European revenues, I guess I'm curious, first of all if you saw that in 2016 versus 2015 in terms of the regional breakout and it with the Prime Minister May\u2019s comments earlier this week any update to your outlook in terms of what Brexit might or might not do to quiet activity more broadly across your European client base?","Harvey Schwartz","Yeah. So look I have no visibility into anyone else's franchise, the breakdown in terms of our geographic contribution revenues wasn't materially different year-over-year certainly difference in - no meaningful difference in our European franchise. In terms of Brexit as we go through Brexit we just continue evaluated the same way, it is obviously going to be a long process, so in all kind of contingency planners play a very nature so we'll run through different alternatives.","I thought some of the comments with respect to trying to ensure it's not disruptive, there's a long enough runway, all those things I thought some of those comments, but it is going to evolving situation. And so but I wanted to say the sensitivity to financials and understand a criticality of the industry across Europe. But of all those things we\u2019re pretty positive but again we're going to see how this evolves over the next couple years.","Matt Burnell","Okay, fair enough. And then just finally if I can you booked your first loan in Marcus when we spoke last October, just wondering what the growth in that portfolio has been since them.","Harvey Schwartz","Yeah we've booked more loans. I'm not counting and wanted time any more though that would have to be aware coincidence with the last call. It's going according to plan. Not in by that I mean our plan have been very deliberate growing it slowly our primary focus here is on the client experience we believe we've built I mean that differentiated for the consumer. And so we're being very attentive to that making sure we incorporate any feedback we get. And obviously risk management something we've done for a long time. So that's a big component of this, but as we've said many times to be a slow process.","Matt Burnell","Sure, thank you very much.","Harvey Schwartz","You're welcome. Take care now.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks very much.","Harvey Schwartz","Hey Eric.","Eric Wasserstrom","Hi how are you? Just to follow up on a couple of questions that have been raised before, but may be taking a little more of a broader view of the balance sheet. I mean your RWAs are now it had fairly low levels now as far back maybe as my model might run. And in INL obviously the balance sheet there continues to decline although you're growing markets a bit. So overall kind of what is your - what should be our expectations about GAAP and RWA growth for 2017 and in particular is there anything that's occurring environmentally that causes you to sort of view that outlook differently than let's say three or six months ago?","Harvey Schwartz","That's a great question. So you know I think I could be wrong on this by the way. So Dan will correct me, but I think it was - I think it was 2012 we were at investor conference and we did our first review of some of the capital tools we have built. And so I guess the best way I would sum it up in terms of how we thought about the risk reduction of the capital of that it goes all the way back to 2012 those tools of course took years to developing themselves. We were just displaying them in 2012 and it's really been about evolving the firm to understand that we need to ensure we use our capital in the most thoughtful way to deliver to our clients.","And as I mentioned before over that period of time we've been able to grow market shares, deliver, I think last for the industry ROEs over a multi-year period of time and at the same time we sit here today with record low share count. So the short answer after that big summary because there are so many people involved across the firm in the divisions with the clients and in the federation it's just been years of hard, hard work and a lot of elbow grease to get us where we are now.","The good thing about that is it gives us a lots of capacity, and it goes back to when we talk about operating leverage sure it's about expenses it's about capital, but it's positioning the firm in a way that we can respond to an uptick. And so I don't know if you asking the question could we grow risk weighted assets I\u2019ll tell you it would be - it's not the scenario I've experienced as CFO.","But I would wish it for Marty over the years ahead that if he had the chance to deploy capital back to our clients not to return as much to shareholders grow risk weighted assets that actually with the firm has done for the vast majority of the firms history and those are the environments that you know we thrive in and so it was Marty and I'd pass the baton over the next couple of months, I'm hoping he gets to deploy the capital in that way with all of us across the firm. So that's my long winded answer.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks that's very helpful. Thank you very much.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.","Devin Ryan","Thanks, good morning, Harvey, Marty.","Harvey Schwartz","Good morning Devin.","Martin Chavez","Good morning.","Devin Ryan","Maybe timely with Marty in his new role year, but technology headcounts now about a third of the firm has been the fastest growing area in recent years and arguably the most amount of kind of the newer initiatives have come in this area. So I'm going to put the cart before the horse here, but if we are moving towards more of this business friendly backdrop where regulation softening a bit, can you see a scenario where that trend actually changes in investment high touch personnel is where the incremental growth comes from or is it just technology growth is the secular trend diverse is there being some maybe cyclical component there as well.","Harvey Schwartz","Well maybe I'll kick off and then I'll turn over to Marty and he can talk more specifically about technology, but I wouldn't say there's been a lack of investment in, I think the way you described it some of the other growth areas, right. So we've continue to invest and all parts of the firm, asset management, the new business as we've talked about launching, the acquisition of on line platform. So there's been a lack of investment in areas of the firm for years where we've seen more of a multiyear decline obviously they\u2019ve been super careful as they run those businesses. But I wouldn\u2019t describe it as we\u2019ve invested in technology, we haven\u2019t invested anywhere else. I know you weren\u2019t being that literal about it, but I just want to make sure we are clear for the call.","But in terms of technology, specifically I\u2019ll turn it over to Marty.","Martin Chavez","Yeah, so as Harvey says, we invest in both in high touched and low touched and really agnostic where evolving in the direction that our clients that are taking us. So as for technology has clients have continued to transact more electronically we\u2019ve invested more heavily in those capabilities, so that we can better serve them. We have a history of that kind of adaptation. We work with the regulators to make sure that those automated capabilities are the best-in-class and to the extent that the markets continue to be more electronic, technology make our people more effective and it strengthens our clients\u2019 engagement.","Devin Ryan","Okay, great understood and appreciate all the color and absolutely you know understand the investments been across the firm, just curious on that incremental technology spend, but thank you. And then within DCM just coming back to some other questions you know had a really terrific year there obviously if the M&A backdrop improves from here that it could be supportive, on the other hand you know higher interest rates you see like my constrain some issuance, I know there is a lot of puts and takes. I am just curious kind of after such a good year, how do you feel about the intermediate term kind of outlook they you think that we can grow from here or kind of as you think about all the moving parts that this is the tough bar?","Harvey Schwartz","I\u2019d say a couple of things first, obviously as you point out record year in the underwriting, the team done an amazing job, really working with clients and delivering for clients. So quite proud of that. You know the debt component of the backlog continues to growth, that\u2019s a necessarily forecast this year but the level of client engagement is quite high. I think there is always a temptation for all of us. I certainly do it to think of past cycles when interest rates went up in terms of the implications for markets and the market dynamic. This is such an extraordinary scenario that we\u2019re coming off of basically a zero rate policy.","So I think if you look at history, the rate levels is still pretty low even though the tenner might have moved up a 100 basis points of one point. So I think if you split your questions and say well could you end up with less refinancing, I think that\u2019s certainly a case, but we\u2019re still in a very low rate environment by historical standards and so the extent to which we see growth, company see top line growth. There are CapEx activities and they are feeling confident, they want to finance. I think you could see a pretty good period for debt underwriting over the foreseeable future. But if you saw big rate moves disproportionate charts for someone expected reason, obviously that could have an impact too. I don\u2019t think it more up in rates and in itself, it should necessarily be considered a negative in an absolute sense.","Devin Ryan","Great, very helpful, thanks guys.","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks.","Operator","You next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Yeah, thanks, good morning. Just two quick questions, one in the investment management, with regards to the flows in liquidity products, I mean you\u2019ve seen those kind of flows pickup in the fourth quarter of last two years, is this just where you saw this quarter again a seasonal effect with regards to liquidity products?","Harvey Schwartz","No, I think that has been a trend has been in place, we had a very big commitment to this business. We\u2019re a scale provider in this business makes us very efficient in terms of an aggregator of those kind of flows. And so I don\u2019t know necessarily there is always some seasonality in these businesses but I wouldn\u2019t - this is a long term commitment of this business, I wouldn\u2019t say that is necessarily seasonality in of itself it\u2019s driving it.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. And then just one quick one to on the European equity franchise, have you seen any impacts yet from if it due and kind of what\u2019s your thoughts on long term impacts from if it due as it becomes adopted?","Harvey Schwartz","Lot of focus on it, too early to tell.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay, great, thanks.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Christopher Wheeler with Atlantic Equities. Please go ahead.","Christopher Wheeler","Yes, good morning, gentlemen. Harvey, you\u2019ve been talking a lot about capital efficiency and obviously you\u2019ve been very effective in that area. Can I just ask you a question about the way forward here, because you\u2019ve been obviously very aggressive in buying back stock and keeping the capital sort of very sensible levels, but of course you\u2019ve enjoyed or you could say haven\u2019t enjoyed having stock which is trading at or below book value or tangible book value for the last few years, you\u2019ve not got a situation very happily where you offered about 1.4 times tangible book. I am just wondering I know that you want to keep the dividend at a manageable basis in terms of your payout ratio so that you don\u2019t see in swinging around volatile in a volatile fashion but have you started to think about special dividends which is being the subject that come up rather than buybacks which is start to become dilutive? Thank you.","Harvey Schwartz","Yeah, so look it\u2019s a good question. Just one think you said that I thought you said something like we enjoyed buying back a little book, just somewhat clear I never.","Christopher Wheeler","I know.","Harvey Schwartz","I never felt that enjoyable, I am always running for the share price and I am running our shareholders, so for all of our shareholders I am going to be bit confused. We route for a higher trading level.","Capital management is a long term process and so if you actually did a math in terms of the fourth quarter buying back book causes about $0.24 a share. If you actually did a corporate finance analytics around share repurchase versus dividends, share repurchase because you are reducing share and you are returning capital at the same time are always more accretive than a dividend. Now that\u2019s a map and that sort of stuff. I think the bigger issue is how we want to run the company. And we\u2019re not thinking about changing how we run the company because where the share price is. We try to run the company in the best way for our clients and our shareholders and ultimately that translates to a higher share price.","But out policy respect to the mix being more heavily weighted to share repurchase, that has suited us quite well. It gives us exactly the kind of flexibility we\u2019ve talked about in the context of this operating leverage goal so that if we see a big pickup in demand, we can deploy that capital to our clients where ultimately that\u2019s our preferred way to deploy the capital. But you shouldn\u2019t expect any change in long term policy in terms of how we think about share repurchase relative to dividends.","Christopher Wheeler","Thank you, very clear.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","At this time there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.","Harvey Schwartz","Great, since there are no more questions, I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank all of you for joining this call. Hopefully Marty and I as well other members of senior management will see many of you in the coming months. Any additional question come up, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to Dane.

This call is being recorded today April 17, 2018. Thank you.","Ms. Miner, you may begin your conference.","Heather Kennedy Miner","Good morning. This is Heather Kennedy Miner, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call.","Today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm\u2019s belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain and outside of the firm\u2019s control.

Marty?","Marty Chavez","Thanks, Heather, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. I\u2019ll walk you through our first quarter results and make some brief comments on the broader opportunity set for the firm. Then of course I am happy to answer any questions. ","First quarter net revenues of $10 billion were up 25% versus the first quarter of last year. Net earnings of $2.8 billion were up 26%. Earnings per share were $6.95, up 35%. Return on common equity was 15.4% representing our highest quarterly return in over five years. While we are pleased with our strong first quarter performance, it\u2019s we are stepping back to put these results and the environment into context. ","The last time we generated over a 15% return the environment was different in several ways. Five years ago, global growth was generally improving but still slow and we were embarking on a period of unprecedented global central bank stimulus. In contrast, the start to 2018 has been characterized by healthy backdrops of synchronized global growth and rising interest rates. ","Better growth prospects are supporting central bank efforts to reduce stimulus which has been a primary factor driving the below average market volatility seen in recent years. During the first quarter, the positive outlook for global growth translated into improved corporate and investor confidence and subsequently solid activity across the firm, particularly in our Investment Banking and Market Making businesses.","Compared to the first quarter of last year, Investment Banking, FICC, Equities, Investing & Lending and Investment Management, each produced net revenue growth with four of the five increasing 18% or more. While it\u2019s impossible to predict the future, we remain cautiously optimistic that many of the broader drivers underpinning the solid start to the year, healthy economic growth, relatively positive investor sentiment and the emergence of new market trends can remain in place. ","We are pleased with our improved performance in the quarter as it demonstrates the earnings power of our diversified franchise and shows what is possible with modest improvements in the environment and client activity and we believe there is room for additional revenue and earnings growth as we further diversify our global franchise across a broader client base with an expanded suite of products and services. ","Let\u2019s discuss the individual businesses. Investment Banking produced net revenues of $1.8 billion, 16% lower than a very robust fourth quarter, which was our strongest in over ten years. The decline came amid a lower but still strong underwriting performance and a decrease in advisory revenues. ","Financial Advisory revenues were $586 million. The decline relative to the fourth quarter reflects the decrease in a number of completed M&A transactions. During the quarter, we participated in announced transactions of approximately $240 billion. We are optimistic regarding the outlook for higher activity across a number of sectors given new clarity from US tax reform and healthy client dialogues. ","Moving to underwriting, net revenues were $1.2 billion in the first quarter, down 12% from the fourth quarter across equity and debt. Equity underwriting net revenues of $410 million declined 11% driven by lower industry volumes. ","In the first quarter, we ranked second globally in equity and equity-related underwriting with $20 billion of deal volume in over 100 transactions. Debt underwriting net revenues were $797 million, the second best quarter ever following last quarter\u2019s record. ","Growing debt underwriting has been a long-term priority for the firm and we expect our strong M&A franchise will continue to support robust contribution from acquisition-related financings.","Turning to our Investment Banking backlogs, it increased versus both the fourth quarter and first quarter of 2017 driven by M&A volumes and underwriting respectively. As I mentioned, the new tax legislation in the U.S. has added significant clarity for our clients and we continue to work with them to assess and execute a variety of strategic priorities. ","Moving to Institutional Client Services, net revenues were $4.4 billion in the first quarter, up 85% compared to the fourth quarter and up 31% versus the first quarter of last year. In both our FICC and equities franchises, we generated our highest quarterly revenues in three years. Performance was supported by better prospects for global growth and higher market volatility. ","This backdrop drove, improved investor confidence, led to higher client engagement across flow and structured transactions, and a broader opportunity set for our franchise. FICC Client Execution net revenues were $2.1 billion in the first quarter, more than doubling fourth quarter levels reflecting a better operating environment and our efforts to strengthen client relationships. ","Results were helped by reduced inventory headwinds in certain businesses. We saw higher sequential performance across all five of our global fixed income businesses as higher client activity drove a broader opportunity set despite a continued competitive environment with relatively tight bid ask spreads. ","We also saw increased activity in areas where we have historical strength including higher activity in derivatives and structured transactions as clients sought to access emerging trends or hedge risks. ","Within FICC, commodities increased significantly versus the fourth quarter reflecting improved performance, particularly in natural gas and power. Currencies results reflect better performance in G-10 and the significant improvement in emerging markets compared with a challenging fourth quarter. Rates benefited from higher activity in the U.S. and in Europe where we continue to grow our client footprint. ","Credit reflected improved conditions in high yields, investment grades, munis and structured credit and benefited from stronger client activity in flow trading. Mortgages benefited from improved market conditions and better client engagement. ","The improvement in FICC was also evident on a year-over-year basis with a significant increase in currencies reflecting strong performance in emerging markets, as well as significantly better results in commodities and credit. ","We are pleased to see our FICC business improve versus a difficult 2017, which we believe in part represents our continued efforts to expand and diversify our global client franchise. Nonetheless, much work remains to be done and we continue to execute on the billion dollar FICC revenue growth plans we laid out last September. ","Turning to Equities, net revenues for the first quarter were $2.3 billion, up 69% sequentially as equity market volatility rebounded globally from record lows driving higher client activity, and the broader opportunity set. ","Equities Client Execution net revenues of $1.1 billion rose significantly, driving our highest quarterly performance in three years on stronger results in both cash and derivatives. Commissions and fees net revenues rose 11% to $817 million driven by stronger volumes across the U.S., Europe and Asia. ","Security Services net revenues of $432 million rose 6% on higher client balances. Turning to risk, average daily VaR in the first quarter was $73 million, up from 15 year lows during 2017, but consistent with 2015 levels. The increase was driven primarily by client demand for our balance sheet. In many ways, we view rebounding VaR as a positive development and indicative of an improving opportunity set. ","Moving to Investing & Lending, collectively, these franchises produced net revenues of $2.1 billion in the first quarter. Our Investing & Lending balance sheet ended the quarter at $129 billion, up $8 billion versus last quarter. It is comprised of approximately $106 billion in loans, debt securities and other assets and $23 billion in private and public equity investments. ","Equity securities generated net revenues of $1.1 billion, reflecting net gains from private equities driven by company-specific events and corporate performance. Approximately 55% of our performance was from mark-to-market on public securities and events such as sales in our private portfolio. Our global equity portfolio was $23 billion at quarter end and remains well diversified with over 900 different investments. ","Our performance continues to be driven by an investment discipline that emphasizes risk-adjusted returns applied by global teams of over 400 investment professionals and supported by our dedicated risk management and controls infrastructure. ","Regarding our equity investment portfolio, it is diversified across industry and geography and balanced across investment vintage. Approximately 30% of the portfolio is held in investments made in 2011 or earlier. Roughly 30% is from investments made between 2012 and 2014 and about 40% is from investments made over the last three years. ","The balance and diversification coupled with our disciplined investments approach should help support further \u2013 future contributions from these businesses through the cycle. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were robust $1 billion. Results included over $550 million of net interest income, which continues to grow as we seek to increase more recurring revenue streams. ","Results also included mark-to-market gains driven by underlying credit fundamentals and specific events from roughly 100 loans and securities. No single name was a significant contributor to the results. Our lending strategy remains focused on providing financing to support and expand our existing clients including in Investment Banking, Investment Management and ICS.","Our strategy is also focused on applying core competencies of Goldman Sachs, collateral and asset valuation and risk management. We also continue to prudently expand our lending to new client segments, primarily through our Marcus consumer platform, which includes digital lending, and deposits. ","Since launch, markets has originated approximately $3 billion of consumer loans. We continued to emphasize credit worthy customers and the credit quality of our portfolio is performing in line with expectations. Additionally, our retail deposits, which were $9 billion at the acquisition of the GE business, exceeded $20 billion in March. ","We are pleased with the progress we are making on strategic initiatives within our consumer franchise. Our long-term vision for markets is to create the leading platform for millions of consumers to take control of their financial lives offering personalized products to save and borrow better simple, transparence and provide value to customers. ","Last week, we closed the acquisition of Clarity Money. This is an important next step and certainly not the last in creating a business that marshals technology to put power over personal finances fast in the hands of consumers. ","Moving to Investment Management. We produced record revenues in the first quarter driven by our diversified global asset management business and differentiated private wealth management franchise. Net revenues were $1.8 billion including relatively stable management and other fees. The 6% sequential increase reflected higher incentive fees, driven by Harvest King.","We also grew transaction revenues by 28% driven primarily by higher TWM client activity. Assets under supervision finished the quarter at a record $1.5 trillion, up $4 billion versus the fourth quarter driven by $13 billion of long-term net inflows across fixed income and equity partially offset by $5 billion of liquidity product outflows and $4 billion of market depreciation. ","Now, let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense include salaries, bonuses, amortization to prior year equity warrants and other items such as benefits, and our compensation to net revenues ratio of 41% was consistent with the first quarter of 2017. Non-compensation expenses were $2.5 billion, down slightly versus the fourth quarter and up 14% versus the year ago. ","Higher non-compensation expenses versus the first quarter of last year reflects both higher client activity and our investments in future growth. There were three main drivers. Approximately, $150 million was driven by higher client activity, which increased brokerage, clearing, exchange and distribution fees. ","Approximately $100 million comes from a variety of investments to drive growth including Marcus, and consolidated investments and approximately $50 million of the increase was related to an accounting change for certain transaction costs. ","Next on taxes. Our reported tax rate for the quarter was approximately 17%. The quarter included a $203 million income tax benefit related to share-based compensation. Excluding this benefit, our underlying tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 23%, slightly lower than the long-term expectation of 24% we stated last quarter given transition rules effected for 2018. We will provide further updates as we continue to evaluate ongoing guidance from treasury. ","Turning to balance sheet, liquidity and capital. Our global core liquid assets averaged $229 billion during the quarter. Our balance sheet was $974 billion, up 6% versus last quarter driven by increased client activity and demand for our balance sheet. On a fully phased in basis, our common equity tier-1 ratio was 12.1% using the standardized approach and 11.1% under the Basel III advanced approach.","The ratios improved by 20 and 40 basis points respectively on a sequential basis. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 5.7%. ","In the quarter, we returned a total of $1.1 billion to shareholders including common stock repurchases of $800 million and approximately $300 million in common stock dividends. Additionally, our Board approved a7% increase in our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.80 per share beginning in the second quarter. ","Given current capital levels and the opportunities we see to support our client franchise, we do not expect to execute share repurchases in the second quarter and will use earnings to support future investments. We have been transparent our growth plans and there is a clear demand from clients for our balance sheet, which provides an opportunity to deliver attractive returns to our shareholders. ","Nevertheless, over the medium-term, we continue to believe our historical repurchase level of approximately $5 billion to $6 billion per CCAR cycle is a reasonable expectation. ","Before taking questions, a few brief closing thoughts. While we are pleased with our performance in the first quarter, we continued to diversify our client footprint and the breadth of products and services we offer. We believe successful implementation of these initiatives will provide further upside to additional revenue and earnings growth for the firm. ","Regarding our $5 billion in growth initiatives, we track our progress in a detailed and comprehensive way mapping not just the specific revenues generated from each initiative, but many key performance indicators that will provide insight into our progress. ","Today, we are pleased to share that our performance is tracking in line or better than our goals. Of course, the results will be more back-end loaded and our plan and progress reflects that expectation. Looking forward, we continue to make significant investments in our future to deepen and expand our client franchise and drive growth in each of our businesses. ","As we\u2019ve discussed, our significant investments in technology underpins all of our efforts. We also continue to emphasize producing higher revenues from more recurring sources such as Investment Management, and Lending generating significant operating leverage and diversifying the long-term earnings profile of the firm. ","We believe these efforts will continue to position us to create long-term value for our shareholders. ","With that, thanks again for dialing in. I will now open up the line for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Bernstein. Please go ahead. ","Christian Bolu ","Good morning, Marty. ","Marty Chavez","Good morning, Christian. ","Christian Bolu ","Just first off on Equities, so similar to peers, very strong numbers here. The worry is always sustainability. I know you do have some growth initiatives around electronic trading and you won the Bloomberg Trade Book business last year. Just curious how much of 1Q's strength was pay-off from growth initiatives versus just the episodic volatility backdrop during the quarter? And then how should we think about sustainability in that business going forward?","Marty Chavez","So, Christian, client activity was the major driver of the year-on-year increase. The vol spike, particularly at the beginning of February was a positive contributor to the Equities\u2019 P&L, but again client activity was the major driver and it would have been a strong quarter without the long volatility benefits. The environment lined up well for our franchise as you know, we\u2019ve got franchise diversified across the products and geographies and really in the quarter, we saw the benefits of that. ","The performance was strong across flow and structured products, across cash and derivatives, across geographies, and all the business lines when delta derivatives and prime there was really broad based improvement where the volatility created a robust market-making backdrop and the clients were active and we executed well. ","You referenced the growth initiatives and of course our investments in Equities growth is an important part of those initiatives. It\u2019s \u2013 you also referenced Bloomberg Trade Book which brought on 1300 new clients and that\u2019s got some revenue runrate associated with it and we\u2019ve been onboarding low touch and quant clients in connection with the new product services and platforms we\u2019ve been developing. ","It\u2019s early days in that onboarding, but also important to note that these offerings, electronic trading tools, analytics are valuable not just to the quant and systematic clients, but to our traditional clients as well. Bottom-line, the franchise does well when clients are active. ","Christian Bolu ","Great, thanks. On the regulatory front, I guess the Fed put out a couple of NPRs around SLR and stress capital buffer, the off-shut feels like leverage could potentially no longer be constrained or a binding factor for your business. So curious how we should think about the opportunity set for Goldman, especially growing some of the lower ROE businesses to the extent leverage is no longer a constraint? ","Marty Chavez","Our initial read of the notices of proposed rulemaking from the Fed last week, I\u2019ll start with ESLR, it\u2019s clear from the rule \u2013 the proposed rule that SLR is likely to return to its intended purpose originally which was serving as a back stop to the risk-based requirements as opposed to being in itself a binding requirement. ","While it seems likely that SLR will be less binding, we are of course still going to consider it holistically in our approach to capital allocation generally perhaps with the less \u2013 lesser weight. Of course, we will see how it\u2019s going to evolve and all of this has to \u2013 how the businesses evolve and responses that we make in demand from the clients is a dynamic process. ","As for the stress capital buffer proposal, also last week, we are not surprised by it. It\u2019s been well highlighted and outlined by the Fed in multiple conversations with the market, as well as white papers and we are supportive of the Fed\u2019s stated goal which is to simplify the capital framework and connect the stress capital and spot requirements. ","The regulator has also been very clear that it is a proposal and that they are open to feedback and they are inviting the feedbacks and we will take all of that under advisement as they works through finalizing the rules. ","Based on the proposal, we would expect stress capital buffer to be the binding constraint and we will continue what we\u2019ve been doing for a long time now which is dynamically allocating our scarce resources, optimizing under all of these constraints as they evolve with the goal always of growing the franchise driving returns. We have a history of responding to new constraints and we\u2019ll continue to do that. ","Christian Bolu ","Great. And then just one last clean up question for me. On the non-comp side, thanks for that breakdown between brokerage, investment and accounts. It\u2019s very helpful. How should we think about the right jump of point? Is it the $2.5 billion this quarter of non-comp, less the 150 of volume-driven cost and that\u2019s a, kind of a good number for us to think about the forward \u2013 kind of the forward non-comp trajectory?","Marty Chavez","Chris, and I encourage you to think of the recent level of expenses as indicative of the future level, given our commitment to growth and the growth initiatives that we have outlined that we are executing on. But having said that, of course, our commitments to delivering positive operating leverage to the shareholders is as firm as ever and you saw some of that play through in the first quarter results with EPS and pretax up 35% and non-comps up 14%. We welcome that dynamic. ","Christian Bolu ","Okay. Thank you for taking my questions.","Marty Chavez","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Marty Chavez","Hey, Glenn.","Glenn Schorr ","Hey, Marty. How are you?","Marty Chavez","Good, thanks. ","Glenn Schorr ","First one on I&L. I definitely appreciate the extra color that you gave. And I don\u2019t know how better to ask this, every capital market in the world is down, not a lot, but down 1% to 4%, call it. But it seems like your private is both on the equity and debt side, obviously has other things going on, so you produce like the best gains in like five years. ","I am curious as to what we can learn to get towards that and more importantly what we can do going forward to get more credit? Because, if you look at it, your I&L line has been great for five years and we keep not getting enough credit in there. So I am searching for help on how to both explain it and particularly on the equity side. ","Marty Chavez","So, I\u2019ll start with equities and happy to go in any direction you like it in Equity, I&L. The key to that business is, diversification. It\u2019s a global portfolio and it\u2019s diversified across sectors, across geographies, both private equity, also real estate. And the other key to it is a franchise business. We have sourcing capabilities that are driven by a global network and investing as we\u2019ve been demonstrating with these results remains long-term emphasis as well as a core competency. ","I gave you the vintage breakdown. And what I would say is that in this quarter, we clearly saw the results of excellent environment for harvesting and we\u2019ve been actively harvesting both to maximize value for our investors and then also as to comply with the regulations. We also talked a little bit about the drivers, 50% of it was from mark-to-market on public securities for events. ","For instance, sales in the private portfolio, but really the key to it is that we have [attractive] [ph] sourcing mechanism and it\u2019s finding great businesses and working with them to operate them and make them better and of course, that\u2019s been driving not only the results you seen in this quarter and prior quarters, the long-term book value for us. ","Glenn Schorr ","Okay. Got all that. Thank you. Curious on \u2013 I guess, this holds on to the labor corporate relationship\u2019s full umbrella. I guess, I\u2019d love to hear you talk about the full suite of products that you \u2013 think you either have now or will be \u2013 obviously you are picking up on the lending fronts and trading, but, it has been talked about building on a suite of cash management products. So, maybe if you could just put that whole package together, that would be helpful?","Marty Chavez","There is \u2013 as we\u2019ve mentioned in the growth plan, a number of initiatives across the firm and where do I start? So, what remains constant across all of them is the risk management, infrastructure that we\u2019ve got and the disciplined approach to managing scarce resources. I\u2019ll call out a few of the activities under the growth plan. In FICC, we\u2019ve increased our corporate derivatives mandates. ","In Equities, as I touched on before, we\u2019ve been onboarding clients, continuing to invest in execution services and infrastructure. There is some exciting developments that are driven out of equities, but actually, we are now broadening and applying across FICC as well building electronic tools, that are portals for our clients where we abstract and take the concepts of risk transfer very generally and show our clients all the different possible ways where they can effect risk transfer from agency to principals systematic across different product wrappers. ","There is so many ways to do it and really making that transparent and simple and digital for our clients. It\u2019s a huge effort that\u2019s underway. ","In Investment Banking, we\u2019ve assigned coverage on over 500 of the 1000 targeted clients and you\u2019ve all seen announcements of a number of senior bankers who\u2019ve joined us recently. I called out the inflows in our Investment Management business and also to say a little bit on Marcus, the funded loan balance is about $2.4 billion, originations through the end of the first quarter life-to-date approximately $3 billion and you also know of the announcement of Clarity Money\u2019s \u2013 after the acquisition of Clarity Money, which closed on Friday and there Clarity Money is a digital app that aligns with what we\u2019ve been doing already in Marcus. ","Simplicity, transparency, a great experience for the clients and you can expect to continue to see us making investments to create adjacent businesses built around that digital app and that digital experience. And as we are doing all of this, we are doing it in a flexible way, where it allows us to move into all kinds of adjacencies, you mentioned cash management, which is an important opportunity and one that we are evaluating and exploring. ","In Ayco, that\u2019s another example of providing executive counseling to the senior executives in Fortune-1000 companies there. We\u2019ve been effective at growing the number of Ayco\u2019s client companies, as well as using digital tools and platforms to offer Ayco\u2019s services to more people inside the Ayco client companies. With all these activities have in common is delivering the entire firm and using our long-term strength in engineering to do this in a scalable and digitized way. ","Glenn Schorr ","Okay. So you are not doing much. Okay, thanks a lot. Appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. ","Marty Chavez","Hello, Michael.","Michael Carrier ","Hi, Marty. Marty, just, I guess, a question on client content and activity levels both in banking and trading, like the industry, we always have kind of a seasonal lift in the first quarter. We\u2019ve gotten the tax reform and rising rates and on the flip side, we\u2019ve got some trade work and churns, flatter yield curves, so where do you see if there is things that you can point to in the business metrics, client balances activity? ","Whether it\u2019s in banking or trading that makes you think that the \u2013 beyond potential that you are better this year over the next couple of years, that\u2019s different versus the past year is where we\u2019ve seen kind of the 1Q bounce and then back to kind of muted activity levels?","Marty Chavez","Michael, one way to think about it is to compare this quarter to the last time we had results in both FICC and Equities at these levels. And I\u2019d just start by saying, but clear and stable across these businesses is that our clients respond to macro growth and market dynamics dispersion across asset classes and they respond by being more active. ","So let\u2019s look at some of the drivers in this first quarter versus the first quarter of 2015. Now of course, no predictions here, just contingency planning, but the drivers, having said that are quite different this time around. So this time we\u2019ve got globally synchronized economic growth. It\u2019s been a little while since we had that. We had rising U.S. rates and stronger labor markets. ","We\u2019ve got U.S. tax reform now behind us and one could easily imagine that those are more durable drivers than, say, what we saw in the first quarter of 2015 in the first quarter you recall there were some events such as the Swiss Central Bank depegging from the euro. ","There was an expectation of rising rates, but rates didn\u2019t actually rise until the back half of the year and then there was the initiation of quantitative easing from the European Central Bank and generally that\u2019s after some initial repositioning associated with dampening market volatility. So, those are some of the things that are different. ","Going over to our Investment Banking business, there is a related set of dynamics, where, as I mentioned the backlog is up year-on-year. It\u2019s up sequentially and in retrospect with tax reform behind us it\u2019s now more clear that that\u2019s some corporations were waiting for clarity on tax reform to proceed. And so, the dialogue is strong. ","Announced M&A is up and it takes a while for those announced M&As as you know to play through into completed M&A transactions and therefore into revenues, but it will note that across those sectors, yes, there are concerns about tariffs, trade wars and so on. But the activity and dialogue is strong. It\u2019s difficult to predict \u2013 impossible to predict what these drivers will be in the future. And so, we keep the focus on what we can do here which is to position ourselves to support the clients in whatever they are going to do. ","Michael Carrier ","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, maybe one on the regulatory ratios. So just given, where your CET-1 is today in your comments on the buyback outlook. Just wanted to get a sense when you look at kind of the demand for the balance sheet and the opportunities for growth, whether it\u2019s on the institutional \u2013 the trading side or what you are dealing like the lending side. Do you have, kind of what you need meaning, can you hit the growth targets comfortably and still manage to the capital ratios with the buybacks that you suggested?","Marty Chavez","Yes, so, to give you that buyback expectation and then to reaffirm it in this quarter and also in pace of our growth plan which we\u2019ve known and we\u2019ve shared the outlines of it sometime ago. All \u2013 plus the notice of proposed rulemaking that have come from the Fed, we\u2019ve been taking all of those factors into account. And of course there is uncertainties and it\u2019s evolving and dynamic and there is going to be a lot of discussion next \u2013 on those sixty days that the Fed has invited with the industry on stressed capital buffer and so there will likely be some evolution there as the rule makes its way into the final state. ","And so, all of these things are moving and when we gave the growth plan, and the $5 billion to $6 billion expectation of share repurchases per CCAR cycle, we very much had what we thought possible for the stress capital buffer proposal in our minds when we proposed and adopted our internal capital management planning, which ensures that we are dynamically managing capital moving it around on behalf of the clients to where the highest return opportunities are for our shareholders. ","So, we have all of these things in mind when we gave those. So the short answer to your question is, yes, we have the resources and the plan to be well-capitalized and to serve the clients and to execute on the growth plan. ","Michael Carrier ","Okay. Thanks a lot. ","Marty Chavez","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Marty Chavez","Good morning, Matt.","Matt O\u2019Connor ","Good morning. I want to follow-up on the Investment Banking piece, stronger than what we are seeing at peers and especially in the DCM, debt capital markets area, you alluded to the share gains there apart from some of the build out in recent years. But just hoping you could elaborate a little bit maybe specifically this quarter what drove DCM and I guess a follow-up question while now it \u2013 you mentioned the pipelines is up versus year-end, and maybe give a little color in terms of which areas were stronger within the businesses? Thank you.","Marty Chavez","So, on debt underwriting, let\u2019s step back and look at how we got here to this near record quarter after a record quarter. It\u2019s a priority that we identified as strategic priority really almost ten years ago. And you are seeing the results of that and the consistent execution across weeks, months, quarters, years in building that business and there in that business, you saw in this quarter what is the key driver and the differentiator of the business compared to the debt underwriting businesses in the peer group, which is that we identified our core strengths which we all know in M&A and we built the debt underwriting business around that core strength. ","And so, it\u2019s really M&A as the driver for demand for the issuance and you are seeing the results flow through into revenues. The strategy over this period and continuing to now has remained stable which is giving advice, giving our clients access to capital markets and then applying everything we know and do about risk management to this business and doing it all in the context of strong franchise. ","In this quarter, acquisition finance activity drove nearly half of the revenues in debt underwriting. As for notable transactions, I am very pleased to say that we were a leader in CVS\u2019s $40 billion bond issuance to fund the acquisition of Aetna. ","Bottom-line I would say, M&A is the driver of sequential improvement in the backlog and the results that you are seeing in the business. ","Matt O\u2019Connor ","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, just on the backlog of overall Investment Banking being up versus year-end, maybe some additional color in terms of what areas are stronger, what region, any additional thoughts you can provide there?","Marty Chavez","Sure. What\u2019s notable about banking dialogue is that it\u2019s global. It\u2019s happening in all the geographies and it\u2019s happening in all of the sectors. You can see from some of the announced M&A which sectors are really active, but it\u2019s really across the board. It\u2019s in healthcare, it\u2019s in natural resources, it\u2019s in media, very broad based. ","Matt O\u2019Connor ","Okay. Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Mike Mayo ","Hi. How much of the $5 billion in growth initiatives have you achieved? ","Marty Chavez","I\u2019m not going to give you the revenue number itself. It\u2019s early days. When we built the plan to get to $5 billion over three years, it\u2019s back-end loaded. Certainly not ratable over the twelve quarters and so we\u2019ve built in a slope there. But what I will say in this early quarter, the second quarter after we laid out the growth plan, it\u2019s the revenue is tracking according to the internal goals that we set for ourselves. ","Mike Mayo ","Let me ask a different question. How much do you have in tech spending for 2018? And how does that compare to say, 2017 or 2016? I am not sure if you\u2019ve disclosed that in the past.","Marty Chavez","We don\u2019t, Mike, break out our tech spending. What I would say about tech spending generally is \u2013 there is really two components of it, which of course people, that\u2019s the major component. And then also, all of the other platforms, cyber security and so on that go along with it, which we call the managed spend. In the growth initiatives, which we\u2019ve highlighted, the seven growth initiatives whether it\u2019s the corporate derivative mandates, it\u2019s what we are doing to quantum systematic clients. ","In Investment Banking, there is a lot going on there. For instance, automating the buildings of company models and doing merger math by pairs and doing that at scale across all possible pairs and identifying opportunities for our clients. Whether it\u2019s Investment Management components of the $1billion growth initiatives in Investment Management, about a third of it is in our Ayco Executive Counseling business, the digital platforms there in markets there. ","The key has been all digital, no manual intervention, no spreadsheets in the workflows and that continues to be core to the philosophy there. So, when you look at all of those initiatives, you can see that they all have engineering and in engineering, we are going to be doing some capitalizing of the expenses as we build up these platforms. ","Make sure that we build them without over-engineering them in a way that\u2019s shareable across businesses and geographies. And so, yes, the demand for more software, more math is up across the board and we are evaluating that carefully because it really has to all be in service of making ourselves more effective, more efficient and doing this with margin expansion which you are seeing continuing as we make these investments.","Mike Mayo ","Last follow-up. The decision between buyer build and you certainly are investing and that\u2019s why I was asking those questions, but what about the trade-off with buying and your answer to a Glenn\u2019s question earlier, I thought was very comprehensive and I can\u2019t wait to get the transcript to keep that. But when I look at your list, consumer lending, commercial lending, cash management, thousand more companies with Investment Banking, at what point would you ever consider merging with a traditional commercial bank?","Marty Chavez","So, let me start up by talking at a related different buy versus build and then I\u2019ll get to the last part of your question. So, we had a long history at the firm and I was a part of that since I grew up in the engineering businesses as a quant and software person. We had a long tradition where we would say the only thing crazier than building all your own software is not building all of your own software. ","And so, we did that for a very long time and we\u2019ve built hundreds of millions of lines of custom software. Our own language, we wrote our own database. That was a part of that a long, long time ago. And that has served us very well. So that platform that we\u2019ve been working on, we just actually celebrated the 25th anniversary of it a couple weeks ago. ","The SecDB platform is now wall-to-wall across all of our businesses globally and voiced out there. One thing that we\u2019ve been working on is extending it out to the clients and packaging it up in APIs and user experiences and making it directly available to clients. Along the way, we\u2019ve evolved that strategy of building everything internally and the strategy has now become one which we describe as a waterfall and so the waterfall is download, builds, buy. ","And so, there I would say, by download, we just mean, if it\u2019s open source so we can participate in open source. We start there. If that\u2019s not going to work for our growth plan, then we are going to think about building it. But if it\u2019s really not differentiated, if it already exists in a great form and you saw that was Clarity Money, then the example there will be to buy. ","So, pretty different from the old approach. We look at all of these possibilities and are open minded there as you know pros and cons to all of that. I\u2019d expect that we are highly likely to continue with bolt-on acquisitions we\u2019ve found in our Marcus business, but in many other places, that\u2019s building it on our own allows us to deliver best-in-class experiences. ","But even within those context, as you are seeing with Clarity Money, we develop the view that that it already existed in a great form and so acquiring it makes sense. And so we are evaluating all of these acquisitions including things that you described, we are open minded and it\u2019s all part of the consideration as we execute on the strategy. ","Mike Mayo ","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Marty Chavez","Good morning, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck ","Hi, good morning. How are you doing? ","Marty Chavez","Very well. Thanks. How are you?","Betsy Graseck ","Good. So I just wanted to drill in on a couple of things. One was on the growth and the impact on the buyback. So I understand the rational for turning up the buyback in second quarter. I am looking at the fact that your end of period assets grew about 6% Q-on-Q. ","So, as I am modeling out what kind of growth rate you are likely to get in assets, is it like 1%, 2%, I can keep for $5 billion to $6 billion buyback, but if we are going to \u2013 if you are going to be able to continue to grow it like a 5%, 6% Q-on-Q, that\u2019s when the buyback gets shut off. Maybe you could help let me understand when to turn it on and off?","Marty Chavez","So, we called out the passing of the buyback in the second quarter. It\u2019s part of the plan that we submitted to the Federal Reserve for their approval and we\u2019ll hear, we\u2019ll hear from them in June on that. And our goal is always to operate from a position of strength by exceeding all the regulatory capital requirements and having the resources available to meet the client demand for our balance sheet. ","And as we do that, we are looking at serving the clients and doing so in a way that generates attractive risk returns for our shareholders and when we \u2013 the approach is straightforward. When we see opportunities to deploy capital in that way to serve the clients, then we are going to do that and we would always prefer that when we see the returns there as well to buying back our shares above book value. ","It\u2019s a high-class problem to have, this taking capital allocation and while it\u2019s important to have the excess capacity and that\u2019s why we highlighted that $5 billion to $6 billion expectation, if the demand from the clients continues to be strong, that is really the principal driver and when we see that demand and the opportunity to deploy capital with high ROEs that\u2019s what we are going to do. ","Betsy Graseck ","I probably get it growing the book for our clients is best use of capital. I am just wondering if there was a breakpoint with the 6% versus the 1% to 2% that we have seen over the past several quarters that\u2019s all.","Marty Chavez","Betsy, I wouldn\u2019t see it as a breakpoint. I would say, that\u2019s far from being a breakpoint and really it\u2019s dynamic as clients\u2019 demands for our balance sheet continues to be strong. ","Betsy Graseck ","Okay. And then just second question on the markets and the deposit gathering that you are doing. I know you called it out in the prepared remarks, could you just give us a sense as to how much funding you are expecting? You are going to be able to support with the market\u2019s deposit growth? In other words, maybe you could give us a sense as to what kind of inflows you are anticipating getting with the price points that you have and how much loan growth do you think that can support over the next couple of quarters?","Marty Chavez","On the loan growth, I gave you the figure which is that, as of the end of March, we are over $20 billion in retail deposits. That figure back at the acquisition was $9 billion and there was about a $3 billion increase in those retail deposits in the first quarter and there we continue to, of course, pay close attention to what the deposit rates available are and you can see from that evolution that we have rates that are in the sort of top bunch of the pack but not at the top. ","And there is a philosophy is to continue to grow the deposits by offering a better product and a better service and we are certainly exploring all kinds of ways to grow that deposit base with different products and different geographies. And you can expect to see some of those play out in results in future quarters. Having said all that, our loan-to-deposit ratio is low. And so, we definitively have sufficient capacity to fund the loans our clients\u2019 demands for loans. ","Betsy Graseck ","Great, great. And then just lastly, due to the marketing expenses associated with the deposit program, I mean, are those relatively small? I mean, it\u2019s not going to be something that shows that the non-comp expense that I should model in that roughly it\u2019s in the runrate today and that is just been a question that I\u2019ve gotten from some people, is the marketing going to show-up in any meaningful form?","Marty Chavez","So, Betsy, the marketing expenses as we build out the consumer business do as you say, show up in non-comp. And we broke out some of the drivers in the year-on-year increase and outlined $100 million of that year-on-year increase is related not only to building out the Marcus platform, the market development of it, but also relating to investing in our investment entities that are consolidated on the balance sheet and therefore their expenses will also show up in non-comps. ","On the Marcus business, as we mentioned in the last call, we\u2019ve integrated the deposit and lending activities under one brand and increasingly you are going to see all of the adjacencies in that one brand and brand consistency and user experience consistency across all of the offerings into the Marcus brand is an important priority. ","So the market developments and expenses will all be well be integrated. The results that you\u2019ve seen in the first quarter include all of the investment costs as we build out this business. That\u2019s all baked in and we are still a few years away from fully scaling that business. ","Betsy Graseck ","Okay, thanks a lot. Appreciated. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.","Marty Chavez","Hello, Brennan. ","Brennan Hawken ","Hey, good morning, Marty. Thanks for taking the question. Just, I\u2019d apologize if you\u2019ve touched on this, but could you talk about the trends we saw this quarter, there was a lot of volatility and significant change in how we started out the quarter, risk appetite, engagement, it seemed in the beginning, maybe first half of the quarter versus March. ","Could you, did that have a noticeable impact on your revenue trends trading businesses? And how has the quarter \u2013 second quarter started? I know it\u2019s early days, but maybe any indication would be great. Thanks. ","Marty Chavez","Well, Brennan, as we all know, it\u2019s in the nature of markets to fluctuate. Wouldn\u2019t every week and every month is different, certainly in February, we saw the notable spike in vol and in volatility and volatility or mix wall, that was easy to see on all of the screens. In terms of volatility, in other asset classes, well, it\u2019s up a little bit from very low levels. ","What I will note is that we are definitely seeing a trend where there is more dispersion in the asset classes than we\u2019ve seen before. So for instance, higher rates, but not generally playing through into a stronger dollar and increased activity and volatility in credit markets, not really necessarily showing up in a powerful or material way in the credit markets. ","And so, those \u2013 that kind of dispersion has continued, but I wouldn\u2019t say that there is anything material that I call out to read through into the first couple weeks of April. ","Brennan Hawken ","Okay. Thanks for the color. ","Marty Chavez","Sure. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous. Please go ahead.","Marty Chavez","Hello, Guy.","Guy Moszkowski ","Good morning. ","Marty Chavez","Good morning. ","Guy Moszkowski ","With revenue as strong as it was in the first quarter across so many businesses and you did talk about positive operating leverage on the non-comp expense side, but I was wondering why you didn\u2019t signal that positive operating leverage as well on the comp accrual rate? ","Marty Chavez","The comp accrual rate is something that we evaluate under a large number of scenarios. For what the rest of the year could be, we also do a little bit of a backwards look as you would expect, but it\u2019s much more forward-looking. ","And when we look at all of these different scenarios, 41% which is the same as where we had it in the first quarter of last year is our best estimate or where the comp ratio will be for the year, but of course as you know, extremely well that evolves as we work through the year. ","Guy Moszkowski ","Got it. And then, just noticing that, when you talked about fixed income, you talked about strength in credit in the year-over-year comparison anyway that I thought was in contrast as pretty much all of your peers that have reported to-date. I was wondering, is that strength that you saw on the credit side, just a base effect that you didn\u2019t have such a good execution in this quarter a year ago. Or was it more than you were just extra conservatively hedged or just something else?","Marty Chavez","It\u2019s the year-on-year driver in global credit was increased client activity. So, that\u2019s really the best way to see the improvements in the results. Part of it was the comparison as you mentioned. But really it\u2019s improved client activity and also I would call out within that in structure trading, particularly notable contributor to the year-on-year increase. ","Guy Moszkowski ","Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And then just one more quick one, which is also credit-related, but in a different way, in discussing Marcus, you did say that you were tracking your credit expectations. But I think that, a lot of the clients that I\u2019ve spoken with were a little surprised in your 10-K when you noted the higher than expected percentage of assets which are \u2013 or clients which are essentially sub-prime at least according to the FICO definition. ","And I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on what you are seeing in terms of delinquency, formation and alike in the Marcus portfolio? ","Marty Chavez","In the charge-offs and AHFL build of the portfolio, it\u2019s all proceeding according to expectations. I remember vividly that section in the K that you are talking about it to go back and look at it. And don\u2019t \u2013 and we could certainly get back to you on that whether there is migration from where somewhere the loans were originated. ","But I\u2019ll ask Heather to get back to you on the detail of that. We give disclosures and indications of where we are, really what I would say is that, there has been no surprises in the evolution of that business at all and we are well aware of where we are in the credit cycle as we set those expectations and we monitor it closely. ","I get reports every day and every week and we have a structure in that platform in that business where we can rapidly roll out revisions to the credit sandbox as conditions evolve.","Guy Moszkowski ","Okay, great. Thanks for answering my questions. ","Marty Chavez","Sure. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Kian Abouhossein with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Kian Abouhossein","Yes, hi. Can you talk \u2013 you mentioned earlier competition, I think you said is continuing on the bid ask spread side and I am just wondering, there is a higher volatility which historically has correlated this higher bid ask spreads. ","Do you still that correlation breaking down from what we used to pre-regulation I refer as you to the set platform on post-trade transparency? I.e., is there a change that higher volatility in any of you is not leading to the historic higher bid ask spread levels? And I base it a little bit on your comment, but if you can maybe elaborate.","Marty Chavez","Well, first I will say, there are higher levels of volatility. You can see it in our VaR and yet the main driver of the increase in VaR was not increase in volatility. It was actually increasing in client demand for our balance sheet. And certainly in the case of Equities, there was that pronounced vol spike that happened in February. ","When I look at the other volatility measures, yes, they are up for sure. But really it\u2019s, I would say a modest improvement in the market-making backdrop. It\u2019s evolving up in dramatic way, that would have shown, that would have played through as a driver of our VaR. There is a connection, no doubt, between vol and bid offer. ","But it isn\u2019t linear and it doesn\u2019t happen in tight synchrony and there are also all kinds of evolutions in the market in the way products are traded in the packaging of the products themselves. And that\u2019s certainly an evolution as well. So, it would be too simple to say that there is just as tight co-efficient that relates VAR to bid ask. It\u2019s really the result of a lot of drivers playing through together. ","Kian Abouhossein","And then, in terms of the trends, when we look at FICC in the first quarter, we heard from some peers there has been a material drop-off and then the rates business in particular in March. And can you just \u2013 I assume, you are sort of seeing the same developments across the market and can you just comment why that is? ","And it should lead you think about normal seasonality trends as we have seen in the past, the fixed income is just a straight declining line first and second quarter. Do you see that as a reasonable trend for the market?","Marty Chavez","Well, I would start by saying that in the months-to-months comparisons, there is not a lot of information content to get into our FICC businesses. They are a little bit more detailed. There is a better market-making backdrop increase VAR, higher volumes across many of the asset classes and importantly, the work that we are doing to improve broaden, strengthen, diversify our engagement with clients, who are our clients, as well as new clients in different segments. ","And most of the businesses rose year-on-year, foreign exchange, certainly and that was the driver of \u2013 and emerging markets, strong performance in emerging markets was the driver. In rates, if we look at the sequential change in the rates business, it\u2019s definitely up sequentially as you know and there it was really client activity-driven and clients responding to Central Bank activity. In the year-on-year comparison, rates declined a bit but remained solid. ","Kian Abouhossein","Thank you.","Marty Chavez","Sure.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Marty Chavez","Hello, James.","Jim Mitchell","Good morning. Hey, Marty. Maybe just a follow-up question on the Seb. Obviously, from the starting point to your stressed minimum, that\u2019s a bit of a challenge for you and your peers in the brokerage side. But, I think when you think about the stressed minimum, there is probably a pretty big assumption that\u2019s on the Fed on RWA inflation and we can\u2019t see that in the stress test because it just gives you a period end. ","So is there any help you can give us on if they are assuming flat RWAs as they\u2019ve indicated or other sort of impacts that could help offset the big drop distressed minimum from start? ","Marty Chavez","Well, as you know, there is many changes in the CCAR framework that are outlined in the Fed\u2019s proposed rules from last week. And, certainly there is a lot of discussions with the Fed about the evolution of their scenarios over time. There is some important changes that they\u2019ve made, not only in putting a little more detail on Governor to rule those discussions back couple of years ago on stress capital buffer. ","But they\u2019ve also been quite specific that they are changing their assumptions about capitalization or share repurchases and balance sheet growth as they are evolving the framework. And they have been \u2013 it\u2019s really clear in our discussions with the senior people at the Fed and the staff that they are open, they want to hear suggestions. ","They actively want to make the framework more simple and more transparent. The transparency theme is one that they highlight at every opportunity. And so, there I will say that we\u2019ve been working on this evolving rule sets going back to 2009, the proposed rulemaking is consistent with everything that we\u2019ve been hearing from the Fed over a period of time. ","No particular surprises and our model has been one where generally we have more sensitivity to some of the stress test than peers with a different mix and even in the phase of that over the cycle, we generally have ROEs at the top or near the top of the peer group. And so, the adjustments will continue. There will be new constraints. There will be evolutions. ","There will be dynamic changes, hedges, various kinds that we can make in our business and we\u2019ll respond. And so, I would say, the work continues. ","Jim Mitchell","Absolutely. I am just wondering if there is a way you could help us frame the size of the impact of their assumed increase in RWAs that your stressed \u2013 at your peak to help us kind of at least get close to what might \u2013 at least one offset that you are starting where you can frame that?","Marty Chavez","Yes. Actually, it\u2019s too early to tell that really we are seeing RWAs as flat in the stress scenario. And when we look at where our capital levels are, and what we think the notice of proposed rulemaking is likely to imply. We\u2019ve got a plan and we highlighted what we thought what we think. ","The share repurchases will be over the CCAR cycle in the context of that plan and how we see that the minima evolving. So, it all ties together. I don\u2019t think at this current state with one week into the period of commenting on the notice of proposed rulemaking. I am thinking, there is a lot more that one could say right at this time. ","Jim Mitchell","Okay, fair enough. And just maybe a question on, there has been a lot of chatter on the overall being east, what\u2019s your sense of what that \u2013 how it\u2019s kind of impacted you and your peers in terms of constraining inventory? Do you think it\u2019s a big deal, little deal? How do you think, how do we think about the impact of potentially some little more leeway in terms of holding inventory? Is it a big positive, little positive?","Marty Chavez","The discussions and indications from the regulators are that, they are looking to simplify the compliance with the Volcker Rule. Various \u2013 including very senior people at the Fed have said that it\u2019s a rule with a relatively straightforward concept or intent, but and its current form, the compliance with it. The number of data points that one has to generate is quite complicated. ","And they\u2019ve indicated that it\u2019s more complicated that it needs to be to serve the purpose of the rule. So, when we are thinking about how the Volcker Rule might change, we don\u2019t know. We will read the proposed rulemaking if there is one, when it comes out. And we will respond to it as we always do. Our thought would be it\u2019s likely to considerably simplify the process of conformance with the rule. ","As for our ability to serve our clients make markets for them have the right amount of inventory on the balance sheet and manage all of those risks, it\u2019s dynamic. This is something that\u2019s one of our core strengths. Putting it all into the analytics and coming up with a strategy to optimize and draw all those constraints. And we\u2019ll continue to do that. ","Jim Mitchell","Okay, fair enough. Thanks. ","Marty Chavez","Sure. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer & Company. Please go ahead.","Marty Chavez","Hello, Chris. ","Chris Kotowski ","In your discussion of INO, you flagged $550 million of net interest income and believe the year ago number was 243 in the fourth quarter is right around 400. So, I am curious, does that reflect some unusually good positioning opportunities in the first quarter? Or does that primarily reflect the underlying growth in the loan portfolio, so that we could multiply it by four and add a growth factor? ","Marty Chavez","So, I am not sure if you call that the second quarter of last year or the fourth quarter of last year. My records in the fourth quarter NII was $500 million and now it\u2019s $554 million, just little north of $550 million and definitively, it is \u2013 think of it is recurring. It is related to expanding our lending activities and continuing to diversify the lending activities. ","That\u2019s $554 million component of the $1 billion in the debt INO segment, that $550 million component is recurring. As for the balance of it, happy to give you a little bit more color on the balance of the revenues, $1 billion, minus the $554 million and it\u2019s a diversified portfolio. We\u2019ve got a differentiated sourcing mechanism and in that business a very long history of strong risk adjusted returns. ","And so the additional revenues beyond the recurring NII are mark-to-market gains, which were driven by underlying credit fundamentals, not just like credit spread widening that we saw in the quarter. Just underlying and fundamentals as well as specific events and there it would be important to note that it\u2019s diversified. ","It reflects mark-to-market, company-specific events, credit fundamentals across more than a 100 loans and securities. And there was no single name that was a significant contributor in any way to the results. ","Chris Kotowski ","Okay. All right. So I was looking at note 25 in your Ks and Qs, but that\u2019s puts up net interest income and it doesn\u2019t quite match up to the numbers you gave. But I\u2019ll follow-up with Heather. ","Marty Chavez","Okay, we\u2019ll be happy to follow-up. There is net interest income in the segment and then there is net interest income for the firm and that\u2019s likely the difference between the two. But Heather will follow-up with you. ","Chris Kotowski ","Yes, but I am right in thinking that there is \u2013 I guess, the thing that\u2019s interesting is always rapid growth off a small base. ","Marty Chavez","That\u2019s the theme we\u2019ve built in our lending books over the past several quarters from a very small base and that\u2019s the phenomenon that you are seeing is important to emphasize in that lending growth that is franchise adjacent lending growth. That\u2019s not lending in and of itself that\u2019s related to all of our other businesses. ","Chris Kotowski ","Okay. All right. Thank you. I\u2019ll follow-up. ","Marty Chavez","Sure. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.","Marty Chavez","Hello, Steven.","Steven Chubak","Hey, good morning, Marty. So, wanted to just start-off with a question on the balance sheet growth. I was hoping you can give us some better insight just in terms of the specific drivers of the balance sheet expansion. I recognize it was a reflection of a pickup in client activity in the quarter? I just want to get a better sense as to what \u2013 given the uptick in VaR, as well as the sheer magnitude of balance sheet growth, why we didn\u2019t see a bigger increase in RWA?","Marty Chavez","So, the growth in the balance sheet generally, it\u2019s an increase in loans receivable and it\u2019s also in financial instruments owned to support Repo and our prime services business and so that\u2019s where you are seeing the balance sheet growth. ","As for the risk-weighted assets, they were constantly working to optimize the risk-weighted assets, especially if you get into advanced risk-weighted assets, you are seeing some continuing roll-off in operational risk-weighted assets and then the results of a lot of work on efficiencies, of various kinds, netting opinions, compression and so on all playing through into reduction of the risk-weighted assets. ","There \u2013 it would be lovely if there was just a direct and easy connection between balance sheet and risk-weighted assets, but there is portfolio effects and it isn\u2019t just a direct linear relationship. ","Steven Chubak","I appreciate all the color there, Marty and I know it\u2019s a rather envelope question. So, appreciate the effort. I just have one follow-up on Marcus. I know you already gave a very comprehensive response to Glenn\u2019s earlier question discussing some of the various product launches. ","I am just wondering as I think back to last year, when you initially highlighted the $1 billion revenue target and how much of those new launches that will be spin, cited in the \u2013 and you highlight on the call or initially contemplated as part of that target, or is there maybe upside that could actually be realized as you maybe pursue other potential avenues or product channels?","Marty Chavez","Steven, when we announced the growth initiatives, one thing that we said was really important to reiterate that is that, they were not intended to be the definitive all encompassing list of growth initiatives. They were a set of initiatives that we shared with the market to hold ourselves accountable and to drive and organize our activities. ","But, again, not the comprehensive set and certainly when we first began the planning process that led to the launch of our Marcus business, we looked at well over a hundred opportunities in consumer finance. And there, we evaluated all of those opportunities through a set of different lenses. Did we see substantial pain points for clients and therefore the opportunity to deliver some value? ","Did we see a way to leverage core strengths that we already have, but that\u2019s in engineering or risk management culture and processes? And did we see attractive shareholder returns? And as well, would it be possible to generate meaningful results for us without requiring a large market share in those businesses. ","And so, we still refer back to that set, because it\u2019s quite comprehensive and the world changes and evolves and so, we are looking at a very large number of opportunities. And we will execute on some of them and the ones we execute on will check all the boxes that I just outlined. And the set is quite large. So we are evaluating credit cards as you\u2019ve heard us say. ","We are looking at wealth management. We are looking at retirement products. We are looking at personal finance and we are looking at the adjacencies in and among our various businesses as we build all these things out. And so, the short answer to your question is, the growth initiatives are the one we outlined and we are tracking them. ","We are making progress on them. There is granular indicators that we look at every week and there is a lot of other activities that are also happening, that we haven\u2019t expressly highlighted for you in the form of the growth initiatives. ","Steven Chubak","That\u2019s great, Marty. I appreciate the color. Thank you for taking my questions. ","Marty Chavez","Sure. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.","Marty Chavez","Hello, Devin. ","Devin Ryan ","Hey, thanks. Good morning, Marty. Most of my questions have been asked here. And I just have a modeling question. So the $50 million this quarter relate to the revenue recognition accounting change, should think that\u2019s maybe a low number moving forward, just assuming revenues in areas like M&A advisory, move higher? ","And then, just trying to connect that to any implications that could have on the comp ratios this year, obviously, which is going to be one more lever in addition to kind of the higher starting point on revenues in the first quarter to maybe help push that comp ratio lower. So we didn\u2019t see it in the accrual this quarter. ","Just trying to kind of think about some of the moving parts here. I know, you are kind of taking a full year view and you\u2019ll maybe adjust it later depending on the backdrop. But I am just trying to get a sense if this is conservatism as we are all in the year and that maybe one more factor to kind of think about what should be also kind of be thinking about the growth investments as we are just thinking about all those moving parts here? ","Marty Chavez","So, in that $50 million component of the $300 million year-on-year increase in non-comps, the $50 million that\u2019s related to the change in accounting standards. I would say there is just some very modest conservatism in there and I would call it $230 million effect once you analyze it. And so, of course, we take it into account in all the scenarios that I mentioned, when we set our estimate at 41% for the comp ratio, that\u2019s in there. ","Ultimately, as we go through the year and the results become clear, and we look at non-compensation, compensation and operating expenses, both of them together as operating expenses, a super important consideration for us always is delivering operating leverage with revenues growing meaningfully more than expenses and therefore that\u2019s playing through to the bottom-line increasing even more than revenues. ","That\u2019s all part of the mix of how we set the comp ratio. 41% is our best estimate. It includes all of these factors that we\u2019ve outlined, but ultimately, it\u2019s an output, not an input.","Devin Ryan ","Okay, got it. Fair enough. And then, maybe just, not to beat the dead horse here, but on Marcus appreciate, all the detail and kind of the tangent areas that are growing in terms of loan opportunities. But when we think about the $1 billion of \u2013 it sounds like loan growth within Marcus alone this quarter. ","Is they are adding some of these additional capabilities, it would seem that that should accelerate here, because I know that there is $12 billion of balance sheet tied to Marcus in the growth plan. So I am assuming that potentially there is an opportunity to actually increase that, given they are already at $1 billion today. Is that reasonable?","Marty Chavez","Let\u2019s go back to one point. I think it could $1 billion loan growth in Marcus have actually in the quarter, it\u2019s $0.5 billion. ","Devin Ryan ","Okay, got it. Yes, I think you were at a little bit over $2 billion last quarter, so. Okay, missed it. ","Marty Chavez","I am sorry. Could you then repeat the rest of your question please?","Devin Ryan ","Yes, I guess, my \u2013 the premise of the question was that if you are in the ballpark of $1 billion already and we are still in early days, is there an opportunity to potentially accelerate off of that, so that would maybe put the $12 billion level within the growth target is maybe a bit low at this point?","Marty Chavez","So, in the Marcus business, as it\u2019s a new business for us, we are not in any hurry. We are not approving large numbers of applications. We could approve more, but we are choosing not to, because it\u2019s all part of this deliberate organic growth process. We are always thinking of where we are, maybe more accurately said where we might be in the credit cycle since there will be no announcements of the turn of the credit cycle or any harbingers of when it\u2019s going to turn. ","Hence taking all those into account, we are going to proceed with this methodical growth always open to revisiting it, but right now, as we look at the $12 billion balance sheet on Marcus and we look at the revenue opportunity associated with our Marcus, which, just as a reminder is the entire Marcus business not just lending, but also deposits. That remains our growth target. ","Devin Ryan ","Yes, great. Thanks, Marty. Very helpful. ","Marty Chavez","Sure. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. ","Marty Chavez","Hello, Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","How are you, Marty? A question for you. On the mark-to-market accounting that we show this quarter in the equity portfolios, can you share with us was there a cumulative mark because of the change in accounting and will we see similar \u2013 I mean, based on volatility every quarter of course, is that a kind of normal mark or was there something that was built up from prior quarters that had to be recognized and the marks will actually be lower going forward?","Marty Chavez","I know, some of the peer groups mentioned one-off effects from accounting changes. That is definitely not the case for us. Everything in that portfolio is and has been fair valued. So there was no kind of accumulation.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay. And then, second, when you guys talked about your Equities trading business, Equities Client Execution was quite strong as you've indicated and I think you highlighted that the cash and derivatives area was particularly good. ","Can you give us some color what was it within those categories that really drove it and then was it more long-only traditional accounts versus trading accounts? And then, geographically, was there any area where America is stronger than EMEA or Asia and so on?","Marty Chavez","Well, first to step back and the important context is that, the year-on-year growth in Equities Client Execution is driven by client activity. And I would \u2013 if it were possible to call out a specific area of outperformance, I\u2019d currently would do that, but actually I\u2019d prefer it like it is, which is that it\u2019s quite balanced across cash and derivatives and flow and structured and all the regions including prime. ","It\u2019s across the client segments of asset managers and corporations. The traditional clients, and newer clients, it was absolutely everything all of the parts of the business working together and really a good evidence that all of these businesses in this kind of environment all work together synergistically. So, it was across the board. ","Gerard Cassidy","And being in across the board, would you say that \u2013 or I don't know if you could break it out this way, what percentage of it was really market-driven meaning that volatility you identified particularly in February versus your guys' efforts of working twice as hard to get more engagement? Can you break it out that way or is that not really that easy to do?","Marty Chavez","I wouldn\u2019t break it out that way. I would go back to something that I touched on earlier, which is that even without the vol spike, it still would have been a strong quarter. ","Gerard Cassidy","Great, thank you. ","Marty Chavez","Thank you.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks. ","Marty Chavez","Since there are no more questions, I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank everyone for joining the call. On behalf of our senior management team, we hope to see many of you in the coming months. If any additional questions arise in the meantime, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to Heather.

This call is being recorded today January 17, 2018. Thank you.","Ms. Miner, you may begin your conference. ","Heather Kennedy Miner","Good morning. This is Heather Kennedy Miner, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call.","Today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm\u2019s belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain and outside of the firm\u2019s control.

Marty?","Marty Chavez","Thanks, Heather, and thanks to everyone for dialing in this morning. Before diving into our results, let\u2019s first discuss the effect of U.S. tax reform and the potential future implications. We can then walk through our fourth quarter and 2017 performance. And finally, I\u2019m happy to answer any questions.","When you take a step back and think of the implications related to the new tax law, you can categorize them in two main buckets, direct and indirect. Let\u2019s discuss the direct impacts first.","We took a $4.4 billion onetime charge in the fourth quarter. This includes approximately $3.3 billion associated with the onetime deemed repatriation tax on foreign earnings and approximately $1.1 billion related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets. The current estimate of the DTA impact reflects further refinement of our numbers since our December announcement. Based on our current understanding of the rules, another direct consequence will be a reduction in our effective tax rate to approximately 24%.","On the indirect side of the equation, there is clearly the potential for increased business activity. Potential benefits could take many forms including heightened M&A activity, increased financing volumes, or the most important indirect benefit to our business, economic growth.","Despite the fourth quarter charge, the direct benefits from forward EPS and ROE accretion, coupled with the potential for several indirect tailwinds are material, long-term positive for shareholders.","With that out of the way, let\u2019s review our results.","Fourth quarter net revenues were $7.8 billion, net earnings including the one-time tax charge were a loss of $1.9 billion and EPS was a negative $5.51. Excluding the one-time tax charge, fourth quarter net earnings were $2.5 billion and EPS was $5.68.","With respect to our 2017 full year reported results, we had firm-wide net revenues of $32.1 billion, up 5% versus 2016. Including the one-time tax charge, net earnings were $4.3 billion and EPS was $9.01. Excluding the charge, we had net earnings of $8.7 billion, up 17% year-over-year; earnings per share of $19.76, up 21%. Our return on average common equity was 10.8%, and we grew book value per share by 5% year-over-year.","We were able to post these strong results despite the industry-wide headwinds, facing one of our businesses, FICC, and despite continued investments in future revenue opportunities that has not yet contributed meaningfully to earnings. Once again, solid performance against that backdrop.","The environment in 2017 turned out to be mixed. Continued strength in global equity and credit markets coincided with lower levels of market volatility and client trading activity. And with these headwinds, we concentrated on serving our clients, rolling out our growth initiatives, and investing to drive our business forward.","Three of our four business segments including Investment Banking, Investment Management, and Investing & Lending produced solid net revenue growth and led to an overall increase in the firm\u2019s revenues. Conversely, in Institutional Client Services and FICC in particular, revenues declined as the business continued to operate in a low volatility, low activity environment. Our solid overall performance in 2017 demonstrates the value of our diversified business model and the strength of our client franchise. And as I will talk about later, we are making significant engineering investments to further expand our client franchise, grow revenues, and transform the long-term earnings profile of the firm.","With that as background, let\u2019s discuss the individual businesses in detail.","In the fourth quarter, Investment Banking produced net revenues of $2.1 billion, 19% higher than the third quarter, as a significant pickup in underwriting more than offset a decline in M&A. Advisory revenues were $772 million. The 15% decline relative to the third quarter reflects a decrease in the number of completed M&A transactions. Nonetheless, we advised on over 75 transactions that closed during the fourth quarter, representing approximately $120 billion of deal volume. We also participated in announced transactions totaling $450 billion, a pace that more than doubled third quarter volumes.","Moving to underwriting, net revenues were $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up 55% sequentially as equity issuance improved and we participated in numerous large transactions around the world. Equity underwriting net revenues of $460 million more than doubled compared to the third quarter, driven by an increase in follow-on offerings including our role as sole arranger into Toshiba\u2019s \u00a5600 billion private placement. Debt underwriting net revenues increased 35% to $909 million and included significant contributions from leveraged finance activity. It\u2019s worth spending a moment on our debt underwriting franchise which we have built into a nearly $3 billion business. This is more than double our average revenue run rate from 2009 to 2011. This growth happened despite our smaller lending footprint because we identified it as a strategic priority where we saw an opportunity to grow share, invested continuously over a number of years and executed relentlessly for the benefit of our clients and shareholders.","For the full year, Investment Banking net revenues were $7.4 billion, up 18% from 2016 on increases in both financial advisory and underwriting. Results included a 40% increase in equity underwriting and record debt underwriting revenues which rose 20%.","Our Investment Banking franchise remains very well-positioned and continues to grow. For the full year 2017, Investment Banking generated its second highest annual revenues since our IPO. This strong performance reflects our continued focus on building long-term client relationships and our ongoing investment in talent and capabilities. We ended 2017 ranked first in both global announced and completed M&A and held the number one position in global equity underwriting. Additionally, we have a leading position in leveraged finance where we have picked up market share over the last several years by successfully integrating our strategic advisory capabilities with our capital markets and market-making franchises.","Looking forward, our Investment Banking backlog increased versus the third quarter, driven by announced M&A volumes. It was also higher compared to a relatively solid level at the end of 2016. The new tax legislation in the U.S. has brought significant clarity for corporations, and as a result, our level of dialogue with clients has increased across a range of strategic and financial issues.","Turning to Institutional Client Services. Net revenues were $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter, down 24% compared to the third quarter amid lower volumes in a variety of markets and continued low volatility. For the full year, ICS generated $11.9 billion of net revenues, down 18% compared to 2016, also driven by lower volatility in client activity and a particularly challenging backdrop for our commodities franchise. FICC client execution net revenues were $1 billion in the fourth quarter, down significantly versus the third quarter, reflecting a continued challenging operating environment. We saw lower sequential performance across four of our five fixed income businesses. Commodities improved versus the difficult third quarter, reflecting our risk mitigation efforts. Currencies and rates both declined amid a backdrop of volatility and currencies included a weaker emerging markets performance.","Credit and mortgages also saw weaker results in this environment. For the full year, FICC client execution net revenues were $5.3 billion, translating into a 30% year-over-year decline. Most of our businesses were impacted by low volatility across global markets, which affected client activity. For example, during the year, we saw historically low volatility levels in U.S. and European interest rates, and volatility in G10 currencies hovered near post-crisis lows. We also saw tighter bid ask spreads across various products. Low levels of volatility also had a disproportionate effect on us given our active investor oriented client base. During the course of the year, we saw lower levels of derivative activity and fewer large transactions which historically have been areas of strength.","Looking specifically at our FICC performance of the year. Commodities was the largest single driver of our year-over-year decline, representing more than one-third of the delta amid inventory challenges and muted client activity. Across the rest of our macro franchise, currencies and rates were also significantly lower compared to a year ago. A variety of factors including reduced volatility and lower client activity which particularly affected G10 currencies contributed to the decline.","Credit also decreased significantly amid relatively low client activity and declines in our U.S. high yield and distressed businesses. Mortgages, although a smaller business, increased significantly versus last year, reflecting improved performance in commercial and residential mortgages. Needless to say, we are highly engaged in improving our performance in FICC through our strategic initiatives. We are broadening our client and product footprint, and deepening our relationships to drive higher rankings and market share with key client groups. Client feedback has been positive. And we believe as we continue to improve our connectivity with clients, we can drive meaningfully better performance going forward.","In equities, net revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.4 billion, down 18% sequentially. Relative to the third quarter, equities client execution net revenues were down significantly on lower results in both cash and derivatives. ECE performance was partially offset by higher commissions and fees and the slight increase in security services. As it relates to fourth quarter equities client execution results, clearly not a strong quarter. However, quarterly performance will fluctuate as this business requires capital commitment to support our client franchise. Over time, these activities have been a consistent contributor to our equities franchise, comprising 30% to 40% of total equities revenues over the past five years.","For the full year, equities produced net revenues of $6.6 billion, down 4% year-over-year. Despite very favorable trends for equity prices during the year, U.S. cash volumes fell by double digits, while equity market volatility fell to new lows. For the year, equities client execution net revenues were $2 billion, down 7%, driven by lower derivatives performance. Roughly two thirds of the annual decline relates to our on-exchange, single stock options business in the U.S., which we exited in the fourth quarter. Commissions and fees were $2.9 billion for the year, down only 5%, which outperformed the decline in U.S. cash volumes. Lastly, securities services generated relatively stable net revenues of $1.6 billion as higher client balances were offset by a mix shift in short covering to more liquid securities.","Turning to risk, average daily VaR in the fourth quarter was $54 million, up from $47 million in the third quarter, driven primarily by increased exposures associated with our equities franchise.","Moving on to our Investing & Lending segment. Collectively, these activities produced net revenues of $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $1.2 billion, reflecting corporate performance as well as sales and gains in public equity investments. Approximately two-thirds of our performance was from mark-to-market on public securities and events such as sales in our private portfolio.","Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $449 million, which was largely driven by net interest income of roughly $500 million. Results included an impairment of approximately $130 million on a secured loan related to Steinhoff. Our Investing & Lending balance sheet ended the quarter at $120 billion, up 4% or $4 billion versus last quarter, driven by continued growth and real estate, private wealth and consumer loans. Life to date, as of year-end, we originated approximately $2.3 billion of Marcus unsecured consumer loans and grew our online deposits by over $5 billion last year.","In the fourth quarter, we also consolidated our online lending and deposit platforms under the Marcus brand. Feedback on lending and deposit products has been positive as we have been able to deliver real value to customers by offering simple and transparent products with the great user experience. We plan to build on this momentum in 2018, while remaining disciplined in our underwriting standard, focused on lending to creditworthy customers.","For the full year, Investing & Lending generated net revenues of $6.6 billion, driven by $4.6 billion in gains from equity securities and $2 billion of net revenues from debt securities and loans. Within equity securities, $3.8 billion was related to private investments and approximately $800 million was related to public investments. Our net interest income within debt securities was approximately $1.8 billion for the year.","Let me take a moment on the long-term contribution of our I&L segment. Equity investing is a capability that uniquely positions us in financial services and differentiates the firm in the eyes of our clients. It also has significantly contributed to book value per share growth and return through the cycle. With respect to debt I&L, the recent expansion of our lending activities positions the firm with $2 billion of run rate net interest income as we start 2018. In addition to driving revenue growth, increased lending has not only deepened our relationships with existing clients, it has also enabled us to establish new ones. We are confident that these efforts will continue to drive the growth of our client franchise and earnings.","In Investment Management, we produced fourth quarter net revenues of $1.7 billion, our second best quarterly performance. This was up 9% from the third quarter, primarily on solid growth in management and other fees, which were record despite broader industry headwinds. For 2017, Investment Management net revenues were a record $6.2 billion, up 7% year-over-year, largely driven by growth in management and other fees on higher assets. Assets under supervision finished the year at a record $1.5 trillion, up $115 billion versus year end 2016 driven by $42 billion of long-term net inflows driven by fixed income and alternative products, $13 billion of liquidity product outflows and $86 billion of market appreciation. During the fourth quarter, AUS increased $38 billion, primarily driven by $17 billion of net inflows into liquidity products and $22 billion of market appreciation.","Now, let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior equity awards and other items such benefits was up 2% for 2017, which was 300 basis points lower than the increase in net revenues. This translated into a compensation-to-net revenues ratio of 37%, down 110 basis points versus 2016.","Fourth quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.6 billion. The increase versus the third quarter was driven primarily by a $127 million donation to Goldman Sachs Gives, our donor-advised charitable fund, higher expenses related to consolidated investments and higher consulting fees. For the full year, non-compensation expenses rose 5%, largely driven by our investments to fund growth, partly offset by lower litigation expense.","There were three main drivers of the increase which were fairly balanced contributors. The first driver relates to our investment in Marcus; second, were expenses associated with investments that need to be consolidated in our balance sheet for accounting purposes; and third, were higher technology and consulting costs to support both regulatory implementation efforts and our ongoing focus on improving efficiency and scale throughout our businesses.","Underpinning our growth initiatives, we continue to make significant investments in engineering, which are critical to driving the expansion of our franchise. The two goals of our engineering strategy are two, enhance the client experience and drive revenue opportunities; and improve operating efficiency and scale.","On the client side, we are exploring and embracing innovative solutions to evolve and transform our business model using machine learning, data analytics, APIs, cloud services and open-source to deliver new services. These investments will allow us to leverage our intellectual capital in more impactful ways, to evolve and be a disruptor in new and existing markets and will affect all of our businesses.","From an efficiency perspective, we are automating processes and analyzing workflows, particularly in our market-making businesses. There are significant opportunities to operate more efficiently across the firm.","Moving on to taxes, our underlying tax rate for 2017 was 28.4% excluding the impact from tax legislation and employee equity compensation accounting. Our reported effective tax rate for the year was 61.5% including the $4.4 billion tax charge, which was partially offset by a $719 million benefit related to employee equity compensation. Our fourth quarter tax rate reflected $223 million of this benefit, primarily from the delivery of certain prior year equity awards in December. For the first quarter of 2018, assuming current stock price levels, we estimate the equity compensation related accounting benefit will be approximately $175 million.","Turning to balance sheet, liquidity and capital. Our global core liquid assets averaged $221 billion during the fourth quarter. Our balance sheet was $917 billion, down slightly versus last quarter. On a fully phased in basis, our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 11.9% using the standardized approach and 10.7% under the Basel III Advanced approach, down a 110 basis points and 100 basis points respectively versus the third quarter. Approximately 70 basis points of the decline was related to the onetime tax charge with the remainder of the change related primarily to continued growth in lending. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 5.8%.","In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 6.6 million shares of common stock for $1.6 billion. For the full year, we repurchased $6.7 billion at an average purchase price of roughly $232 per share. As a result, we reduced our basic share count by approximately 26 million shares for the year, reaching a new record low. In addition, we paid out approximately $1.2 billion of common dividends over the course of the year. In total, we returned nearly $8 billion of capital to shareholders in 2017. As we look forward to 2018, given the positive backdrop for investing further in our franchise and the impact of tax legislation on our capital ratios, we do not expect to use all of our 2017 CCAR cycle authorization.","Over the past three years, our share buybacks have been approximately $5 billion to $6 billion per annual CCAR cycle. We believe this is a fair expectation over the medium term subject to a variety of factors. However, given the capital impact from tax legislation, we do not expect to buyback at that pace in the first half of 2018.","Before taking questions, a few closing thoughts. We enter 2018 well-positioned for growth. We are working intensely to achieve our $5 billion in strategic growth initiatives with an emphasis on growing earnings and returns. We remain committed to growing our global client franchise and have received positive feedback on our early progress. To do that, we continue to invest in our franchise, to broaden and improve our client capabilities through technology, talent and by our willingness to explore new disruptive opportunities.","Finally, there are also a number of positive tailwinds that could drive greater client engagements and a more expansive opportunity set. We start 2018 with renewed optimism for accelerating growth in the U.S. and abroad. Higher interest rates and more active central banks often correlate with higher client activity. And as I mentioned previously, the recent change in U.S. tax law is driving increased client dialogue in investment banking and across the broader client franchise which could stimulate increased confidence and activity.","With that, thanks again for dialing in and we\u2019ll now open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Glenn Schorr","Good morning. So, in the past, better DCM revenues eventually led to better secondary revenue, and I heard all the comments on this really low vol in just about every asset class. But, I\u2019m curious if there is any component that it\u2019s a lot of leveraged finance or there is a lot of money going into bond funds just buying every new issue and putting it away. It feels like the whole dynamic has changed as we sit here and wait for vol to pick up. But it seems like revenues have fallen more than even the drop in vol.","Marty Chavez","So, Glenn, are you asking more about our debt underwriting business or about our FICC client execution business?","Glenn Schorr","I appreciate that, fair enough. It\u2019s a little bit of a combination of both. I am asking about the geography and the main contributor to the pick-up in DCM and why there is not a follow through in FICC as there was in the past?","Marty Chavez","Well, clearly Glenn, we agree with you that better DCM revenues can result in better secondary revenues in FICC client execution over time. But to talk a bit more about our debt underwriting business, as we said, record in many ways, not only league tables, also revenues full year on the quarter. So there are many things going on in there. There is trends in rates, spreads and vol, those are all -- plus M&A of course, all driving demand for issuance. And as you know, overall financing costs, even with the rate increases are still low historically. Really, the key to our debt underwriting business over time and in this quarter has been the alignment with acquisition finance and our M&A franchise broadly including our relationship with financial sponsors. And that\u2019s really something, as I mentioned that we identified as a priority a few years ago as our core strength versus lending, which might have been part of the strategy for others. And so by aligning with the M&A franchise and focusing on it quarter-after-quarter, we got to this point. And that\u2019s really what differentiates our debt underwriting business compared to others. But to get back to the other part of your question, the pull through for trading requires a bunch of things, increased volatility, client activity, market events, central bank actions, all of those things could be drivers for greater activity in secondary.","Glenn Schorr","Maybe just a one follow-up. In equity and I&L, I could be wrong. So, please correct me if I\u2019m wrong. But, I don\u2019t feel like you\u2019ve made lots of new investments for years on the equity side, but still seems like you have you own a ton of private equity. And in the world we live in, it seems like there has been lots of opportunity exit. Is this just the market going up or is there more of like annuity stream there? I like the $2 billion on the debt side that you told us about, but could you give a little more detail about the private side on the equity?","Marty Chavez","Yes. Well, the equity I&L represents a diversified global portfolio. It\u2019s diversified across sectors and geographies; it\u2019s diversified across corporate, private equity and real estate. And we called out the driver which is gains in corporate performance and events. There is a public component of that portfolio, and we\u2019ll be saying more in the upcoming 10-K on the breakdown there. Really, I think it\u2019s important to observe that the 2017 revenues are driven by several hundred investments, not any one particular investment. And really what\u2019s distinctive about this franchise is that the sourcing capabilities are driven by a global network. And it\u2019s really that which creates a portfolio that has its own behavior and generally rising markets are helpful but it\u2019s not indexed in any way.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Michael Carrier","Maybe just first question. Historically, Goldman has been able to achieve a premium ROE versus peers. You guys always noted that in the past. That said, peer ROEs are set to rise on whether it\u2019s business mix, more exposure to rates and tax benefits. You guys had a $5 billion growth initiative. But other areas of the business like trading continue to see headwinds. And this year alone FICC raised about half of that $5 billion benefit. So, I guess, just how confident are you over a multiyear period? Are you going to sustain that premium and improving ROE? And if trading remains weak, do you need to do more strategically, whether it\u2019s on business mix or capital on cost allocation into the business?","Marty Chavez","Well, first, of course, we have this track record of generating ROEs at or near the top of the peer group over the last several years. And the key there is not any one business; it\u2019s the diversity across our segment. And three of the four segments are up, as you know. And several of them had, really there is no other way to describe it other than the stellar performance. And so, we\u2019re always looking at our business mix; we\u2019re always looking at growth initiatives. We\u2019ve had them for years. For instance, debt underwriting is one that we identified, as I mentioned and we executed on. Really what\u2019s different in the growth initiatives that we shared with the market was we externalized that. So, that you will hold us accountable and we will hold ourselves accountable and it\u2019s galvanizing focus and attention over time.","Now, when we look at FICC, we\u2019re always looking at optimizing every aspect of the business; capital allocation, expenses, the efficiency of the business. Generally, when we outline the growth initiatives, we said they do not depend on any change in the market environment. Where the market backdrop which as you know is challenging across the industry to deteriorate, of course, we would revisit all of those aspects of the business.","Michael Carrier","Okay, it\u2019s helpful. And just as a follow-up, you mentioned on the lower tax rate, potentially you see more activity. Just how are you guys thinking about your lower tax rate in terms of either reinvesting in the business, so basically like the expense outlook, as you look into 2018 or 2019 or how much will it drop to the bottom-line? And then, I guess, just from a competitive standpoint, do you expect a lot of the tax benefit to be passed on to clients just given competitive pressures?","Marty Chavez","Well, so, I\u2019ll start by walking through our estimated, the go forward tax rate first off, which is a long-term effective tax rate 24%; that\u2019s just starting with the 21% new U.S. corporate tax rate, adding 2 points for state and local, adding 1 point for international impacts and all other effects [indiscernible] and so on. And we see in there, benefits, both ROE as well as EPS accretion in the high-single-digit percentage range. Now, as the next few years play forward, we don\u2019t know exactly how the competitive dynamics are going to evolve. But of course, we\u2019re looking to share those benefits across our shareholders, our clients and our people. And it\u2019s going to dependent, it\u2019s going to vary by business, but especially on competitive dynamics. But again, for us, I\u2019ll just say, the main effect that we see that the direct effect is driving earnings growth and ROE over time.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O\u2019Connor","I want to follow up on the buyback comment. So, I guess first, do you care to kind of better box or more tightly box the buyback expectations for the first half of the year versus just less than the 5 billion to 6 billion annual medium-term target?","Marty Chavez","I am sorry, Matt. I couldn\u2019t hear the middle part of your question. Could you repeat that please?","Matt O\u2019Connor","Sorry. Just on the share buybacks, I think you have said the medium-term outlook is for 5 billion to 6 billion annually, but as the pace in the first half would be less than that. And I was just wonder, if you want to give any more clarity on the amount that you\u2019re looking for on buybacks for the first half of this year and do you want to tighten up that range?","Marty Chavez","So, as you know, Matt, there are so many factors that drive the buyback. There is our earnings profile and then of course over time there is the next CCAR cycle and the evolution of the test, which has many puts and takes in it, but especially depending on severity of the macro shock. And so, given all of that, we\u2019re not going to further break out the term structure of the buybacks, other than to say that $5 billion to $6 billion is the range over the medium term, which is very similar to our buyback in the past few years. There was 4.2 billion and 6 billion and 6.7 billion last year. So, 5 billion to 6 billion is the expectation.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay. And then, just in terms of committing more capital to growing the business, when you outlined the 5 billion initiatives back in September, I think you talked about some additional capital being committed to that. Is there any acceleration in that process? I did notice that the loan limits on Marcus I think were meaningfully increased, if I read correctly, the 40,000. Is there any kind of acceleration or front-ending of some of that capital commitment, as you think about growing out the -- those 5 billion of revenue initiatives?","Marty Chavez","So, the capital that we underlined in the growth plan remains part of our long-term plan. And as for acceleration, no, we\u2019re operating according to the plan and it\u2019s evolving, though of course we\u2019re in the early stages. I would just say as it relates all of those growth initiatives, we\u2019ve got extensive dashboards. I love dashboards and those are going be metrics of all kinds, including the capital because of course we\u2019re changing from a -- where we\u2019ve been in the past few years. Now, we see these opportunities for growth, high marginal ROEs and of course we prefer all day to invest in these opportunities that are in our business compared to buying back our stock above book value. But, no particular acceleration in the capital plan but it\u2019s all baked into the plan.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Jeff Harte with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.","Jeff Harte","Good morning, Marty. A couple for me. One, it\u2019s not hard to envision a more favorable operating environment in 2018 versus 2017. Can you give us any kind of updates on how quarter-to-date trends are progressing? I know, it\u2019s kind of early but I mean do you get the feeling seasonality is showing up?","Marty Chavez","Well, Jeff, it is most definitely very early and 10 days into the quarter. And so, I would not extrapolate anything. But, I would say, market conditions can change and turn rapidly, and they have. And it\u2019s been a strong start to the year. Definitely, if you ask me this time last year, this time this year, I take this time this year all day. But again, no one, not you, not us especially would extrapolate anything from what we\u2019ve seen in just 10 days.","Jeff Harte","Okay. And secondly, on the commodities business, can you give us a little historical perspective, I suppose on Goldman\u2019s commodities business? I mean, it\u2019s been a tough year. But, I guess, I am trying to get a feel for kind of the frequency of tough years historically versus other FICC businesses. And also, what we should be watching from the outside to maybe get indication things are getting better? It doesn\u2019t necessarily seem like exchange volumes and oil volatility are as useful as it used be.","Marty Chavez","Well, Jeff, on historical perspective, I am definitely feeling my age since I grew up in that business. So, I could go on at too greater length on the historical perspective in the business. But, what I will say about it is some things are exactly the same, many things in the commodity business as they were when I was growing up in the early 90s, which is exchange volumes are an important part of the business, they are not all of the business. Some have said erroneously in our view in the past that there was an opposition between over the counter and exchange. Actually, we\u2019ve always seen exchange volumes and liquidity on exchange as potentiating the ability to provide liquidity and hedging solutions to clients over the counter. And so, those two businesses can be in a virtuous cycle and often are.","The other thing about the commodity business that being in it teaches you is that maybe some other businesses will have very long term trends including trends that continue for decades, and that is rarely the case in the commodities business. I remember when I was in that business and people would ask me, well, you are the quant in the business, and so, what do you think about the outlook for oil prices. I would say accurately but perhaps not all that helpfully, 50% chance they go up and 50% chance they would go down. And so, the business is not predicated on any -- on directions and the view, it\u2019s really -- it begins and ends with the clients. The clients want to buy, we sell; they want to sell, we buy. It\u2019s intermediating all along the value chain from producers to refiners to consumers in all kinds of different product formats, which could be physical, futures, systematic trading strategies, derivatives. And so, what I will say, just to end is that the commodities environment was tough across the board. And for us, as you know, we have a bigger footprint in our commodities business as a part of our FICC franchise compared to others.","And then, we\u2019ll also note as I mentioned last quarter to you, we made significant progress in reducing risk in the business, risk that we acquired on the back of facilitating what the clients wanted to do. And those inventory headwinds which were a challenge throughout the year for second and third quarter, subsided meaningfully in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Mike Mayo","Hi. Well, I\u2019m torn between the Investment Banking results versus the trading results. And I think I\u2019ve heard you say that you\u2019d like to do more trading with corporate clients where you\u2019re -- it\u2019s kind of a mix issue when it comes to the trading results, Goldman versus peers. So, what I\u2019m trying to figure out is if you\u2019re so strong in investment banking and advisory in particular that implies that Goldman has some of the best relationships with corporate CEOs on the planet. In other words you have great relationship with the CEOs, the boards of directors, the people on top of the house. So, why can\u2019t you do more business trading with those, so much further down from the top of the house?","Marty Chavez","Well, it is the key question. And as you know, in our growth plans that we\u2019ve been talking about, there is a component of the $5 billion annual revenue opportunity developing over the next three years, a $250 million component, which is expanding our corporate franchise in both foreign exchange and commodities. This is something that actually isn\u2019t brand new for us; it\u2019s something that growing up in the business, I was at the intersection of those two businesses and worked in both, at various points in my career with the firm. And what you will notice and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware, is that the different parts of our corporate clients are accountable for different parts of the business. And so, depending on the client, this actually changes greatly depending on the kind of corporate client. Just speaking about the commodity sector, it depends a lot whether you\u2019re talking with exploration and production, companies or diversified companies, or mid-stream; who is owning the hedging strategy for the company can vary greatly and it can go all the way from CFO to treasurer to assistant treasurer or sometimes it\u2019s on the procurement side.","And so, translating these top-flight relationships that we have with CEOs across the -- deep inside the corporations to all the parts of them that are executing various kinds of business, not just the capital markets products and the M&A product but all of the products of the firm is work and effort and we see it as a huge opportunity to leverage our banking franchise to drive this kind of corporate business. And having embedded the market-making talent in the banking business more deeply than we ever have in the past, we\u2019re already seeing the benefits; we\u2019re already seeing mandates start to arise from that deeper integration. But still and all, having seen all of these significant declines in FICC, we still -- because of diversification, because of for instance our M&A franchise, we still have one of the highest ROEs in the industry.","Mike Mayo","Right, but specifically on trading, it just seems like progress would have been a lot faster than it\u2019s been. In other words, it\u2019s not new news that you\u2019re underpenetrated to the corporate. What are you guys saying to employees internally, what are you saying in terms of intensity? Do you think you succeeded? Would you say so far your score card -- and I know it\u2019s only September since you came out with strategic growth initiatives but this isn\u2019t really new news; it predates the September presentation. How do you think you\u2019re doing in terms of penetrating deeper within your corporate clients, through the CFO, treasurer, procurement and the other people you mentioned?","Marty Chavez","Well, to step back, we\u2019re making progress on all of the growth initiatives that we outlined, deploying balance sheet, growing deposits, AUS, hiring employees into FICC, improving market share in FICC and equities, and specifically increasing the mandates from this joint venture between investment banking and trading. And we are seeing according to all these metrics that we\u2019re making progress on the initiatives on all of the initiatives. Now, it\u2019s early days and of course, we\u2019ll be having many conversations with you and everyone in the market and certainly internally. We just came out with some internal discussions with our global managing directors where everybody knows that we\u2019re holding them accountable and you all are holding us accountable, and that breaks down a lot of detail, accountability matrices everywhere. And also, one thing that we know from having seen the cycles many times is that when we start making this progress in market share, it actually needs a better activity environment for the penetration to flow through to revenues.","Mike Mayo","And then, last follow-up. What\u2019s the time from getting additional mandates to actually seeing the improvement in the trading?","Marty Chavez","Well, the mandate timeframe is -- its order of months, quarters, it depends on deal flow, and all kinds of drivers. Again, activity which -- activity is the main one. Client activity is the main predictor of our results. And we\u2019re not just given a particular client mix or business footprint, we absolutely acknowledge that the business footprint and mix we have is consequence of choices that we made over time. And we know that we need to do better. But again, for all this to flow through to revenues and for those mandates to turn into printed revenues, we need activity.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Betsy Graseck","I have just a slightly different way of asking that question, but on your outlook where you gave your three-year forward revenue potential growth initiatives. I know that part of that came with allocating more headcount to various groups, more headcount to FICC and more headcount to banking. Could you just give us a sense of how much that resource allocation is already done and how much is still left to go in the FICC bucket and the IB bucket and the financing bucket?","Marty Chavez","So, we have had hiring in FICC, net hiring. And as we\u2019ve mentioned, our lateral hiring rate is up significantly, it doubled from prior year levels. But really net, there is very little effect in headcounts. Where we have made some of these hiring investments particularly is in engineering. That is a leading part of our strategy as we\u2019re executing on these growth initiatives, not only the super important detail of having the metrics and dashboards for all of it, but just not just extending our current workflows, but redesigning them, building them with digital channels in addition to the historic voice channel. This is a big part of it. And so, as we mentioned, you\u2019ve begun to see some of this. I\u2019m not going to break out headcounts, because really it makes more sense to see it holistically.","So, for instance, as we build out some of these platforms and we\u2019re investing for growth, in many cases, we\u2019re capitalizing the development of that software. And then, once we place it in service, we\u2019re going to be depreciating expense. Over the course of three years, you\u2019ve begun to see some of that flow through into our non-comp line for various initiatives, not just the multiple regulatory initiatives that we had last year, whether it\u2019s MiFID II, initial margin implementation resolution, but also just digitizing our platform generally. And so, really, you have to look at it across all the lines of the business. And actually even though compensation ratio is down 110 basis points 2017 versus 2016, as we mentioned, there is some slight upward pressure on the comp ratio as we\u2019ve made these hiring decisions and people have come on-board. You\u2019ve seen many of the announcements. We\u2019ve hired some very senior people, some -- several partners and we\u2019re extremely excited about their joining us and what they\u2019ve already brought to us in the short time. And so that is a little bit of upward pressure on the comp ratio.","But, I would end by saying specifically in banking, we\u2019ve talked about our reach -- our strategy generally, our coverage strategy, which not only has us covering bankers, covering clients in different sectors by bringing on-board coverage people who specialize in those sectors, but also regional. And so in Atlanta, Dallas, Toronto, Seattle, other cities, we\u2019ve hired senior bankers to improve our coverage of mid-sized corporates and all of those activities are off to a good start.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. So, what I\u2019m hearing is, you\u2019re largely -- you\u2019ve got the resources in place to execute on the plan?","Marty Chavez","Yes, we do.","Betsy Graseck","And then, second question, just on earnings disclosure. I know, a lot of other folks put the loans into fixed line. And I\u2019m just wondering, is there any thought to either changing your disclosing, the I&L versus the FICC or integrate in a way that can be more apples to apples to how the rest of the Street discloses?","Marty Chavez","So Betsy, we\u2019re always working on our discloser. It\u2019s something that I\u2019m especially focused on and working with team on. And you\u2019re beginning to see bits of that, early days of course. We, for instance, broke out the geographic distribution of revenues, gave you a bit more on the balance sheet, there is a ways to go, of course. And for instance, in HFI loan growth, what you\u2019ve seen, we\u2019ve talked about HFI loan growth going from 60 -- it\u2019s growing up by $4 billion to 66 overall. And in our upcoming 10-K, we\u2019re going to be breaking that down further for you and going into all of the drivers quarter-on-quarter. So there is that. But of course, anything that we can do to have more comparability, it\u2019s valuable to us; we know it\u2019s value to you; and we know that you\u2019re focused on it and we are too. So, it\u2019s work in progress.","Betsy Graseck","And then, just lastly on the buyback for 1H 2018. I get the point that it\u2019s a bit of a moving target. What I got from the earlier conversation was largely based on how the CCAR test comes out, is that a fair takeaway? And if so, if the CCAR test global shock in particular was similar to last year, does that -- can you give us a sense as to what kind of buybacks you\u2019d have in that scenario?","Marty Chavez","So, Betsy, I wouldn\u2019t want to predict how CCAR is going to evolve. There is, as you know, many inputs and complexities to it. And of course, we are constantly engaged with the fed in understanding how they are thinking about all aspects of it, how they\u2019re going to treat DTAs for instance relating to tax reform and the remeasurement of them, how they are going to treat the new provisions for NOL. All of these are complex moving parts. But of course, the biggest driver is ultimately the severity of the test and the macro shock, and that\u2019s with the fed, and we\u2019ll receive it. And so, I don\u2019t think it makes any sense to speculate on how the test is, except to say that we understand it, we put a lot of work into implementing it and having an extraordinary and robust firm-wide process for running the test and understanding how it affects all parts of our business.","I would just say that -- we\u2019ve got this one-time effect of tax legislation. We outlined for you a roughly 70 basis-point reduction in the capital ratios related to that. Having strong capital position to deploy for our clients and wherever we see opportunities is a crucial part of our strategy. And so, that\u2019s why we are thinking about the pace that we outlined for you, $5 billion to $6 billion, similar to what we\u2019ve done in the past few years. And also, given the one-time effect of tax legislation that we just went through our financials in the fourth quarter, thought the actual payments happen over eight years, we are going to be focused on having those capital ratios be robust in the next few quarters.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.","Brennan Hawken","So, first, just a couple questions on trying to figure out what\u2019s one-time and not. You guys had a loss -- you highlighted a loss on I&L tied to a secured loan. Was that related to Steinhoff and was there any other impact to Steinhoff in any other of the trading lines? And can you talk about how much of the 4Q we should think about as one-time and therefore what\u2019s the right jumping off point? Because ex legal, it was pretty substantially above where you\u2019ve been running. So, just trying to unpack some of that commentary?","Marty Chavez","Sure, Brennan. So, in the prepared part, wanted to just come right, I mentioned that we took a $130 million loss on a single structured loan and that was Steinhoff. And I know one of the -- well, let\u2019s compare and contrast. So, we took full mark on that position. And it\u2019s very public who participated in that loan and at what levels. And we presented that loss in debt I&L; others have presented it in slightly different places. And as for the second part of your question, do we have other exposures in and around Steinhoff, the answer is no.","Brennan Hawken","And then, as far as non-comp expense goes, it was a pretty elevated level. I know you made some reference to investments that you guys are making, but it also seems -- I know, you laid out $127 million donation, so obviously that\u2019s one-time. It seems like there is some accelerated depreciation and what have you. Is there -- are we better off looking at 3Q as the jumping off point for non-comp or is some of the uplift quarter-over-quarter reflective of investment and what have you? Just trying to think about what the right jump off point is?","Marty Chavez","Sure, Brennan. So, the -- of course, as you identified, we made the traditional fourth quarter allocation to Goldman Sachs Gives and so that is a very big part of the sequential comparison. But rather than look at third quarter or fourth quarter, much more relevant for your analysis and for the way we\u2019re thinking about the business to look at full year. And so, full year, it\u2019s up 5%, in line with the revenue growth and that was all deliberate. This is something that we look at every day and every week, of course. And it\u2019s importantly the annual increase is driven by investments to fund the growth plan that we outlined for you. And so, I\u2019ll break it down this way and say that the growth, the full year on full year growth was really balanced across these three areas.","So, the first is investments in Marcus, something that we\u2019ve talked a fair bit about, huge and important and exciting area of growth for us and one of the pillars of our growth plan. And then second part of the year-on-year growth in non-comp was consolidated investment entity expenses. So, as we make investments, some of them for accounting purposes, need to be consolidated on our balance sheet. And so, you\u2019ll see their expenses show up there. And then, the third part is on technology and consulting. We\u2019ve always had an overweight to engineering, as you know, and building software. And that\u2019s served us in great stead over many, many decades and we continue to do that. The way in which we make those investments is evolving. We now have a large emphasis on using and especially participating in and contributing to and creating open source. And so, the nature of it has changed. But yes, there is a -- in that growth year-on-year, there is supporting regulatory implementation. Some of those activities are behind us such as initial margin, no parts of it continue. MiFID II, the big bang on MiFID II go live has already happened, as you know, but there is ongoing work. Really across the firm, there is investments in technology to improve efficiency and scale. And also in that line, there is more software and service. So, as I mentioned briefly, we build the software, capitalize some of the expense and then as it gets deployed, we\u2019re depreciating it ratably over three years. And so you\u2019re seeing in that line some of those effect as well. And it\u2019s something that we expect and embrace and we\u2019re investing for growth and pivoting to executing on the growth plan and delivering earnings growth that non-comp growth proceeds revenue generation. But, I can assure you that we will not lose the historic discipline that we have here on cost management.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Guy Moszkowski","I just wanted to follow up on expenses and in particular the comp ratio. As you\u2019ve pointed out, you showed a lot of discipline in getting the comp ratio down by a little bit over a percent, despite the investments that you\u2019re making. And I was just wondering should we expect that that could keep going in say a 5% revenue growth environment like what you had last year, should we expect that the comp ratio would come down again meaningfully or with the acceleration of some of the investments in the initiatives that you\u2019ve laid out. Should we expect that that improvement in the comp ratio could stall?","Marty Chavez","So, we talk about it and it\u2019s just a core part of how we operate, which is operating leverage. So, as revenues increase, of course, we want to see pretax EPS, everything increasing faster. And that is a core part of how we operate. And as we\u2019re building out on the growth initiatives, I can\u2019t emphasize enough that of course talent, our people are at the core of everything we do. Paying for performance, inspiring the best people to be here, attracting and retaining them is the core part of the strategy and also, going along with that supporting it having great engineers and leading with digital platforms and automated workflows, not just extending the current workflows. And so, of course we\u2019re investing in that. But yes, as we build out these new initiatives and these new work flows and do them in a modern way, you will continue to see operating leverage flow through.","Guy Moszkowski","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And then, just as a follow-up on some of the questions before on I&L and in particular the equity investing line. Do you have any early thoughts on the impact of Basel IV on the -- which I know is an informal term, but the changes in the Basel risk weighting on the RWAs and therefore the capital that are associated with the assets in I&L with some of these private equity investments? It seems like the potential impacts there are quite significant. ","Marty Chavez","So, I will just say, Basel III, as it continues to evolve, of course, we\u2019re close to all of those activities that happened in the back half of last year. And as you know, many of the implementation and roll out timeframes were changed and significantly the Basel committee left room for a great deal of more work on calibrations of various kinds but -- and standardizing elsewhere. And fundamental review of the trading book continues to be -- there is parts of it, the calibration that remain open and we think that that\u2019s appropriate and wise. But as to how this is all going to arise for us, I won\u2019t speculate on it until the calibrations evolve, we see how the 72.5% floor relates to the Collins but most importantly, the NPR that we\u2019ll actually implement this in the U.S.","Guy Moszkowski","So, too early to do much there?","Marty Chavez","Yes.","Guy Moszkowski","And then, just one final follow-up on the comment that you made about the consolidated entities impacting your non-personnel expense growth. Are largely all of those consolidated entities I&L investment entities or is there something else?","Marty Chavez","They\u2019re I&L entities.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead. ","Steven Chubak","Hey, Marty. So, I wanted to kick things off with a question on FICC pricing. It was something you mentioned in your prepared remarks. You noted that the tightening of the bid offer was a source of fee pressure in the quarter. And I have heard others allude to that as well. I\u2019m just wondering if you can give us some color as to what specific factors drove that contraction in spreads. I\u2019m just trying to gauge how much of that\u2019s ephemeral versus a function of maybe increased competition which may persist going forward?","Marty Chavez","Yes. So, that is one of the many important questions. We generally notice that at low levels, for instance of interest rates, but also at low level of volatility, it\u2019s -- we\u2019ll see this effect, bid offer compression. And it makes sense. So, if the clients are active, they\u2019re looking to buy and sell, then there is generally more volatility and those activities, those two phenomena can reinforce one another. But, when there isn\u2019t much movement, it makes sense that the bid offer would compress. And as for whether it\u2019s ephemeral, whether it\u2019s secular or cyclic, extremely hard to assess that. As rates break out of their range bound levels, as the tenure yields on a variety of govies start moving around, perhaps we\u2019ll have an opportunity to get more answers to that question.","But, as we say all the time and it\u2019s really how we think and act, rather than predict what\u2019s ephemeral and what\u2019s not and what\u2019s going to change and when, it\u2019s important to be prepared for all of these eventualities and to build optionality for them. So, one of the many things we\u2019re doing on this front and it\u2019s one of the topics that I mentioned when I talked about how our various engineering activities are transforming all of the businesses of the firm not confined to any one business. But there is a huge emphasis in our market-making businesses where we\u2019ve always had this kind of strat engineering activity and had an overweight to that.","And so, let\u2019s look for instance at the equity markets. Commissions over the last 18 years have declined to very small percentage of where they were and yet that business continues to thrive. And there, one of the contributors in addition to just having great talent is the automated platform that we\u2019ve built for systematic market-making and for trading out of risk in that environment where, in that case, could commissions, but could equally be bid offer spreads are reducing. This is generating better results for our clients especially and also for shareholders. Well, why confine that activity which is something that is historical strength of ours to equities. And so, we\u2019ve been bringing that to all of our FICC businesses, most obviously businesses such as foreign exchange, but not stopping at foreign exchange. And so, we formed last year a group within our securities division, our ICS business, called security systemic solutions, which is extending these approaches across all of our businesses. And really taking a consistent approach in FICC and equities, which is execution, services, capital, content, analytics, increasingly sharing that directly with clients, digitally extending it over the web and taking this platform such that we\u2019ve had for years and building it out to our clients. That\u2019s a key part of the strategy and builds optionality for variety states of the world. If the bid offer compression trends out to be ephemeral, then having done all this will make it even better. And if it turns out to be more persistent, we\u2019ll have a plan in place.","Steven Chubak","Thanks for all that color, Marty. I mean, admittedly, a lot of the debate has been around whether some of those efforts to take what you learned from the equities paradigm and apply that to more homogenous products, like FX, where there\u2019s been a great degree of success. I think there is a little bit more skepticism as to whether that success can be replicated with more heterogeneous products like corporate credit, but just curious to see whether you think that that distinction is an important one?","Marty Chavez","We have a strong view on that one. So, I think historically, you would often hear people say, well, all this works great for equities or homogeneous products. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s just FICC. But how is it going to work, when you got so many different CUSIPs, instead of just one stock CUSIP for the company, that same company might have 600 bond CUSIPs. And so, what I will note there is that equities, I\u2019m not so sure that it\u2019s all that homogeneous. When you look at small caps and when you look at the large number of listed option instruments on every strike and every tender, on every underlying and all of the different product formats that you see an equity, everything from cash to derivatives to systemic trading strategies to EPS, there is an awful lot of right in complexity in equities. And as to this factor of 600 to 1 or so on bond CUSIPs to equity CUSIPs, one thing, and this is the computer scientist in me, would just say, well that\u2019s something that Moore\u2019s law more and the doubling of compute power every 18 to 24 months compounding over decades, the computers catch up and can handle that extra complexity.","So, really, I would say to package all that up is that we\u2019ve always been a leader in our engineering, in our math and software capability. And that\u2019s an important contributor to all of our businesses that is one of the pillars together with the bankers and the traders and the sales people and everyone in the federation, all of our people. But that\u2019s something that we\u2019re going to continue to lead with and differentiate ourselves in.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.","Devin Ryan","Maybe just to come back here on FICC again. It seems like a lot of conversations and even on the call today we\u2019re talking a lot about volatility in the industry, volatility recover. But, I guess my question is should we be careful what we ask for? Because it seems that this kind of benign backdrop that we\u2019ve been in here recently has been good for other businesses. And so, how should we think about volatility and the mix of what that means for all of Goldman Sachs? Is it a way mean reversion of volatility and that\u2019s good for the whole business or is this actually environment what you\u2019re seeing the benefits of the diversification of the firm, kind of the natural head to your business? I am just trying to think about that because it comes up quite a bit.","Marty Chavez","Well, of course, it\u2019s always the right amounts of volatility and organized around trends that draw active investors in who see also generation opportunities. That\u2019s always the goldilocks scenario. And of course, we have observed and so have others that there can be a countercyclical nature to the FICC business. But really that\u2019s just another of saying if you\u2019ve got a diversified set of businesses, then, well, of course, one would love all of the businesses to all perform well. At the same time, if they all went up 18% year-on-year for instance as the banking segment did, then you -- over time you\u2019d have to ask yourself whether really all of that uncorrelated and diversified. So, volatility generally, just uncertainty, we are in that business; that is the core of our business. And you can imagine in some hypothetical state that we don\u2019t see and is extraordinarily unlikely, there was no volatility and everything just stayed the same forever. In that kind of environment, there wouldn\u2019t be much to do on any of our businesses or anyone\u2019s business really. And so, while there\u2019s always puts and takes, and it\u2019s difficult to foresee exactly how diversified and uncorrelated businesses are going to play out, in any environment that kind of uncertainty, we can engage with clients and share content and insights with them. And when they have risk they don\u2019t want or want risk that they don\u2019t have, we\u2019re there to provide. That is generally a good backdrop for all of our businesses.","Devin Ryan","Got it. Thank you. And then, a quick follow-up here. Goldman has obviously been innovator in the industry over time. And so, I am just curious how the thinking is evolved on crypto currencies as an opportunity? What the process in terms of thinking about getting into a business like that would be? And I know it\u2019s a small asset class but obviously, you talk about an area with plenty of volatility and not being over saturated yet. So, just curious, current thoughts there.","Marty Chavez","So, crypto currencies, it\u2019s so much of the moment of the zeitgeist. Last time I checked, which was last week, there were 1,300 crypto currencies, I am sure there\u2019s way more today. And so, that\u2019s just something that\u2019s happening. At the same time, also important to step back, really a million years ago when I was a grad student in computer science, this problem that\u2019s at the core crypto currencies is an old, old one. We used to call it the Byzantine Generals Problem. It\u2019s really been around for decades. And the problem is, how do you get a bunch of people who are not necessarily coordinated and not necessarily reliable and don\u2019t necessarily have great communication all to agree on shared reality. And so, what is especially interesting about Bitcoin is that someone -- there is some group of people, we don\u2019t know exactly who they were, presented a particularly elegant solution to this relatively old problem and they made a specific application of this problem. How do you agree, how do you get a bunch of people to agree on who paid what to whom. And so, that\u2019s the distributed general ledger. Really the way we\u2019re thinking about this whole area is that it\u2019s really a much bigger topic, it\u2019s really the blockchain or the distributed general ledger that is of great and very broad application potentially. And we\u2019re always talking about cloud services and APIs and open software as major drivers of innovation not just for the industry, but also for us. I wouldn\u2019t be too surprised if in a few years we reliably add blockchain to that list of important drivers of innovation. So, we really want to distinguish the blockchain which is in area of huge emphasis and investments across our industry and across many industries from a particular application of blockchain which tends to get all the news, cycles which is cryptal currencies.","So, having distinguished those two, let\u2019s talk a little bit about crypto currencies. Now, it\u2019s well known, it\u2019s some of the exchanges have introduced contracts, better referenced to Bitcoin. And who knows what other kinds of crypto currencies or baskets of crypto currencies, they may come out with products on. And so, on the back of our clients asking us, will you offer clearing in these contracts? Well, we\u2019re in that business of client facilitation. And so, we want a response to those client requests, and we have. And we\u2019re in also the businesses of being careful with our shareholders\u2019 capital. And so, we\u2019re doing that with extreme, prudence and caution as we learn. Now, the broader question of will there be trading in these instruments that are linked to Bitcoin, there is just a huge number of topics to address and being a part of the industry, we\u2019re working on all of that. Custody is a part of it and it\u2019s a very complex one. So, it\u2019s really too early to say how that will evolve for the industry or for ourselves.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lim with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Please go ahead.","Andrew Lim","So, for commodities, obviously you\u2019ve downsized the business. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of how much by and perhaps maybe you could say within the full year 2016 commodity revenue context, how much of those revenues have been downsized by?","Marty Chavez","So, I won\u2019t break it out exactly that way, Andrew. But, one way to think about the business is really to step back and look at the full year. So, in the full year, four out of the five FICC businesses are down, one of them which is relatively smaller for us, which is mortgages business, was up. And we talked about many others in the industry since it is a broad phenomenon, have talked about low volatility, low client activity, tighter credit spreads, tighter bid offer spreads playing through and all of those areas. But here is something I will quantify for you. I did it on the last call, you\u2019ll recall that last quarter, I mentioned that if you compared nine months on nine months, half of the FICC\u2019s decline was attributable to our commodities business. If you compare full year 2017 to full year 2016, one-third of the decline in FICC revenues is attributable to our commodities business.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.","Marty Chavez","Since there are no more questions, I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank everyone for joining the call. On behalf of our senior management team, we hope to see many of you in the coming months. If any additional questions arise in the meantime, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to Heather. Otherwise, enjoy the rest of your day. And we look forward to speaking with you on our first quarter call in April.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call.

I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2016 Earnings conference call. This call is being recorded today, July 19, 2016. Thank you.","Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.","Dane Holmes","Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. Today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm\u2019s belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain and outside of the firm\u2019s control. The firm\u2019s actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm\u2019s future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2015. ","I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our investment banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets, and supplementary leverage ratio, and you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that\u2019s posed on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com.","This audiocast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. ","Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, will now review the firm\u2019s results. Harvey?","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I\u2019ll walk you through the second quarter results, then I\u2019m happy to answer any questions. Net revenues $7.9 billion, net earnings $1.8 billion, earnings per diluted share $3.72, and our annualized return on common equity was 8.7%. ","As you all remember, the first quarter of 2016 was dominated by renewed uncertainty regarding the global economic outlook. This impacted prices across various asset classes and drove macro headwinds in each of our businesses. Many of the concerns that existed in the first quarter moderated as we started the second quarter. This was a better environment for our clients and our performance.","This was also reflected in equity markets; for example, the S&P 500 was relatively unchanged for most of April and May. In addition, we saw sequential improvements in global investment banking volumes. Activity for the first two months of the quarter was on pace to be up over 20% for equity offerings and nearly 15% for announced M&A; however, as we approached June, the market became increasingly focused on Brexit. The focus was on both the economic uncertainty surrounding the potential outcome and the potential economic implications of leaving the EU. These concerns negatively impacted client sentiment, risk appetite and activity levels heading into the vote. ","In response to the Leave vote on June 23, market volatility spiked and global equity markets declined significantly, with the MSCI World down roughly 7% in two days. While equity markets largely reversed those losses in the last three days of the quarter, clients and the border marketplace continue to wrestle with the Brexit vote and related uncertainty.","With that as a backdrop, let\u2019s now discuss individual business performance in greater detail. Investment banking produced second quarter net revenues of $1.8 billion, 22% higher than the first quarter as we saw increased client activity across equity and debt underwriting. Our investment banking backlog decreased relative to the end of the first quarter and the year ago. ","Breaking down the components of investment banking in the second quarter, advisory revenues were $794 million, up 3% from the first quarter. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&A. We advised a number of important transactions that were announced during the second quarter, including NorthStar Asset Management\u2019s $16.9 billion tri-party merger with Colony Capital and NorthStar Realty Finance; Great Plains Energy\u2019s $12.2 billion acquisition of Westar Energy, and Hewlett Packard Enterprises\u2019 $8.5 billion spinoff and merger of its enterprise services business with Computer Sciences Corporation. ","We also advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the second quarter, including Charter Communications\u2019 $78.7 billion acquisition of Time Warner Cable and $10.4 billion acquisition of Bright House Networks; Visa Inc.\u2019s \u20ac18.7 billion of Visa Europe, and Airgas Inc.\u2019s $13.4 billion sale to Air Liquide. ","Moving to underwriting, net revenues were $993 million in the second quarter, up 43% sequentially as capital markets activity picked up from the first quarter. Equity underwriting revenues were $269 million. This was up significantly compared to weak activity in the first quarter due to an increase in IPOs. Debt underwriting revenues were up 42% to $724 million and benefited from asset-backed issuance and strong leveraged finance activity.","During the second quarter, we actively supported our clients\u2019 financing needs, participating in Mylan\u2019s $6.5 billion investment-grade offering to support its acquisition of Meda AB; U.S. Foods\u2019 $1.2 billion IPO; and the approximately \u20ac850 million IPO of Philips Lighting. ","Turning to institutional client services, which comprises both our FICC and equities businesses, net revenues were $3.7 billion in the second quarter, up 7% compared to the first quarter. FICC client execution net revenues were $1.9 billion in the second quarter, up 16% sequentially as market making conditions improved in many businesses from the first quarter. Credit and mortgages increased as the backdrop for providing liquidity was more normalized compared to the first quarter. Rates was also higher sequentially given better market making conditions. Currencies declined relative to solid client activity levels in the first quarter, and commodities declined slightly during the quarter.","In equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees, and securities services, net revenues for the second quarter were $1.8 billion, down slightly quarter over quarter. Equities client execution net revenues of $587 million were up 25% sequentially. Better market making conditions for most of the quarter and select corporate activity drove improved performance. Commissions and fees were $745 million, down 15% quarter over quarter as client activity decreased following heightened volumes in the first quarter. Securities services generated net revenues of $422 million, down 2% relative to the first quarter as seasonally stronger client activity was offset by slightly lower customer balances and spreads.","Turning to risk, average daily borrowing in the second quarter was $62 million, down from $72 million in the first quarter.","Moving on to our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $1.1 billion in the second quarter. Equities securities generated net revenues of $626 million primarily reflecting company-specific events, sales, and gains in public equity investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $485 million and included more than $250 million of net interest income. In investment management, we reported second quarter net revenues of $1.4 billion, consistent with the first quarter. During the quarter, management and other fees were roughly flat sequentially at $1.2 billion.","Assets under supervision increased $23 billion sequentially to a record $1.31 trillion. The $23 billion increase was substantially driven by $19 billion of net market appreciation. We also had $4 billion of net inflows with $3 billion from liquidity products, and the remainder from long-term fee-based products. ","Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense for the year to date, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity work and other items such as benefits, was accrued at a compensation to net revenues ratio of 42%, consistent with the first half of last year. To respond to the more challenging backdrop, we completed an expense initiative during the first and second quarter. The run rate expense savings will be roughly $700 million. In 2016, these expected savings will be partially offset by severance and other related costs. Second quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.1 billion, up slightly compared to the first quarter. ","Now I\u2019d like to take you through a few key statistics. Total staff was approximately 34,800, down 5% from the first quarter. Our effective tax rate for the year to date was 26.8%. Our global core of liquid assets ended the second quarter at $211 billion and our balance sheet was $897 billion. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.2% under the Basel III advanced approach. It was 13.7% using the standardized approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 6.1%. All of our capital ratios are well in excess of regulatory requirements. This reflects our multi-year effort to de-risk the firm and strengthen our financial profile. Given robust capital ratios, the firm is well positioned to return excess capital to shareholders.","In the quarter, we repurchased 11.1 million common shares of common stock for $1.7 billion. For the five quarter CCAR cycle for 2015, we provided shareholders with $6.2 billion in share buybacks and $1.5 billion in common stock dividends. In terms of this year\u2019s CCAR test, we announced that the Federal Reserve Board did not object to our plan.","In conclusion, the first half of 2016 has certainly presented its fair share of challenges and concerns. At the core of these concerns is the outlook for the global economy. As you have heard us state many times before, confidence in economic growth is the most important long-term driver of our business. Confidence incentivizes client activity, which increases demand for our advice, our content and our execution capabilities. While like the rest of the world we would welcome more robust economic growth, ultimately we have to manage the firm for both the current environment and potential future opportunities.","How we\u2019ve navigated the difficult environment in the first half of 2016 demonstrates both the strength and resilience of our culture. We remain vigilant regarding our cost structure, our capital usage and our risk profile, and at the same time we have maintained the necessary commitment to ensure that we can meet our clients\u2019 needs as they grow.","Being in a position to deliver for our clients and our shareholders requires ongoing investment and a long-term perspective. While we continue to invest in our existing set of businesses, we are also looking for new opportunities. One example is our digital consumer lending platform. While still in its early stages, we expect to begin the initial phase of engaging consumers this fall. As we have discussed with you in the past, we are taking a very deliberate and methodical approach to this effort. We are looking to build a durable business, so it will take time. Similar to our other businesses, creating a valuable and differentiated service for our clients is core to our strategy.","In summary, our ability to both react to the current world and simultaneously invest in the future will position the firm to deliver superior value to our clients and our shareholders in the years ahead.","Thanks again for dialing in, and I\u2019m happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. ","Glenn Schorr","Hi, thanks a lot.","Harvey Schwartz","Hey, good morning Glenn.","Glenn Schorr","Good morning. A question on comps. It\u2019s always a little touchy, but if you look at it on a year-to-date basis, the ratio is flat with last year but the dollars are down 28% six months year-on-year. So I\u2019m just curious, I know you\u2019ve been remixing a little bit in the employee base. How much of that can help that ratio when you look at it on a full year, and then just how do you balance between a higher ratio versus the 37% you had the last couple of years, three years, and then just having it be a little bit more belt tightening?","Harvey Schwartz","So obviously 42 at this stage is our best estimate, but incorporated in that is all the steps that we\u2019re taking. So as I communicated, year-to-date the cost efforts themselves on a run rate basis translate into $700 million of run rate savings. Now, after severance that number is going to be more like 350 this year, but obviously we\u2019re staying very focused on this and I think you see that performance has been down, and with that compensation and benefits expenses down 28% year-to-date.","Glenn Schorr","Just so I understand, the\u2014your run rate savings comments - 700, 350 ex-severance, is that in this quarter\u2019s number and therefore just sets a lower bar as we roll through the rest of the year? I just want to make sure what we\u2019re looking at versus what\u2019s on the [indiscernible].","Harvey Schwartz","The way I would think about it is it\u2019s in 2016, and it gives us operating flexibility. But that\u2019s executed - the $700 million is done. Again, that\u2019s run rate, severance costs and other things.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. Then your comment on the investment banking pipeline\u2019s down, I\u2019m just curious, how much of that is just off of great numbers and as you execute, including the debt underwriting that you talked about, and then versus how much does Brexit play a role in just kind of slowing things down on deals that might have been happening across Europe?","Harvey Schwartz","So when you look at the backlog, I think one way to look at it is the year-over-year, so if you\u2019re actually standing here at the end of June last year, obviously the second quarter and first half of last year were very dynamic. If you look at the backlog in aggregate, it\u2019s sort of down mid-single digits, and so that\u2019s the trajectory of the backlog. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s surprising coming off of high levels - it is where it is. Obviously our market shares have been very significant.","In terms of Brexit, where we sit today, given I think that the base case expectation is that the dynamic is going to play out over a long period of time, and in some respects it may contribute to some of the same factors that contributed to a very active M&A environment, other than maybe very specific transactions that are geographic in nature, that are really driven by geography, which is generally few, when we talk to our bankers, if we continue in this low growth environment, they don\u2019t feel sitting here today that Brexit is going to be a headwind but obviously it\u2019s going to be a dynamic situation.","Glenn Schorr","Okay, I appreciate it. Thanks Harvey.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Christian Bolu","Good morning, Harvey.","Harvey Schwartz","Hey, good morning Christian. How are you?","Christian Bolu","Good, good. Thanks for the update on expenses. I might just ask a question, just to try and understand the knock-on impact of Brexit on your cost base. So do you have a sense, a rough sense of what percentage of your revenues and expenses are denominated in pound sterling? I presume you have significant more cost in sterling than revenues, so curious if the decline in the pound could be a further tailwind to expenses in 2H16.","Harvey Schwartz","No, it\u2019s not the case necessarily that we have significantly more expenses denominated in sterling. There\u2019s a whole host of processes through which we go through in terms of how employees elect to get compensated, et cetera, so that\u2019s an issue obviously we monitor very closely in terms of our foreign currency risk broadly across the globe, managing a global business, but I wouldn\u2019t point to that as a significant consideration, although it\u2019s a consideration of the many things we look at. ","In terms of Brexit, the way I would frame it for you is I\u2019d say there\u2019s sort of the near-term observations I can give you and then sort of a longer term perspective. The near-term ones would be just sort of going through the process. Now, obviously we were preparing for Brexit well in advance, even though we all expected it to be a very, very unlikely outcome, but we were significantly prepared for that and that really left us in a position, we feel, to be very front footed with clients. Going into Brexit, client activity tapered off, but at the point of Brexit and potentially thereafter in a number of our businesses, we either near-peak volumes or peak volumes, or new peaks, so that was quite good to see.","In terms of the longer term perspective on Brexit, as I said before, this looks like this process is going to take a while, and we\u2019re hopeful, along with everyone else, that the parties that are engaged in these negotiations will be prudent and thoughtful because obviously it\u2019s good for all of us, a thoughtful negotiation and outcome will just be good for economic growth. As it relates to our business, we\u2019ve been in Europe and the U.K. for a very long period of time, and we\u2019re completed committed to our clients in the region, and regardless of how these negotiations go, we\u2019re going to make sure that we\u2019re there for them. That would be my broad comment on Brexit.","Christian Bolu","Great. Thanks for the detailed response. On debt underwriting, very, very strong numbers and well in excess of what we can see in the kind of public lead tables. So just curious maybe if you can detail some of the growth initiatives around the debt underwriting business and particularly any color on businesses that we would not typically be able to see in the public lead tables. ","Harvey Schwartz","So one of the drivers in this quarter, as I referenced, was an asset-backed related activity, and there was one significant transaction where earlier on, we had committed capital to purchase a portfolio, which ultimately translated through in the debt underwriting line that would not be included in a lead table, so it\u2019d be difficult for you to see.","Christian Bolu","Okay, thank you very much.","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks Christian.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Michael Carrier","Thanks Harvey.","Harvey Schwartz","Hey, how are you?","Michael Carrier","Good. First, just on the G-SIB surcharge, just wanted to get an update where you stand, and then probably more importantly when you think of wanting to reduce that versus taking advantage of opportunities to take market share, just given some of the exits that we\u2019ve seen throughout the industry, just want to get a sense on where you\u2019re at and kind of the pullback versus the growth, just given some of the dislocations out there with some of the competitors.","Harvey Schwartz","Yes, so you\u2019re right - I would summarize it because I think you framed it well. It\u2019s a bit of a balance, and so at this stage we\u2019re at 2.5 on the surcharge. Obviously we\u2019re very focused on reducing our systemic footprint. We believe that and all firms obviously should make that a priority; but you\u2019re right to say that as the competitive environment is shifting and a number of our competitors have stated restructuring plans, we want to make sure that in all of our efforts, whether it\u2019s managing our capital, that we\u2019re focused on costs, that we remain full service across all of our businesses and we\u2019re there for our clients. We believe at this stage we\u2019ve found that balance, and for shareholders it gives them a lot of operating leverage.","Michael Carrier","Okay, got it. Just as a follow-up, I guess just two things on the regulatory side. So with CCAR, I know you guys don\u2019t disclose what you\u2019re going to do, but just from a quarter as we kind of go through the third quarter through 2017, should we expect the same type of ramp that we saw last year just in terms of the lighter up front and then the heavier buybacks as that plays out? And then just any update on the\u2014you know, you guys\u2019 capital and funds that would have to be liquidated in 2017? I guess just when you think about those investments, any way for us to gauge where those are marked or where the potential gains could be as those are exited over time?","Harvey Schwartz","So what\u2019s expected of CCAR and the CCAR process, obviously you say the 11.1 million shares this quarter and the 1.7 billion-plus in dollar buybacks, so last year\u2019s test had some idiosyncrasies in it which led to this profile where, to the extent of which and we ended up using capacity that we\u2019re repurchasing, that we were more constrained in the early quarters versus the later quarters. And even though we don\u2019t disclose the buyback capacity, and you know we don\u2019t want shareholders to conflate that with dividends, and that\u2019s why we don\u2019t, the profile that you would expect this year doesn\u2019t have those idiosyncratic elements to it, so the extent to which we repurchase, it won\u2019t necessarily follow that profile. ","In terms of the\u2014I think what you\u2019re asking, the question really relates to the harvesting in the funds. Is that what you\u2019re asking?","Michael Carrier","Yes, that\u2019s it.","Harvey Schwartz","Okay. So I\u2019ve walked you through that, for lack of better language, that waterfall, so why don\u2019t I just do that. So right now, dollars that are invested predominantly alongside our clients, where we act as a fiduciary, is $7.3 billion. There is $900 million that you would characterize as permitted under the Vogel rule. That leaves us with $6.4 billion. Of the $6.4 billion, $2.1 billion is public; that leaves us with $4.3 billion that is still private sitting alongside those funds.","Michael Carrier","Okay.","Harvey Schwartz","Actually, I think you asked a question\u2014did you ask a question about - I tried to write them all down. Did you ask a question about how we mark them?","Q - Michael Carrier","Well you know, because these would be relatively seasoned. I was just trying to get a sense on based on the investment versus where it is today, is it running at 1.5 times the cost when you invested? Just trying to get a sense of where things are marked in terms of what the potential gain could be.","Harvey Schwartz","I understand. Yes, so we mark everything to fair value, so we\u2019re marking it quarter to quarter. So whatever gains or losses that are occurring in those investments, you\u2019re seeing those translate through every quarter.","Michael Carrier","Got it, okay, but we don\u2019t have a cost base versus a fair value, meaning to\u2014","Harvey Schwartz","It\u2019s across multiple funds, and so I don\u2019t have an aggregate number for you on that.","Michael Carrier","Okay, all right. Thanks a lot.","Harvey Schwartz","The funds have obviously performed well - you\u2019ve seen that translate through the performance over the last couple years.","Michael Carrier","Yes.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Good morning. ","Harvey Schwartz","Hey Matt, how are you?","Matt O\u2019Connor","Good, thank you. Could you talk a little bit more about investment management in terms of why the fees were so weak there, say, versus a year ago? I realize a lot of it is the incentive fees, which tend to be lumpy, but even the other, call it more [indiscernible] like fees were sluggish. Is there something on the timing of when you collect, say, versus equity prices and the volatility there, or is there something else going on?","Harvey Schwartz","So the biggest driver in the quarter when you look year-over-year is obviously the incentive fees, and that\u2019s reflective of the environment and incentive fees from time to time are going to be lumpy. With respect to the management and other fees, it really is just about mix and the average fee coming down, although offset in part by the fact that obviously [indiscernible] has grown pretty significantly year over year.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay, and I guess what exactly is the negative mix shift? I mean, obviously liquidity under supervision has increased, but it seems like the overall balances for equity and fixed income really across the board, it seems like the balances have increased. When you talk about the mix shift, what exactly is that?","Harvey Schwartz","So as you know, in the business obviously we have a number of different client segments so it\u2019s full service across a number of different lines. One of those lines is large advisory institutional mandates. Those mandates, given their size, tend to come at a lower fee base, and so that\u2019s really the mix shift. So it\u2019s basically away from classic mutual funds and into those types of mandates. You can see\u2014I think we break it out for you in the 10-Q, you can see all that.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay. Then just separately on the bank initiative, you did mention about rolling out the digital consumer lending platform in the fall. But just more broadly speaking, maybe give us an update on where you are on the lending thought process overall, and then on the deposit side as well, I think you did the brand conversion of the deposit acquisition this past quarter.","Harvey Schwartz","Yes, so by view of the separate banks, this one\u2019s really about liability management. Are you talking about the GE deposit acquisition? Is that what you\u2019re asking about in terms of the brand acquisition? Is that what you\u2019re talking about?","Matt O\u2019Connor","Correct.","Harvey Schwartz","Yes, okay, so why don\u2019t I just start there and I\u2019ll take your question in reverse. So we view those\u2014obviously that\u2019s separate in terms of\u2014obviously we view asset liability management as an integrated exercise, but those two efforts are separate. But having said that, the acquisition went quite well, added in excess of $15 billion of deposits to the firm. It\u2019s great for us because it diversifies our sources of funding, which as you know we\u2019re always looking to do. Since the acquisition date, it\u2019s been well received by consumers - we\u2019ve had in excess of 20,000 consumers open up new accounts for us, so it\u2019s had very significant growth in a short period of time. So it really speaks to the brand strength, which has been very nice to see.","Now in terms of the longer term objectives, maybe I\u2019ll just take an opportunity to level set you on where we are in the online lending. So as we talked about, we hired Harit over a year ago and he\u2019s been a fantastic addition to the team, and he\u2019s built a very capable team over that period of time. So I think it\u2019s probably important just to level set you on how we approach this process.","So we\u2019ve obviously keenly aware of the fact that this is a new business opportunity for us and, importantly, a new client base, so one of the things we did is we reached out to thousands of consumers to really understand what they want and their borrowing priorities. Through that, we learned some things that probably aren\u2019t so surprising - they want a product that\u2019s simple, it\u2019s straightforward, it provides a lot of value, and they also want what they refer to as really a high quality user experience. So what we have attempted to do is take all this feedback, we developed one product. I\u2019ve emphasized\u2014you know, we\u2019ve emphasized a number of times that we\u2019re going to be very deliberate and slow with this, so we\u2019ve developed one product which we plan to launch later this fall, so that\u2019s where we stand [indiscernible] over the next several months.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay, and sorry - what is that one product? Is it an unsecured loan, or what\u2019s the\u2014","Harvey Schwartz","Yes, it\u2019s an unsecured consumer loan product.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay. Would they ask\u2014I mean, target a customer of kind of short duration, small loan size, bigger loan size? What\u2019s kind of the\u2014","Harvey Schwartz","We\u2019ll come back with all those details in the fall.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay, fair enough. Okay, thanks for all the answers.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Harvey Schwartz","Morning, Mike.","Mike Mayo","Hi. So headcount was down a lot just over three months, I guess down 5%. Is that right?","Harvey Schwartz","That\u2019s correct.","Mike Mayo","So where were those\u2014where did those headcount reductions occur?","Harvey Schwartz","So in terms of the headcount process, the process itself really started back in February in terms of our analytics. Now as you know, Mike, we go through\u2014what gets a lot of attention is that we referred to it as a review of the 5%. In years, it varies. Sometimes those reviews yield small reductions, sometimes we actually add people. It varied by business. Obviously for businesses that have hit heavier headwinds, like fixed income, they elected to go beyond the 5% in terms of their exercise, and then there are supporting businesses that are adjacent there, so things like ops and tech. This is a broad exercise across the firm.","Now, I would point out again that this is netted against hiring, so we\u2019re still hiring, and so\u2014but the 5%, as I pointed out, on a run rate basis it\u2019s $700 million.","Mike Mayo","I\u2019m sorry - what\u2019s $700 million?","Harvey Schwartz","$700 million is the cost savings on a run rate basis associated with that exercise.","Mike Mayo","And that\u2019s not reflected in the second quarter?","Harvey Schwartz","It is reflected in the quarter to the extent to which it\u2019s reflected in our compensation accrual, which is our best estimate for the year.","Mike Mayo","Okay, so what was the gross headcount reduction? Net is 5%, before the hiring, was it 6 or 7%?","Harvey Schwartz","The biggest addition offsetting that would have been, for example, roughly 600 new analysts that joined the firm in June.","Mike Mayo","That\u2019s a really big headcount reduction in just three months. How do you know that you did it correctly? I mean, did you cut into muscle, did you cut fat?","Harvey Schwartz","You know, it\u2019s interesting. We, as you know, like sometimes\u2014sometimes I think that because we don\u2019t announce targets in advance, that people misunderstand a bit about the way we run the business. So we view this as a very thoughtful exercise. We don\u2019t feel like we\u2019ve sacrificed any optionality. We certainly have not sacrificed any commitment to our clients. These exercises are done at the business level and built up from the business level.","Mike Mayo","All right, thank you.","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Guy Moszkowski","Good morning. ","Harvey Schwartz","Morning, Guy.","Guy Moszkowski","I just wanted to return first of all to the capital management question and maybe ask it a little bit differently in terms of what we might expect over the next several quarters. So you bumped up the buyback to $1.7 billion, the diluted share count fell by about 2% in the quarter. If you annualize, then you\u2019re two or three percentage points ahead of what the kind of last five years\u2019 run rate has been in terms of how you\u2019ve reduced the diluted share count. So in the absence of a specific guide post-CCAR, what should we be thinking about in terms of that attempt to reduce the share count? Should we be thinking in terms of that 5% run rate, or maybe a couple of percentage points higher in line with what you\u2019ve done recently?","Harvey Schwartz","I think the reluctance for me to be more specific in terms of guiding you really reflects the dynamic nature of how we do it. So you have to think about\u2014and it\u2019s obviously more complicated than this, but you have to think about the three competing factors that we\u2019re always managing. The first and most important is that we put ourselves in a very strong financial position so that we\u2019re there for our clients, so if we saw a big uptick in client demand for our capital, we would be very happy to deploy that capital and actually not return it to shareholders. So this really reflects the fact that the client demand of a period of time hasn\u2019t been there.","Now, the second things we do and the strength of the financial footings of the firm, obviously you\u2019ve seen us do a huge amount of work and you see it reflected in our ratios with 13.7 standardized at the end of this quarter. Obviously we\u2019ve been very focused on how we\u2019ve been de-risking the firm and deploying that capital when demanded for us. Ultimately, that gives you the flexibility to either return it or not, and that\u2019s why you\u2019ve seen the uptick over the past couple of years in terms of levels of activity. But the average diluted share count, as you pointed, is at a low level.","Guy Moszkowski","Okay, that\u2019s actually useful in terms of understanding your overall framework, so thanks for that. This actually turns out to be a related question - you caveated in the release that the environment for FICC continues to be pretty challenging because of low rates and volumes and low client activity, which implies that there is a more normal run rate that you think is achievable. Can you give us a sense of what that might be, and does that take into account revenue pressures from shifts to electronic trading as well as alternatively the potential to gain share from global competitors who may be retrenching?","Harvey Schwartz","So I\u2019ll make a couple of comments on that. You know, Guy, I\u2019d say that first in terms of client activity levels and run rate, if you will, run rate is a difficult thing but I don\u2019t think anyone would disagree that when you look at the trading activity levels and the industry trends over the last couple years, obviously they\u2019ve been in decline. When you look at the factors in terms of our clients and what they need, our clients are still there and they still need those services, they need them from us, and so the type of environment we\u2019ve been in, if you actually look at the sort of\u2014for lack of better language, the violence of the first quarter in January and February, and then the concerns about Brexit in the second quarter, I think it\u2019s fair for us to say these feel like low levels\u2014these are the type of factors that contribute to reduced client sentiment, reduced confidence, and as a result reduced activity.","Now, one interesting takeaway, and we\u2019ve seen this before sporadically, is after Brexit when volumes were much higher for those couple of days, in all the things that we watch, we could see a demonstrable uptick in our market shares. That may be the result of the current competitive environment as we\u2019ve talked about a number of the global competitors are going through restructurings, they\u2019ve been quite challenged. So when volumes pick up, we feel like we see it, but it\u2019s difficult for me to tell you what the run rate will be over a long period of time, given the dynamic nature of markets and the unique place we find ourselves with respect to global growth and interest rates. ","Guy Moszkowski","So can you elaborate a little bit on those metrics, even though I recognize it was just for a short period of time, but the metrics that told you that you were picking up market share, because up until now when we\u2019ve asked you that question, you\u2019ve generally said it\u2019s still hard to measure, it\u2019s early days, you\u2019re not really going to be able to tell in this kind of environment. But you sound much more concrete about it now.","Harvey Schwartz","Yes. One of the things that we\u2019re able to do over time, given all of the public regulatory reporting, is we\u2019re able to monitor those things more closely in fixed income than historically exists, and obviously you have exchanges that you can monitor. Exchange volumes are not necessarily the greatest indicator, but over long periods of time you can see it, or under unique circumstances when you get big spikes in activity. But it feels like it to us, Guy.","Guy Moszkowski","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Fiona Swaffield","Hi, I have questions in two areas. Firstly, I think you made some comments about security services and margins and volumes being somewhat down. I wonder if you could go into that in more detail, and are we\u2014historically we\u2019ve seen wider spreads, this is kind of a real change in trend. The second question was on your clients. In a recent presentation, Goldman talked about a mix shift in clients, or stronger growth among some clients versus others over 2015, going back. I mean, has there been a continued shift change if you looked at the client mix in 2016? Thanks.","Harvey Schwartz","Yes, thanks Fiona. So with respect to [indiscernible] client services, that\u2019s just reflective of activity levels, and as markets were volatile in the first and second quarter, you saw that translate through with respect to demand, market prices and spreads, so there\u2019s nothing really to highlight there other than its reflective of the environment.","In terms of the client base and our client footings, we\u2019re always looking to grow our market share across all segments, across all regions, and so we continue to focus on that and there\u2019s always things we can do better. ","Thanks Fiona.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Kian Abouhossein","Yes, hi. First question\u2014","Harvey Schwartz","Kian, are you there? Kian, I think we lost you. I don\u2019t know if you can hear us.","Operator","Kian, maybe your line has been placed on mute? Okay, we\u2019ll move onto the next question, and that\u2019s from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. ","Jim Mitchell","Hey, good morning.","Harvey Schwartz","Good morning, Jim.","Jim Mitchell","Just a couple of quick small questions. On FICC, you guys mentioned that mortgages were down significantly. None of your peers really talked about that. Is there anything unusual there for you guys in mortgage that hurt you in the quarter?","Harvey Schwartz","No, I think that\u2019s maybe just reflective of different product lines that businesses may have. We\u2019re not as big in things like credit cards and other parts of things which may flow through those business lines. I don\u2019t really have the visibility into the competitor base well enough to tell you.","Jim Mitchell","But why was mortgages so much weaker than a year ago? I\u2019m just trying to think through the dynamic there this quarter.","Harvey Schwartz","Client activities and inventory, in terms of the way it moved year over year.","Jim Mitchell","Right, okay. Maybe I missed it - did you give us the fully phased in ratios?","Harvey Schwartz","No, I didn\u2019t. So you want me to [indiscernible] for you, so just to recap again, I\u2019ll start with the advanced. Transitional 12:2, the fully phased is 11:8, standardized 13:7, fully phased 13:1.","Jim Mitchell","Okay, so those gaps are closing as you kind of sell down the private equity, so that\u2019s progressing nicely. Okay, great. Thanks.","Harvey Schwartz","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Harvey Schwartz","Welcome back, Kian.","Kian Abouhossein","Yes, sorry. I got disconnected somehow. Just briefly on Brexit, and I really have two questions. The first one is related to clearly we had the sell-off, high volatility, a lot of transaction volumes as you indicated in FX, et cetera. Historically after such an environment, we\u2019ve seen more of a dry-up of the business. Is that something that you\u2019re seeing, or do you see more seasonal adjustments to the business as you see in normal times, or is there a more pronounced adjustment to the business environment transaction volumes is getting a bit lower than usual what you would expect?","Harvey Schwartz","Yes, I think that\u2019s a reasonable question in terms of just the unique nature of Brexit. It\u2019s interesting how the world\u2014so the market reaction, the activity level right around Brexit obviously I don\u2019t think was surprising to any of us. I think you could have sat there those couple days after Brexit and if you were forecasting the next month of activity, I think you might have been surprised if we could have known in advance that equity markets would rebound so strongly, there would be a rebound in currencies, and the world would sort of normalize. I think that may be a little bit different, to go back to the core of your question about things we\u2019ve seen in the past, so this normalization was so quick that it actually may be something that\u2019s a better harbinger in the near term usually following one of these events for activity levels. I can frame that for you in a bit more detail.","So I talked about the merger business earlier. If we stay in this low growth environment, unless something is really uniquely impacted by Brexit and if the negotiation process takes a long period of time, then as I said, our bankers don\u2019t necessarily see this being a headwind. If we stay in this low interest rate environment and you take a look at our asset management business, then this is really an environment where clients need advice, and that also translates into our ITS business. This is a very content-rich environment now and markets have stabilized so quickly, whether it\u2019s debt or equity, et cetera, that I don\u2019t know if I would have guessed a couple of weeks ago that the market would have rebounded so quickly, but it feels pretty normalized for now.","Kian Abouhossein","The [indiscernible] that you underlined, do you see that already so far planning out?","Harvey Schwartz","Well, I think there would have been a lot of questions a few weeks ago about the cross-border mergers, for example, into the U.K., and obviously we\u2019ve seen that within two weeks, so I think there\u2019s evidence.","Kian Abouhossein","Okay. The second question on Brexit is I think there was an earlier question about the impact of Brexit on you, but clearly there\u2019s this issue of EU passporting and there\u2019s clearly the potential of using [indiscernible] Article 4647 assuming there is no EU passporting. Is that something that you feel as a European player sitting in the U.K. you would be able to use to your benefit, or is that not strong enough of a regulatory setting in order to operate out of the U.K.?","Harvey Schwartz","I think the answer is it\u2019s just too early to tell in terms of how this process was going to unfold. Again as I said earlier, like everyone else, yourself included, we\u2019re hopeful that this is a really thoughtful and prudent process, but it really is a question\u2014you know, we\u2019re contingency planners and so we\u2019ll contingency plan for multiple outcomes, but way too early to speak specifically. ","Kian Abouhossein","Okay, thank you very much.","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks Kian.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.","Brennan Hawken","Thanks, good morning. How are you doing, Harvey?","Harvey Schwartz","Good.","Brennan Hawken","A quick one on NII. I think when you were walking through INL, you said that NII was around $250 million or so, so if we\u2019re run rating that at about $1 billion, when we look at your INL balance sheet in the Q and just using the last quarter\u2019s numbers because I doubt they\u2019re that different, if we sum up the debt and loans, you get to about $70 billion or so, just over, which is a little over a 1% net yield. Is it that funding costs for that portfolio are really high? What causes that, or is it that the asset yields are low? What causes that yield to seem a bit low to folks?","Harvey Schwartz","So that\u2019s a good question. So let\u2019s start with\u2014why don\u2019t I just level set you on the balance sheet, the INL balance sheet first. So you were very accurate in your high level commentary, but the balance sheet is down roughly $2 billion quarter over quarter, down to 97.1, and that breaks out between roughly $20.8 billion of what we call equity, and of that $3.5 billion is public equity and the total $16.8 billion of corporate equity, and then the rest, as you said, is debt. With respect to the NIM, in part it has to do with deposits but for the most part it has to do with the quality of the portfolio. So as you know, a large portion of the portfolio is collateralized, so it\u2019s just less risky.","Brennan Hawken","So it\u2019s more on the asset side rather than on the funding side.","Harvey Schwartz","It\u2019s a mix. We don\u2019t have branches all over the United States, so we don\u2019t have the lowest marginal cost of funding in terms of deposits, but it really is more of the collateralized nature of the lending that we\u2019re doing.","Brennan Hawken","Got it, that helps. Thanks Harvey. Then one question on capital post-CCAR here. We in the past have gotten the dividend increase in the first quarter for you guys post-CCAR. I believe you mentioned in your press release post-CCAR that you were approved for a dividend hike, so was the difference this year just around timing with the Board not having time to meet before the third quarter dividend got announced, or should we think about this CCAR year differently than past years? ","Harvey Schwartz","I think what we intended to communicate was that the approval gave us the flexibility to do all those things, but we weren\u2019t speaking specifically to any decision making with respect to the dividend. The way we\u2014as you know, our preferred methodology, because it gives us a lot more flexibility internally how we manage our capital, is to provide capital return to shareholders, but there\u2019s nothing specific or you shouldn\u2019t interpret anything as a takeaway year to year as we think about the dividend. Those will be discrete decisions that we make as we think through the capital planning process.","Brennan Hawken","Okay, thanks Harvey.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Steven Chubak","Hi, good morning. ","Harvey Schwartz","Morning Steven. How are you?","Steven Chubak","Well, thanks. So Harvey, first question I have is on CCAR. You noted in the past that CCAR is the firm\u2019s binding constraint on capital, and I\u2019m just wondering whether the favorable result in the latest exam positions you to maybe attribute or allocate less capital to market making activities; or said a bit differently, does it enable you to be more competitive on pricing assuming that your attributable equity has come down? ","Harvey Schwartz","Yes, so it\u2019s an interesting question. I guess you could say CCAR is binding if you ask of capital return and you have to revise it. That\u2019s not necessarily what we\u2019ve meant to communicate. Obviously if you just looked at our headline ratios at 13:7 and 12:2, we have significant excess capital relative to the required regulatory minimum. It\u2019s a dynamic process for us, and so in this particular year the Federal Reserve\u2019s interpretation of their scenario was more favorable than our interpretation of the scenario, but it\u2019s our interpretation of the scenario that\u2019s going to govern our capital policy and how we think about capital management, so that\u2019s how we\u2019ll approach it. It\u2019s our test.","Steven Chubak","Got it, okay. So in thinking about capital allocation, should we look at your own submission as a way to infer how much capital you\u2019re allocating for certain activities, or is that not reasonable?","Harvey Schwartz","Yes, except for the fact that\u2014the one thing I would say is that the capital allocation process itself, and now we\u2019re talking about operating principles, we\u2019re not talking about tests, the operating principles, we design the firm, we manage the firm to be very flexible. So if there is client demand for capital in investment banking, we want to be in a position to deploy that. If there\u2019s client demand for capital\u2014because the vast majority of our capital is high velocity. If there are opportunities and client demand in investing and lending, which tend to be longer term commitments of capital, obviously we engage in those also, but we don\u2019t allocate down a capital in a way that says, okay, here\u2019s your capital Mr. and Mrs. Business, you use that, we\u2019ll see you in a year. We feel like we get a much better ability to deliver to our clients globally if we can be more flexible and dynamic with it.","Steven Chubak","Right, thanks Harvey. Just one more follow-up from me. There was a senior regulator who recently made remarks suggesting that they could impose some tougher capital requirements for activities specifically in the physical commodities space. I know that\u2019s been debated for some time, but do you have any sense as to what form that proposal might take and whether it could compel any changes in terms of how you strategically manage that business?","Harvey Schwartz","No, we\u2019ll have to see what the rule comes out with. The vast majority of our business, as you know, is not unlike a lot of the other capital markets businesses where we\u2019re working with corporate clients on hedging their exposures, we\u2019re working with investors who want access to the commodity markets. So commodity hedging for a consumer or a producer of a commodity, to them it\u2019s no different than the way a corporate would hedge foreign exchange. ","We\u2019ll have to see what ultimately the rules look like, but obviously we\u2019re very committed to those clients.","Steven Chubak","Thanks Harvey. Do you have any sense as to timing as to when we\u2019ll get clarity on that rule?","Harvey Schwartz","No, I only have the same information you have.","Steven Chubak","Fair enough. All right, Harvey. Thanks for taking my questions.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Matt Burnell","Good morning, Harvey. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. First of all, in terms of the additional global core liquidity you had on the balance sheet at both the end of the quarter and for the average of the quarter, that was up a bit from last quarter. Is that primarily due to the GE deposits, or is there something else going on there?","Harvey Schwartz","No, that\u2019s correct. We took in $16 billion roughly of deposits, and that\u2019s really the whole driver of the increase, both in the balance sheet and in the GCLA.","Matt Burnell","Okay, fair enough. Then just in terms of the backlog decline both sequentially and year over year, is there any specific geography - you know, Asia, Europe, North AmericA - that is meaningfully stronger or weaker within that trend?","Harvey Schwartz","No, not necessarily. ","Matt Burnell","Okay, that\u2019s it for me. Thank you.","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. ","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks very much. Harvey, just to circle back to the expense commentary for a moment, would it be your expectation that the actions you\u2019ve taken will allow you to generate positive operating leverage, or maybe just more broadly, what is your expectation about operating leverage for the back half of this year?","Harvey Schwartz","Look, you\u2019ve seen it - it seems like ages ago now, but in the first quarter of 2015, we had an improved market environment, we were very quickly able to deliver lots of operating leverage, and you saw a near 15% ROE in that quarter. Like I said, it feels like a long time ago now. We continually review all the businesses to ensure that we\u2019re maintaining the right footprint, so this is all about making sure that we find the right balance between our commitment to clients over the long term and expense management, and obviously the first half of this year has not been the greatest environment, so you\u2019re just seeing us respond to it.","Eric Wasserstrom","Can you just help me understand - when you say $700 million of run rate savings, from what level and under what revenue circumstances?","Harvey Schwartz","So the way to think about that is, if we finish the end of the 2015 with a certain [indiscernible], all those adjustments and resources on a run rate basis would be $700 million, so all other factors being equal. But that won\u2019t translate into this year because there are severance and other related costs, and net of that will be something more like 350, so you should really think of that as translating into 2017. Now, this will be dynamic of course because we\u2019ll be hiring more people, so you and I are really sterilizing the discussion for this number, but I think that\u2019s the best way to explain it to you.","Eric Wasserstrom","It sounds like you think that the actions you\u2019ve taken are sufficient to address this current revenue circumstance, but what would cause you perhaps reconsider and make additional adjustments?","Harvey Schwartz","Well certainly if the environment continued to be challenged, we would continue to refine the businesses. On the flipside, if the environment globally improved dramatically and there was a real demand for our resources, which has been no difficulty in attracting very, very high quality talent to the firm, so we\u2019re also being very thoughtful about giving people an opportunity to want to be at Goldman Sachs that we want to be here.","Eric Wasserstrom","Great. Then just one quick accounting question. I think last quarter you indicated that your expected tax rate for the full year would be around 31%. Has that changed at all, given the second quarter\u2019s figure?","Harvey Schwartz","Yes, given where we\u2019re running now, I would say something just shy of 30 feels like a better expectation where we stand right now.","Eric Wasserstrom","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.","Devin Ryan","Hey, good morning Harvey.","Harvey Schwartz","Good morning, Devin.","Devin Ryan","I appreciate the update on the digital consumer finance business initiative, understand the current view that this is going to be a slow build. It sounds like it could take some time to really move the needle under the current path, but is there a case for buying something to enhance either the lending capabilities or liability gathering, just so that you get to that critical mass more quickly, or just thinking about the strategy, is it just kind of by its nature it needs to be built up organically, just so that it\u2019s a differentiated platform?","Harvey Schwartz","Yes, it\u2019s a good question. So obviously you\u2019ve seen us do a number of smaller bolt-on acquisitions in IMD, and the thesis behind those, because we\u2019re certainly not reluctant to do that, is when we feel like we had a capability that we would\u2014if there\u2019s a service we\u2019d like to enhance for our clients or a capability that we\u2019re quite good at, that we think we can add scale to, we\u2019ll just weigh the costs and benefits of acquiring versus building in-house. ","This particular effort, when we looked at it, we really felt like best designed from scratch, and the reason for that is I think we\u2019re kind of uniquely positioned. It allows us to leverage our technology skills and our risk skills, but this is really about if you look at sort of the competitive landscape, there are benefits that online lending platforms provide to consumers and there are benefits that large commercial providers of credit provide to consumers. We\u2019re just really looking to bridge the gap between those strengths and offer consumers as best we can a really thoughtful and differentiated product.","Devin Ryan","Got it, that\u2019s very helpful. Separately, just love some thoughts about how you guys are thinking about the upcoming election just as an influence on business, either from a client perspective or even how you\u2019re thinking about planning in your business. There\u2019s been a lot of rhetoric just around some pretty bold proposals recently, reinstating Glass-Steagall, for example in financials, some similar kind of bold themes in other sectors. I\u2019m just curious how much is this uncertainty into the election delaying decision-making, if at all, or keeping a lid on client activity.","Harvey Schwartz","Look, I think this cycle will have its unique aspects to it versus other presidential cycles, but historically there\u2019s always been some element which may have ultimately deferred a decision that a client might make to a later period. But these are short term in nature, so we don\u2019t see any significant impact in terms of the near term.","Devin Ryan","Got it, okay. Just last one quickly - the decline in VAR, I know that can bounce around, but was that just de-risking into the U.K. referendum or just the reduced volatility? Just curious what drove that - it was at the lowest level in quite some time.","Harvey Schwartz","It was a combination. Obviously the VAR declined pretty meaningfully in average over the quarter. Really, that was a combination of two factors. There was reduced client activity going into Brexit, and as I mentioned earlier, we were being pretty prudent as we approached the date.","Devin Ryan","Understood, got it. Thanks Harvey.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.","Marty Mosby","Thanks. Harvey, I wanted to go back into the CCAR and think about adjustments on operational risk. Like we had talked about, there had been some double counting. You did get a benefit of 250 basis points, so to speak, in your minimum ratios going higher. Is that\u2014you know, as we talked about double counting and SIFI possibly going into CCAR, it looks like you got a break on operational risk that almost equals your SIFI charge almost exactly.","Harvey Schwartz","We don\u2019t have any visibility into those calculations, Marty. As you know, there\u2019s no transparency in that process, so I really can\u2019t comment. I think this year\u2019s test and last year\u2019s test and the year prior to that, I think it just confirms what the Federal Reserve has been very clear about. Their test is going to be dynamic from year to year. They\u2019re going to incorporate lots of different variables - that\u2019s how they designed it, so I actually think they\u2019re just fulfilling their design criteria.","Marty Mosby","The other thing I was going to ask you was on this quarter and the headcount reductions, where the severance costs would probably hit, when you look at kind of dividing it, if you just said well, you\u2019re at full run rate in the second quarter, which I know you probably weren\u2019t, but $175 million per quarter, and then you look at the net for the year you\u2019re talking about for this year of being 350 net severance then being possible $350 million, I was trying to think of the timing in relation to the gains in the sense of the expense savings and how that might have affected the second quarter.","Harvey Schwartz","Yes, so the way to think about it is on an annualized basis, Marty, so you should incorporate those numbers as $700 million on a run rate basis, that run rate basis\u2014and this is again a very sterilized way we\u2019re doing this conversation. That\u2019s all other factors being equal going into 2017, and this year that will translate roughly into $350 million of savings this year. How that flows through quarter to quarter, that\u2019s very specific to a number of circumstances. ","Marty Mosby","Would it be safe to say that a majority of the severance was going to be at least in the second quarter?","Harvey Schwartz","Some, but not all. ","Marty Mosby","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Hey, morning Harvey.","Harvey Schwartz","Hey Brian.","Brian Kleinhanzl","I just had a quick question on the Volcker investments. I know you said previously that there is a chance that it could get extended as you get into 2017, but there\u2019s really been no discussion as far as I\u2019ve seen with regards to that. So how should we think about those Volcker investments over the course of next year? Is it really just some type of liquidity event in 2Q17 that will become or happen because if there is no extension or you\u2019re just going to take a wait-and-see approach on winding those down?","Harvey Schwartz","So as I mentioned before, we have $4.3 billion that\u2019s private, $2.1 billion\u2014I went through the waterfall, so I won\u2019t do it again. You would have seen a communication from the regulators that basically spoke to the confirmation of the extension to 2017, and then there\u2019s been public submissions in terms of industry-wide requests for incremental extensions, which I believe under the Volcker interpretations can be as much as an incremental five years. ","If you remember, if you go back to the genesis of Volcker, it wasn\u2019t designed to force fire sales or anything like that, so the industry again has been working with the regulators through various bodies, and we\u2019ll see how the regulators finally respond to that. But I think the industry has done a good job, as have we, of bringing down these levels, but we\u2019re sitting alongside our clients mostly in these funds, so we don\u2019t have unilateral authority just to sell these assets.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay, good. Thanks.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.","Harvey Schwartz","That\u2019s great. Since there aren\u2019t any more questions, we just want to thank everybody for joining the call. Hopefully we\u2019ll all get to see you over the course of the coming months. If you have any other questions, give a call into Dane and the team; but otherwise thanks again for participating and have a great summer.

(Operator Instructions) Also, this call is being recorded today, April 16, 2013. Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may now begin your conference.","Dane Holmes","Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Director of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm\u2019s belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain and outside of the firm\u2019s control. The firm\u2019s actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm\u2019s future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for our year ended December 2012.","I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets and Global Core Excess. And you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that is posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com. This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent.","Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz will now review the firm\u2019s results. Harvey?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Thanks, Dane, and thanks everyone for dialing in today. I will walk you through our first quarter results and then take your questions.","Net revenues were $10.1 billion, net earnings $2.3 billion, earnings per diluted share were $4.29 and our annualized return on common equity was 12.4%. Overall, a solid result. As we\u2019ve talked about in the past, client activity levels are generally correlated to the broader macroeconomic environment. This certainly proved to be true in the first quarter as activity levels were mixed as the quarter progress. Early in the quarter, continued positive development from U.S. economy, specifically in housing and unemployment drove increased client activity and greater risk appetite. In January U.S. new home sales grew by almost 15% month-over-month, one of the largest month-over-month increases in the last two decades.","The U.S. nonfarm payroll report for February came in significantly higher than expectations with 236,000 jobs created versus expectations of a 160,000. In addition to driving increased client activity and risk appetite, these economic developments help support driving asset values. Most notably the S&P 500 was up by 10% and key credit indices, such as the LCDX and high yield CDX reached higher by more than 50 basis points. This created a back drop to generally improve liquidity and a more favorable environment managing client flows.","However, later in the quarter, market sentiment was mixed at political uncertainty in Europe and U.S. began to resurface. The Italian election and the situation in Cyprus added further complexity to the European outlook. Specifically its events like these that create uncertainty for market participants who struggle to understand the mechanism and approach for resolving sovereign issues within the Eurozone. Likewise in the U.S., our clients' focused on the potential negative impact to sequestration and the continued impacts related to budget negotiations.","In aggregate, as the quarter progressed, these concerns impacted both client activity and risk appetite. Client activity levels were mixed across our investment banking businesses during the quarter. Debt underwriting activity continued at the robust pace we experienced in the fourth quarter as corporate issuers took advantage of the low interest rate environment and strong investor demand.","Equity underwriting activity improved sequentially with higher issuance activity, but is still relatively muted by historic standards. And announced M&A volumes were down 37% sequentially. Macroeconomic uncertainty has been an understandable and consistent theme following the onset of the financial crisis and had quite naturally led many of our clients to approach strategic decisions with greater caution, as CEO confidence is such an important input to M&A and IPO activity, continued improvement in the macro environment will be a key driver of opportunity in these businesses. Regardless of the macro uncertainty, our people remain focused on serving our clients by providing them with superior advice and execution and of course the capital necessarily to meet their goals.","I'll now run through each of our businesses. Investment Banking produced first quarter net revenues of 1.6 billion, up 12% from the fourth quarter. First quarter advisory revenues were 484 million, down 5% sequentially. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide completed M&A. We advised on a number of important transactions that closed in the first quarter, including the 21 billion Swedish Krona sale of Ahold stake in ICA to Hakon Invest. The $3.3 billion sale of select SuperValu assets to an investor group led by Cerberus Capital Management, and the $2.4 billion sale on McGraw-Hill Education to Apollo.","We're also an advisor on a number of significant announced transactions. These include the $23.3 billion sale of Virgin Media to Liberty Global, the $6.7 billion sale of Repsol's liquefied natural gas assets to Royal Dutch Shell, and the $2.6 billion acquisition by Orix Corporation of a 90% equity stake in Robeco Group. First quarter underwriting net revenues were 1.1 billion, up 21% sequentially, a record debt underwriting quarter with revenues up 17% to 694 million. In particular, this reflects significantly higher net revenues from leverage finance and commercial mortgage-related activity.","Equity underwriting revenues of 390 million were up 28% from the fourth quarter, reflecting an increase in IPO activity and secondary offerings. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in global equity and equity-related common stock offerings and IPOs. During the first quarter, there were several noteworthy transactions. Sinopec's 3.1 billion private placement ArcelorMittal\u2019s $4 billion dual-tranche equity and mandatory convertible offering, and Intelsat\u2019s  $3.5 billion high yield offering. Our Investment Banking backlog declined modestly from year-end levels.","Let me now turn to institutional client services. Total net revenues were 5.1 billion in the first quarter. These businesses produced stronger results in the seasonally weak fourth quarter, driven by an overall improvement in activity levels and market sentiment. FICC Client Execution net revenues were 3.2 billion in the first quarter, significantly better than the fourth quarter. This quarter's results reflected a broad contribution across businesses. Rates reflected generally higher activity levels as clients reacted to the improved economic outlook at the beginning of the quarter.","Our credit business experienced solid client activity and a favorable market environment with strong issuance trends and generally tighter credit spreads. Mortgages continued to benefit from strong client demand, relatively limited new supply, and improving prices. Our currency business reflected higher levels of client activity. And finally commodity results improved from what was a relatively weak fourth quarter.","Turning to equities, net revenues for the first quarter were $1.9 billion. Excluding the $500 million gain from the sale of our hedge fund administration business in the fourth quarter, results were up 7% quarter-over-quarter. Equities client execution revenues were 809 million, up 6% sequentially; commissions and fees were 793 million, up 10% from the fourth quarter on improved market volumes and generally higher market values in Europe and Asia. Excluding the one-time gain in the fourth quarter, security services net revenues of $320 million were roughly flat sequentially. With respect to risk, average daily VaR in the first quarter was $76 million, consistent with fourth quarter levels.","Let me now review Investing & Lending. We produced net revenues of $2.1 billion in the first quarter. Investing & Lending includes direct investing, investing we do through funds, as well as lending activities. These activities occur across a diversified set of asset classes including both equity and debt. Other equity investments generated net revenues of $1.1 billion, primarily reflecting gains from private equity investments.","This strong performance reflects higher global equity prices during the quarter as well as increases in fair value driven by company specific events. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $566 million, driven by continued tightening of credit spreads as well as interest income. Our investment in ICBC produced a $24 million gain in the quarter, other revenues of $375 million were driven by the firm\u2019s consolidated investment entities.","Switching over to investment management, we reported first quarter net revenues of $1.3 billion, down 13% from the fourth quarter due to lower incentive fees. Management and other fees were consistent with the fourth quarter at $1.1 billion. During the first quarter, assets under supervision increased $3 billion to $968 billion, primarily reflecting net market appreciation and net inflows in both fixed income and equity assets, partially offset by outflows and money market assets.","Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior-year equity awards, and other items such as payroll  taxes and benefits was accrued at a compensation  to net revenue ratio of 43%, which is a 100 basis points lower than the firm\u2019s accrual  in the first quarter of 2011 and 2012. Over the past two years, we\u2019ve focused extensively on cost reduction and efficiency efforts.","From the headcount perspective, total staff at the end of the first quarter was approximately $32,000, down 1% from the end of 2012 and 10% from year-end 2010. First quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.4 billion, significantly lower than the fourth quarter due largely to lower other expenses. In the fourth quarter, other expenses included higher litigation and regulatory expenses and higher charitable contributions. Non-comp expenses was essentially unchanged from the first quarter of 2012, and our effective tax rate was 33% for the first quarter.","In terms of capital, there are a number of items to cover with you. During the quarter, we repurchased 10.1 million shares of common stock for a total cost of $1.5 billion. These repurchases reflected the completion of our 2012 capital plan. We also recently amended the terms of our warrant agreement with Berkshire Hathaway to acquire  net share settlement on October 1st of this year. At the end of the first quarter, our Basel 1 Tier 1 common ratio was approximately 12.7%. This includes the revised market rich framework that became effective on January 1st. Our estimated Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was approximately 9%, of course with all the caveats that the rule has not been finalized. During the first quarter, the Federal Reserve announced that it did not object to our proposed capital actions that as required by the Federal Reserve we will resubmit our capital plan by the end of the third quarter incorporating certain enhancements to our stress test processes. We intend to work closely with the Federal Reserve to implement these enhancements.","Before I take questions, let me close with a few summary thoughts. As I mentioned earlier macro uncertainty continues to be a meaningful consideration for the global marketplace. While the environment is slowly improving, there will clearly be bumps along the way. So despite an improvement in the outlook some uncertainty remains. Another uncertainty that has occupied investor\u2019s minds is the potential impact of regulatory reform on our industry. While everyone would like clarity, it's natural for these rules to be developed over multi-year timeframes, especially given the complexity and the potentially significant ramifications for the global economy. As a firm we remain a constructive participant in these discussions.","We understand the importance of creating a safe financial system while meeting our client needs and supporting global economic growth at the same time. In light of the continued macro uncertainty, we\u2019ve continued to stay focused on managing the firms risk exposures, capital usage and our expense base. It has allowed our people to be principally focused on serving our clients. We believe the combination of our operating discipline and our steady investment in our client franchise has us well positioned competitively. In addition, it has provided the firm with the opportunity to generate significant operating leverage as the environment improves.","Regardless of the operating environment, we will continue to rely on the strength of our client relationships, the diversity of our businesses, the caliber of our people, and the adaptability embedded in our culture to deliver superior results for our shareholders.","With that, I'd like to thank you again for listening today, and I'm now happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Your first question is from the line of Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","Hello.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Hello, yes.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","Hi, Harvey. I was hoping to get your takeaways on the 2013 CCAR now that it's all set and  done, there was some disparity on the PPNR and stress ratios between you and the Fed, and I was just wondering how that impacts your view on capital planning or running that process internally if it does at all?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So when we think about capital planning, obviously first and foremost Howard, we think about making sure that we strike that careful balance between making sure that we have capital from a defensive  perspective, but also we want it to be positioned for the opportunities for our clients, and we manage that process obviously dynamically as we go through. Specifically with respect to the CCAR, what I would say is we don't have visibility into their numbers. So, I really can't comment to any extent on the differences between our submission. I know when we go through our submission, we think about the event and we approach it from a very conservative framework. Did I answer your question, Howard?","Operator","Okay. And we'll move on to the next question. It's from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.","Hi. How are you?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Fine, Glenn. How are you?","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.","All right. Curious with the market up so much and sluggish revenue backdrop across the industries and everything that we know about balance sheet and cheap debt, normally this would be a pretty good world for M&A, but of course there are some bigger overhangs out there. I'm just curious to see what you're seeing? You made a comment about pipelines, but as a general comment as you look out the next year plus why don't we have a better M&A backdrop? I mean that backdrop is good, why isn't there better M&A activity?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So, I think and I highlighted in my prepared remarks, I really think it's a question of we're very close still to the epicenter of the crisis at least in the context of history, right? And so people's memories are very fresh. And when you have periods of uncertainty, as I said bumps along the way, like events in Europe or big shifts in employment data and economic growth, it doesn't translate well when you think about CEOs who are making what obviously is the most significant decision they're making for the organization strategically. And so, I think it's going to be a bit of a lagging indicator, because it will be one of those things that when we really have stability and confidence, you'll start to see it come out of the pipeline. Having said that, obviously we feel really good about our position competitively in our M&A franchise, and it really is just a question of when activity picks up.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.","Okay.","Harvey M. Schwartz","But I wish I could tell you when.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.","I hear you. Investing & Lending, is there anything you can tell us in terms of much realized this quarter, I mean markets were up huge, so I would imagine that there were some gains along the way, but a lot of that is marks?","Harvey M. Schwartz","It really was in line with broad equity markets, so in the past, we have pointed you to the MSCI, and so there are going to be periods where we obviously outperform that because of the idiosyncratic nature of the portfolio on periods where we underperformed, but more or less in line.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.","And you still -- there's a decent private component to it, so I'm assuming that there's still some big liquidity discounts used on the private positions?","Harvey M. Schwartz","I don't know that I'd say -- I do want to be careful about the word liquidity discounts. What I'd say that we're, as you would expect us to be very thorough in terms of how we mark the portfolio and as well as our orders, so yeah, these things will be in line with the market as appropriate.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.","Understood. And then in commodities, I get the component of the business that would be weak due to just trending lower prices and less structured transactions. Is there anything on the regulatory front that\u2019s changing how you do business, how you think about the business going forward, or is it strictly a cyclical phenomenon  right now closing the weakness?","Harvey M. Schwartz","No, there is nothing on the regulatory environment that\u2019s impacting the way we think about the business, specifically no, of course there are lot of rules to come, and so we will get more visibility in commodities and other businesses could be impacted as we see \u2013 as we get more transparency, but there is nothing in the regulatory aspects of it.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.","Okay, excellent. Thank you, Harvey.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Roger Freeman with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Hi. Good morning.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Hey, Roger.","Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Hi. The Volcker Rule presumably getting pushed out further, I guess, latest reports are not until sometime during the second half. How do you view that good or bad being the uncertainty lasts longer good as potentially better outcome?","Harvey M. Schwartz","I think in the end, it\u2019s all about quality rule making process. These are \u2013 and it\u2019s not just Volcker, these are exceptionally complex rules. So, these are obviously incredibly critical, not just with the financial institutions that will limit the rules, but really quite frankly more broadly in terms of their impact on the capital markets, and given the complexity, I think it\u2019s quite natural that these are going to take time to implement. And the regulators themselves -- it\u2019s a massive amount of work that they have to go through to get to a place to introduce these rules. So, I think this process in terms of the time it\u2019s taking, I think we would love to \u2013 I think everyone would like to have the final rule set in front of us, clients would certainly want that, we would want that, our constituents would want that, but I think it\u2019s very natural and on balance, I think if it improves the quality of the rule making, which to-date is what we\u2019ve seen for example in clearing, I think it\u2019s a good thing on balance.","Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And that BDC you\u2019re setting up, is that in anyway tied to sort of you or the regulatory outcome. It seems like that might be investing in things that SSG does?","Harvey M. Schwartz","No; not at all. That\u2019s very much just part of our asset management strategy where we\u2019re managing assets on behalf of our clients as a fiduciary. We obviously have asset core competence in there, credit risk management skills, so no this -- that has nothing to do with Volcker.","Roger Freeman \u2013 Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And one another on the reg front, the -- I guess the first phase of the mandatory clearing has been effective over a  month or so now, any comment on how that -- how that\u2019s going, and specifically anything or you can identify on activity levels like rate and CDS that\u2019s sort of separate from broader market impact?","Harvey M. Schwartz","No, as you know -- and we talked about this a lot in the past, we\u2019re huge proponents of clearing, and obviously that comes with the caveat, the obvious caveat that as long as it is done safely, but in terms of as a mitigant to systemic risk, we think it ranks quite highly, and so we\u2019ve been a huge proponent of it. I think just getting back to the earlier question, I think in terms of things that were delayed, I actually think the delay here was quite thoughtful, and I think the CFTC in their rollout plan by having the first rollout in March, a second wave in June. I mean that\u2019s a very constructive way to approach the market because it gives clients an opportunity particularly the second wave appliance not the most frequent users an opportunity to adjust. And they have a lot of work to do. There are work flow issues, processes et cetera that go into this, and so I think it's been thoughtful. With respect to impact on business activity et cetera, I do think this is one of these things that as we gain more clarity, it definitely provides people the rules that they can operate in, they\u2019re more willing to engage, but it's way too early to measure the impact.","Roger Freeman \u2013 Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, just lastly inventory levels across FICC, I think they were higher in the first quarter. Did they end at around the average of the quarter, any sort of kind of trends coming into this 2Q?","Harvey M. Schwartz","I didn\u2019t hear the very first part of what you said. Did you say, is it inventory or activity?","Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","No, inventory levels.","Harvey M. Schwartz","No, no big trends. Nothing meaningful in terms of inventory.","Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. All right, thanks.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Thanks, Roger.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks. Just on the OTC side, you've just given out we're starting down that process. If you think about the different users in the market, so like corporates, pensions, asset managers, hedge funds and if you look at the increased margin requirement, when they're thinking about alternatives, meaning using a future versus an OTC contract, is there something that Goldman or the deals, particularly on that margin, are disadvantaged? Is there something that you can provide to make that less of an issue, so maybe like on the collateral management side, just trying to figure out because it seems like there's going to be some users that there will be more incentive to try to use an alternative if they don't have the hurdles like hedge accounting, but I don't know if on the dealer side if there's something that you can provide to kind of ease that burden?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Yeah, I think that when -- first of all, I would say the following. We in the industry have lived with uneven requirements in terms of whether its margin or a capital standard and so some of these things are going to run like this. I think as we get the full view of everything that's out there, I think that the regulatory community and all of our as participants will then have to view the extent of which there's differences and understand whether or not those incentives are actually the right incentives in terms of reducing systemic risks because remember, the overarching objective here is to reduce systemic risks and that's again I'd go back to my earlier comment about clearing. So you don't necessarily want to have significantly different collateral requirements for essentially the same type of risks, because then you can get some unwanted incentives. Now having said and putting that aside for a moment, our clients are driven by the long-term incentive goal so they're going to make the best choice they can for executing and at times, collateral maybe a more significant component of their thought process; other times other issues will guide how they execute.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, makes sense. And then just on the market share opportunity, there's a lot of stuff that's shifting around whether it's the increased cost or regulation on the fixed income side, you guide different roles on comp coming out of Europe, maybe foreign entities in the U.S. having different capital requirements going forward. When you got to size up just given the competitive landscape in the different product areas, how much market share opportunity do you think is kind of shifting around and potentially up for grabs over the next, call it one to two years?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So it's a great question. It's a difficult thing to quantify. And so strategically the way we approach it is making sure that, and let's just take for example the security division, if you think about the diverse nature of that business, what you really need to be successful in terms of having scale, but awesome ability to deliver the full range of services to your clients, so whether it's commodities or interest rates or prime brokerage, executing blocks of equities. So furthermore you need to be at scale in this market environment because trying to build I think the headwinds are hard given the activity levels we feel like we are at scale and feel quite good about our position both within those individual businesses but of course geographically also. So I'll have to see over the next several years, but it feels like there's reasonable market share opportunity given the environment, because as I said that's leader in some of these businesses, I think it's a difficult time to build.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, all right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Hi, good morning.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Hi, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","A couple of questions. One on the reinsurance business, you broke that out which is helpful. Just wanted to understand what kind of impact that has on capital relief when that deal closes?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So in the insurance business, we're in the midst of the sale process. So if it's okay, Betsy, I will come back to you with that when the sale process closes. However, as we go through the new capital rules, the driver here was as I mentioned earlier, the amount of capital that business attracts under the new rule set. And so we like that business, but under new capital rules its really better held in other people\u2019s hands and so it just felt like it was appropriate to move forward the sales process, but as it completes we will certainly update you with more info.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then you\u2019ve in the past outlined opportunities for active and passive RWA mitigation, is there any changes at all to the outlook over the next year or two?","Harvey M. Schwartz","No, there are no changes in the outlook. Obviously, we continue to focus on it very closely and I talked about the tools that we\u2019ve been rolling out, that will continues on schedule. So we just continue to work through the process.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Because it just looks like maybe there wasn\u2019t as much this past quarter is in average what you suggested. Is that fair or \u2026?","Harvey M. Schwartz","No, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that, but I think it \u2013 I think its hard to look at it in a quarter-over-quarter period. I think we\u2019ve to look at over longer periods, but we\u2019re comfortable with our progress.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Sure. Okay. And do you give details just on numerator-denominator on the Basel III, the RWAs for example?","Harvey M. Schwartz","No, we\u2019ve not.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Good morning. Its like a follow-up with a couple of questions on the commodities business, there was a blurb last week that you might be selling the metals warehousing unit, I was just wondering if there was any comment you could provide on that?","Harvey M. Schwartz","No, we have no comment, although the only thing I would say that, I don\u2019t want those things come out and they\u2019re picked up in the press, they often have not knock on question that relate to our commitment to commodities or anything like (inaudible) we got into that business in 1981 and have invested a huge amount in being a market leader, so we\u2019re very committed to that business.","Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then just related to just commodities pricing that we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of days, obviously a lot of volatility and maybe its too early to know, but is this potentially good for the business because maybe volumes increase or bad because there was just too much volatility or again maybe too early to know.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Well, its definitely too early, but it's really a question of degree of volatility and causes. I think some of the volatility we have seen particularly in commodities it looks more like liquidation of crowded positions. So, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into it. And in all the time investors will digest the information and then that will translate these either into expanded client activity or not. But I think in the near term the action is what I said, mostly liquidation.","Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just separately some other firms have talked about structured products being a little bit better in 1Q and I would assume that\u2019s somewhat broad based, but any thoughts on what's driving that, is it just as clients look for yield or optimism over the economy or a combination of both?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Yeah, I can\u2019t comment on anything else, any of what the competitor said. What I would say is that and you certainly see it in terms of yield activity and it was reflected in the quarter in respect to both issuers -- the opportunity issuers have to issue and obviously investor appetite as people search for yield.","Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess any thoughts on, I mean rates have been so low for so long and obviously this is broadly an area that\u2019s been fairly quite and it seemed to pick up quite a bit at 1Q so it just seems like rates have been low for a while and it was a combination of that in the economy or?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Well there\u2019s certainly, there\u2019s certainly a cycle of reinvestment that\u2019s occurring. I think back to last year a capital committee we were reviewing financing opportunities for our clients, committing capital, bringing things to market and many often \u2013 many times those same clients were back six to nine months later in a position to refinance because of the compression of credit spread and the market appetite. But if you\u2019re asking me when that will change, that\u2019s a question I definitely don\u2019t ever view on and I can guarantee I\u2019ll do wrong.","Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Hi, Mike.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.","Hi. So your prior ROE target was 20%. You haven't given a new target I don't know. You were 12% this quarter. Can you just give us some sense what sort of ROE you guys would hope to have over several years?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So with respect to the ROE, it's an important question Mike and we still don't have enough information in terms of capital rules, all the regulatory activity to give you a view. What I will tell you is that we remain very focused on our returns, both on our relative and absolute basis and certainly in the way that we're deploying and managing the balance sheet.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.","And you said your Basel III tier and common ratio was about 9%. With your passive strategies if they were all done today, what would that 9% ratio be?","Harvey M. Schwartz","We haven't updated that, Mike.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.","Okay. And I guess -- I won't get an answer to the active strategies either. I'm just trying to figure out how much potential there is with both the passive and the active strategies for managing the risks with the assets to create a whole lot more capital, because it seems like you're willing to buyback a lot of stock here. You bought an average price of $150, the stocks below there, so why not be even more aggressive I guess?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Well, with respect to capital, first of all, in terms of the ratio, you're going to see the work as we do it. So we want to present it to you. I'm sure there's a whole lot of value for guessing it. In terms of how we think about share repurchase and how managing the capital dynamically from quarter-to-quarter, we're going to make adjustments as we work through. And so if we think the best use of our capital is to return it, we'll do that. And if we think it's best to deploy in the business, we'll do that.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.","And then just lastly a separate question. In terms of rightsizing the business, how do you know if you've downsized too much you or your competition? Some are cutting a lot more than others and how do you know what's the right amount when you've cut too much?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Right. So that's a great question because if you look back over the past two years, in some respects if you knew you were going to end up down 10% in headcount, you would have rather done that on day one rather than take two years to do it, okay. We don't have a crystal ball. This is a really important strategic point about how we have to think about the business. First and foremost, we need to be there for our clients in all aspects of our business; Investment Banking, Asset Management, Securities Division. And so we can't shape the opportunities, instead we can only shape how we respond and compete with other market participants. And so we're constantly reviewing it and that's why you've seen us take the steps that you've seen us take. Right now for the current environment, we feel quite comfortable. If the opportunities had expanded and the environment can improve, you could see us deploying more resources and likewise. If the environment was to trend downward, I think you'd see us responding there too of course.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous. Please go ahead.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP","Good morning. So I'm looking at your FICC revenues, if I adjust them for DDA year-over-year and I look at the percentage change. You're down about 9% and the couple of big peers that have reported so far are also down but more like mid-single digits. You've identified the drag on the year-over-year comparison as being rate products, but I would expect that some of those other guys who are more sort of big banks would have been maybe more by that just based on mix. Are we still seeing a process of [assessment] to your business mix towards the new regulatory realities and can you comment maybe on the revenue mix between cash and derivative instruments on a year-over-year basis?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Those quarter-over-quarter numbers we don't view those as a big deal. There is -- I don't think there's a lot of information in there. If the numbers were completely reversed, I wouldn't be pointing -- I wouldn't be pointing you to that as a material item. There's going to be noise in the numbers back and forth and we feel quite comfortable with the position of our FICC business. But again just a problem that a little bit, you talked before about the opportunity relative to the some of the issues that a lot of the European banks are facing and I believe that Goldman Sachs should be able to actually benefit pretty meaningfully from some of that. Is that something that we\u2019re going to see longer term and again I\u2019m going to come back to this idea that given that you\u2019re seeing some change in the regulatory environment because of the change in OTC protocols and everything else, are you making changes to your business in the short-term debt or that are driving short-term revenue contraction and preparing yourself for some of these market share opportunities longer term or is there is something else that I\u2019m kind of missing here, as I tried out to figure out what\u2019s going on?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Yeah, so \u2013 okay, it is a very important question, so I want to make sure I\u2019m clear on that. So, in terms of again the quarter-over-quarter I don\u2019t think there is a lot of read through for you there. I think in terms of the opportunities that as it relates to the \u2013 to regulatory issues, really difficult to speculate on for example the impact of clearing swap execution facilities we don\u2019t have yet and many of the rules are still outstanding. If you ask me I think as you get more clarity rule set, clients respond well to that. Now with respect to how we adjust, this is the strategic issue. You can \u2013 and I covered this, I don\u2019t know, if you saw I covered this a bit at the Credit Suisse conference back in February, but one of the things that we\u2019ve found is that trying to anticipate rules can be quite costly and you can make major mistakes. The mortgage business being a really concrete example of when you first saw the Notice for Proposed Rulemaking for mortgages a couple of years ago versus responding to final rules. So, you\u2019re not seeing us dial down or up our businesses in anticipation of rules. With respect to market share opportunities, those are all always in my experience multi-year events and they will play out over time.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP","Okay. That\u2019s actually very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Good morning, just a couple of I guess relatively quick questions. We\u2019ve heard from a couple of your competitors that the client activity levels over the course of the first quarter was sort of strongest in the first -- earlier part of the quarter, weakest or absent in March. I guess I\u2019m curious given that your assets were up about 11% quarter-over-quarter, but borrow was stable. Can you give us a sense as to sort of what your activity levels were over the course of the quarter and what the level of I guess, conversations were in the advisory businesses over the course of the quarter?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So client activity as I said in my prepared remarks was \u2013 it was more active really in the first month of the quarter and then it slowed down a bit in March based on just the data that came through. And what we have seen is that clients whether it's in the advisory business or those on the investing side are obviously very sensitive to data and information. And so for example as issues started to come back more on to front screens as it relates to issues in Europe, clients obviously pulled back towards the end of the quarter. But I would say that overall the trend in terms of outlook feels like it's continuing to improve steady, but it's not going to be a straight line from here to there and so our strategy during this time period obviously is to stay extremely focused on our clients. It is an environment where there is, you can really compete on content with your clients because there is uncertainty that you\u2019re dealing with.","Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Right. And then just back on a quick question on I&L, can you \u2013 given the strong performance of the markets in the quarter, did that incent you to potentially accelerate a bit of your realizations in the first quarter given the strong performance of the markets or was that pretty much at steady state?","Harvey M. Schwartz","It's always going to be a function of the market and idiosyncratic events, and obviously I said there was a correlation. But there aren\u2019t things \u2013 we don\u2019t look opportunistically and the market will give us opportunities.","Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","And I guess just back to VaR, given the volatility in the market of Cypress in March, did that have a meaningful impact on VaR over the course of the quarter?","Harvey M. Schwartz","No. With respect to VaR over the quarter, it was virtually unchanged from the fourth quarter\u2026","Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Right.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Well, you see a bigger drop is from first quarter last year to this year, but that's virtually all driven by market volatilities.","Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. Thank you.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank","Good morning.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Morning.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank","So a question on the competition for talent here and maybe potential impact on expense flexibility. Could you give us some color on what you're seeing so far and maybe where you guys trying to signal something in that regard with the moderate drop in comp ratio? I know where you guys peg it in the first nine months, it almost turns out to be arbitrary given how big the fourth quarter delta is, but was that something you were trying to get across?","Harvey M. Schwartz","No. In terms of talent, quite frankly it feels like one of the better market environments we've seen in quite a long time. Our ability to acquire and add people to our team seems pretty good. And in terms of attrition, attrition is very manageable. And it's not reflected at all in how we think about the competition ratio.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank","Okay. And then a follow-up on Howard's question. Is there any color you can give on the resubmission process, how those discussions are going with the Fed? Maybe any granular specifics about what drove that request and such?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So we don't have any color yet and to the extent which we can share it over time, we will. Of course, it's supervisory level data but whatever we can share over time, we will. What I will say is that as a firm that invested a lot of time and energy both in terms of analytics but culturally around risk, we always look for opportunities to learn. And so we'll work closely with the Fed or with the Federal Reserve over the next six months. And we look forward to enhancing any process changes we make.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank","Okay. And I guess following up on that the idea of learning is we're going through this. Given that we now are starting to see the impact of the stress test as we move closer to Basel III and some of these rules start getting implemented and included in stress test, do you continue to think that firms with large comps or global investment banks running with about a 10% tier 1 common ratio is realistic, or do you think that it might end up working out higher than that given how the stress test process has been going so far?","Harvey M. Schwartz","I think it's too early to tell and I do think -- but what I will say is the stress test is a really good concept and quite frankly it there was a version on the stress test prior to the crisis, maybe it would have had some mitigating effects in terms of the crisis. But it's evolutionary and it's complex, and so we'll have to see how it evolves.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank","Okay. And then last one from me is just sort of a net question. Incentive comp in investment management stood out as pretty high particularly given it's the first quarter. Was there anything specific behind that or were it just the strong markets?","Harvey M. Schwartz","No, I think you're referring, sorry, just to incentive fees\u2026","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank","Yup.","Harvey M. Schwartz","No, there was\u2026.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank","I'm sorry, yeah, incentive fees.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Yeah, I'm sorry, it's okay. No, nothing specific to highlight for you.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Christopher Wheeler with Mediobanca. Please go ahead.","Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca Securities","Yes, good morning. Three questions if I may. The first one is on the VaR, just interested in the increase in the currency and rates. Obviously -- and anyway you don't normally see too much movement, but you seemed to have seen the increase there. Perhaps give us some background on that? Second question is on revenue mix. I think 59% of the revenues last year in the United States, I wondered if you could give us a flavor for whether that has changed much in the first quarter, given obviously how rather more vast the U.S. markets were? And then finally just to follow-up really on that question on the realizations in I&L on equities, because I think you had about 120 billion of Basel III [RWA] in the end of the year and I wondered had that moved a great deal on the back of the gains you've made, and really what sort of progress you want to make on that over the next 12 months? Thank you very much.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Okay. So, let me make sure, I rattle through those. So, on VaR, so as you know, VaR is measured with a lag. Our VaR I think relative to competitive reason we\u2019re heavily weighted to the more recent observable time period, so about 50% of the contribution. But there is nothing meaningful in those shifts and they reflect generally speaking client activity and obviously the result in position. So there is nothing meaningful about VaR. The more \u2013 I think more significant observation that everybody should take away with the one I made with respect to last year versus this year, and that as market volatility is increased I think you can easily see increasing VaR over time, but perhaps with the same position profile. So people shouldn\u2019t be \u2013 we\u2019re certainly not lulled into any complacency as a result of the fact that the VaR signal is low because that\u2019s mostly driven by market volatilities. With respect to your second question on business mix, its nothing significant we would highlight for you there obviously as you would expect activity in Europe towards the end of the quarter a little more impact, a little more impacted but it really just natural outcome of client activity. And so where you see uncertainty, client activity obviously is going to be impacted. But I wouldn\u2019t say that the mix is used materially. When you asked a question on I&L, your last question \u2026","Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca Securities","Yeah.","Harvey M. Schwartz","\u2026 you had \u2013 I think also a question on I&L, we\u2019re going to continue to manage that business as we have in the past and so that is obviously about investment selection, but that includes obviously the lending activities, the debt and equity, so it\u2019s a diversified portfolio, its diversified geographically and so, we will continue to manage that business we have in the past. So nothing really to comment there.","Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca Securities","Thank you very much. Thank you.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Sure.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Douglas Sipkin with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group","Yeah, hi, good morning. Two questions. First, can you just sort of update us on the framework or thinking around capital usage at this very point, obviously you\u2019ve talked about capacity coming out of some businesses. The stock is at about $143. You have a pretty significant authorization, so any change in the philosophy there? Or is it sort of \u2013 should we be thinking about the 2012 dynamic? And then on the Asset Management side, I know \u2013 not mentioned yet, but it did look like you guys had one of your better quarters in a while with respect to some long-term flows and I\u2019m just wondering if there was anything you guys could attribute that to? Thanks.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Sure. In terms of capital no there is nothing there and with respect to -- asset management we obviously continued to stay very focused on performance and improved performance always attracts client flows and we\u2019re still missing that.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group","So if I could just follow up at the first question I guess, when we think about repurchase activity I mean the framework for 2012 is a reasonable framework for \u201913, is that a fair statement?","Harvey M. Schwartz","I wouldn\u2019t extrapolate 2012 into 2013, because it will be based on the environment and so if we see continued improving opportunities which again will be driven by our clients then we may deploy capital into the business and it's a balance.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group","Got you. Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Fred Cannon with KBW. Please go ahead.","Frederick Cannon - KBW","Hi, so I just had a follow up on the BDC issue on the Liberty Harbor, I was wondering if you might be able to kind of size the opportunity there in terms of growth you mentioned it as part of kind of an asset under management and also if that\u2019s part of a broader strategy to kind of attack mid-size firms?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Well it's not a strategy to sort of be targeted against any firm. It really is just again what I said earlier about the point our compensations, the opportunities that we feel our clients are interested in and would benefit from. And so, we\u2019ll have to see how the business grows over time but of course this will be a multi-year effort. And I think it really gets to the point that we\u2019re always looking for opportunities and new products to introduce that our clients want to utilize.","Frederick Cannon - KBW","Okay. And then just another \u2013 one other follow-up by, you\u2019ve addressed a lot of the issues about the U.S. regulatory environment. I was wondering if you could comment on some of the issues going on in Europe particularly the push for a financial transaction tax.","Harvey M. Schwartz","So of course we\u2019re monitoring all that and we\u2019ll engage with regulators in terms of discussion, of course it's unclear at this point exactly how this will ultimately be adopted so it's really not possible at this stage to ask me to give a little impact. I guess I would say that when evaluating any of these rules, all the market participants, obviously we all have a huge obligation, regulators and clients and ourselves to make sure that we strike the right balance because we want to make sure that we're insuring that the best capital markets are build with proper liquidity and so these are important things.","Frederick Cannon - KBW","And then along those lines, I guess I would just kind of follow-up is, is there any sense of kind of where regulation seems to be headed to be the most ownerless, whether it's Europe or the U.S. or does it feel like it's the same kind of across the globe?","Harvey M. Schwartz","No, I don't know if I'd say ownerless. I think I'd say that if there was a consistent pattern, I think generally speaking for the rules that have been proposed versus how they've been finalized, they generally start in one place. There's been engagement with market participants and they generally have migrated to a place that's better for the capital markets.","Frederick Cannon - KBW","All right. Thanks so much.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Sure.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC. Please go ahead.","Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets, LLC","Good morning. I just have two quick questions. One was on the issue of Basel III where I'm struggling to reconcile what's happened with the new market risk rules. It looked to me like it came in a bit better, because you talked about 350 basis points of improvements and I thought I'd see that in the [RWAs] under Basel III and I wondered if you could talk about why that's not the case? And the second issue is just if you have any comments on security services just in terms of year-on-year, there a seasonal impact or is there anything in particular you wanted to note? Thanks.","Harvey M. Schwartz","So on the second question, nothing in particular to note. The only other thing I would say with respect to the ratios, you're right, reference what we -- I think you're referring to what we put in the 10-K. And so it was in the 10-K. So obviously the performance for the quarter and also we received some feedback from the Fed despite the numbers which improved them.","Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets, LLC","But then what I can't quite understand is why we didn't see that in the Basel III number because obviously it's part of the components?","Harvey M. Schwartz","No, well, I did say approximately, so I'm not going to specific guess the number but it is improving there as well.","Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets, LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jeff Harte with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Harte - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.","Hi, good morning. Kind of a macro thought question thinking about the FICC revenue outlook and I guess I'm specifically thinking we've been waiting for higher margin businesses like mortgages to pick up for a while. Now that we're seeing it, we're actually kind of seeing thick decline but I had a little trouble balancing between the importance of larger what I usually think of as being lower margin businesses like rates versus the smaller of a typically much higher margin businesses like mortgages?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So as the activity picks up, obviously you're going to see it. But I think the key for us is the diversity of the franchise. And so as I said earlier, we just want to make sure strategically that -- and we're far from perfect and there's always work we can do on improving our businesses and we stay very focused on that. But we want to make sure that we're positioned within each one of the businesses where we really get the benefit in a market environment like this is the diversity both within products but also geographically.","Jeffrey Harte - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.","Should we kind of sitting here today be happy because we see mortgages picking up or should we be more concerned that rates are probably not going to hit the revenue levels that is did historically?","Harvey M. Schwartz","We don't. I don't know if I'll describe it as happy or sad. I think again we have to -- we don't create the environment, we just have to make sure we're best positioned for our clients to respond to it. So for example right now as you point out and I mentioned in the earlier comment, a bit improvement in housing. There's also been investors desirous of yield and so you see things starting to turn off in terms of the mortgage business, but it may not correlate for example with the rate business which is why I highlighted the diversity aspect. It will be the case -- we don't expect necessarily very frequently all the cylinders to fire at the same time.","Jeffrey Harte - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.","Okay. And as we're thinking about comp expense, what should we -- and this may have been touched on but what, if anything, should we read into a year-over-year decline in the accrual ratio, despite I&L actually being a smaller portion of revenues year-over-year, I mean should we be looking for continued comp expense efficiency-driven improvements going forward?","Harvey M. Schwartz","No, there are no change to the way we thought about the compensation ratio this year versus prior years and just to be thorough as you know and we talked about this a lot, it's driven by performance other issues the competitive dynamic and what's happening in a broader environment and in the end it's our best estimate. Now what I would say is that certainly the expense efforts that, and the controlled efforts we put in over the past two years give us some degree of flexibility and that\u2019s represented in the number.","Jeffery Harte - Sandler O'Neill & Partners","Okay. So your best estimate now is lower than your best estimate a year ago and can I paraphrase to say that\u2019s at least partially structurally driven, as opposed to business mix driven?","Harvey M. Schwartz","I think about it that exactly, I think that\u2019s fine.","Jeffery Harte - Sandler O'Neill & Partners","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thanks. Harvey, I just wanted to return to the VaR issue. Most of my questions have already been answered, but you made a comment, I just want to make sure I understood it, which was that \u2013 that we should directionally expect the VaR dollars to increase but in a similar mix of categories. Is that correct?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So what I was trying to say was the following. So, there\u2019s obviously multiple inputs that go into the VaR calculation. One dominant factor obviously is market volatilities that we experience during the process. So, for us there\u2019s a bit more of a waiting towards the more recent time period, roughly 50% of the VaR calculation is impacted by the last three month volatilities and so when we saw what I was trying to was just draw a line under the 95% from last year, I think it was down to 76% this quarter and that is coming mostly by drop \u2013 a decline in implied volatility in the market place.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Not from position change and what I was really saying was it wouldn\u2019t surprise me at some point the volatility will increase, who knows. It could be soon, it could be a long time from now. But I also wouldn\u2019t read too much into my comment.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay, so I guess the real crux of my question now is that it sounds like based on what you\u2019re seeing from client activities that this trend VaR profile would remain pretty consistent without any changes in broader volatility?","Harvey M. Schwartz","That\u2019s too hard for me to predict, I mean if you\u2019re basically saying the second quarters were exactly the same as the first quarter it might look like that, but I think clients are going to drive activity as they always do and it's a dynamic world.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Great. Thanks very much.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer & Co. Please go ahead.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Hi, Chris.","Christoph Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.","Yeah, hi. I just wanted to see if I could pin you down on the compensation question with a little bit more specialties at the end. Should we read into that decline that the Goldman Sachs Company is dedicated to achieving positive operating leverage, in the sense that if revenues are flat to up by when we see the fourth quarter number the compensation ratio should be slightly down.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Yeah, I don\u2019t want to attach too much to the compensation ratio itself. What I would think was that, you should a 100% assume that in all aspects of our business we\u2019re always looking for operating leverage. And at the same time we\u2019re making sure we find that balance between how we compete for talent, compete against our competitors in Uruguay and most importantly how we serve our clients.","Christoph Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.","Okay, fair enough. Thank you.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with The Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research","Hi, good morning. Just one follow-up on the derivatives reform, with the May 1 deadline looming for signing up clients with for them to register for swaps trading. Do you see that as an issue in terms of activity levels? Do you think it gets extended, how do you think of \u2013 how should we think about that impact this quarter?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So this is again one of these things that\u2019s really, really difficult to predict and so we\u2019ll monitor and -- one other things that we\u2019ve learned in terms of regulatory changes and market structure changes is that, the key is lessen our predicting effort outcomes and more about responding to them. And so we have a long history of adapting and so as these rules become [live], we're going to have to adapt as our clients. And we'll have to adapt better than our competitors. Historically, we've been good at that but we'll have to deliver in the future.","James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research","Fair enough. Maybe taking a little bit of a longer term view as you get more prepared for and moving things to clearing and increasing electronification of FICC, do you see offsets here? What's your view on how expenses react to greater electronification and should that offset, I guess, most people's view of declining revenues in that type of environment?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So again, difficult to predict so I think it's better to look at history of the guide. The electronification of FICC has been obviously happening for a number of years. You go back to early part of 2000 with the advent of trade web and government bond and then simultaneously the foreign exchange markets. So, electronification is not new to us, even FICC and obviously equities broadly. And so it's for us, the electronification I think is a bit of a muscle memory issue and of course as you know, we think we have some competitive advantage given than we have one platform in (inaudible) which when will it become final and as markets become more electronic, a lot of this is about speed and ability to adopt new procedures and respond because that's what our clients need. And so with respect to the forward, obviously there's some operating efficiencies that can be gained. You may get new revenue development and new products, but I think those things are much harder to forecast. You really have to look at our experience in terms of how we're done it.","James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research","So I guess if we look at equities, it did seem like you had following more electronic, moved to commission you had less volatility and better returns. Do you think that that's a logical outcome for fixed income as well?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Again, like I said, I think if you look at the case study and we didn't -- and Dane I think can walk you through more specific examples offline. But if you look just at us, case study of equities, foreign exchange, government bond trading, et cetera, I think our history is good but we have to execute.","James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research","Okay, fair enough. Thanks.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions.","Dane E. Holmes","Great. This is Dane Holmes.

This call is being recorded today, April 16, 2015.","Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.","Dane Holmes","Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the Firm's belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain and outside of the Firm's control. The Firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements.","For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the Firm's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2014. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, Global Core Liquid Assets, and supplementary leverage ratio, and you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that's posted on the Investor Relations portion of our web site at www.gs.com. This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent.","Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, will now review the Firm's results. Harvey?","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks Dane and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I will walk you through the first quarter results, and I am happy to answer any questions.","Net revenues were $10.6 billion; net earnings $2.8 billion; earnings per diluted share, were $5.94, and our annualized return on common equity was 14.7%. The first quarter was dominated by one primary theme, central bank policies. In the United States, the market heavily debated whether 2015 would be the year that the Federal Reserve raises rates. On the other hand, the European Central Bank announced the creation of a \u20ac1.1 trillion quantitative easing program that kicked off in March.","The prospect of two of the world's largest economies, implementing divergent monetary policies had a significant impact. Market participants reassess the implications for both global economic growth, and as a consequence, the performance of various financial assets.","Regarding the economic outlook, on one hand, low rates are viewed as providing an important economic stimulus to the United States. On the other hand, a return to normalized rates would be consistent with a strong underlying economy.","Looking at the bigger picture, the degree of conviction around a slow but stable U.S. recovery continued to gain support for most of the quarter. The weaker recent jobs report in the U.S. has sparked some debate around the timing and magnitude of potential rate hikes. However, the long term expectation of slow, but steady growth and higher rates, remains intact.","Across the Atlantic, the announcement of quantitative easing in Europe provided some stability and the basis for greater economic growth in the region. The launch of a \u20ac60 billion per month purchasing program provided greater confidence to market participants on the Eurozone outlook. The impact was immediately felt across European financial markets.","If you take the European government bond market for example, more than a quarter of the bonds are trading with negative yields today. The equity markets in Europe rallied, as demonstrated by the 18% increase in the Euro Stoxx 50 Index during the quarter, and the Euro reached its lowest level versus the dollar in 12 years. As a result, there was greater activity as clients responded to heightened market volatility.","Given the scope, complexity and significance of these two different monetary policies, it isn't surprising, that there continues to be a robust discussion around the potential impacts.","For our firm, the focus continues to be our clients and serving their needs. Our clients are placing a greater premium on both intellectual and financial capital, given market dynamics and an evolving competitive landscape. We are committed to providing our clients with superior advice, investment performance, content, market liquidity, and certainty of execution. We believe that our extensive capabilities favorably position us to meet a variety of client needs, in what is certainly a dynamic market environment.","Now I will discuss each of our businesses. Investment Banking produced first quarter revenues of $1.9 billion, up 32% from the fourth quarter. Our Investment Banking backlog decreased since the end of the year, but its still up significantly, relative to a year ago.","Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the first quarter, advisory revenues were $961 million, the highest since 2007. This 39% increase relative to the fourth quarter reflects both the increase in completed M&A, and the strength of our leading global franchise. In the quarter, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&A. We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the first quarter, including Allergan's $71 billion sale to Activis; RWE's \u20ac5.1 billion sale of RWE-DEA, [indiscernible] Group, and Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company's $5.7 billion acquisition of Protective Life Corporation.","We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the first quarter; these include, MeadWestvaco's merger with Rock-Tenn for a combined enterprise value of $20 billion; Charter Communications' $10.4 billion acquisition of Bright House Networks; and Dow Chemicals' $5 billion separation of its chlor-alkali and downstream businesses, to Olin Corporation.","Moving to Underwriting, revenues were $944 million in the first quarter, up 26% sequentially as equity issuance improved. During the quarter, we ranked first in Global Equity and Equity Related and Common Stock offerings. Equity Underwriting revenues of $533 million rose 56% compared to the fourth quarter, largely due to an increase in secondary offerings. Debt underwriting revenues were essentially unchanged at $411 million.","During the first quarter, we actively supported our client's financing needs, leading Santander's \u20ac7.5 billion follow-on equity offering; Chevron's AUD4.7 billion sale of its stake in Caltex Australia; and Berkshire Hathaway's \u20ac3 billion investment grade issuance.","Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and Equities businesses, net revenues were $5.5 billion in the first quarter, up significantly compared to the fourth quarter. FICC client execution net revenues were $3.1 billion in the first quarter, and included $32 million of DVA losses. Net revenues were up more than 2.5 times sequentially, as client activity increased in a number of our businesses, in response to higher volatility and improved market conditions. Interest rates and currencies were both significantly higher sequentially, as client activity improved amid diverging central bank policies.","Credit increased significantly from a more challenging fourth quarter, as credit spreads generally tighten during the first quarter. Mortgages also rose versus the fourth quarter, although volatility and client activity remained generally low. Given continued trends in the energy markets, commodities improved sequentially, with higher levels of client activity.","In Equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the first quarter were $2.3 billion, up 20% sequentially and include $12 million in DVA losses. Equities client execution net revenues increased 50% sequentially to $1.1 billion due to a favorable market-making backdrop with higher levels of client activity, particularly in derivatives. Commissions and fees were $808 million, down 3% relative to the fourth quarter. Security services generated net revenues of $393 million, up 12% sequentially, reflecting higher customer balances.","Turning to Risk; average daily VaR in the first quarter was $81 million, up from $63 million in the fourth quarter. The move up was primarily due to increased market volatility across all categories.","Moving on to our investing and lending activates; collectively, these businesses produced net revenues of $1.7 billion in the first quarter. Following a sale of our investment in Metro International in the fourth quarter, we made a decision that the remaining revenue related to consolidated investments within the other line, was not significant in the context of the I&L segment. As a result, we are now reporting the other I&L revenues within the equity and debt lines.","Equity Securities generated net revenues of $1.2 billion, primarily reflecting strong corporate performance and company-specific events in private equity, as well as net gains in public equities. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $509 million, with roughly $200 million in net interest income and the balance coming from net gains.","In Investment Management, we reported first quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion, essentially unchanged versus the fourth quarter. Management and other fees were down 3% sequentially to $1.2 billion. Assets under supervision remain flat at $1.18 trillion. $7 billion of long term net inflows, driven by fixed income and equity products, and net market appreciation of $6 billion were offset by net outflows of $14 billion in liquidity products.","Moving to performance; across the global platform, 82% of our client mutual fund assets were in funds ranked in the top two quartiles on a three year basis, and 73% in funds ranked in the top two quartiles on a five year basis.","Now let me turn to expenses; compensation and benefits expense, which include salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits, was accrued at a compensation to net revenues ratio of 42%. This is the lowest first quarter accrual in our public history, and 100 basis points lower than the accrual in the first quarter of 2014. Our lower accrual rate reflects our strong 14% year-over-year net revenue growth and the positive operating leverage embedded in our firm.","First quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.2 billion, 12% lower than the fourth quarter, and slightly lower than the first quarter of 2014. The fourth quarter included higher charitable contributions and higher impairment charges on consolidated investment entities.","Now I'd like to take you through a few key statistics for the first quarter; total staff was approximately 34,400, up 1% from year end 2014. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 27.7%, that is down from a 2014 rate, primarily due to changes in geographic earnings mix. Our global core liquid assets ended $175 billion. Our common equity tier-1 ratio was 11.4% using the standardized approach, it was 12.6% under the advanced approach. Starting this quarter, the lower of these two ratios is our binding regulatory constraints.","Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 5.3%, 30 basis points above the minimum requirement that begins in 2018. And finally, we repurchased 6.8 million shares of common stock for $1.25 billion in the first quarter. These repurchases reflected the completion of our 2014 capital plan.","As previously announced, the Federal Reserve Board did not object to our revised 2015 capital plan, which includes share repurchases, dividends and other capital actions. In terms of this year's CCAR test, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.65 per share beginning in the second quarter. As it relates to our share repurchase capacity, one point I want to highlight, is that any potential share repurchases over the next five quarters, will be heavily back-end weighted. As you all know, we do not publicly disclose the approved size of our repurchase capacity. Again, we take this approach for a very specific and practical reason. We don't want our shareholders to view the approved buyback amount as a commitment to return that capital. For us, capital allocation is a dynamic process. If we see opportunities to deploy the capital attractively to support client activity, we want the flexibility to do it, and conversely, if our clients are less active, we will certainly look to return it. our track record on this one, is well established.","Now, before I take your questions, let me offer some closing thoughts. The first quarter has served as a strong start to 2015. The year-over-year increase in net revenues reflects, not only the strength of our franchise, but also our ability to provide high quality advice and certainty of execution for our clients. Our performance this quarter, well just a quarter, reflects numerous efforts over the last several years to adjust our business. We sold several businesses due to regulatory capital implications. We transformed our financial profile, significantly improving our risk based capital. We revamped our capital allocation processes, improving our decision-making and efficiency. We took a hard look at our operating cost, fundamentally changing our expense structure by eliminating costs, reallocating resources, and leveraging technology. We made all these changes, while at the same time, continuing to invest in our global client franchise.","We know that our success in many ways begins and ends with our clients. It\u2019s the trust they place in us and our ability to execute on their behalf that drives our franchise, and we believe that our steady commitment, particularly through these more difficult years, has been critical to creating stronger client relationships. And there is one important thing that we didn't change, our focus on creating shareholder value, our efforts are ultimately a reflection of our commitment to you, our owners. We understand that to create shareholder value, we need to have strong financial footings, be an efficient allocator of capital, and have a world class client franchise. Ultimately, our efforts over the past several years have meant that a 14% increase in year-over-year revenues can contribute to a 40% increase in net earnings, a 48% increase in earnings per share, a 380 basis point improvement in ROE, and finally 9% growth in book value per share over the past year.","Thank you again for dialing in, and I am happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Glenn Schorr","Thanks very much.","Harvey Schwartz","Hey good morning Glenn.","Glenn Schorr","Good morning. Let's start with Investing and Lending, it was pretty darn good. I am curious on the equity side, how much of it was actually realized in asset sales, because it was a pretty active quarter? And then maybe related to that, if you could give the portfolio of breakdown in terms of equity, debt and lending assets?","Harvey Schwartz","So, let's just start with the balance sheet; you know that the balance sheet at the end of the quarter for the fourth quarter was $79.5 billion and in terms of debt, that's basically -- north of $50 billion of that is in the debt line. So that's the bulk of the balance sheet. In terms of equity, as you know, we have $4 billion of public equity and $18 billion of private equity.","Now, in terms of the performance in the equity line, in terms of the quarter, we don't think of it as much as asset sales, because we make asset sales often, there is a period we are restricted. That's why we are careful to give you the public equity numbers. But basically, when you break it down, give or take 40% of the performance came from those assets that are already public. 40% came from basically company improvements and the balance would come from things like pending IPOs and things like that. That's how I'd break it down for you.","Glenn Schorr","And, what's the disallowed portion or what's the best way to ask how much Goldman still has in the funds that you need to eventually liquidate?","Harvey Schwartz","So I think -- I just want to make sure, I am going to rephrase your question to make sure I understand it. I think you're saying that, in terms of -- under regulatory guidelines, under the vocal compliance, that number is approximately $8 billion, and so, a bit of a high class problem, as we have been harvesting, that number has obviously been going up, because there has been good performance. Now remember of course, one of the reasons we were focusing on that with you over the last couple of years is, because the original deadline in that was July of this year. Of course, the regulators have granted an industry-wide extension on that through 2017. So we continue to focus on it.","Glenn Schorr","Great. Last one is, on FICC, I mean, the macro products are great, but credit mortgage wasn't, so not exactly hitting on all cylinders as a whole. But it certainly seems like, maybe some of the reduced capacity in the industry is helping you, and so your long term strategy that we all beat you up for the last five years might be working. Could you talk towards what you're seeing in terms of capacity and now that you've seen a pickup involved, clearly [ph], what it means?","Harvey Schwartz","So on FICC, I think you're right to say that, one of the things we have benefited from, certainly is the diversity of the businesses. Its not just FICC, its across equities as well, because as you said, even in a quarter like this, where you're seeing improved FICC performance sequentially and year-over-year, you're really seeing it in the macro side of the business, and as you said, not all cylinders are firing.","In terms of us, through this part of the cycle, while you were beating us up, we were spending a lot of time focused on the clients and staying very-very committed to the businesses, and we are seeing it translate through. I don't have perfect visibility into our competitor's obviously, but you've seen the announcements, some things more stark like commodities. But certainly, we are hearing it from clients, and now we are starting to see a bit of it, I would say geographically, certainly in Europe. I know you asked about FICC, maybe take the equity business for example. We have seen a trend in derivatives, and then certainly in a quarter like this, it was pretty significant.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. Thank you very much.","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Christian Bolu","Good morning Harvey.","Harvey Schwartz","Hey, good morning Christian.","Christian Bolu","So to start on maybe CCAR, the Firm has proven very adaptable in managing the regulatory environment. As you think about, obviously, your CCAR results. I am just curious as to what levers you have here to improve your relative positioning?","Harvey Schwartz","Sorry, I didn't hear the very beginning of your question, I apologize Christian. Could you just repeat it?","Christian Bolu","Yeah. So my question basically is just on your CCAR ratios. I am just curious, what levers you have to improve your positioning?","Harvey Schwartz","Right. Okay, I understand. So as you know, we get very little transparency by design, in terms of how the regulators have constructed CCAR going into the test. One thing of course is, we get transparency on our results coming out of the test. And so last year, you saw us digest that information among other regulatory constraints, and we took very immediate action around the balance sheet, and as you saw in the second quarter, reduced the balance sheet by $50 billion. Every year's test, you learn a little bit more in terms of the results. This year's tests, in terms of the constraints, again this is all public, had to deal with total capital, and so we are again digesting the results, and we will look at that, in terms of how we think about deploying our balance sheet, our capacity and our capital structure, and again, we will go through a process. I am not saying the process will yield the same results in terms of last year's balance sheet actions, but we are going through that same diagnostic process now, with our teams in the businesses.","Christian Bolu","Okay. Have you mentioned your clients are placing a greater premium on kind of financial capital, and [indiscernible] execution. Curious to how this is being expressed? Are you seeing a wider bid-ask spreads in the market that give you more business, or something else?","Harvey Schwartz","So, as I mentioned, we are seeing it in certain parts. I guess one of the areas I point to, is if you just look at the capital we committed to block transactions during the course of the quarter, obviously there were some significant capital commitments we made to clients during the course of the quarter, the largest block transactions that were done. And so, we felt very well positioned to connect those sellers or issuers of equity, with buyers on the other side.","I'd say more broadly, the process of repricing has been maybe slower than folks would have expected. We are certainly seeing it in parts of the business, and when you start to see it, is when the market picks up. So again, I highlight the derivatives activity, which was a solid driver in our equities client execution line this quarter. We have also talked about it in commodities for example. So in the comm markets, you don't see it as much. But when activity picks up, you start to see it.","Christian Bolu","Great, very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O'Connor","Good morning.","Harvey Schwartz","Good morning, Matt.","Matt O'Connor","Any more color you can give us in terms of the strengths within equity, derivatives, from a regional point of view, should we assume that it was in Europe, from QE and some of the movement in prices there. Just trying to piece that line item together a little bit more?","Harvey Schwartz","Yeah so, within equities, the performance was really broad based in what we saw this quarter. We talked for a long time with you about -- to really be a significant player in this, you need to have scale and you need to -- for example, be in all the business lines, whether its prime brokerage, derivatives, ability to commit capital which I just spoke about, you need to have strong electronic capabilities, and you need to be geographically diverse. And this was a quarter, where we really saw strong contribution across the entire business, and I highlight derivatives in Europe, because it was a driver, and we hadn't seen it recently, but that's really a sum of it, but was really broad-based, and it really leaned into the strength of our business. And again also of course, we had a weaker Q1 last year. But it was a solid performance.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. And then just separately, in terms of the comp-to-revenue ratio coming down, I mean I feel like symbolically its important that the ratio came down the first quarter, which hasn't for several years. So just how are you thinking about, what the target is, in terms of operating leverage? You said, a focus on generating positive operating leverage, but I think it was more than two times to one, so you had a lot of margin there to say, play with?","Harvey Schwartz","So, the 42% at this stage is our best estimate. We did reduce the competition expense last year from 44% to 43%, and then this is 42%. And again, we have always talked about the fact that, the compensation is going to be driven by performance, and this year with the 14% year-over-year increase in revenues, that's our best estimate.","Now in terms of the operating leverage, this has been years of hard work, in terms of managing expenses, really thinking about how to most efficiently use the resources. And so, when you have that in place and you get the revenue uptick, obviously, its much -- you can more easily translate that into the bottom line, and that's what you're seeing this quarter.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. Thank you very much.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Michael Carrier","Good morning Harvey. Just a follow-up on the equity [indiscernible]. So it sounds like you mentioned the derivatives, you mentioned blocks; I just wanted to make sure on the block side, was there anything that was way outside, when you look at whether its maybe quarter-over-quarter, because year-over-year, you know, you had a weak comp?","Harvey Schwartz","No. As I said, prime brokerage balances were up. There were a number of drivers in volume and activity. But it was really client driven. So there were index rebalance, transactions that we do. This quarter, we were able to facilitate large volumes for clients. It just came together nicely.","Michael Carrier","Okay. And then -- I think it was the last quarter, but you guys gave some of the repositioning that has taken place in the past couple of years, the revenues that were lost. Then you guys have also mentioned, a lot of the investment that you are making on the technology side, to position for a lot of these new roles. When you think about, what is expected of the industry, at this point going forward, do you feel like most of that is in place, and I guess what I am trying to get at is, if you are already positioned for that, then from the client or the market share standpoint, maybe that's one of the things that's driving it, as a lot of other firms are still trying to figure things out. So wanted to get a sense of, where you guys think you're, given all these conflicting regulations, and how well you can manage them, at this point, given what you know?","Harvey Schwartz","So, let me start with technology, because obviously technology has been a critical driver and part of our operating infrastructures are firm for as long as you have been covering us and well before. And that investment is not something obviously you can do in a short period of time. So this reflects decades of investment in technology platform as you know. We have talked about this in the past, Mike, we have one risk management platform SecDB, which certainly gives us some efficiencies in scale, because as we adapt, if we need to build things for our equity business, or if we need to build things in different parts of the world, it obviously goes without saying, that you can be more efficient as you replicate those things.","So its that constant reinvesting in the business that gives us that flexibility, but that's not new. The regulatory component obviously, as we get into the finalization of rules and the implementation of rules, that will continue to be an ongoing process; when we think about technology away from the narrow subset of regulatory compliance, which plays obviously a mentally critical role. The other way we think about it is, really how do we deliver to clients, and that again, we continue to invest in, and then other than being efficient, are there ways we can grow revenues from technology, and so we are constantly monitoring that.","Michael Carrier","Okay, that's helpful. Thanks.","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks Mike.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Mike Mayo","Hi. I am just going to ask a real basic question; how sustainable were your results in each of the four business lines? You already said, the investment banking backlog is a little bit less than at year-end. So as you look at it compared to the prior quarter, should we expect this higher level of performance, or is this just the usual first quarter bump and that we are going back down to a lower level?","Harvey Schwartz","So lets just take Investment Banking, Mike; so you remember, at the end of last year, we talked about the fact that we had 1 trillion announced transactions and there was a $200 billion gap between us and our next closest competitor. So in the first quarter obviously, you would expect to see a certain of those transactions coming through. I would point out that the backlog is up significantly from last year. And so, in terms of the backlog in the quarter, it was down a little bit in investment banking, and then it was up across equity underwriting and it was up across debt underwriting.","[Indiscernible] about the backlog, in the way that you described it, but for example, if you asked the question slightly differently, you said listen, the trend in banking, does it feel like its still in place? The short answer to that is yes; when we talk to CEOs and Boards, CEO and Board confidence continues to be high, and you've even seen in the last couple of weeks in announced transactions, there is a fair bit of activity out there, and we feel very well placed for it.","Mike Mayo","And on the trading side?","Harvey Schwartz","So, on the trading side I'd say the same thing; in terms of trends, this discussion around diverging monetary policies, which is a catalyst. That trend feels like its in place, and the client dialog and in terms of our communication, we are very focused. But in terms of you extrapolating that in terms of the quarter, its very early in the quarter, and so all these things, as you know, are going to be driven by the environment, and ultimately, how our clients respond to that.","Mike Mayo","Then one follow-up question; the PSUs are new with an 11% hurdle for ROE and this quarter you had a 14.7% ROE. So is that PSU hurdle high enough, how did you come to that? Do you consider that kind of a target for the firm?","Harvey Schwartz","I am glad you asked that question; because we have had this discussion around target. And as we said before, a call wouldn't be complete, unless we talked about something about a target with you Mike. So really important, the PSUs that you mentioned, which I am sure you saw in the proxy, that is not a target for the firm; and that's an important distinction for everyone to understand. The reason we don't have a published ROE target, is because it's just not how we manage the firm. If you recall, all the time we spent in the fourth quarter, talking about our ROE framework, in terms of how we think about capital management. That's a much better way to understand how the firm thinks about most efficiently deploying its capital.","So in terms of the PSUs, as for the proxy, our Board engaged with shareholders actively as they always do, and they took that feedback in along with other constituents, and they felt like adding those metrics to certain executives in the firm, made sense from a shareholder perspective.","Mike Mayo","All right thank you.","Harvey Schwartz","The other thing Mike I'd say on ROE target, its interesting you know; if we'd had an ROE target out there, and again, because you and I have gone through this so many times. If we'd had a target out there, we had an 11.2% return last year. If we had a target out there of 13%, and we had our 14.7%, I don't know how you would digest that. We really view 14.7%, it\u2019s a good solid performance for the quarter, its close -- we are really in mid-teens territory now. But our aspirations to deliver for our shareholders are higher. And so -- again, that's why we don't have a specific target. We really think about how to drive value over the long run.","Mike Mayo","All right. Thank you.","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks Mike.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Betsy Graseck","Hey, thanks.","Harvey Schwartz","Hey Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","Hey good morning. Hey, a couple of questions. One is just on the fundamental review, the trading that Basel is currently engaged in and wanted to get your thoughts on, how you see that going, and if it goes into places its currently outlined, how you deal with that?","Harvey Schwartz","So we have obviously been actively involved with the regulators, as does the industry broadly on the trading book review. I think its too early to extrapolate anything from the QIS in terms of any final rule. Our discussion, we think its important -- its really about calibration in terms of how folks want to actually think about the next round of a rule set. But as you have seen us do in the past, whenever we get a final rule, we will work within that rule set. I think that -- as we think about these rules that impact businesses where we require to have inventory, again we got to think about calibration, because we need to think about market liquidity and the industry's ability to provide that, so that has been a discussion for us.","Betsy Graseck","Right. Just because it feels like the hedging is a little bit clunky, not really treating risk as you would want to manage it?","Harvey Schwartz","Yeah I would say, let's give regulators time on this, I don't want to pre-judge anything. There is still a lot of work to do.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And then just separately, maybe speak a little bit to how you're thinking about the commodities business? We have had some recent headlines from some of the regulators on that. I know that you're very committed to a client oriented business. But could you just identify how much of -- what your commodities business generates today is client facing?","Harvey Schwartz","So the driver -- I mean, our commodity is all about the clients. As you know, we have sold certain assets, and that's really the driver and when we talk about commodities within our fixed income business, that's what it is. I think -- look, its an interesting time to be having this discussion around commodities and regulation, because as we have seen really since the first quarter of last year, we start to see volatile natural gas markets, then followed by this huge decline in the energy markets over the last six plus months.","I think it really reinforces the needs for firms like Goldman Sachs to be in a position to provide our clients with liquidity, with financing capacity, and so for us, as you know, we have been in the commodity business forever. We know how valuable it is to our clients, we are hugely committed to it.","In terms of regulation, we will see how the regulation evolves, and again, we will stay in active dialog with the regulators. But I think at this stage, everybody sees how critical it is, and how important it is to clients. That's what I would say.","Betsy Graseck","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Guy Moszkowski","Good morning Harvey. Question for you first of all on the buyback comment you made and the idea of backend loading, and I was wondering in the context over the last couple of years, where it has tended to be more consistent. What prompted the rethink? Is it something to do with CCAR, reinvestment opportunities that you're seeing? Just a little color on that would be helpful?","Harvey Schwartz","As you know, year-to-year, the CCAR test changes. Obviously I can't speak to anything at supervisory level detail. But there were aspects and nuances of this year's tests, that to the extent to which we use our capacity, that we would use our capacity later in the year. Now this is public of course, the Federal Reserve gives you capacity on a quarter-by-quarter basis. And so, I was just letting you know, that due to nuances in this year's test, largely driven by the fact that we are mark-to-market firm -- we mark-to-market our balance sheet, that the -- to the extent to which we use it, it will be more back-end weighted.","Guy Moszkowski","Okay. So it has more to do with that, than the idea that with business levels picking up, you're seeing more opportunities to deploy capital in the business?","Harvey Schwartz","No. I was specifically speaking in a CCAR context, with the expected capacity. Of course, as you know when you look at our long history, as a firm, for the vast majority of our history, we have reinvested capital into the business, and so to the extent to which we continue to see growth in client demand, obviously that's our preference.","Guy Moszkowski","Got it. Let me ask you a litigation question; you certified a $190 million in the quarter, can you give us a sense for how much of that is the reserve build versus just incurred costs?","Harvey Schwartz","So we don't break it down specifically at that level. What I will tell you, it\u2019s the same process. We continue to evaluate any outstanding litigation in the course of the quarter, and we accrue accordingly.","Guy Moszkowski","And how should we think about, the fact that in the most recent quarter, one of your major competitors said that they were in negotiations with the Department of Justice on private label mortgage securitizations. And really at this point, if we assume that they do what they are in negotiations to do. The only major U.S. dealer that wanted to have done one of those settlements is Goldman. Should we be thinking that there is probably going to be something coming down the line in the next few quarters, that you're in negotiations?","Harvey Schwartz","So again, to the extent to which on any specific cases, we are not going to comment. I am sure you understand that. I would really encourage you to look at the most recent 10-K and our Q disclosure, where we are very explicit about all these matters.","Guy Moszkowski","Okay, fair enough. And then, the final question I had for you is just on the tax rate. You talked about geography and obviously, we have seen tax rates similar to -- that you had this quarter in the past. Would it be appropriate for us to sort of factor that in together with the norm for the first quarter together, with the normal kind of low 30s and be thinking in terms of something along the lines of 30% for the full year, or would you expect this tax rate to continue?","Harvey Schwartz","So it\u2019s a good question. So just for everyone who may have not had a chance to be [indiscernible] beginning of the call, effective tax rate for last year was 31.4 and for the quarter was 27.7, and as you have pointed out Guy, that was mostly driven by geographic earnings mix.","What I would say is, all factors being equal, in terms of the full year rate, and the way you should think about it, given that we are starting from such a low level, I think its reasonable to assume that we come in below last year's rate. But we will see how the year evolves.","Guy Moszkowski","Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you, Harvey.","Harvey Schwartz","Sure, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell","Hey good morning.","Harvey Schwartz","Hey Jim.","Jim Mitchell","Just maybe circling back to FICC. FX [0:41:31] rates are very strong, which you obviously highlighted as did everybody else, credit, mortgages being weak year-over-year, but we had an environment where, I mean, I guess that if you look at sort of trace volumes being up, credit spreads were pretty stable. What's really, I guess, hurting that business, is it just simply, there wasn't enough volatility, or just absolute low rates are hurting spreads, or is it -- clearly inventory levels are down, or is it a combination of all those things. Just trying to think what is a better environment do we just need to see higher rates?","Harvey Schwartz","I think this last quarter was really a case of investors evaluating, clients really evaluating, where they used to be, with respect to their portfolios. There was obviously less refinancing activity during this quarter versus a year ago. But I would say the key driver is the debate overrates and how people are thinking about their portfolios. I think if we saw a path towards normalized rates over time, I think you could see a pick-up.","Jim Mitchell","Okay. So we just kind of need to wait and see rates get a little -- more conviction about rates and predictability. And just maybe a bigger picture question on the banking cycle and M&A. Clearly, we have seen a nice pickup and continued in the first quarter, where do you -- in terms of conversations with clients, do you still think there is a lot of juice left in, I think if you look at past cycle, this would imply we still have quite a bit of room to go. Just want to hear your thoughts on it, if you --","Harvey Schwartz","You're right. In terms of -- if you want to use the benchmark path cycles, certainly there is room for increased M&A activity. In terms of our discussions with CEOs and Boards, I would say that the momentum feels still quite good. There is large transactions within industries tend to be a catalyst for other transactions. Strategies are very well positioned, in terms of driving synergies, the financing markets remain attractive. Again -- so, there is room here, and our recent dialog is quite good, and as you point out, there is room versus sort of historical benchmarks.","Jim Mitchell","Okay, great. That's helpful. Thanks.","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Chris Kotowski","Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to circle back to the equity client execution, because the result is just so discontinuous with -- though its roughly double the last, say, eight quarter moving average. I mean, can you say -- was it just a unique opportunity set, was it a couple of big transactions, was it related to the block transactions that you were talking about earlier, or is this more like the new normal?","Harvey Schwartz","Look, we will see how the subsequent quarter goes. I would say that, look, if we looked at last year's first quarter, it was definitely a more challenging market-making environment. Again, this is really just one where, geographically, from a derivatives perspective, the ability to commit capital. Things just really lined up quite nicely for our franchise; and again, it was broad based. So the environment was good everywhere. Doesn't mean it can't get better and doesn't mean it can't decline, but it was good everywhere this quarter.","Chris Kotowski","Okay. And then on a kind of a global macro-view back in 2011, I guess the prospect of a Greek default inside the Eurozone and crisis and we seem closer to it than ever. Is it now in your view, a non-event, if and when it happens, that everyone has had enough time and preparation to get ready for it?","Harvey Schwartz","It\u2019s a complicated question. I would say, first of all Greece has been in view for a long time for folks, so people have had an opportunity to digest it. I think that, on the plus side, the environment in Europe versus 2011 is dramatically different, in terms of -- if you think about the discussion around other peripheral countries relative to 2011. And so I think, those are all things on the plus side. We are obviously monitoring it very carefully.","I would say, on the concerning side, look, its an experiment that hasn't been run, and so we will have to see what it has for markets. But its certainly, if we compare this to 2011, you'd have to assume that, the risk is much more contained, given people have had years to focus on this.","Chris Kotowski","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning Harvey.","Harvey Schwartz","Hey Brennan.","Brennan Hawken","So quick one on thinking about equities here coming into 2Q, typically strong, given dividend season in Europe. How much do you think that QE on the continent is going to play into that this quarter?","Harvey Schwartz","Well clearly, it was a big driver in terms of increased confidence in Europe, and you saw that immediately -- that translated immediately into big uptick in European equity markets. We will see how much pull-through that has during the course of the quarter, but clearly it has been in focus for our clients now, and so we will see how much stamina it has. But obviously the commitment to QE is substantial.","Brennan Hawken","Sure. And then, sorry about bringing it back to equities here, but one more; can you just speak to what sort of impact Asia had on the quarter, particularly given some of the market structure changes we saw in the region?","Harvey Schwartz","So, certainly it was a contributor, if I ranked it for you, it was -- Europe was a more significant contributor. But the trend in Asia, has been much better, obviously. And as those markets continue to liberalize, I think the dynamic nature of capital flows will continue to increase. Of course, it was helpful in Asia, but again, this was broad-based across our equity business.","Longer term, we are pretty optimistic about the opportunities there though.","Brennan Hawken","Terrific. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.","Steven Chubak","Hey, good morning Harvey.","Harvey Schwartz","Hey, good morning Steven.","Steven Chubak","So I just had a question on CCAR and your preferred issuance plans. With total capital under CCAR specifically, now the binding [ph] constraint for the firm. Even though you're already operating at that 150 basis point preferred target, is it fair to expect that you will look to close the gap, or improve your CCAR position by issuing more preferreds or more qualifying debt?","Harvey Schwartz","So you may have seen, or you may not have seen, Steven, but we are actually -- we announced this morning, we are out in the market with preferred. So that transaction is out in the market now, and we will be closing later this afternoon. In terms of how we think about this, this is a great question, because as I said before, a lot of this is about how you digest the CCAR results and how you think about -- again things like, how you price the balance sheet, how you deploy your capital and the optimal capital structure. And so, you should assume we are going to look at everything, in terms of how we position the firm going forward as it relates to the capital structure, make sure we do -- we construct it in a way that's most efficient for our clients and most efficient for our shareholders.","Steven Chubak","That's really helpful Harvey. And actually, in that same vein, since you mentioned about capital allocations under CCAR, it might be helpful if you could clarify, regarding how you allocate the capital under your attributable equity framework. Under CCAR lines, do you use for your stressed end of [ph] period or your minimum ratio for determining the level of required capital for assessing the adequacy of the ROEs for various trades?","Harvey Schwartz","Right. So some of this obviously, we consider proprietary in terms of how we think about the dynamic nature of capital management. But for the folks who haven't studied, and obviously Steven is a very thoughtful consumer of the information. In terms of our return on attributed equity framework, what we have discussed with the marketplace, is basically all those factors that contribute to regulatory capital constraints, Basel-III advanced, standardized, supplementary leverage ratio, elements of CCAR. We had weightings [ph] to those, given their significance and we basically have constructed an algorithm that helps guide us, both in executing certain transactions, and obviously how we evaluate businesses over the long run. But we haven't discussed the specifics of how we incorporate those variables.","Steven Chubak","Okay. Well that's it for me Harvey, thank you for taking my questions.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Harvey Schwartz","Good morning Matt.","Matt Burnell","Good morning Harvey. Just a question for you, in terms of what's going on in the capital markets with your businesses, specifically on the energy side of things. We have heard from a number of more commercially oriented banks so far this earning season about what's going on with their borrowing and capital markets activity within that sector specifically. I am curious given what's happened in the last two to three quarters in the oil markets, have you seen a meaningful increase in those companies coming to market, or has that been much more status quo?","Harvey Schwartz","I can't comment specifically in terms of the [indiscernible]. What I will say is, obviously given our role in commodities and our role -- energy companies and industrial companies broadly, the activity level for the past several quarters has been extremely high. Often what you will see is, given sort of this really very steep decline in the oil price, is, those things won't translate immediately. But over time, obviously the industry adjusts that, and then you begin to see things like merger transactions and capital actions. And so, the activity level -- the dialog is quite high, but I can't point you to any specific transactions that I would highlight.","Matt Burnell","Okay. And then just switching to investment management; you mentioned that there was an outflow on liquidity products. It seemed a little bit larger than what we have seen from a couple of other peers. I guess I am curious if you can just give us a little more color on that, and does -- what happened over the last couple of quarters with the flows, presume a somewhat higher normalized pre-tax margin in that business, relative to the high teens that you typically put up?","Harvey Schwartz","So in terms of the flow, as we said, there was $13 billion of combined net inflows and market appreciation, offset by $14 billion in liquidity outflows. Those flows can move around, as clients reallocate assets and move back and forth. I think if you look at the historical movement around those predominantly mutual fund assets, you will see flows like this historically, so I wouldn't point to any meaningful indicator.","In terms of the margins of the business, obviously this business remains strategically a very high priority for us. We have been investing in it for years, and we continue to see progress; and over time, we expect that you will see margin expansion.","Matt Burnell","Okay. And then just finally for me, was there any material change this quarter versus the fourth quarter in the benefit to your Basel III ratios from a significant financial institution deduction that you said was about $5 billion last quarter?","Harvey Schwartz","Yeah, that's not the key driver in this quarter. It really is the growth in equity. It\u2019s a [indiscernible] driving it this quarter.","Matt Burnell","Okay. Thanks very much.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Good morning. Just a quick question on the capital ratios; can you give us what the fully phased-in capital ratios are, what's the RWAs?","Harvey Schwartz","Sure. So fully phased-in is 11.8 and 10.6. Now again, we just got a question on the significant clients for institutional deduction, and so when you look at that, that between the transitional, I would say, the best way to think about it on an apples-to-apples basis, assuming all other factors being equal, you should assume that the fully phased-in versus transitional would roughly be around the midpoint of that, because we get the benefit of the significant institutional deduction, as we move money out of funds.","In terms of RWAs on the quarter, for advanced $565 million, and standardized $626 million.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. And towards the [indiscernible] 5.3% and the kind of the constraint ratio for CCAR has moved up the total capital. Do you have a sense of what the buffer is that you would run the SLR [ph] at now, could you get away with a 50 basis point buffer, since the total seems to be constraining?","Harvey Schwartz","We haven't finalized a buffer in terms of how we are thinking about that. And so, we will have to see how that evolves, in terms of how we want to think about it. But obviously, there has been significant progress, and we are above the 2018 minimum requirement.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Great. All right, thank you.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks. Good morning.","Harvey Schwartz","Good morning Eric.","Eric Wasserstrom","One of the dominant themes from Goldman last year was the very significant reduction in its balance sheet size. And so I am wondering how -- if we should be thinking about that differently at all, at this stage, given what you're talking about, with respect to client interest and demands, but relative to the capital constraints that were highlighted under the CCAR and I am assuming were the genesis for today's preferred offering. How should we think about all of the dynamics with respect to balance sheet size?","Harvey Schwartz","So the balance sheet reduction we went through last year, it\u2019s a great -- I am glad you brought it up. That was about repricing the balance sheet, and all about this framework we talked about, in terms of how we deploy our marginal capital. And so, if you think again about last year's test, you could grow equity, you could grow capital, but the reality is, you obviously -- you want to do that in a way that delivers marginal returns. And so, that was all about repricing, and so as we went through an exercise last year, that was repricing [indiscernible]. If we again -- our preferred operating position would be to grow the capital base, grow the balance sheet accretively and deploy that capital to clients. but obviously, we are going to be very sensitive to returns on that, and how that marginal balance sheet gets priced.","Eric Wasserstrom","But it sounds like, from your repricing commentary, you do see that at least on the margin occurring?","Harvey Schwartz","Correct. Well we certainly have seen some in terms of pricing, and then last year, we felt the discipline of the process we went through -- went quite well, as we talked about, there was very little disruption to client activity.","Eric Wasserstrom","Great. Thanks very much.","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.","Devin Ryan","Hey, good morning.","Harvey Schwartz","Good morning Devin.","Devin Ryan","Good morning. Just one the ROE outlook and the drivers, obviously your margin is a big one, and the pretax margin for all of last year is 36%. It was 37% this quarter, which I thought was impressive. So we just look at the businesses, that have more of a granular level, are there are areas where you feel like you're getting to about as good as it will be, and then where do you see the biggest areas for additional leverage to the margin?","Harvey Schwartz","So the discussion around how we manage the businesses and where we think about driving additional leverage, that's a continual conversation at Goldman Sachs that's going to happen all the time; because we are always reviewing the businesses, and making sure we are driving them to the ultimate outcome. Now, to the operating leverage you're seeing, that's firm-wide, and really is the result of, again, the years of investment we made in technology, how we scaled the resources, the cost cutting programs that we announced several years ago that was raised, and several billion dollars. And so, you are now just starting to see all that translate through. But we are constantly evaluating the businesses for opportunities, both to grow and to hold.","Devin Ryan","Okay. Thanks, and then just coming back to Europe one last time, the stability that's helping client activity, is there any way you can just help size that for us relative to the recent past; how much stronger was it this quarter, we talked about derivatives, but where else does that pickup, and any perspective around how much bigger it was this quarter, relative to the recent past?","Harvey Schwartz","So I highlighted it to give you some sense of the underpinnings of the activity that's driving it. But again, in equities, it really was broad-based client activity, geographic and across the business and within individual product lines.","Devin Ryan","Okay. Thank you.","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks Devin.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Kian Abouhossein","Yes hi. Just coming back to equity derivatives, I was wondering if you could just give a little bit more flavor in terms of products, if the strengths on the execution side came maybe more from the flow side, or was it more from the delta one side or structuring side or dividend swaps; can you just talk a little bit through the products in order for us to get a better understanding of what we should think about going forward trends, in some of these areas? Because clearly, some of them are a bit more bulky than others, if I may?","Harvey Schwartz","Really Kian, its truly client activity across each of the businesses. So I wouldn't highlight any particular product line within the derivative businesses. Obviously, when you have a big up move in European equity markets like you did with QE, obviously that's an opportunity for clients to get involved, and there is lots of things they look at, both from a [indiscernible] perspective and a more structured perspective. I think if you try and answer your question around things like where, people are more interested in derivatives that had maybe multi-variables, sure. But again, it was broad-based, it wasn't any one particular driver.","Kian Abouhossein","And there is no real distinction between structuring with this flow, in terms of -- your mix not much significantly changed?","Harvey Schwartz","I won't talk to our mix, because the firm obviously, we have the intellectual capital on the systems, and the capacity to point that capital for clients. And so, I think we are always well positioned for those parts of the cycles in the market. But again, broad-based in equities.","Kian Abouhossein","Yeah. And in respect to fixed income, we have had some things giving us a bit of a steer in terms of how the revenues breakdown between macro and credit, and I was wondering, could you give us a bit of a feeler as well? Is it half-half at this point in the first quarter, or should we think about it differently?","Harvey Schwartz","We don't provide a detail by macro versus credit. What I would say is that -- look, we have an investment in all these businesses, and again, we benefited from the diversity. At times, credits can be particularly active, and at times, macro is going to be particularly active. But we don't provide disclosure in terms of that split.","Kian Abouhossein","And lastly, on commodities. Clearly, commodities had an uptick in volatility, but at the same time, you highlight volatility as a business which year-on-year was down. I am just wondering, if you could just explain a little bit to me, why commodities was relatively weak on a year-on-year basis?","Harvey Schwartz","So you may recall that last year, and I was going back to the first quarter 2014, commodities had a very strong quarter, a lot of that is we discussed at the time, was due to the extraordinary volatility of natural gas. And it drove a lot of client activity in the sector, and that was really the first time you and I started talking about the fact, that we were really seeing the absence of competitors on the field, and a huge uptick in client dialog. And so you're just coming off a very strong 2014 first quarter, but commodities remains a very active space for us, and our dialog with clients is quite strong.","Kian Abouhossein","Okay. That explains it. Thank you very much.","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks Kian.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.","Marty Mosby","Thank you. I want to ask you, one thing that you highlighted in the press release was the largest ever NPL -- largest increase in five years in tangible book value. Would the increase in returns and still continue constraints on capital deployment, isn't that really a fundamental accelerator, as you look forward over the next couple of years?","Harvey Schwartz","So again, the environment is going to -- ultimately something that we participate in. But I would say that again, the thing that we have focused on over the last several years, which has been making sure that we continue to invest in our client franchise, and at the same time, build operating leverage. That's why you're seeing that. You're seeing the 14% year-over-year growth in quarterly revenues, and its just translating to the bottom line, with a lot of operating leverage.","Marty Mosby","And then, when you look at the comp ratio at 42%, once you made some improvement with what you've done in the past, but when you look at it on the average for the year, you have recently highlighted, then on the 38% kind of number. In that, you would look for the year being closer to what you've done in the past couple of years. When you see that you almost have $0.50, $0.60 of earnings per share that's basically pushed forward as you review performance in your compensation plans over the rest of the year?","Harvey Schwartz","So its our best estimate today, Mosby, and we will evaluate the year as we go through and obviously again, as we have discussed in the past, the culture of pay for performance at Goldman Sachs will evaluate it continuously as we go through, and it will be driven by performance.","Marty Mosby","Thanks.","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks Mosby.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.","Since there are no more questions, I just want to take a moment to thank all of you for joining the call. Hopefully, I will be able to and other members of senior management, we will see many of you in the coming months. If you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to Dane. Otherwise, enjoy the rest of your day, and look forward to speaking with you on our second quarter call.

Harvey?","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I\u2019ll walk you through the third quarter and year-to-date results, and I\u2019m happy to answer any questions. Net revenues were $6.9 billion. Net earnings $1.4 billion. Earnings per diluted share $2.90, and our annualized return on common equity was 7%.","For the year-to-date, net revenues were $26.5 billion. Net earnings $5.3 billion. Earnings per diluted share $10.84, and our return \u2013 our annualized return on common equity was 8.8%. Book value per share is up 5% relative to year-end 2014, despite recording net provisions for litigation and regulatory matters, up $2.1 billion for the year-to-date. These provisions largely from legacy issues reduced our annualized return on common equity for the first nine months of the year by approximately 3 percentage points.","Moving to the third quarter, parts of our franchise performed quite well, while others operated against a more challenging backdrop. Our M&A franchise continued to deliver robust results and our outlook remains positive. We continue to see net inflows in our investment management business. Of course, they\u2019re the usual seasonal drivers due to the summer slowdown, but in addition the third quarter also had more than its fair share of significant macroeconomic developments.","Both the Chinese economy and the country\u2019s monetary policy came into focus. Our clients evaluated the potential implications of a slowing Chinese economy, the decision by the People\u2019s Bank of China to devalue its currency, and the resulting volatility in global markets. As it relates to the U.S. economy, our clients remain focused on the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy. Over the course of the third quarter, client\u2019s expectations for an interest rate hike began to shift. Mixed economic indicators drove uncertainty about the pace of U.S. economic growth. Ultimately, there was doubt about the timing and magnitude of the future rate increase.","Another significant macroeconomic theme in the third quarter, commodities. Prices fell across a number of different products. WTI was down 24%. Copper and natural gas were both down approximately 10%. The price slump let the market to focus on the credit risk of commodity producers, trading houses, and those economies with significant commodity exports. These concerns drove an increase in credit spreads, particularly across the energy sector. The sum impact of these various events led to lower levels of client activity and a significant repricing of the equity and credit markets.","The S&P was down nearly 7%, the MSCI world was down almost 10%, and the Shanghai Composite was down close to 30%. In the credit markets, European high yield spreads were 107 basis points wider and U.S. high yield spreads were 153 basis points wider. Not surprisingly, we produced lower quarterly revenues across many of our businesses, given both declining asset prices and reduced level of client activity.","Now, I will discuss each of our businesses. Investment Banking produced third quarter revenues of $1.6 billion, 23% lower than a strong second quarter as underwriting slowed. Although issuance declined during the quarter, our Investment Banking backlog remains strong and was up compared to both the second quarter and the end of 2014.","Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the quarter, advisory revenues were $809 million, roughly consistent with the second quarter. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&A. During this period, we served as an advisor on nearly $900 billion of completed transactions. This is roughly $350 billion more than our next closest competitor. We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the third quarter, including DirecTV\u2019s $67.1 billion sale to AT&T, eBay\u2019s $46.8 billion spin-off of PayPal, and Baxter\u2019s $20.3 billion spin-off of Baxalta.","We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the third quarter. These include Energy Transfer Equity\u2019s $37.7 billion acquisition of the Williams Companies, Humana\u2019s $37 billion sale to Aetna, and Procter & Gamble\u2019s $12.5 billion merger of its beauty business into Coty.","Moving to underwriting, revenues were $747 million in the third quarter, down 38% sequentially, primarily due to a significant decline in equity issuance. Although global activity was weaker, our franchise remains strong with a number one ranking in global equity and equity related and common stock offerings for the year-to-date.","Equity underwriting revenues were $190 million. This was down substantially compared to the second quarter, due to a decrease of industry wide IPOs and secondary offerings, as higher volatility and a decline in prices reduced activity. Debt underwriting revenues of $557 million were down 8% quarter-over-quarter, a decrease of industry wide issuance volumes was partially offset by acquisition related financing.","During the third quarter, we actively supported our client\u2019s financing needs leading HP Enterprises $14.6 billion debt offering related to a spin-off from HP, Biogen\u2019s $6 billion debt offering, and Simporno\u2019s [ph] $1.4 billion rights offering.","Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our fixed and equities businesses. Net revenues were $3.2 billion in the third quarter, down a 11% compared to the second quarter. Within the number of our businesses, the macro concerns I have already talked about impacted both client conviction and activity.","FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.5 billion in the third quarter and included a $147 million of DVA gains. Net revenues were down 9% from the second quarter and market-making conditions continue to be challenging.","Currencies improved sequentially, as the devaluation in the Chinese yuan sparked significant client activity within our emerging market franchise. Commodities increased relative to a more challenging second quarter, as declining commodity prices and higher volatility benefited results.","Interest rates was significantly lower, as uncertainty related to the direction of U.S. interest rates impacted activity. Credit decreased, as client activity remains generally low amid continued spread widening. Mortgages was significantly lower as conditions remained challenged with limited client activity. In equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the third quarter were $1.8 billion, down 12% quarter-over-quarter and included $35 million in DVA gains. Equities\u2019 client execution net revenues decreased 29% sequentially to $555 million.","Broadly speaking, client activity declined versus the second quarter, as higher volatility and global equity market weakness impacted investor conviction and risk appetite. However, as is often the case in more volatile markets, we did see activity pickup in our lower touch electronic channels, as a result commissions and fees were up 7% quarter-over-quarter to $818 million. Security services generated net revenues of $379 million, down 14%, compared to the seasonally stronger second quarter.","Turning to risk, despite an increase in volatility, average daily bar in the third quarter was down $3 million sequentially to $74 million.","Moving onto our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $670 million in the third quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $370 million. The declining global equity markets negatively impacted net revenues and public equities during the quarter. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $300 million with the majority coming from net interest income.","The Investment Management reported third quarter net revenues of $1.4 billion, down 14%, excuse me, 14% from the second quarter, as incentive fees declined. Management and other fees were down 3% sequentially to $1.2 billion. Assets under supervision reached a record $1.19 trillion, as long-term net inflows more than offset market depreciation.","With respect to long-term flows, organic net inflows were strong at $23 billion. We also closed the Pacific Global Advisors acquisition during the quarter, which added $18 billion of assets. This represents our 7th acquisition since the beginning of 2012. Over that timeframe, total long-term net inflows were $195 billion. $71 billion of these net flows came from acquisitions.","Moving to performance across the global platform, 72% of our client mutual fund assets were in funds ranked in the top two quartiles on a three-year basis, and 70% in funds ranked in the top two quartiles on a five-year basis.","Now, let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior-year equity awards and other items such as benefits was accrued at a compensation to net revenues ratio of 40% for the year-to-date. This is 200 basis points lower than the firm\u2019s accrual in the first-half of this year and consistent with the year-to-date compensation ratio at the end of the third quarter of 2014.","Third quarter non-compensation expenses were 30% lower than the second quarter. Substantially all the decrease was driven by a larger litigation charge taken in the second quarter. In the third quarter, net provisions for litigation and regulatory expenses were $416 million.","Now, I\u2019d like to take you through a few key statistics for the third quarter. Total staff increased by 2,000 to approximately 36,900, which was up 6% quarter-over-quarter. Roughly half of the new staff was from the federation, largely technology and operations. The other half was primarily spread across Investment Banking and Investment Management. The increase was dominated by campus hires and reflects both the activity levels in certain businesses and our continued investment in regulatory compliance.","Our effective tax rate for the year-to-date was 31%. Our global core liquid assets averaged $193 billion during the quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.4% using the Standardized approach, it was 12.7% under the Basel III Advanced approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 5.8%. And finally, we repurchased 5.4 million shares of common stock for $1.1 billion in the third quarter. As we have discussed related to our share repurchase capacity, any potential share repurchases over the next three quarters will be more back-end weighted compared to the last two quarters.","Before we turn to Q&A, I\u2019ll share some thoughts around the market and industry broadly. The third quarter served as a reminder of the fragility and sensitivity of markets, investor sentiment, and the path to strong global economic growth. As you know over the last several years, the financial services industry has faced a series of headwinds. These pressures have forced many within the industry to rethink their footprint or their level of commitment to a variety of businesses, particularly within the more capital intensive businesses of fixed income, currencies, and commodities.","At Goldman Sachs, our strategy remains intact to be the leading advisor, underwriter, liquidity provider, financier, and investment manager. To that end, we are always looking for ways to deliver more differentiated value to our clients. We\u2019re also keenly aware of the challenges facing the industry. While some of our businesses are experiencing year-to-date growth, for example, Investment Banking and Investment Management, other parts of the business are in a more difficult part of the cycle.","However, we\u2019re hardly complacence. For example, within FICC, we are proactively responded to industry wide challenges, including asset sales, expense initiatives, and balance sheet reduction. The goal of these various efforts is to maintain margins, improve returns, prudently manage risk, and protect the global client franchise. We will always look for additional opportunities to improve our FICC operations. However, we will also never lose sight of the tremendous value that we can bring to our FICC clients over the long term.","In closing, we believe that our long-term prospects are quite favorable. Our global pipe franchise, it\u2019s as strong as ever. Our lead table rankings and track record of superior returns are a byproduct of that strength. In addition, we have the people, the risk culture, the embedded operating leverage and clarity of purpose to deliver superior value to you, our shareholders, particularly as the environment improves.","Thank you, again, for dialing in. And I\u2019m happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Glenn Schorr","Hi. Thanks very much.","Harvey Schwartz","Hey, good morning, Glenn.","Glenn Schorr","Good morning. Harvey, Harvey, maybe we pick up where you left off on the whole cyclical versus structural debate in FICC. And I heard everything you said and I think you\u2019re right, and I think you are who you say you\u2019re for your clients. But I look at the backdrop and I say, the Europeans are actually starting to need to adjust their balance sheets and shrink parts of the business. And so the thought of Goldman maintaining is optionality all these years. This would seem like the pay off and yet a pick up in volatility in several asset classes, it feels like actually the world that was coming your way, but yet the revenue reduction for Goldman relative to peers, and I\u2019m not just talking this quarter, last couple of quarters is more pronounced. I\u2019m just trying to do the smell test of all, why is that, because I actually do think that things are lining up that you would be more important to your clients, not less and there would be more opportunities, not less.","Harvey Schwartz","So, well, first of all, completely agree with that thesis, maybe let\u2019s back up a little bit. And I think it\u2019s worth having a discussion, because I think the easy way to the have it is sort of break it down into three parts. Let\u2019s just talk about the quarter for a minute. Obviously, it\u2019s a tough quarter for us in fixed income. But if you think about how we\u2019re running the business, I think that\u2019s the more important two parts.","If you look back over the last several years at the expense initiatives we\u2019ve taken where we have reduced headcount fixed income by more than 10%. We have shrunk the balance sheet by 20%, and if you actually look at it on RWA basis since we switched over to Basel III, we really very softly [ph] managed the capital deployment.","So in this part of the cycle, we have been very disciplined about how we managed those resources. Now, of course, your thesis is our thesis, which is we\u2019re in a deep and somewhat long cyclical part of the fixed cycle. But when you think of the forward, our construction simplified is twofold. Our level engagement with our clients tells us clients still need the services. It\u2019s like M&A, Glenn.","M&A, the services weren\u2019t active in 2009 and 2010, people questioned whether or not M&A would come back. But our dialogue told us that client engagement and the services we provided to the liquidity provider were important. So when we think about the forward and we hear the announcements and we\u2019re in this part of the cycle, but it\u2019s going to take a while for that to transition through, because I think so far it\u2019s been more than announcements than a retrenchment, and you won\u2019t really see it happen in all the steps we\u2019ve taken until you see a pick up in client activity and the competitive environment continue to shift, that may take a while.","But in the meantime, look, we\u2019ll benefit as a firm, because we would diversify until you saw a pick up in certain part of equities, you\u2019ve seen the strength in banking. But certainly a tougher quarter for us in fixed income this quarter.","Glenn Schorr","May just a last follow-up on the FICC conversation is, how if any, does the new vocal reporting requirements changed? How you managed the business? How you reported? I\u2019m just curious, because we can\u2019t see any of them?","Harvey Schwartz","No chance that we managed the business. Any steps in terms of vocal adoption happened a number of years ago, where we shutdown certain business. And all of the U.S. firms are subject to the same rule set in vocal, so not an issue. I really think it\u2019s a question of client environment. In the third quarter, the environment for all the factors I mentioned was very challenging, it was hard for us. And if we go back to the first quarter the first quarter environment was one with more activity and better performance on our part, but we don\u2019t want to overreact to a particular quarter.","Glenn Schorr","Okay, I appreciate that. Thank you.","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks, Glenn.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Michael Carrier","Thanks, Harvey.","Harvey Schwartz","Hi, Michael.","Michael Carrier","Hi. Just first, you mentioned some of your comments on the commodity, I guess pressures in the quarter. Just wanted to get kind of an update. When you guys look at commodities and that everyone call it asset class. Just how do you view your exposure to that part of the market or the economy? And then, when you look at it from a client base, what has been happening, meaning our \u2013 the clients in those areas lot \u2013 less active, more active, and are you seeing that spread to any other areas of the economy?","Harvey Schwartz","So in terms of the exposure, we\u2019re not a big lender to the energy space. I think the best way to characterize it for you is just to take a look at two parts of that. First, any of our funded exposure to non-investment grade parts of the sector, it\u2019s a bit over $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion. And the other sector, which obviously came to focus in the quarter is the trading houses. And we\u2019re less than $200 million in exposure to those trading houses. So they\u2019re not, as I said, we\u2019re not a big lender, not an important part of our business.","In terms of the aggregate impact, in terms of client activity, things have been moving so quickly that sometimes as advantageous to client activity and intensity when things are more trending. I think the whole world is adjusting to basically a longer-term consideration of commodity prices being lower in the intermediate term. And ultimately, that will be a catalyst for activity, as clients considered hedging strategies, as they think about financing alternatives, as clients and companies struggle for refinancing.","So lower for longer in commodity prices, while very good for the consumer and the global consumer and the broader economy, which is also a tailwind, certainly, it should be a catalyst for client activity also.","Michael Carrier","Okay, thanks. And then just as a follow-up, maybe on capital and the ratios, if you have the CET1, maybe like the fully phased immerse of the transitional, and then just given the decent buffers, just any outlook in terms of where you think you would run that? In the buyback pace, just seemed like it ramped up. I know you guys have been saying, it\u2019s backward weighted, but it just seemed like this quarter was probably a bit sooner than expected. So just wanted to understand, is that because of the movement in the stock or is it just the plan with the CCAR process being pretty normal from what you guys expected?","Harvey Schwartz","Yes. So on the capital ratio, so with the G-SIB buffer finalized that what you said 10%, and obviously we have a lot of capacity above that. Our target zone would be 50 to 100 basis points above that. If you\u2019re just looking at that set of metrics and obviously our supplementary leverage ratios in very good shape at 58, but CCARs are binding constraints. And so, at least, it has been.","In terms of the share repurchase capacity and what we\u2019ll do, obviously as you know, we don\u2019t disclose that, we don\u2019t disclose it for the very simple fact that we don\u2019t want our shareholders to think of share repurchase as dividends. And we also reserve and really look forward to actually deploying the capital back into the business. Now, in terms of the mechanics of what is possible part of the profile that you saw over the last two quarters certainly dictated by the specifics of the test. But to an extent, which we use the capacity over the next three quarters, as I said in my early remarks, you should expect it to be more back-end weighted than you\u2019ve seen in the prior two. Does that helpful?","Michael Carrier","Okay. And \u2013 yes. And then just to see if you want, if you had the fully phased in, and I think you guys gave the transitional?","Harvey Schwartz","So on Standardized or are you talking Advanced?","Michael Carrier","I think if you have both, but Advanced probably more\u2026","Harvey Schwartz","[indiscernible] began. So on a transitional advanced 12.7%, fully phased in 11.9%, on Standardized 12.4%, and fully phased 11.7%. So as I said a lot of capacity over our 10% minimum and our operating range of 10.5% to a 11%.","Michael Carrier","Got it. Thanks a lot.","Harvey Schwartz","Okay.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Harvey Schwartz","Hey, Chris, good morning.","Operator","Mr. Christian, check your phone to see if your line is on mute, sir?","Christian Bolu","Hello, good morning. Can you hear me now?","Harvey Schwartz","Yes, sure.","Christian Bolu","Yes, sorry by that. I will ask the FICC question of another way, as it\u2019s a focus of investor this morning. I guess, three of the last four quarters, performances lagged peers. How do you rationalize this? Is it a business mix or customer mix issue? And then looking forward just a bear market backdrop, or is there any proactive steps you can take to improve performance?","Harvey Schwartz","Well, there\u2019s always things we can do better, we\u2019re not perfect. So we always look at them. Christian, we don\u2019t see as much value in comparing revenues certainly revenues quarter-to-quarter movements, but we certainly study them and we look for any valuable insights. But I think if you really look to the quarter-to-quarter noise, you run the risk of over steering the business.","So, for example, in the first quarter, we didn\u2019t glean huge value out of that in terms of comparing competitors, I don\u2019t know how much value we\u2019ll get out of this quarter. So we don\u2019t have a lot of visibility into their businesses. Our focus has to be on a hand of things, most importantly, our client engagements, and then our profit margins, the risk management, and the ultimate returns. And so that\u2019s really what we\u2019ll focus on. In fact, now it\u2019s interesting, because you brought up the issue of volatility of revenues, and I make a couple of important points.","If you look over the years, revenues don\u2019t really tell a great story. And as a shareholder, if you want a collection of businesses, and if you actually look at our performance, consistency of ROE, and returns and earnings, we\u2019re the most stable. And so it really is about from wide earnings, not revenues. Anyway I don\u2019t know if that helps you or not.","Christian Bolu","Yes, no, that helps, and thanks for the clarifications. Maybe just a broader question on pricing power in the business. I guess, what lessons have you learned from the price increases implemented in the prime brokerage business from what we can see revenue generation has not suffered at all for any of the top players. Maybe does that tell you that the industry has more leverage in pricing, and maybe can we expect this and other business to maybe offset some of the weaker activity trends?","Harvey Schwartz","So I think there\u2019s two things driving. Your first is a question of really strength of franchise. And we\u2019ve had a long, long history of being a dominant player in the prime brokerage business, and I think it really is the value proposition that we offer our clients globally, that is the differential in that business. I think the capital rules, as they come into play and the balance sheet impact of those capital rules in the class has forced a very natural repricing in terms of how much balance sheet we and the industry can provide the clients. And clients are being very judicious about that, but they\u2019re also been making a differentiated judgment about who the best value providers are, and we\u2019re certainly one of those. And so we\u2019re seeing pricing power.","Christian Bolu","And any other businesses you think you can accept that pricing power?","Harvey Schwartz","So, certainly in as we talked about in the past from time-to-time when activity has picked up, I don\u2019t know necessarily, I would call it pricing power as much as I would call it an absence of competition. But certainly in the commodity space several quarters ago, there was a lot of activity where certainly competition, which if you want to call that pricing power, I think of it a little bit differently. But certainly clients were going to engage us differently. And then in the derivative businesses globally, as you\u2019re seeing firms exit parts of the CDS business and other parts of the equity derivative businesses, I think it\u2019s early days, but certainly you\u2019re seeing a reduction in competition, and that translates into pricing power or maybe better said better returns.","Christian Bolu","Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you, Harvey.","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks, Christian.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Harvey Schwartz","Hey, Matt.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Actually first is the quick follow-up to that very last comment you made about some repricing in parts of equity derivatives. I just I haven\u2019t heard that before. Maybe I haven\u2019t been paying attention. But what areas there?","Harvey Schwartz","So it\u2019s really two parts we\u2019ve seen some of it in Europe where competition used to be sort of more significant, but also given the requirements around collateral worlds and things like that where you may have at times had marginal participants actually pricing that levels where we would have thought the risk return didn\u2019t make sense. Now you\u2019re seeing more rational and improved pricing I\u2019d say that\u2019s a general trend.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay. And then just separately, can you give us an update on the bank deposit and lending strategy. You obviously announced a deal to acquire some deposits and have had a key hire in the lending side I think in the second quarter. So just give us an update on what you are thinking there and will we see this business grow to be meaningful at some point?","Harvey Schwartz","Sure, great question. And the way the first thing I will emphasize on that question is really the separation between a liability strategy, and potential asset strategy. So these two things are completely separate, but I think it\u2019s natural that people would link them.","The online deposit strategy, where we requested approval for the deposit platform that really is all about funding diversification we have spent sometime contemplating building our own platform this platform became available, it seemed attractive and timely for us and for GE. And so, but we would do that independently of any asset driven strategy.","Now, in terms of the digitally led lending strategy, which you talked about is not a lot to update you on since we last talked. We\u2019re thrilled to have Harvey on board as our partner, he brings a wealth of knowledge and we feel like there is a handful of reasons why we maybe able to have an impact on this space here.","One our real core competencies, and risk management, and technology. And we feel like we maybe able to provide a differentiated product that is accretive to the firms current returns, but it\u2019s going to be slow going obviously, we built lots of business at Goldman Sachs this is a new business. Again it\u2019s great to have Harvey here, because he brings all the expertise\u2019s and when we have more to talk you about we\u2019ll certainly update you, but it\u2019s going to be very deliberate in terms of its development.","Matt O\u2019Connor","And I guess just a quick follow-up, on the funding side, as we think about the deposits growing over time, is that something that will benefit you in down turns or is it also something that will benefit the earnings incrementally from lower funding costs?","Harvey Schwartz","I think it\u2019s too twofold I mean, we have always been very conservative about our liquidity profile and a part of being conservative is about being diversified and so we\u2019re always looking for diversification I\u2019m always looking for cost-effectiveness. But when we think about liability management, again it it\u2019s really about making sure we have the strongest financial footings at any given point of time.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay, thanks for taking my questions.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good morning.","Harvey Schwartz","Hey, Betsy, how are you?","Betsy Graseck","Good. So, just a question about how you think about your market share. As you indicated, revenues were tough way to measure things, because people have different positions and marks, et cetera. So, I\u2019m interested in understanding how you think about how you are doing on market share, really from a transaction side. I know you talk about client engagement. So thinking that from a transaction perspective ignoring the P&L impact where do you think you stand in your various businesses?","Harvey Schwartz","So, I know you\u2019re asking me question narrowly, but in terms of running those businesses and particularly FICC, it really is multipart. So our client engagements in the businesses that we\u2019re focused on feels quite good. So for example we\u2019re not the biggest emerging markets firm as you know, because we don\u2019t have offices in hundred countries and it\u2019s never been the biggest part of our footprint there are certainly always things that we\u2019re focused on and if you think about our client base, we\u2019re more skewed I think, because we\u2019re not the biggest lender in the globe, we\u2019re more skewed to professional money managers and investors and you saw and you could see their activity moves around.","But we feel good about our client engagements and our market shares, but it\u2019s a multi-part question is \u2013 it\u2019s not just about clients although they\u2019re the most important part and running these businesses, it really is about margins returns over the long-term.","Betsy Graseck","Okay then separately on the INL space last quarter you gave a very helpful dissection of a third, a third, a third in terms of revenue flows that were a function of public marks versus not so public versus private. Do you have any kind of breakdown on how the quarter was impacted by that?","Harvey Schwartz","Sure, so let\u2019s just maybe step back. So at the end of the second quarter the INL balance sheet was $89 billion and roughly 75% of that is debt related. So the balance really equity related and then it breaks out.","But the breakout I gave you last time really was public equities, which were down and they [part 11 1: 41]more or less in line with global markets and they started $4 billion at the quarter and so certainly there was just the path to mark-to-market.","And then in private equity the vast majority of the performance that offset the public portfolio was event related and by event related I mean sales, pending sales IPOs. And we really benefited from the idiosyncratic nature of the portfolio. We\u2019re not large for example in some of the hardest hit sectors like energy and that kind of stuff.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. Thanks, very much.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from a line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Mike Mayo","Hi.","Glenn Schorr","Hi Mike.","Mike Mayo","Questions on trading both equities, and fixed income. What percent is electronic or automated and has that compared to five years ago. And then the second question is, kind of what percent of the business would you say pricing is more rational than it\u2019s been in the past?","Harvey Schwartz","So, on the second part I\u2019d say it\u2019s the trend is improving in terms of rational pricing, but it\u2019s in a market where the client engagement from quarter-to-quarter has been very different right, so we saw it in the first quarter, we saw less in second quarter I think that I would answer the electronic trading question as sort of long-term.","The secular trend, which has been in place long before the crisis, that just continues and to some extent is aided by the creation of SEPs and things. This quarter what we\u2019ve seen in the past, what we saw in this quarter where when volatility is quite severe particularly in the equity markets.","Clients really look to de-risk or add risk and they tend to trade electronically, so I would say it\u2019s a trend, but I don\u2019t have the specific numbers for you Mike, in terms of the quarter contribution of electronic versus cash, but we can certainly get to that stuff.","Mike Mayo","I think, can you just give even a ballpark. If electronic 5%, 10%, 20%, 50% just any sort of ballpark figure?","Harvey Schwartz","Well, I don\u2019t want to guess on a ballpark, certainly in the third quarter there was a meaningful pick up in electronic activity relative to cash in the equities business and again I don\u2019t want to guess at a number for you Mike, we\u2019ll be happy to get you one.","Mike Mayo","Sure, and then just a follow-up on the pricing. What areas in particular are you seeing the best pricing improvement in trading?","Harvey Schwartz","So, I\u2019d say balance sheet intensive business is broadly and that really is as firms globally around the world adjust capital requirements and have to be more thoughtful about the marginal deployment of balance sheet.","And then other things, that are potentially balance sheet consumers like longer dated derivatives swaps and certainly when commodities has picked up, we have seen circumstances where and this is obviously augmented by the fact that their trading houses have gone through some pretty significant pressure now. What we\u2019re saying reduce competition, but again it\u2019s harder to see it certainly translate through unless the client activity levels are high. I think that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing this big back and forth swing between a quarter like the first quarter where we had a 14.7% ROE and in this quarter we have a much tougher quarter.","Mike Mayo","All right. Thank you.","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Harvey Schwartz","Good morning.","Harvey Schwartz","Good morning.","Guy Moszkowski","I just wanted to follow-up a little bit first on the composition of the change in revenues in equities and FICC from the second to the third quarter in FICC you alluded I think to rates first off as having contributed significantly, and then you mentioned credit and mortgages, was that kind of the ordering of the degree to, which they impacted the revenue move?","Harvey Schwartz","Mortgages, was a bigger driver if you\u2019re doing year-over-year comparables.","Guy Moszkowski","Right. But I mean for the second quarter to third quarter shift?","Harvey Schwartz","Mortgages remain challenged. The biggest driver was interest rates and then followed by mortgages.","Guy Moszkowski","Okay. So the widening of credit spreads that was actually pretty significant in the quarter didn\u2019t really \u2013 it wasn\u2019t as impactful overall on FICC as just what was going on in rates and mortgages?","Harvey Schwartz","Yes, we saw it more in those two businesses, but it was still challenging obviously for credit markets.","Guy Moszkowski","And then really to the same question for equity, you\u2019ve talked in the release on a year-over-year basis about cash versus derivatives. But can you talk about, as you move from second to third quarter, what was driving the change in client execution?","Harvey Schwartz","So, it\u2019s pretty straightforward. Obviously, lots of volatility in Asia, which had an impact on the entire market structure in terms of global market responded. But basically there instead of the shift I talked about earlier, tougher market conditions in Asia and then a shift to electronic activity, which boosted commissions and fees.","Guy Moszkowski","Got it. And then just final question, which I think is going to relate to I&L, in the release you alluded to a pretty hefty decline in level III assets linked quarter about 15%. Is that largely driven by I&L, and if so, can you give us a sense for how much of the reduction is due to actual runoff for planned portfolio sales versus just the impact of negative marks?","Harvey Schwartz","A pretty meaningful driver was actually monetizations and harvesting that was really the driver.","Guy Moszkowski","So, actually underlying the negative mark-to-market on the public portfolio. It really does sound like there was very significant positive activity in terms of just being able to reduce positions?","Harvey Schwartz","Yes, I don\u2019t \u2013 in terms of reduced positions, you mean, in terms of harvesting\u2026","Guy Moszkowski","Yes, monetization let\u2019s put it that way?","Harvey Schwartz","Yes, the portfolio did well. As I said, the vast majority of the driver of the performance in the portfolio came from event driven things like IPOs, asset sales. Obviously, the public portfolio suffered with public markets.","Guy Moszkowski","And in terms of \u2013 just a follow-up on exactly that comment, would it be as straightforward as to saying the public portfolio was $4 billion in equities, the MSCI as you\u2019ve alluded to was down about 10% that the mark there would be about that, or is it more complex to that?","Harvey Schwartz","It can be different from quarter-to-quarter, but I would say that\u2019s pretty reasonable.","Guy Moszkowski","Okay. Thanks, Harvey.","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC. Please go ahead.","Harvey Schwartz","Hey, Fiona.","Fiona Swaffield","Just \u2013 hi. Just few things. One is the difference between the CT1 ratios and obviously the difference in Advanced and Standardized has gone down quite a lot. And it seems to be something to do, I just wondered, is it the operational risk RWA, I don\u2019t know if you could talk through the differences in those numbers?","And the second is just a geographic question. I mean, you\u2019ve alluded to Asia a few times, but could you kind of give us a feel for year-on-year geographic revenues, or kind of trends EMEA versus Asia, were those any big change versus on Q2? Thanks.","Harvey Schwartz","Yes. So in terms of the ratios in Advanced and there was a pick up in operational, which impacted and there was a pickup in operational, which impacted the operational, but the real driver in the improvement of the ratios was on harvesting, in general risk reduction and you\u2019re seeing it more in standardized, because obviously there are things that are not eccentric, which impact that more like things like clearing and other things and notional and so that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing the compression. In terms of geography, it has been pretty much 55% in the U.S. and then the balance is really two-thirds EMEA and one-third Asia.","Fiona Swaffield","Like what time period would that be is that Q3?","Harvey Schwartz","No that\u2019s this quarter.","Fiona Swaffield","Great. Thank you.","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","James Mitchell","Hey. Good morning.","Harvey Schwartz","Hey, good morning.","James Mitchell","Just a question on the M&A outlook. I think there\u2019s been some concern with the disruptions in the market in U.S. hitting the record level that the M&A cycle might be peaking. I just wanted to get your thoughts on that. It seems like number of deals haven\u2019t really moved. International volume still remained very well. So I just maybe some thoughts on how you guys think about where we are in the M&A cycle given some of the concerns out there?","Harvey Schwartz","So, the two factors that, obviously we rely on most is the backlog, and the pipeline is good. And as I said it was up at the end of the third quarter and then really the most significant information component for us is the level of dialogue that board\u2019s CEOs are having and the dialogue feels quite good. I think it\u2019s always natural for folks to question when the market has been robust, whether there is information content in the actual activity level as peaking and maybe that\u2019s a factor.","But when you look at past cycles they\u2019ve been more significantly driven by LBO activity where certainly you can get some market capacity and how much debt can be borrowed and it\u2019s a 100% accurate to note that certainly the cost of financing is a contributor to the transactions that are happening today, but they\u2019re much more strategic and a reflection of slower global growth and how confident CEOs are at this stage. And that could always get disrupted, you can have a market event, but I don\u2019t know necessarily that the aggregate activity levels to-date are the best indicators that they would slow down. If anything, some of these large transactions very naturally have spin-offs and foster other activity across industries. That wouldn\u2019t be the most significant factor we\u2019d look at.","James Mitchell","So, you would kind of think is the large deals as this maybe potentially a leading indicator, because a lot of these smaller deals and the number of deals have been lagging.","Harvey Schwartz","That\u2019s correct, but so if you get large deals in a sector, it can have a knock on effect and you get spin-offs that can be a leading activity for more activity, but I think in short our indicators tell us that if the current environment continues the level of activity will be high. Again that could always change, a lot of things in the world can shift.","James Mitchell","Sure. Okay and maybe just a follow-up on the balance sheet. I think if I look at your disclosures you guys balance sheet was up to a level we haven\u2019t seen in a I think over a year I think balance sheet was up 20 billion plus quarter-over-quarter yet it was a volatile environment, it just looked like you pulled back on risk at least in the bar, can you kind of just help me think through that, you didn\u2019t close on the deposit franchise acquisition this quarter \u2013 third quarter?","Harvey Schwartz","No, that\u2019s subject to regulatory approval.","James Mitchell","Great.","Harvey Schwartz","No, the balance sheet growth, when you cut through it is really all driven by prime brokers\u2019 activity and so is all client driven in terms of client assets that came in during the course of the quarter.","James Mitchell","Just sort of interesting, putting on leverage or?","Harvey Schwartz","No actually, you get somebody to fix when people de-lever, actually you can get cash that comes in and actually comes into the balance sheet so client assets can grow partial driver.","James Mitchell","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Harvey Schwartz","No problem.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Christoph Kotowski","Yes, hi your comp ratio on a full-year basis have been trending down ever so slightly last couple of years and you were able to keep the year-to-date comp ratio flat at 40% with revenues being down a percent. Going into the fourth quarter how should we think about the full-year comp ratio in terms of that there\u2019d be upward pressure on it if the full-year revenues miss a bit more from here or continued downward pressure the fourth quarter ends up being better and driving you above where you were last year?","Harvey Schwartz","So, no change to the compensation philosophy the 40% at this point a year is our best estimate. And we\u2019ll have to see I can\u2019t predict the outcome for you in terms of where the Roland obviously we\u2019ve spent in number of years really building in pretty significant operating leverage, but we\u2019ll have to see how the year plays out, but we\u2019ll go through our normal bottoms up top down process.","Christoph Kotowski","Okay, all right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.","Brennan Hawken","Morning, Harvey.","Harvey Schwartz","Good morning.","Brennan Hawken","The you made a point in the press release about the IB backlog building and just was kind of curious whether or not in your view that\u2019s a function improving business outlook or just deals getting held up due to market volatility in some of the trends that we saw impact the FB underwriting line?","Harvey Schwartz","Yes, so all parts of the backlog were up. The biggest part of the backlog, that was up with equity underwriting. And part of that is the markets being more challenges, and challenge in part of the season, but I think that the more important takeaway is less about market influence over the quarter and more about activity levels client confidence, which certainly at times for CEOs would have been tested as we came during the quarter. But the transactions that they\u2019re contemplating are very long-term and strategic. And so I think it speaks more to corporate confidence than anything else.","Brennan Hawken","Okay, but thanks for that color. And then thinking about that point and then connecting it to I&L and the commentary around monetization events and such. Can you help us understand how, when, the exit strategy or ability to use the IPOs or equity markets is weaker how you guys were able to have an up-tick in monetization and episodic events in I&L I was just trying to connect those two dots please.","Harvey Schwartz","So, again it\u2019s just it\u2019s the nature of the portfolio, it won\u2019t always necessarily be this way in the quarter, but there will be opportunities for us to sell assets and in taking company\u2019s public and those kind of things those were usually on a schedule, it usually don\u2019t happen instantaneously they can certainly get delayed by market activity. But I can\u2019t answer the question any better for you than it\u2019s the nature of the portfolio.","Brennan Hawken","Okay and I mean did you rely on M&A in addition to IPO, it sounds like you were purely relying going on the IPOs market right?","Harvey Schwartz","There\u2019s IPOs, private sale they can come in a number of different forms, so there\u2019s certainly transaction that you wouldn\u2019t see the public eye parts of the portfolio are in real estate not really heavy and financials or anything like that not heavy in energy. So that gives you some of the background why maybe the portfolio on it\u2019s surface would have performed better than you might have expected.","Brennan Hawken","Great, thanks for the color Harvey.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Steven Chubak","Hi good morning.","Harvey Schwartz","Good morning Steven.","Steven Chubak","Harvey, I appreciated all your comments on the quarter FICC strategy how are you still committed to business at the same time aren\u2019t going to be complacent. And just looking at some of the capital metrics, it feels as though the RWAs have been slight to maybe honest slightly downward trajectory, but we haven\u2019t seen any meaningful change in terms capital and risk allocations.","And just want to get a sense as to and trying and obviously making a concerted effort not to simply be complacent whether you\u2019re going to look to shrink risk on and any meaningful way within that business if the pressures persists on the revenue side?","Harvey Schwartz","So, the risk reduction again well level said it since we want obviously the risk reduction is pretty significant right RWAs were down a third across ICS, which is vastly, which is mostly FICC and so I think the risk reduction effort, the balance sheet reduction, the cost reduction exercises have been pretty significant.","So I don\u2019t think we can be accused of being complacent around the cycle again this is about finding that right balance. If the cycle continues and it stops we\u2019ll continue to evaluate the business that is an ongoing process that never stops. If the cycle picks up then, we will obviously participate and that we can feel good about the competitive environment and our client engagement. Now away from fixed, obviously, we\u2019re doing lots of other things. So, I talked about the fact that we made a number of acquisitions in asset management and that fee-based business continues to grow and be a bigger part of the firm. Obviously, full engagement in IBD and or the merger activity and their performance I think has been stellar.","So there\u2019s a lot going on under the hood in terms of reallocating resources. But we are being very disciplined about the fixed business during this part of the cycle, as you would expect us to be.","Steven Chubak","Okay, thanks for that, Harvey. And it\u2019s a fair point on the RWA, as I was talking more in the near-term context over the last few quarters. But certainly, since we\u2019ve been monitoring all the Basel III measures, you made a pretty substantial progress?","Harvey Schwartz","That I also think, look, I think if you look at our capital management and the capital we\u2019ve been able to return over the last several years, we\u2019ve been as judicious as we can given the capital rules, and managing the firm in a way to make sure that the financial footings are perfectly solid.","Steven Chubak","Okay. And then as you mentioned the capital rules, there is one quick follow-up. Did you say buffers have all been published by the Fed, it looks like you guys fell into the 3% bucket. I just wanted to get a sense as to whether you see any opportunities to optimize or shrink into that lower buffer 2.5 or given that CCARs are binding constraint, at least, for the moment as maybe not such a pressing need to do that?","Harvey Schwartz","So, well, I think the big picture, the first thing we\u2019ll do obviously is in any opportunity that we think we can reduce our systemic footprint now that the rule is finalized. Obviously, we would look to do that. I think that\u2019s just good practice. I think the trade-off obviously is whether or not in making those reductions, does that really impact your ability to deliver to clients. Now the rules are finalized. There are certainly things we can do.","As you said, we\u2019re not bound currently by our state of capital ratios, CCARs are are constrained, we\u2019ll have to see how CCAR evolves over time, that certainly could be an influence, because it could ultimately reprice the cost of that capital relative to the services we provide. But I think it\u2019s a bit early for that, at least, for us.","Steven Chubak","All right. Thanks for taking my questions, Harvey.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Eric Wasserstrom","Hi, how are you? Just to follow up on the I&L discussion. Can you give us a sense of how we should think about sort of the quarter-to-quarter risk management practices within that unit, given how market volatility can have such a profound effect on revenue recognition in any given period?","Harvey Schwartz","Well, again, I think, one of the \u2013 I think one of the things to point out is, if you think about the transformation of the I&L balance sheet over the last several years, it has changed pretty significantly. The composition today, as I said earlier is really 75% debt. And roughly two-thirds of that is HFI accounting, which is just good old-fashioned bank accounting. The balance is equities and if you compare that to, for example, go back to 2011, in 2011, I think the whole portfolio was more than 50% equities. And so the composition of the portfolio has changed significantly.","Now, if you\u2019re going to have $4 billion public equity portfolio, which is the result of us monetizing asset out of the portfolio and we\u2019re in a sell-down process, if the markets move around a lot that\u2019s going to move around a lot. And ultimately, if the markets decline for extended periods of time or increase for extended periods, obviously that drives value of underlying assets and it drives activity for all businesses in all industries. But the portfolio composition has changed pretty dramatically over the last several years. And when you talk about the volatility, I can\u2019t help to remind you that over long periods of time, I&L has been a pretty big driver of book value.","Eric Wasserstrom","No, certainly, I mean, I guess, my \u2013 I\u2019m trying to make sure I sort of fully understand, given that so much of the, at least, equity opportunity does come from seed investments sort of then hit their liquidation strategy, sort of how that shifts the risk management discussion when you move from no liquid to an \u2013 to a liquid asset, whose risk parameters are somewhat different?","Harvey Schwartz","Yes. So we obviously consider that I think the most important risk component in the discussion is about the point of actually establishing the investments and that\u2019s a long-term process of being disciplined that has to be the philosophy, so look if we see a number of quarters of back to back declining in market that may be the right time to actually being to put capital to work which is why we run with excess capital and we run with excess liquidity because we want to be there for those opportunities and we want to be there for our client. So we size the risk of the investment at the point of making it. Once you have it you can certainly do things but prudent risk management really is the point of the initial decision.","Eric Wasserstrom","Got it and that makes a lot of sense and if I can just sneak in one quick follow up on the RWA discussion within the trading businesses. Was there any real change in RWA over the course of the quarter?","Harvey Schwartz","There were I mean in advance, we finished the quarter at 570 that was down a little bit. In standardized we finished at 582 which you would expect to be down given the move I gave you in the ratios earlier.","Eric Wasserstrom","And presumably most out of FICC or someone else?","Harvey Schwartz","Sorry, what was that?","Eric Wasserstrom","And I was just saying was that mostly because of changes in FICC composition or something else?","Harvey Schwartz","The big mover was really in markets which in advanced went from 13.6% to kind of 11.9% and Standardized went from 13.7% down to 12.0% and that really is about derisking.","Eric Wasserstrom","Great. Thanks very much.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.","Marlin Lacey Mosby IV","Thanks. Good morning Harvey.","Harvey Schwartz","Good morning Marty.","Marlin Lacey Mosby IV","I wanted to give you a chance to stop the drum beat that we have had on levelling out the comp ratio through the year when you mentioned earlier that some consistency of returns for the whole company and not the volatility of revenues. So, just wanted to see whether or not you think coincidentally, the way that this line is up as you go through the calendar year, revenues are typically stronger in the first half, and you get the comp ratio benefit in the second half and somehow coincidentally that kind of hedges each other. I just wanted to get your thoughts on that?","Harvey Schwartz","So we don\u2019t do it that way as other way that we think about it. There\u2019s some seasonality to the business which historically has been the case for the entire industry. As it relates to the compensation ratio from quarter-to-quarter, we just make our best estimates of where we think the performance of the firm is and what the compensation ratio should be. In the fourth quarter we will go through our normal process which again will be firm performance rather than to the businesses and to the individuals and it would top down to bottoms up and we will just have to see where things turn out for the fourth quarter.","Marlin Lacey Mosby IV","So that\u2019s why I was mentioning coincidentally. I know you don\u2019t tie them together like that but it kind of works out in the favour of, kind of stabilizing as you go through the year. The second thing I was going to ask you was you mentioned the acquisitions in the asset managers and what we used to do is look at certain businesses where you could really leverage your economic capital while not really impacting your regulatory capital and I thought this is probably a business that might fit into that category and just thought is that kind of how you look at it and also there are other businesses you might be able to take advantage of that in?","Harvey Schwartz","So we\u2019re always looking really at the quarter. We are always looking at ways where we can enhance the client experience and so you know all these acquisitions which I mentioned, they really break down to three large buckets, secular growth opportunities like advisory and in that it was referenced in the \u2013 as I said in the Pacific Global Advisors\u2019 acquisition, and those things like new product capabilities where we certainly develop new products internally, but there are times both in demand is better for us and that\u2019s an example, that would be Westpeak and ActiveBeta and then there are times when we just want to scale existing products like money markets and you have seen us do acquisitions in that space. It really is all about \u2013 thing about how we can differentiate with our clients. Now from a regulatory capital perspective, we don\u2019t necessarily think about that as much as we think about what is the best way to deploy our capital. Obviously we have to manage our regulatory capital but this is a result of regulatory requirements or anything like that. We will always look at acquisitions or ways to grow or deploy our capital that are long-term accretive for the firm. We want to just to grow obviously those that consume more regulatory capital and those that consume less.","Marlin Lacey Mosby IV","And those that will have a little less or little more efficient and use of the capital that you have, but thanks and I appreciate your comments.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. Thanks. So I just had a quick question on the deposits strategy. You mentioned that was all about the funding diversification. So if you look at the second quarter deposits were about 12% of total liabilities. What percentage that you need to get to for you to consider that to be you\u2019ve to meet your diversification levels as you want?","Harvey Schwartz","So it\u2019s not so much that we are targeting a specific level. We cannot \u2013 not to target specific levels around things like that, because it is much about the asset footing as it\u2019s about liabilities.","In our liability structure, we just like that having a diversified geographic client base, source of liabilities, we just think that\u2019s prudent risk management. When you think about it, it\u2019s all really about where various investors want to provide capital to the firm and so that\u2019s how we think about it. So we haven\u2019t set a target. The reason we don\u2019t set targets and things like that is we always are concerned about building up too much of a warehouse of liquidity, we obviously hold a very significant liquidity cushion at $193 billion. Like you don\u2019t want to feel yourself getting pressed into deploying those liabilities, you don\u2019t want the liabilities to drive your asset strategy, you want your liabilities to inform it and you want to have diversified safe funding.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Do you anticipate that there will be some benefit on interest expense over time as you might take off maybe short-term borrowings?","Harvey Schwartz","It could be over time I don\u2019t think in terms of the online deposit I don\u2019t see a huge cost advantage there. Again it\u2019s all maybe about how can we deploy that funding into the asset opportunities.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay great there was no other question.","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan Chase. Please go ahead.","Kian Abouhossein","Yes, hi. First question relates to commodities, you mentioned, so you talked about the lending exposure, but frankly I\u2019m not really interested in that I\u2019m more interested how you manage your counterparty exposure.","And if you can talk a little bit about how you think about these trading entities that you deal with, how you are managing counterparty exposure considering rating downgrades that we have seen, but also concerns about some of these entities.","And if you can just run us little bit through how you manage counterparty risk on your off balance sheet exposure?","Harvey Schwartz","Yes. Hi Kian. I\u2019m sorry you must\u2019ve missed it what I was saying before was our exposure whether it\u2019s lending or through any derivatives or counterparty exposure to the trading entities is less than $200 million today.","Kian Abouhossein","So that\u2019s your net exposure off balance sheet and on balance sheet?","Harvey Schwartz","Yes correct that\u2019s for the trading out. Again they often intend to position us as more as competitors than clients.","Kian Abouhossein","Yes.","Harvey Schwartz","So that\u2019s our current credit exposure.","Kian Abouhossein","And just in that context clearly you must adjust to rating downgrades as well as your own view around some of the counterparties, the margins or collateral calls etcetera. Can you just explain a little bit to us how you do that? You said the adjustment happening beside the credit ratings, which will drive it?","Harvey Schwartz","We have a long history obviously managing counterparty exposure, which has been tested through pretty volatile markets and again the most important decision made at any point in time is when you establish that credit line it\u2019s really no different than lending, but obviously the dynamics are different.","And we have a very diligent marking policy and we monitor collateral calls very vigilantly as you would imagine. And obviously as sectors are weaker you\u2019re very thoughtful about it, but when we make these decisions over long-term we have lot of experience doing it.","Kian Abouhossein","Okay and in respect just coming back to your fixed-income business the way I at least to myself explain the weakness and please correct me if I\u2019m incorrect is the fact that you are weak on macro and weaker in corporate so just probably correlate it and you\u2019re strong in credit and hedge fund business. And first of all is that an incorrect assumption relative to your peers, I mean, especially some of your money centered peers?","And secondly, if I\u2019m correct, what are you doing? Do you think about diversifying more as a business into and particular as a macro business? And what are you doing to adjust that mix?","Harvey Schwartz","So, again, I don\u2019t have great visibility into the competitors. I would say, I do think there are two obvious things which I talked about before. We\u2019re not at big in emerging markets, again, we don\u2019t have a footprint in hundreds of offices and we\u2019re not a big lender to corporate. Our competitors are much greater lenders than we are. And so that certainly can influence your client base.","In terms of macro, I think, you are wrong about that. And certainly, in commodities, we\u2019ve had a long history being commodities and it feels now like we\u2019re bigger in commodities as the number competitors have pulled away from the business. That \u2013 those are the effects I would give you in terms of what I can say.","In terms of things we\u2019re trying to do, we feel pretty good about the diversified business. I mean, if you think about the course of the year to be sitting here basically nearly flat revenues with our fee-based business is picking up activity, which is compensating for our capital intensive parts of the firm, which you would expect to be more challenged in this kind of market environments. If you look at end of the day when you adjust for legacy costs, we\u2019re nearly a 12% ROE. I know the business grows pretty diversified.","Kian Abouhossein","So you don\u2019t this argument valid off of the nimble credit geared to rather than macro in certain periods of the environment, depending on the environment we will just perform slightly differently from some of our peers, you don\u2019t see that against your money-centered peers?","Harvey Schwartz","I think a lot of the peers have different footings, some are more domestic, some are more emerging-market base, I think the comparables are harder. Again look, take a look at the first quarter. In the first quarter, the way you look at it, we would have outperformed all the peers, that\u2019s information for us. But we\u2019re not going to steer the business in a different direction, because of that we\u2019re not going to over steer it [Technical Difficulty] their revenues on the surface would greater than ours. We\u2019re always going to look ways to improve the business. So that you should just incorporate by reference.","Kian Abouhossein","Okay, very helpful. Thank you.","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks, Kian.","Operator","At this time there are no further questions.

I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Also this call is being recorded today, Tuesday, July 17, 2012. Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.","Dane Holmes","Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Director of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm's belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain and outside of the firm's control. The firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 2011.","I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets and global core excess. And you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that is posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com. This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent.","Our Chief Financial Officer, David Viniar, will now review the firm's results. David?","David A. Viniar","Thanks, Dane. I'd like to thank all of you for listening today. I'll give an overview of our second quarter results, and then I'll take your questions.","Net revenues were $6.6 billion. Net earnings were nearly $1 billion. Earnings per diluted share were $1.78, and our annualized return on common equity was 5.4%. Year-to-date, our annualized return on common equity was 8.8%.","Questions surrounding the stability of the global economy and its future prospects resurfaced in the second quarter. The situation in Europe remains a primary concern. Despite the systemic benefits of the European Central Bank's long-term refinancing operations, the market refocused on the broader sovereign challenges that remain. In particular, client psychology suffered from continued skepticism regarding the mechanisms and political will required to address the complex series of issues facing European governments. The outlook for the global economy was further clouded by concerns about slowing economic conditions in the United States and China given weak economic data during the quarter.","The accumulation of these various macroeconomic concerns increased market uncertainty and reduced client activity. For example, during the second quarter, industry underwriting volumes declined significantly, with debt and equity volumes down by 36% and 15%, respectively. Market volumes also posted quarterly declines in various fixed income and equity products. While a challenging macro environment may translate into lower industry volumes, our focus on our clients is unwavering as the advice, execution and Investment Management services that we provide to our global client franchise are more highly valued in a difficult environment.","The uncertainty has also led the firm to conservatively manage its risk profile, maintaining a high level of risk-adjusted capital and a significant liquidity cushion. We believe our continued focus on serving our global client franchise and managing our risk prudently is essential to the firm's ability to create shareholder value over the long term.","I'll now review each of our businesses. Investment Banking produced second quarter net revenues of $1.2 billion, up 4% from first quarter results. Second quarter Advisory revenues were $469 million, down 4% from the first quarter. Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&A globally for the year-to-date. We advised on a number of important transactions that closed in the second quarter, including Johnson & Johnson's $19.7 billion acquisition of Synthes, Sara Lee's $7.2 billion spinoff of its international coffee and tea business and Austar United Communications' AUD $2.7 billion sale to Foxtel. We're also advisor on a number of significant announced transactions, including Cooper Industries' $12.6 billion sale to Eaton, Walgreens' purchase of a 45% stake in Alliance Boots for $6.7 billion and Catalyst Health Solutions' $4.4 billion sale to SXC Health Solutions.","Second quarter underwriting net revenues were $734 million, up 10% sequentially. Equity underwriting revenues of $239 million were down 6% from the first quarter, reflecting weaker issuance activity. Debt underwriting increased 21% to $495 million, diverging from lower industry-wide issuance volumes due to our involvement in several significant transactions.","During the second quarter, we participated in many noteworthy underwriting transactions, including BTG Pactual's $1.7 billion IPO, IHS' $1 billion secondary offering and Chesapeake Energy's $4 billion bridge loan. Our Investment Banking backlog increased from the end of first quarter levels.","Let me now turn to Institutional Client Services, which is comprised of FICC and equities client execution, commissions and fees and securities services. Net revenues were $3.9 billion in the second quarter. Our FICC and equities client execution business produced significantly lower results relative to the first quarter, driven by macro concerns and weaker market sentiment.","FICC client execution net revenues were $2.2 billion in the second quarter, down 37% from the first quarter as most businesses produced lower results. Our rates, currencies, credit and commodities businesses were negatively impacted by client risk aversion and lower volumes following more acute concerns about the situation in Europe and broader macroeconomic weakness. While volumes were also lower in mortgages, the business benefited from better asset price stability.","Turning to equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and securities services. Net revenues for the second quarter were $1.7 billion, down 25% sequentially. Equities client execution revenues were 51% lower to $510 million, reflecting higher levels of volatility and declining market volumes. Commissions and fees were $776 million, down 7% from the first quarter on lower volumes. Securities services net revenues of $409 million were 11% higher sequentially due to seasonally stronger client activity. Turning to risk, average daily value at risk in the second quarter was $92 million, down 3% relative to the first quarter.","Let me now review Investing & Lending, which produced net revenues of $203 million in the second quarter. The firm's Investing & Lending activities across various asset classes, primarily including debt securities and loans and equity securities, are included in this segment. These activities include both direct investing and investing through funds as well as lending activities.","Our investment in ICBC produced a loss of $194 million during the quarter. Other equity investments generated net losses of $112 million, reflecting losses in public equities largely offset by gains in private equities. Net revenues from debt securities and loans included net interest income and net gains of $222 million. Other revenues of $287 million were primarily driven by the firm's investment in consolidated investment entities. In Investment Management, we reported second quarter net revenues of $1.3 billion, up 13% from the first quarter, largely due to incentive fees related to the sale of our client's remaining investment in ICBC. Management and other fees were consistent with the first quarter at $1 billion. During the second quarter, assets under management increased $12 billion to $836 billion. Inflows and fixed income due to the acquisition of Dwight Asset Management were partially offset by $4 billion of market depreciation.","Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior-year equity awards and other items, such as payroll taxes and benefits, was accrued at a compensation to net revenue ratio of 44%, which is consistent with the firm's accrual in the first quarter of 2012. Second quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.3 billion, 4% lower than the first quarter, reflecting reduced cost across a number of expense categories. Total staff at the end of the second quarter was approximately $32,300, relatively flat from the first quarter of 2012. Our year-to-date effective tax rate was 33.2%.","Many of the last several quarters presented challenging operating conditions, with macroeconomic concerns taking center stage. As we've said many times, our opportunity set begins with a client's decision to transact, and the recent environment has damaged client sentiment and reduced overall activity levels. As a management team, we recognize that we cannot control the macro environment. However, we remain committed to using all the appropriate levers available to us to improve returns without negatively impacting our client franchise or longer-term prospects.","We have a long history of adapting, and we'll need to continue to allocate resources effectively to meet our clients' need to maximize returns. In a difficult operating environment, we have 2 principal levers to enhance returns: expense and capital management. A year ago, we announced a $1.2 billion expense initiative. We subsequently increased the amount to $1.4 billion. We've met that target and continue to focus on improving operating efficiencies across the firm. We're currently targeting approximately $500 million in additional run rate cost savings to be achieved by year end.","During the quarter, we repurchased 14.3 million shares of common stock for a total cost of $1.5 billion. We believe that we have sufficient flexibility to manage our capital levels appropriately for the remainder of the year. However, the level of ongoing share repurchases will continue to be driven by our assessment of the risk to the broader operating environment, our earnings generation and the potential for more attractive opportunities to put our capital to work for clients.","In this environment, we will continue to focus on helping our clients navigate the challenging market conditions. We will work to balance near-term uncertainties with longer-term strategic goals. We will invest for growth in attractive regions and businesses and reduce our commitment to businesses experiencing lower client demand. Doing this effectively is the key to protecting our global client franchise and thus, our ability to generate attractive long-term returns for our shareholders.","With that, I'd like to thank you again for listening today. And now, I'm happy to take your questions","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just picking up where you left off the prepared comments, with all that you're willing and trying to do to control expenses and capital management, we still have a 5% return on tangible equity. Just curious what else is in your mind and the partners' minds about getting back to kind of exceeding cost of capital and other than just waiting for a more vibrant macro environment?","David A. Viniar","Howard, look, I think you've heard me talk about this before. We're controlling the levers we can, which are expenses and capital. We obviously don't want to go too far on either one, because we think, at some point, the world will be -- will get better. But I think that all of those things will let us perform a little bit better in a tough environment. They're not -- we're not going to cut our way to prosperity, and we're not going to cut our way to the appropriate levels of returns. And I think that we'll continue to do the best we can with our clients, manage our expenses and manage our capital, but I would not expect that we're going to have acceptable ROEs in a macro environment like this.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Understood. And then given the recent Fed, 2.5 and Basel III NPRs, was just hoping you could give some thoughts on some of the Basel III guidance after you and the team incorporate some of these recent NPR rules.","David A. Viniar","Yes. What I would tell you is when we sit here today, best estimate, and these are still rough and all done manually, if we looked at Basel III today, it would be slightly below 8%. And if we roll forward, and only just pure math add consensus estimate and largely, the passive items like credit correlation, mortgage securitization, they're going to roll off, by the end of 2013, we'd get to slightly under 10%. And that's about 0.5% lower, because of -- than we told you last time, because of some of those -- the new Federals and about 0.5% lower because of lower consensus estimates that have come out. So those are 2 things that have really changed since we spoke last.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And then finally for me, $1.5 billion of share repurchase is pretty impressive this quarter. I think if -- I know there's a lot of variables in this. But if the stock does the same trajectory as it did last year, i.e. it remains below tangible book, we saw you pick up share repurchase in the third quarter and then get a little quieter in the December quarter. Is that still a fair assumption to use? Or are there other things specific to this operating environment or valuation that we should be thinking about for this year?","David A. Viniar","I -- we can't give you a prediction. It's going to depend on a lot of things. And I -- again, you've heard me talk about this before. It's a very big dilemma in an environment like this. We -- in an environment like this, we are -- tend to be very cautious. We tend to conserve cash and conserve capital, and yet, we have a stock price trading well below tangible book. And I know when we look back in the future, we're going to wish we'd bought back more at this price. And so it's a trade-off between caution in a difficult environment, seeing what our earnings are and calibrating it with the very low stock price. And so it's not a science. And it's something that we look at all the time, and we'll just have to see as we go.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Is there anything you can tell us on the asset servicing sale on the capital freed up, potential gain, revenues impacted, anything you can help us with? Because I think I get the strategic rationale of not investing in core business.","David A. Viniar","So there wasn't a lot of capital attributed to the business, so I don't think it's going to free up that much capital. We have very little book value. So a very large portion of the purchase price will be gain. I think the transaction's expected to close in the fourth quarter, so probably won't come till then. And there was not a lot of revenue and earnings associated with it, so it's not going to have -- it has a very immaterial effect on our business going forward.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. Appreciate that. This might be nitpicky, but is it fair to assume that what you and others have -- well, let's just stick with you guys, what you bought back in the quarter was one quarter of your CCAR approval?","David A. Viniar","I -- we have not disclosed that number nor am I going to start right now. But it was a good try, Glenn.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Can -- Alliance Boots, on the Advisory side, I could take my guesses. But can you help us of what you owned and what it contributed in the quarter?","David A. Viniar","With that, I'm not going to give you the exact numbers, but we had a very small, very small equity investment in it. And so -- and a slightly larger but still very small amount of debt. So the gains from those were not terribly material.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. That's good. And then lastly, this is -- any color would be helpful. But you have the expense thing going on. You just told us about more \u2013 you have the buyback, which is actually reducing your share count. Can you talk about how you think about the potential operating leverage, God help us, if revenues actually do go up some day? Because it seems like the incremental margins are -- potential is big.","David A. Viniar","Look, we -- I think you said it well. We think we're very well set up, because the other thing you didn't mention was the amount of liquidity we have. And we have a lot of liquidity also, which can be used if we see good business opportunities. And so we think that we kind of have staffing levels at the right places and the right seniority. Our expense base about taking it down to where we think it ought to be, capital levels where they ought to be. And if we see good opportunities, obviously, we'll start generating capital again. Remember, in addition to that, our risk is extremely low. The VaR, while its just one measure of risk, $92 million is the lowest it's been since the third quarter of 2006. It's almost 6 years. So I think if we see the world get better, and my view on this, it will get better, I just don't know when. We're in a cyclical business. I think we're extremely well set up. And I guess the last thing I'd add to that is our client franchise. We continue to have a very high market share in all of the most important businesses. And I think if there's more to do, we'll get on more than our fair share of it.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Last one that's related to that is you made your comments on Europe. You guys have been very defensive on it and right. Have you seen any signs that either the logjam or the ultimate solution is near?","David A. Viniar","Look, I'm not an economist, and I'm not an expert in this, but there's nothing that we've seen that -- you heard my comments -- that gives us a lot of confidence that there's a solution coming any day now. I hope I'm wrong there. And as I said, I'm not an expert in this. And I know there's a lot of people over there who are working very diligently to come up with the right solution, but we've been through this for a very long time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of cleanup questions on that. On the sale to STT, what's the impact on FTE?","David A. Viniar","The impact on?","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","FTEs? Headcount?","David A. Viniar","Betsy, I don't actually know that number offhand. So how about if we get back to you on that? I think it's going to be maybe a couple of hundred people, but I'm not 100% sure. So we'll come back to you on that.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then the $500 million in cost saves by year-end, does that include the STT sale?","David A. Viniar","It's going to be pretty immaterial. It's really going to be a $500 million run rate savings on our kind of ongoing expenses. The expenses that we had associated with that were not very big. Both the revenues and the expenses were not very big.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","All right. Can you just -- can I dig in a little bit to where the opportunity set is for the expenses? Is it more coming from the non-comp line, where there's opportunities for you to leverage some of the investment spend you've been making in your IT backbone?","David A. Viniar","I'd say it's actually more -- it's on the margin non-comp expenses and more people related, and it won't necessarily result in lower headcount. In fact, I would expect that with campus hiring coming on, we'll probably have higher headcount by the end of the year. But we'll have a more junior and less senior-weighted headcount going forward.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So more skewed towards comp than non-comp?","David A. Viniar","Yes. That's right.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, we've been getting closer to derivative proposals coming out of the CFTC. Can you just walk us through how you're thinking about shifting the business, if at all?","David A. Viniar","I think you said it well. We're getting closer, but we're still not there. Even some of the things that have been agreed upon haven't been released yet. We're, I think, not saying wait and see, because we have a lot of people working on getting ready, but we're not really making wholesale changes yet until we know the final rules. But I think you're right. We're getting closer, but we're just not there yet.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then last, when you mentioned under 8% Basel III, that included the 2.5, right?","David A. Viniar","Correct.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's all in?","David A. Viniar","Yes, all in.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan.","Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A few questions. On NPR 2, I assume you're assuming in your 8% calculation, below 8%, a standard methodology for NPR 2 rather than an internal one. Is that correct?","David A. Viniar","Yes, that is correct.","Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And is it likely that you will be able to move to an internal model, i.e. the 50 basis points could come back?","David A. Viniar","We don't know yet. It's something we have to work through, and we'll work with the regulators. It'll take a little bit of time, but I'd be -- I don't want to overstate it. We just don't know.","Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And can you give us an idea, the 283 market risk-weighted assets that you have disclosed in the past for 2011 and in one of your presentations, where would we be standing at this point for the 283?","David A. Viniar","Kian, I'm sorry. I don't have that number right at the tip of my fingers either. We'll come back to you on that one.","Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. No problem with that. And lastly, if we look at the risk rating of NPR 2 on the securitization, which will be about 20% on the highest tranche. If I look at Europe, we would be around 7% under CRD III. How do you see your business developing in such a context considering the European have an advantage on the securitization front going forward?","David A. Viniar","You ask a very fair question there. I would tell you that some of the rules, even the ones you talked about, didn't come out as badly as we thought they might have, which would have made the divergence even greater. But I think we're looking at this, and we're just going to have to see how it unfolds. But I think it does put the U.S. firms at a competitive disadvantage. I think you're right. And it might end up with a smaller mortgage securitization business for us.","Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And if I may, one more. In terms of capital movement within the firm, how do you see the capital moving towards higher-growth areas? Where are the segments either by business where you see opportunities or geographies from your perspective?","David A. Viniar","Look, we've talked about a little bit about this before. We continue to be pretty optimistic about the growth markets. Obviously, they're not a straight line up, and some of them are experiencing some difficulties now. But over the next 3 to 5 years, we continue to think that there's going to be greater economic growth in some of the growth markets and some of the developed markets. But we're also pretty bullish as the world starts to get better, which I just don't know when it's going to happen in most of our businesses all around the world. And so we're -- you've heard Lloyd say, we want to be Goldman Sachs in more places, but we also want to grow Goldman Sachs where we are.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on the article I'm reading in the Wall Street Journal: Goldman builds private bank, sets a target for $100 billion in additional loans. Can you describe what you're doing in the private banking area and with regard to targets for loans?","David A. Viniar","Sure. I think there might have been some overstatement there. Look, we've been in the private wealth business for a long time. You know that's a very important business for Goldman Sachs. We've always lent to our private wealth clients. And having the bank has just made that a more efficient and more profitable business, so we intend to continue to grow that slowly as we have been. As far as corporate loans go, as we've mentioned, with -- especially with the retrenchment of some of the European banks, there are some of our clients who really need dollar funding. We have some available through the bank. We'll use it where we think it's most efficient, we have the most profit opportunities, we have the clients who need it most. So again, I think we're just going to be more efficient. And all I'd tell you is the bank -- the total bank has a little over $100 billion in assets and only about $50 billion in deposits, which are used for a variety of things. So you can do the math on the loans.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","So do you have a $100-billion loan target?","David A. Viniar","I would say we have $50 billion of deposits right now. They're going to grow slowly over time as we can grow them, and then we'll use some amount of that for our loans. So you can -- as I said, you can do the math.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","So now, a real big picture question. In deciding to go this direction more aggressively, you could either decide to expand the balance sheet, expand loans, expand the back. You could have gone the other direction and said, \"We're going to de-bank and really shrink what we have, especially trading below tangible book.\" Or you could have just put off this decision to another day. So why decide this now? What was the urgency, in addition to the European bank situation? And did you consider the idea of de-banking or just dramatically shrinking your balance sheet?","David A. Viniar","Mike, I think I told you there might have been some overstatements, to start. I think that -- again, I've told you before that I think the idea of de-banking is not really something that's on our mind. We're regulated by the Fed. We're going to be regulated by the Fed. We are a bank holding company, and we're going to be one for the foreseeable future. So that hasn't changed, but I don't think there's any big change in our strategy that's coming. This is something that is part of what we are. We're going to grow it where we see opportunities, we're going to take advantage of the opportunities we see, but it's not a big change in strategy.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And then lastly, you're still trading below tangible book value, and I know you have a lot of confidence that your assets are marked accurately. Anything else you can do to realize that value in addition to more aggressively repurchasing your stock?","David A. Viniar","I think that's really the main way.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Maybe a follow-up question just on the return environment. It seems like if you look across the industry, it's tough enough for someone like you or even the top 5 players in the industry to still generate a 10% ROE. So it's got to be, depending on mix, even tougher for firms that are kind of in the 5 to 15 ranking. Given that you're big on the Advisory side in the financial service sector, has there been any pickup in discussions, dialogue on bigger moves instead of just the cost-cutting strategic decisions in the industry of exiting certain businesses, paring down certain regions? Like are we at that point, just given that this weak macro environment has been kind of just slugging along for a few years?","David A. Viniar","Look, it's a really hard question as we've talked about. You never know what the future is going to bring. We're in a cyclical business. We know we're in a cyclical business. It's hard to know when the cycle's going to change. We think we have tremendous upside in a lot of our businesses. While we're trying to pare down and perform as well as we can in this difficult environment, it's not returns that are acceptable to us or to our shareholders, and we know that. But the question is how much of the upside that we want to give away to have slightly better performance today. So we're not at the point now where we're thinking of wholesale strategic changes or wholesale shrinkages in any way. We have a long history of doing this incrementally as we see how the world unfolds, and I think I would expect that that's what we're going to continue to do.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. I mean that was for you. I was saying more for the industry. Like meaning when you look across like the financial service sector, based on the conversations through, like on the Advisory side, have you seen a pickup on dialogues based on the environment and potential changes taking place?","David A. Viniar","Look, I think we've talked about seeing some of the European banks retrench as -- with some of the difficulty. But other than that, we're not really seeing wholesale changes.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then on your cost reductions, just that $500 million, that makes sense, no wholesale changes. But in terms of where you're seeing those opportunities, like are you still overinvested in Asia or Europe and so you're pulling back more there? Is it certain product areas or certain businesses? Or is it across the board still?","David A. Viniar","The only thing I would say is while we're -- because we still think it's a great long-term opportunity, we're certainly pulling back less in the growth markets than other places. But that doesn't mean that -- as we said, they're not a straight line up either, but we're pulling back less there.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then last one, just on the OTC shift. It seems like we're getting closer in terms of the number of rules that are out there. But still, seems like it's going to get kicked to 2013. When you look at it, whether it's the clearing opportunity and then obviously, the give-up on some of the revenues, do you have any indication or any estimate of -- I think most would expect the OTC market can get cleared -- the challenge is what portion can trade on a SEF or can transact and then the pricing goes away or goes to those platforms? So when you look at the OTC market, what portion can go in that direction? And then even though pricing goes down there, how much capital can you be saving as a lot of these products get cleared?","David A. Viniar","Mike, it's really hard for me to give you specificity on that question. The rules aren't done yet. The industry is still looking at how these things are going to unfold. If I gave you specific numbers there, I would literally be making them up, and I don't want to do that.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A lot of my questions have been asked, but just maybe a couple quick ones. FICC results were actually a little bit better than we had been looking for. And in the press release at least, you highlighted the strength in the mortgage business, and you commented on asset price stability helping out there. Was there some benefit from Maiden Lane? Or can you give us a little more granular impact on what that was?","David A. Viniar","I think that's one of the things that helped. I think some of the Maiden Lane transactions being cleaned up, I think that took a little bit of overhang off the market. I think that was good. I think you probably saw there have been some tenders in Europe, which have been helpful. So there's been a lot of things that have taken some of the overhang off the market. And as investors have also been searching for yield, I think they felt pretty good about the mortgage space. And so I think it's been a pretty attractive space for people.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then circling back to the private bank question, and I know you've stated pretty clearly that the article overdid it a little bit. But when you think about some of the regulatory constraints that are being applied to the Capital Markets businesses and -- couldn't this potentially be an opportunity to create some more stability in your earnings base? And given, as you said, the great relationships you already have with many of your high net worth clients and such, the opportunity to maybe grow the bank to just give a bit more of a baseline for Goldman, is that something that you guys are thinking about as well or not really? Am I overdoing it?","David A. Viniar","I don't want to -- I want to neither overstate nor understate the opportunity. I mean, as I said, private wealth business is a good business for us. We have a bank. We are a bank, a bank holding company with a bank. We're raising deposits, and we'll use some of those deposits for private individual loans, some of it for corporate loans. But we're not a retail bank. We don't have branches. We're not going to bring in $1 trillion of deposits, and so there is no change in the strategy of Goldman Sachs. We're largely a wholesale firm. We also have a bank, and we'll use those deposits that we have and grow them and use them wisely for profitable opportunities where we see them.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Wheeler with Mediobanca.","Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca Securities, Research Division","A couple of questions on the Investment Management business, if I may. First, just a point of clarification. In terms of the incentive fees in respect of ICBC, is it fair to say that probably, if we split those out, we'd have the normal kind of seasonal double-digit millions of incentive fees? That's the first question.","David A. Viniar","Yes.","Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca Securities, Research Division","Okay. The second one is falling back on the private banking segment, can you give us some clue as to the portion of the $839 billion of AUM that at the moment you would classify as being with wealthy individuals as opposed to being institutional or retail?","David A. Viniar","Chris, again, I don't have those numbers with me. And so we're going to have to come back to you on that.","Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca Securities, Research Division","Okay. And then really following on from that, in terms of -- I'm sorry to push on the strategy, but it is a very topical issue, particularly given obviously what seems to be a desire to diversify here. But would the focus, you would say, remain on your traditional U.S. client base, or would you focus perhaps a little bit more of your effort on, obviously, what is the faster-growing Asian markets, where obviously, you have a strong footprint in the investment bank?","David A. Viniar","Well, we've talked about this before. Growing the private wealth business outside the United States has been a big focus of ours and especially in some of the growth markets, as you mentioned, like Asia, where we think there is a lot of wealth that's been and being created given our investment banking relations and given the strength in our private wealth business. That has been a strategic focus of ours for a while, and it continues to be.","Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca Securities, Research Division","Okay. And then if I was to ask you, what portion of your -- I suppose you've answered the question. But your portion of your wealth management assets are actually outside of the United States, would you have an idea whether it was 20%, 10%?","David A. Viniar","It's very small right now. It's a very small number, but it's something that we're looking to grow rapidly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Roger Freeman with Barclays.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I'm just going to come back to a couple of things that have been asked already. One, on the buybacks, were you fairly spaced across the quarter? Or were the buybacks more concentrated earlier part than latter part given the gyrations in the markets?","David A. Viniar","I think it was -- I mean, you can see by the average, I think we were relatively evenly spaced across the quarter.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So I mean as you balance all those things that you've talked about and the risk environment, as you characterize it, it appears not as -- certainly, not as bad as parts of the fourth quarter last year, where I think you did pull back on the buyback. Is that a fair characterization?","David A. Viniar","I \u2013 look, as I said before, this is something that we're going to consider as we go forward. I don't think you should take the fourth quarter as an example of anything other than it's what we decided to in the fourth quarter of last year. And we're just going to see how things unfold as we go forward.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Then on the $500 million in additional run rate costs you're going to take out, does that assume a current-ish run rate for the balance of the year?","David A. Viniar","I'm not sure I understood that question.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Well, does it -- is it an assessment of where you need to get your cost base to relative to current levels of revenue generation?","David A. Viniar","Yes. It's assuming things are kind of stable as they are, we expect that by the end of the year, we will have taken out round numbers and other $500 million of cost. It will come out over the next couple of quarters.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And is there anything that you or the board, management will be looking to make a determination otherwise? In other words, if there's a bigger structural cost change that would after -- be given of you that the revenue profile is going to be challenged for a long period of time? I know that's not your view right now.","David A. Viniar","Look, that's always the hard question, and it's always hard. I can't tell you we won't reach that conclusion. It's hard to reach that conclusion. History tells us that we will do things more on an incremental basis. But we'll have to see how the world unfolds.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, okay. And then just 2 more quick ones. Investing & Lending, you talked about some Private Equity gains. I guess within that, how much was realized versus unrealized? And was most of the realized the Alliance Boots that Doug was asking about?","David A. Viniar","Well, the second question is easy. Most was not the Alliance Boot. It was a pretty small number, as I said. I don't have what was realized versus unrealized with me, but most of it is what we would call event driven, which means it was based on a company that was private, went public. So then we're able to see the price, a bid for a company that we have an investment in. So it was mostly event driven.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. That's fair. And then lastly, just on securities services, you mentioned revenues were up sequentially. Were balance, prime brokerage balances up?","David A. Viniar","They were roughly flat.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brad Hintz with Bernstein.","Brad Hintz - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Yes. Right. I've been looking at the British Banker's Association site, and your name doesn't appear on the list as a LIBOR bank. But I guess I have a question, that is as a major player in fixed income, over the counter enlisted derivatives and as a major money market provider, would that make Goldman Sachs an aggrieved market participant if LIBOR was manipulated?","David A. Viniar","Let's just say we're not a provider of LIBOR. And we'll just leave it at that, Brad.","Brad Hintz - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. Well, then I -- can we talk about history though?","David A. Viniar","Sure.","Brad Hintz - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","In the 1990s, Salomon attempted to manipulate the U.S. Treasury auction. And there was a series of civil claims against Salomon by the other primary dealers. Was Goldman a plaintiff?","David A. Viniar","I actually do not know. I don't believe so, but I don't remember. I'd have to go back and look. I think in this one, we're going to watch this for a while.","Brad Hintz - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Well, okay. So no comments on LIBOR at this point?","David A. Viniar","Other than that we're not involved.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Fiona Swaffield with Royal Bank of Canada.","Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just 2 small things. Just a little bit more clarification on the Basel III. You mentioned '11 now being closer to '10 for 2013. I just wanted to check if that excludes any additional mitigation and whether you've -- now you've got more sight of the rules, whether you may kind of up the mitigation or give us some details on that.","David A. Viniar","It excludes active mitigation. As I said, there's some stuff that just rolls off. That's included in there. It largely includes any active mitigation, and it's something that we're really starting to go through with the businesses now. So I don't have a better update for you on it, but we're going to start looking at it pretty closely.","Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just a clarification on Investment Management. I mean, you obviously mentioned the impact of the acquisition on the net new assets, but would it have any impact on the absolute revenues, Q2 on Q1?","David A. Viniar","Very, very minor.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Harte with Sandler O'Neill.","Jeffrey Harte - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Couple of I think kind of cleanup ones. On the expense side, it seems most quarters recently, we've had the impairment charges related to consolidated investment entities running through the D&A line. I don't know, it's been something in the neighborhood of $100 million a quarter. How should we think of that going forward? Because to the extent that that continues, that would be potentially a meaningful part of the $500 million.","David A. Viniar","It's not what we were thinking of in the $500 million, but we certainly hope that those diminish over time. We like our investments to be good investments, and obviously, the ones that are impaired are not. And we think we're through a lot of it, but I can't tell you the other things aren't going to go the wrong way.","Jeffrey Harte - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Is that something we should look at market trends and almost like a Private Equity-type we should mark things up or down? Or is it just...","David A. Viniar","No. It tends to be very idiosyncratic, and it tends to be more based on the performance of an investment rather than the market.","Jeffrey Harte - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And you mentioned earlier Europe, and we've heard a lot -- at least we were hearing a lot of about market share gains in different businesses as European competitors have pulled back. As we come into the summer and the environment really hasn't been a whole lot better, I guess, a, are you still seeing that? Is it spreading at all? And b, how meaningful of an opportunity really can that be for Goldman Sachs?","David A. Viniar","Look, you've heard me say this. We think that it is an opportunity. We think that there's going to be needs in Europe and that the banks are retrenching. But so far, the -- there hasn't been that much activity, and so it's really hard to see it come through. We think that over time that would be a really -- and certainly, over the near term, it could be a meaningful opportunity for us, but we haven't seen it yet.","Jeffrey Harte - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And was there -- I guess finally, was there any DVA gains to note on the quarter?","David A. Viniar","Less than $10 million.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Worgen [ph] with JPMorgan.","Unknown Analyst","I'm still struggling a little bit with the comp issue. I mean, I think we've had this discussion, but it's becoming more material now. I mean, basically, under the Basel rules, the capital that you have to have today more than has doubled. And I recognize we're kind of in a cyclically slow environment. But in the past, you guys said, \"Well, look, relative to the peer group, our ROT is better.\" So it justified like the comp ratio you were producing. But now, your return on tangible equity is kind of in line or even below some of the peer group, and you're still comping at like 44%. Now I recognize in the fourth quarter, you tend to true that up so that the aggregate full year number tends to go in the lower 40s. But I mean, at what point do you just recognize like that the business has changed because of the capital or maybe the revenue environment and that the new structural or normal comp ratio should be something materially lower, like maybe in the 30s, so shareholders get appropriate return above their cost of capital?","David A. Viniar","Look, first of all, I think it's a dangerous thing to compare comp ratios, because you have a lot of very, very differently structured firms. So I don't think you can compare comp ratio amongst firms. I think we're doing -- we're very cognizant of the returns that our shareholders get versus what our employees get. As you know, the ratio itself has come down pretty meaningfully in the last several years. We'll see what it ends up being this year. We also live in a competitive environment. And we could cut comp very dramatically in one year, and it would help our returns. But we live in a competitive environment. We still have people leaving for multiyear offers away from us, some from our competitors, some from other industry participants. And so we try and balance those 2 things as best we can.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Sipkin with Susquehanna.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just 2 questions. One, you mentioned the IB pipeline had improved a little bit. Can you talk about maybe where you were seeing that? And then just a follow-up. It just seems like on the margin, you're starting to see a little bit more M&A activity, obviously, very gradual. Maybe you can comment on if something's happening. Or is it sort of just guys saying, \"All right. This is the environment, and we still want to do something.\"","David A. Viniar","So the covenants, first of all, you've heard me talk before about it, backlog was up. It's an indication. You shouldn't read too much into it. As you know, some deals never get into backlog. Some deals that are in backlog don't get done. But I think it is an indication that we saw a little bit more activity in the first quarter, and it was, I'd say more M&A and debt focused than equity focused given how tough the equity markets were. And you're right, we're seeing a small pickup in M&A volumes. We continue to see a very large number of discussions. I think some of that pickup are cross-border deals, where people think that they can pick up assets cheap in various locations. But I think we're -- it's still a question of CEOs becoming more confident before we see a very big pickup in the merger business, which is at historic lows. And so I think we're poised for that to happen, but it's not going to happen until CEOs become more confident.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","First of all, on the I&L Portfolio, given now that we -- you've seen the text of the NPR, are you thinking of any changes to the overall balances within that portfolio from what you've already read in the NPR? And are you thinking about potentially changing the amount of capital supporting that business?","David A. Viniar","There are some things that are just proposals, and we're still going through them and trying to understand exactly how to interpret them, because they're not so clear. But as of now, we're not thinking necessarily of a change in strategy, but we're going to have to look at what the capital requirements are. And we're going to have to make sure that investments we make will have the appropriate returns given the capital requirements that we have. If they don't, we won't make them.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then forgive me if you've already mentioned this, but I jumped on the call just a couple minutes late. Any material changes to your stated exposures to the GIIPS countries in the second quarter relative to what you've put out for the first quarter?","David A. Viniar","No. They're up a little bit up, but they're still our gross exposure which, as you know, is exposure only net of cash in U.S. Treasury collateral. But before any hedges, it's still under $4 billion. And that after you take into account CDS hedging, which are with banks outside of the country, is roughly $2.5 billion. So about as well as it can be and still be operating in those countries.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then I guess within that, just one additional question on the commercial\/high net worth business. Would there be loans that would be made in that business that would be included in the -- in future GIIPS exposures potentially? Or is it more focused on Asia?","David A. Viniar","Yes. No, it would be there too. If we have clients in those areas, if we can structure them well and have the right protections, maybe with collateral outside the GIIPS area, maybe with collateral with very big haircuts, we would certainly use the dollar funding capacity that we have possibly, because we have a lot of important clients in those regions for loans in those regions as well.","Operator","And at this time, there are no further questions. I will now turn the call over to management for any closing remarks.","Dane Holmes","We'd like to thank everyone for joining us for our second quarter earnings call.

Marty?","Marty Chavez","Thanks, Heather and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. I will walk you through our second quarter and first half results and then cover each of our businesses and of course I am happy to answer any questions.","Second quarter net revenues were $9.4 billion. Net earnings were $2.6 billion. Earnings per share were $5.98. Return on common equity was 12.8% and return on tangible common equity was 13.5%. Turning to year-to-date results, we had firm-wide net revenues of $19.4 billion, net earnings of $5.4 billion earnings per diluted share of $12.93. We grew first half revenues by 22% or $3.5 billion versus the first half of 2017, while pre-tax earnings were up 33%. Year-to-date return on common equity was 14.1% and return on tangible common equity was 14.9%. Stronger revenues across our businesses and positive operating leverage drove first half ROTE of roughly 15%, our best first half performance in 9 years. We achieved those results and at the same time made meaningful investments to support future growth. Our first half revenue growth resulted from broad-based momentum across the firms as all four of our business segments grew at a double-digit pace versus the first half of 2017.","Institutional client services increased 24%, reflecting a 32% rebound in FICC, where we continue to grow our client franchise and strengthened our market-making capabilities. During second quarter, we saw solid client engagement across our businesses with positive macro trends supporting corporate and investor activity, with the backdrop of rising U.S. rates and better visibility on QE in Europe, trends emerged across a variety of markets and asset classes. This quarter, our clients responded to a stronger U.S. dollar, weaker EM currencies, higher oil prices and a divergence between U.S. investment grade and high-yield spreads. Despite the persistence of geopolitical and economic risks, the backdrop remains constructive as our clients continue to seek our advice and market-making services. While it\u2019s impossible to predict the future, we remain cautiously optimistic that many of the broader drivers underpinning the solid start to the year, healthy economic growth, positive investor sentiment and the emergence of new market trends can remain in place.","Let\u2019s review individual business performance for the second quarter. Investment Banking produced net revenues of $2 billion, 14% higher than the first quarter driven by robust growth in advisory and continued strong and stable performance in underwriting. Financial advisory revenues were $804 million, up 37% relative to the first quarter reflecting higher completed M&A volumes. During the quarter, we participated in announced transactions totaling $477 billion across 125 deals, our highest quarterly deal count in over a decade. Announced volumes remained strong globally. Client engagement increased notably across the Americas and Europe. Year-to-date, healthy activity across a broad base of sectors, including tech media telecom, natural resources and healthcare all strengthened our pipeline. For the year-to-date, we ranked first in announced M&A volumes.","Moving to underwriting, net revenues were $1.2 billion in the second quarter. Results were our third highest on record and up 3% versus the first quarter as strength in equity offerings offset lower debt underwriting. Equity underwriting net revenues of $489 million increased 19% to the highest level in 3 years as our volume growth outpaced the industry. For the year-to-date, we ranked number one globally in equity and equity related underwriting, with over $40 billion of deal volume across more than 200 transactions. A healthy mix of activity supported our equity underwriting volumes during the second quarter. Our IPO volumes increased by over 50% versus the year ago period and our follow-on and convertible volumes grew double-digits despite an overall decline in industry volumes.","Strength across all regions drove performance, including notable deals in Asia, such as Xiaomi\u2019s $4.7 billion IPO which was the largest technology since 2014. Debt underwriting net revenues were robust $752 million, down 6% from last quarter. First half performance was a record reflecting our strong client engagement and multiyear investment in the business. Debt underwriting performance this quarter included significant contributions from acquisition-related activity. Year-to-date, we ranked number one in institutional leveraged loans globally and top 3 in high yield. Our Investment Banking backlog increased significantly versus the first quarter to reach a record level driven by M&A and underwriting. Clarity from U.S. tax reforms, a supportive economic backdrop, generally resilient equity valuations, accessible financing and the virtuous cycle of M&A in certain sectors are all supporting activity.","Moving to Institutional Client Services, net revenues were $3.6 billion in the second quarter, down 19% compared to the first quarter, but up 17% versus the second quarter last year. While performance declined from a solid first quarter, client engagement remained healthy and the overall backdrop remained constructive for our market-making franchises. FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.7 billion in the second quarter, down 19% versus the first quarter, 45% higher than the second quarter of 2017. Our improvement reflected higher client activity and our efforts to both deepen and broaden our client relationships. The operating environment was more constructive and we faced your inventory headwinds than the second quarter of last year.","This quarter, we had lower sequential performance across many of our businesses. Nevertheless, client flows were healthy and this is particularly notable in our macro businesses, where diverging economic outlooks drove major government bond markets. Within FICC, currencies declined significantly versus the first quarter as weaker performance in emerging markets more than offset better performance in G-10. Commodities decreased significantly versus the first quarter reflecting lower performance in natural gas. Commodities however increased significantly versus the second quarter of 2017, which included inventory challenges. Credit also declined versus the solid first quarter amid wider spreads, particularly in Europe partially offset by stronger performance in structured credit. Rates was modestly lower sequentially as lower revenues in Europe were partially offset by solid performance in the U.S. as clients responded to central bank activity. Mortgages, was relatively flat sequentially.","Turning to Equities, net revenues for the second quarter were $1.9 billion, down 18% versus the strong first quarter as equity market volumes and volatility declined. Equities Client Execution net revenues of $691 million declined from the first quarter, which was our highest quarterly performance in 3 years. Our derivatives business declined significantly in the second quarter driven by reduced volatility and the more limited opportunity set. Over the past 3 years, we have had a balanced franchise with derivatives and cash each contributing roughly half of Equities Client Execution revenues. Commissions and fees net revenues of $763 million declined 7% on modestly lower market volumes across regions. We continue to pursue opportunities for market share consolidation, particularly in low touch execution, where we gained volume market share this quarter in every region. Security Services net revenues of $437 million were essentially flat quarter-on-quarter.","Moving to Investing & Lending, collectively, these activities produced net revenues of $1.9 billion in the second quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $1.3 billion reflecting net gains from private equities driven by company-specific events and corporate performance. Approximately, 60% of our revenues were from events such as sales in our private portfolio and mark-to-market on public securities. During the quarter, notable sales included contract food manufacturer, Hearthside Food and capital markets data provider, Ipreo. On a year-to-date basis, our equities I&L businesses generated $2.4 billion of net revenues, roughly 65% from corporate investments and 35% from real estate.","Our global private and public equity portfolio remains well diversified with over 1,000 different investments. Our performance continues to be driven by an investment discipline that emphasizes risk-adjusted returns. We achieved this by applying extensive operational expertise and working closely with portfolio companies to grow their businesses. The portfolio remains diversified across the industry, geography and balanced across investment vintage. By vintage, we made 42% of the investments in the equity portfolio in the last 3.5 years, only 7% between 2012 to 2014 and the remaining 31% in 2011 or earlier. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $663 million. Results included over $625 million of net interest income equivalent to $2.5 billion annual pace. Our net interest income continues to grow as we increased more recurring revenue streams and lends more to our broad client base. Results also included provision for loan losses of $234 million. Our I&L assets included approximately $106 billion in loans, debt securities and other assets and $22 billion in equity investments.","Let me spend a moment and give you an update on Marcus. Today, we have three products in the U.S. markets, consumer personal loans, savings and our recently acquired personal financial management app, Clarity Money. We will launch our fourth product entering the UK deposit market later this year. We have originated over $4 billion of consumer loans since launch and we held $3.1 billion of loans on our balance sheet as of June 30. In addition, our retail deposits grew to over $23 billion as we continue to expand and diversify our funding. Across our businesses, Marcus now serves more than 1.5 million customers. We continued to be prudent in our underwriting and pricing of risk in our consumer lending business to ensure attractive risk adjusted returns. We only lend to creditworthy customers with a demonstrated ability to pay. We employ a conservative underwriting process using multiple hard cuts to define the narrow credit sandbox in which we operate. In addition to FICO, we use proprietary scoring models which have been carefully vetted by our central risk management process.","While the overall markets portfolio remains small relative to the size of the firm\u2019s balance sheet, we approach our credit risk management responsibility seriously and systematically. The loans portfolio however will naturally season over time and fee credit migration over the cycle. And our recent experience a vast majority of the portfolio has remained in the same FICO band or even improves. As of June 30, loans with refreshed FICO scores below 660 measured in the low double-digit as a percent of the portfolio. This reflects migration and our deliberate testing in the 632 to 660 range which represents less than 5% of originations. Importantly, the average FICO score of our portfolio continues to exceed 700 and our loss expectations remain approximately 4% to 5% on an annual basis. We remain excited about the long-term opportunity to build a significant accretive and value added consumer franchise. We continued to evaluate new product opportunities including wealth management, credit cards and others with our criteria to launch predicated on our ability to address consumer needs apply the core competencies of Goldman Sachs and deliver attractive returns to shareholders.","Moving to Investment Management, we produced record net revenues in the second quarter driven by strong incentive fee realizations and solid contributions from both our asset management and PWM businesses. Net revenues were $1.8 billion, up 4% sequentially including stable management and other fees of $1.3 billion and significantly higher incentive fees triggered by harvesting including one of our secondary vintage funds. Transaction revenues of $182 million declined 14% driven primarily by lower PWM client activity. Assets under supervision finished the quarter at a record $1.5 trillion, up $15 billion versus the first quarter driven by $8 billion of long-term net inflows, spread across our asset classes, $10 billion of liquidity product net inflows, offset by $3 billion of market depreciation.","Now let me turn to expenses, we continued to monitor and manage our overall expense base with an emphasis on paying for performance to attract and retain the best talent and spending to support our clients while investing in technology and infrastructure to grow the firm for the future. Compensation and benefits expense includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits. We reduced our year-to-date compensation to net revenues ratio to 39%, down 200 basis points from the first half of last year, reflecting our strong year-to-date revenue growth and our emphasis on profitability. Non-compensation expenses were $2.7 billion, up 6% versus the first quarter and up 24% versus a year ago. Roughly half of the increase versus last year was good expense growth including approximately $175 million from investments to drive growth including markets and our consolidated investments and to build scale through technology. Another roughly $75 million comes from client activity reflected in brokerage, clearing and exchange fees. The remainder includes approximately $125 million related to higher litigation and $80 million related to the new accounting standard.","As we look ahead, we currently expect non-compensation expenses for the second half of the year to be materially consistent with the first half. As we continue to build scale in platform businesses, there is a natural migration from compensation to non-compensation expenses over time. To ensure a disciplined approach, we monitor our cost holistically through measures such as efficiency or overhead ratios and we are pleased to see these measures improve in the first half of 2018 versus first half 2017.","On taxes, our reported year-to-date tax rate was approximately 19%. We expect our full year 2018 tax rate to be approximately 20%. This rate can vary and is based on a number of factors, including our overall level and mix of earnings and updated guidance from treasury on the implementation of tax legislation. We will provide updates on our future tax rate once we have final guidance from treasury.","Turning to balance sheet liquidity and capital, our global core liquid assets averaged $237 billion during the quarter, which we expect to decline as we redeploy our balance sheet to meet client needs. Our balance sheet was $969 billion roughly flat versus last quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.6% using the standardized approach and 11.5% under the Basel 3 advanced approach. Our ratios improved by 50 basis points and 40 basis points respectively on a sequential basis driven primarily by increases in common equity. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 5.8%, up 10 basis points versus the first quarter.","On capital return, we paid $314 million in common stock dividends, which included a 7% increase this quarter to $0.80 per share. Last month, the Federal Reserve announced it did not object to our $6.3 billion capital return plan for the 2018 CCAR cycle, including $5 billion of share repurchases and $1.3 billion of dividends. The level of our share repurchase plan reflects our capital position post-tax reform and our desire to invest in the growth of our client franchise. The $5 billion repurchase plan remains within the range of expectations we laid out in April and we will resume buybacks this quarter. On the stress capital buffer, it\u2019s important to recognize that for several years we have managed the firm\u2019s capital to a stressed concept. The Federal Reserve\u2019s SCB proposal is a formalization of this process, while the natural tendency is to extrapolate recent CCAR results to estimate stress capital requirements, which would imply a roughly 6 percentage points stress capital buffer we caution against reading too much into a single data point. Over the past 3 and 5 years, our peak to trough CET1 ratio change averaged roughly 5 percentage points. We do not yet know precisely how this new capital requirement will be calculated. We submitted a comment letter to the Federal Reserve and like many other rule changes once we know the final requirements we will comply and adapt accordingly.","Before taking questions a few closing thoughts, we are pleased with our performance in the first half of 2018, including our execution on our $5 billion revenue growth initiatives. So, these initiatives are not the limit of our ambition. Across each of our 7 revenue initiatives, we are running ahead of plan and continue to make progress in each of our businesses. For example, in investment banking, we are hiring new bankers and expanding and enhancing our client coverage. To-date, we have completed more than 10 notable transactions from these efforts and continue to grow the backlog for the targeted clients. We have also seen success year-to-date with corporate clients supported by our expanded fixed and investment banking joint ventures. In ICS, we continue to gather feedback on our performance directly from our clients and from third-parties, where indications continue to be positive and our client volume market shares have improved. In equities, we generated over 100 basis points of market share expansion, with low touch clients globally versus 2016. In investment management, we are enhancing our client service offering growing advisory mandates and driving inflows in long-term fee-based assets.","And finally, we are making solid progress across a variety of lending initiatives, including expanding our customer base of Marcus borrowers and depositors, growing our lending to PWM clients, and continuing to prudently deploy capital to our institutional lending and financing business. Clients remain the center of everything we do. We are investing in our global client franchise from a position of strength and will continue to make long-term investments to diversify our client footprint and expand the breadth of products and services we offer. By successfully implementing these initiatives, we expect to drive sustainable revenue and earnings growth and enhance the durability of the firm\u2019s earnings profile.","In conclusion, when we think about our ability to drive value, we are encouraged by roughly 15% returns year-to-date and to further benefit from our growth plans giving us increased confidence in our ability to deliver attractive long-term returns for shareholders. With that, thanks again for dialing in and we will now open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Marty Chavez","Good morning, Glenn.","Glenn Schorr","Hi, thanks very much. Question on the I&L front I know it was a great private equity quarter, but a lot of growth is still being fueled on the I&L side, you pointed out the, call it, $2.5 billion of run-rate NII. You have been good enough to give us the 400, 450 like what is like setting stone based on the current portfolio. I don\u2019t want to read too much into it, so I want to ask specifically, is the $2.5 billion a new higher level, because you keep building the lending book. I just want to make sure that I am getting that right?","Marty Chavez","Yes, Glenn, that\u2019s right. The $625 million of net NII in the quarter reflects $2.5 billion dollar run-rate and that is an outgrowth of growing the lending look.","Glenn Schorr","Okay, great. To add on to that question is just I think you have been there for a long time and you are increasing efforts, but it feels early days in the growth of private credit in general and does it feel like the opportunities are accelerating there and are you constrained at all by your structure meaning in the old days you might raise a big fund like some of the old [indiscernible] but Volcker limits your participation like you just put on balance sheet is the same capital treatment, I am just curious if you could talk towards that?","Marty Chavez","So, Glenn, in our business, we have, well, a variety of ways of looking at it in our merchant bank, we raised funds of course and then we also have the Special Situations Group. The best way to think about it is its franchise adjacent. What drives it is not market beta, but rather the adjacency to our IBD platform. That\u2019s how the sourcing of the investments works, that\u2019s how the harvesting works and this is an area where we are deploying capital. We are seeing attractive risk returns and we are seeing the private credit is reemerging. We have launched new funds. It\u2019s Volcker compliant. We partner with our clients in a variety of ways to participate in the lending and then our IBD platform can participate in the harvesting as well. So, this is the core competency for the firms. We have been doing it for decades. And it\u2019s an important pillar of our growth.","Glenn Schorr","Okay, last quickie. I don\u2019t remember if and when there was ever a lower second quarter comp ratio, is that just a function of revenues up 22% for the year better clarity on it being at least to the 37%, is there anything to read into on if revenues continue at this pace we could actually see a lower comp ratio? Thanks.","Marty Chavez","So, Glenn there, it is just as you say it, it\u2019s a strong revenue growth year-on-year and our emphasis on profitability. The compensation philosophy remains the same as it always has been, we pay it for performance and we attract and retain talent.","Glenn Schorr","Alright, that\u2019s all I have. Thank you. I appreciate it.","Marty Chavez","You bet.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Michael Carrier","Thanks Marty. Maybe first question, just on the backdrop you mentioned pipeline at an all time high and you have got the tax reform, but then you get the trade stuff and so I just wanted to get some color on what you are seeing from clients both on the banking and the training front?","Marty Chavez","So, I will start with the banking front and you know as we mentioned the backlog is strong at record level and the M&A backlog within that also at a record level, underwriting strong pipeline as well and the industry trends are robust. Yes, there is geopolitical and other discussions, but we are seeing the client engagement at high levels across the Americas, across Europe, it\u2019s broad, I highlighted a few of the sectors, but it\u2019s really across many sectors not just the ones I mentioned, PMT, natural resources and healthcare. And CEO confidence is strong, the firms have cash. It\u2019s driven by a lot of things, lower taxes and also the repatriations. So, the trade factor is there, but we have seen no impact on client\u2019s activity and it\u2019s clear to us and to our corporate clients that those strategic benefits outweigh the potential to receive challenges.","Michael Carrier","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just as a follow-up, just want to get your perspective, like this is the second quarter where revenue growth has been strong, you guys produced operating leverage, ROE is year-to-date 14, TE is 15%, but valuation, it doesn\u2019t seem like you get much credit, is there \u2013 is it more just consistency over time, do you think they will follow through and the growth in book value will eventually deliver or from a disclosure standpoint and maybe some of the newer businesses whether it\u2019s on the lending side, is there more that maybe could be down or that you guys are looking into to maybe improve disclosure and transparency?","Marty Chavez","Well, certainly Michael, we are leading in running the business for the long-term and we know that that the importance obviously of delivering revenue and earnings growth, hence the growth strategy that we outlined for the market is driving more recurring fee based revenue banding products and services and broadening the client base and that\u2019s something that you can see in our results and it\u2019s something that we are going to continue to work on. And our view is that as we do this the market will over time recognize that. For me, for Heather, for all of us at the firm, disclosure is a huge priority and we are open to any and all suggestions and recommendations from you, the analysts, from our investors and we are taking them on board and you can see some of that in my prepared remarks and as we go through the Q&A you will see more of it.","Michael Carrier","Okay. Thanks a lot Marty.","Marty Chavez","You bet.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Marty Chavez","Hello Christian.","Christian Bolu","Hello, good morning Marty. So just to have follow-up on operating leverage, it was pretty impressive in the first half as you said revenue growth of 22% in pre-tax even high at 33%, while all investing for growth, question is how should we think about operating leverage for the full year, I guess the comp ratio was down 200 bps for the quarter, is that a good way to think about the full year or should we be thinking about more in efficiency ratio, just we would like to get more color from you?","Marty Chavez","The comp to net revenue ratio, and as you know, Christian, is 39% is our best estimate at this point for the full year. Operating leverage is a lens through which we examine many of our decisions. We know it\u2019s important to our stakeholders, it\u2019s important to us and as we make our investments, we keep those, we keep that in mind. And when we set the compensation ratio, we are looking at a variety of scenarios, but we are especially looking at our 3-year growth plan and those are all the factors that go into it. If you are going to see from us, we will remain focused on operating leverage in the back half of the year, the revenue environment is certainly a factor, but it also just like to emphasize that the comps in that revenue ratio, our best estimate for the year is an output of all of these other considerations. The main drivers are revenues and the growth plan and our emphasis on earnings and revenue growth.","Christian Bolu","Okay, thank you. Maybe a bigger picture question on Marcus and the competitive landscape there, I think your vision is really to build out a comprehensive digital consumer platform, it sounds like other folks are thinking the same thing, JPMorgan launched its FIN digital initiative, Citi is talking about expanding and enhancing its footprint, even PNC is talking about its international bank. So, in light of that sort of that evolving competitive landscape kind of what\u2019s Goldman\u2019s edge in building out Marcus here?","Marty Chavez","Well, Christian, as we outlined and this is the way we are making all of our decisions as we build out this business indeed as we launched ourselves into this business in the first place with the insertion point that you know, which is the installment loans that offers the deposit offering, we are always looking at it from a few perspectives. First, is this a large addressable market? Are there significant pain points that we can solve for our new clients, does it play to our strengths and something that we have been doing for decades that the firm is prudently managing risk in deploying capital and also building software? And is it an opportunity where we can have results that are material for us without requiring a large market share and other attractive risk returns for our shareholders? So as we developed this vision, you are seeing more of the offerings and it\u2019s coming into focus? And the emphasis for us is on what is the consumer\u2019s pain point and how can we solve it in a differentiated way given also that we don\u2019t have the legacy of scale mainframe systems and we don\u2019t have the bricks and mortars. And so as we are doing this and this was of course one of the things that attracted us to Clarity Money, it\u2019s the AB testing, it\u2019s the emphasis on making it an easy user experience leading with the behavioral economics, a better service. We know this is a competitive and commoditized business and we know that we have to differentiate ourselves and earn our way into it. That\u2019s what we are doing.","Christian Bolu","Awesome. Thank you very much, Marty.","Marty Chavez","You bet.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Marty Chavez","Good morning, Mike.","Mike Mayo","Hi. My question relates to why isn\u2019t Lloyd Blankfein staying to the end of the year and what changes do you expect with David Solomon taking over the helmet, Lloyd or David saw in this call if they could answer that would be great?","Marty Chavez","Well, Mike, you just got me for the call this morning and but I am happy to answer it, because this one is straightforward. What you saw in today\u2019s announcement was another step in the unfolding of the board\u2019s plan, which has been in place actually looking back for a real long time. Now you have seen various moments in the succession plans and today is one of those moments. The board has made its choice and its selection fair and that\u2019s been developing over the last \u2013 over the last several months, obvious, but important to say Lloyd and David and all of us have worked together over years and decades on our management committee. The average tenure is something like 20 some years. And so this is all part of the plan is for strategy, David and Lloyd and I and many of us have been working on our strategy and you have seen that develop over time you have seen it in conferences, there is going to be more discussions at upcoming conferences. You will hear the emphasis on more recurring fee-based revenue and you have seen that in the results, the emphasis on the growth plan on driving revenue and earnings growth. All of these are parts of the strategy and David has been instrumental in that strategy, I don\u2019t have any evolutions beyond that to announce right now, so stay tuned.","Mike Mayo","Alright. Well, if I can follow-up, just in terms of the backlog being up, what\u2019s the percentage change, because you are saying it\u2019s a record backlog first quarter to second quarter, how much is that up?","Marty Chavez","So, I am not going to breakout the percentage change other than to say that it was strong growth on the quarter with significance on the quarter and not only as I mentioned was it a record for the overall banking segment in backlog, it\u2019s a record M&A or financial advisory backlog and underwriting is at the second highest level ever. And then if you look within underwriting separately, debt underwriting and equity underwriting, those are each at the second highest level ever.","Mike Mayo","So, last follow-up, so is this a sign that the economy is finally turning up a notch? We had the tax cut, we had some excitement about reflation we are waiting for this to kick in more forcefully. So now you have record backlogs that you just described, is that a function of that or is that just unique to Goldman Sachs sometimes these revenues are lumpy?","Marty Chavez","Well, we are certainly seeing all kinds of trends at play and you mentioned some of them, we have seen resilient growth across many economies, rising U.S. rates, do the unwinds, tax reform behind us and therefore a lot more clarity on its stronger U.S. labor market, CEO confidence, GDP growth, all of those things are part of the macro backdrop and the momentum feels good. That combined with this franchise, that\u2019s by many most metrics number one quarter-to-quarter, year-after-year over the long haul, the combination of those two is powerful.","Mike Mayo","Alright, thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jeff Harte with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Marty Chavez","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Harte","Good morning. So, a couple from me. One, looking back at the last quarter, one of the things I liked at least about the quarter was the spike in the balance sheet, we didn\u2019t really see a follow-through into this quarter, can you talk a little bit about what you are seeing as far as client demand for your balance sheet and kind of what\u2019s your outlook is there?","Marty Chavez","So, Jeff, we talked about this a fair bit. We like to say we are in the moving rather than the storage business and that\u2019s really something that you are seeing in the quarter. So balance sheet, as you noted as I mentioned was flat down $5 billion on the quarter. Within that, the movement in the balance sheet remains high and that gives the opportunity to allocate the balance sheet on a daily basis and to prioritize the way that we are dedicating financial resources and resources of various kinds to our clients that it\u2019s really a velocity story.","Jeff Harte","Okay. You mentioned the tax rate, I believe you said 20% for 2018, which you had expected, hadn\u2019t you been before been talking about 23% or 24% kind of longer term is, is that a 2018 specific decline or should we be thinking about the longer term tax rate being lower as well?","Marty Chavez","Yes, it is a 2018 story and that\u2019s our estimate for the full year. As you know when they are discrete items, equity-based compensation, for instance, we recognized those in the quarter, where they happen. Certainly, in terms of this year\u2019s tax rate, as we know, it\u2019s a transitional year for parts of the tax reform specifically the guilty and the beat taxes. As for 2019, the 24% rate that I highlighted before that\u2019s our best \u2013 that\u2019s what I would suggest you as the sensible model and assumption.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Marty Chavez","Hello Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good morning, how are you doing?","Marty Chavez","Great. Thank you.","Betsy Graseck","Good. I have one follow-up question and then one other question, on the follow-up I know we talked already about the comp ratio and I know in your commentary you indicated, look that\u2019s going to be a function of revenues, but also profitability, so my question is around profitability, are you kind of suggesting to us in that commentary that you really don\u2019t want to go below 12% ROE, because we kept the 41, it would have been below that?","Marty Chavez","We were not setting the comp ratio in that way at all Betsy, I mean of course we are looking at all kinds of things. As I mentioned, the philosophy of comps hasn\u2019t changed at all, but the framework hasn\u2019t changed either. The \u2013 I am well aware that we don\u2019t typically reduce the comp rates in the second quarter and though it has happened in the past really the framework is the same we are looking at where the revenues are and paying for performance. We don\u2019t have ROE targets. One thing that I would say that is an evolution and I mentioned this in the prepared remarks is that as we build and scale our businesses and apply more automation everywhere, it\u2019s natural to think about comp and non-comp holistically. And that\u2019s of course the efficiency ratio is one way to do it, pretax margin does it too and that is increasingly an emphasis for us on driving the efficiency ratio lower. And that\u2019s how we got that.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. So you have mentioned the profitability as one of the factors for assessing that, are we thinking about ROE or is there a different profitability measure you are thinking about?","Marty Chavez","One of the fascinating things about our businesses where we are thinking about so many things, it\u2019s this combinatoric optimization across all kinds of metrics and constraints. We certainly do spend a lot of time thinking about our pretax as well as our pretax margin.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.","Brennan Hawken","Hey good morning, Marty. So I was just Googling combinatoric to try to figure out. Quick one on Marcus, thanks for the increased disclosure especially on the refreshed FICO, that\u2019s helpful, I know it\u2019s a new business for you guys, but I definitely appreciate the attempts to improve and enhance the disclosures there. You mentioned the 4% to 5% annual loss rate on Marcus, is that still the through the cycle view or \u2013 number one and then are you provisioned at a level that\u2019s greater than that currently given that we are in the later innings of the cycle and can you can you give us some perspectives on that?","Marty Chavez","Well, yes Brennan as I am happy to note that you saw the increased disclosure, I am working on it. The 4% to 5% is our best estimate and we are absolutely provisioned higher than that.","Brennan Hawken","Cool. Thank you. And then another one is the narratives and chatter we are hearing on cash management and how you guys are considering a shift towards cash management, actually I think Marty you have referenced that in prior calls, could you \u2013 how should we think about how you are considering positioning yourselves in the marketplace there, what do you think would differentiate Goldman\u2019s offering versus competitors, why do you \u2013 what do you think the value proposition of Goldman is in blues in that business, because it\u2019s rather different than what we are used to thinking of as far as Goldman and the position in the marketplace?","Marty Chavez","Sure. So as you know and as we have discussed and you have seen this we have started by making a partner level hire of an engineer for this business. And I think that tells you a lot right there about how we are approaching it. One of the interesting things about technology and software generally is that there is paradigm shifts that happens about every 20 years and that\u2019s actually pretty stable cycle. And if you look at the cash management offerings that are out there, what\u2019s immediately obvious is they really haven\u2019t changed much for two whole 20-year cycles. So, they are not too different than they were in the \u201870s and so that\u2019s an opportunity right there. But especially, as we evaluated this business, the adjacencies to our core franchise are striking and obvious. We have corporate relationships that are the best on the street and we have been working to broaden those corporate relationships through the companies who are our clients, well beyond the CEO and CFO to treasurers, assistant treasurers, procurement and so we have been building that connectivity and then also the adjacency to our foreign exchange business is obvious. And so there is some analogies to the Marcus. The same evaluation criteria we laid out that led us to Marcus are leading us to this business exactly. There is a sizable revenue pool, where having our small share of that revenue pool is going to be meaningful for us and it\u2019s an exciting opportunity, given changes in technology, payment rails and so many things. That\u2019s the opportunity and we are seeing it as a 2 to 3-year build.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Marty Chavez","Good morning, Guy.","Guy Moszkowski","Thanks. Good morning. Before I ask a question, I just \u2013 I know he is not on the call, but I just thought in case he listens to it later or something, I think really we all owe a hat tip to Lloyd for his leadership over these 12 years through good times and bad. And some things that were very idiosyncratic to Goldman Sachs, which he managed through I think super effectively with the team, so just a hat tip to him. Beyond that, I also want to say thanks for the Marcus data, which I thought was interesting and also a little bit of color you gave on some of the other initiatives that were laid out back in September of last year. We are coming up on the 1 year anniversary of when you laid those out in some detail and I was wondering when might we expect a more fulsome discussion of kind of where you are in terms of meeting some of those objectives?","Marty Chavez","Well, sure. First, let me start with your hat tip to Lloyd. We feel the same way. That\u2019s a delightful, lovely thing you said and also immensely well-deserved. So I will be sure to pass it on to Lloyd, who has been an amazing leader and he has made all of us better. So on to your next question on the growth initiatives, yes, I will step back for a minute. So the way we are looking at the growth initiatives is there are 7 revenue lines in the growth initiatives and we are making solid progress on all of them at or ahead in some cases, well ahead of our targets. And beneath that there is 40 plus key performance indicators and we see those as precursors, harbingers of the revenue and important to track as well, which we do on a granular and as you would expect from us highly automated basis. I, we, many of us, David, all of us look at it weekly to see how we are going. I laid out some of them for you. So, for instance, on the expanding client coverage in both FICC and equities, you will remember that that\u2019s a $600 plus million annual revenue target in 3 years\u2019 time, for FICC, expanding across clients, especially the asset managers. And we are definitively seeing in broker votes and third-party surveys and all kinds of measures of wallet share that we are making solid progress there. Equities, similarly I mentioned 100 basis point expansion in wallet share since 2016, up 140, to be a little bit more precise and that\u2019s with those systematic in quant clients and half of that progress has happened this year to give you a flavor of some of the KPIs, but we know that the market is looking for the mark-to-market. We have mentioned $5 billion annual revenue in 3 years time without the market opportunity set expanding that\u2019s just work that we are doing. And we are going to give you that detail and you are going to hear it from us in the back half of this year.","Guy Moszkowski","Okay. I think that, that will be really helpful. So, thank you for that. Just on something that is related, but is going to be maybe a little nitpicky given that it\u2019s a quarter, but I am just curious in the equities business, which you pointed to, the fact is you were flat year-over-year in the second quarter at a time when your peer group that has reported so far were up on average I think so far about 20% year-over-year, granted there is 10 point sensitivity to these types of analyses, but I am just wondering were there any particular things that might have held you back in the equities business this quarter as we try to think about how we kind of annualize and go forward?","Marty Chavez","I will start by saying our equities franchise, which I had the opportunity to co-head some number of years ago, it\u2019s one that I wouldn\u2019t trade for anyone else\u2019s equity franchise, it\u2019s global, it\u2019s balanced across cash and derivatives, we are doing exciting things in automation and engineering all over it. We have a leading prime platform and that business also had as you know in the second quarter of last year strong performance, solid performance and so the comp was tough. We breakout that segment as you know in three ways. So, it\u2019s more granular than the peer group. I mentioned one of those in specific, but I am happy to go into any of them if you would like, but let\u2019s say starting with commissions and fees, I will note that those revenues were stable and again it is just one quarter versus the second quarter with commission rates going down. And so while we always thought of 2018 as the year of adapting to MiFID II and observing and making changes in our business, we also highlighted for you that we had the view that MiFID II benefits would accrue, do scale players with leading research content and we are one of them and we are seeing abundant signs of that, picking up share from the lower tiers, people who do not have that kind of scale and diversification. The last thing I would say is that on the derivatives component which we highlighted, so in Equities Client Execution same year-on-year, but greater contribution from cash and lower from derivatives, some of those derivative transactions can be lumpy and we certainly have them in the second quarter and less of it \u2013 second quarter last year, less of it in the second quarter of this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Jim Mitchell","Hey, good morning.","Marty Chavez","Good morning, Jim.","Jim Mitchell","Good morning. First, maybe just on follow-up on Marcus, I thought it was interesting that you are looking to expand in the UK, just what kind of drove that decision and could we see follow-through with perhaps a lending product in the UK or do we see other markets, do you enter other markets, how do we think about where that\u2019s heading?","Marty Chavez","So, what drove that decision was the opportunity to continue to diversify our funding channels and we clearly saw that in the UK. And as we built out that offering, it fits all of the parameters that you have seen from us in our digital consumer finance offering so far and you will see more of them as we evolve the strategy. We are always considering new products. There are many new products that were determined to build in the U.S. and we are always considering them, expanding them geographically. And I have nothing beyond that to announce right now.","Jim Mitchell","Fine, I mean you are not limiting markets to the domestic, I think is obviously the takeaway here.","Marty Chavez","Absolutely not.","Jim Mitchell","Okay. And maybe just a question on the SCB impact, obviously it\u2019s as you pointed out year-to-year it\u2019s going to be very different, is there other way if it stays as the economy continues to get better and the test seems to get tougher and tougher, is there a way to reduce stressed volatility in your view or do you think there might be changes to the test, so that is still a pretty big step up to the SCB from the prior buffer, I am just trying to think through that your model and some of the pure play investment banks tend to get \u2013 seem to get harder, let\u2019s say harder in the stress test, is there anything you see that\u2019s sort of easy to do that could help alleviate some of that or is it just sort of you got up that year-to-year?","Marty Chavez","Well, let\u2019s start off by saying that the CCAR stress was hugely important for the safety and soundness of the financial system and it\u2019s an important part of our process and we are supporters of it. We also have our own capital management plan and framework and analytics. And our view is we have ample capital, where we are right now, so you know we are at 12.6%. Our benchmark for capital on standardized CET1 basis was 12.5% and we designed that policy and so that it is as I said want to give this ample capital. To step back and to look at the CCAR process, it was more severe. If you look across the industry, you will see that that the best SCB estimate using DFAST 2018 is in several cases higher than the current capital level. And the math is pretty straightforward, so for us it\u2019s 6% the peak to trough, add to that the 4.5% minimum and the 2.5% GSIB buffer, you get 13% without any management buffer, so that math is easy. And it is just one print. The Federal Reserve has said quite specifically that they view overall capital levels in the industry to be appropriate. And then also if you look back historically over 3 year to 5 year period as I mentioned for us the peak to trough has been 5, not 6. And there is a bunch of other things to consider here. The SCB is a proposed rule and as we know as rules become final all kinds of things happen. The regulators have been very specific that they are open to comments. You can see our bilateral comments to the Fed and you can see the industry rather, so we have certainly shared our views with the Fed. And we will wait and see how they will adapt, I can think of many ways averaging and so on and you said recalibration is one. There is many ways to comport these statements that results of this year\u2019s test are more severe with the Fed\u2019s statement that capital levels are appropriate for the industry across the board. The last thing I mentioned is that if the SCB is finalized, the relevant print would be DFAST 2019, not the one that we just saw. However, this all settles as we always do with the rules, we\u2019ll comply and we\u2019ll adjust them and it will be fine.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.","Marty Chavez","Hello Devin.","Devin Ryan","Great. Thanks. Good morning Marty, I guess question here on Clarity Money and just what you guys have done since the acquisition, the strategy to drive more customers into the app and then just how we should think about that in terms of kind of broader consumer finance wealth management growth especially as you had more products of the offering?","Marty Chavez","Well, certainly \u2013 actually, I was just talking to Adam Dell this morning and if you walk into our building, you can see Clarity Money on the pillar and I have absolutely sometime ago downloaded it myself and used it. Generally, as you know, historically over time, our approach at the firm has been we build all our own software. And as we have discussed in the past, we have changed that approach to see can we find it in open source or can we find something that\u2019s already out there. And in the case of Clarity Money, we saw something that was beautifully designed from the user experience for the consumer and it made much more sense to join Clarity Money with our brand and our resources than to go build it on our own. And what we immediately saw in it and this is playing out is we saw it as a front door to all of the Marcus offerings, buy, save, spend, protect, invest and we saw it as a way to lower acquisition costs, which is a fascinating thing about the way that they have done it and we see it as a platform in which we can aggregate content and provide all of the services and products that we are developing in a consistent way, consistent brand and look and feel.","Devin Ryan","Okay, great. Thanks for the color. And then maybe a follow-up here just on kind of the investment bank commentary, I mean, it seems that anytime we are talking about record backlogs, we get questions around whether we are close to a cyclical peak. So when you look across the franchise, how do you think about that just based on the metrics that you look at, meaning what areas seem to be maybe hitting close to on all cylinders and are there areas or regions where you just feel like there could be quite a bit of upside just to even get back to some type of baseline activity level?","Marty Chavez","Well, the way I would look at the first half of 2018 is it was great results and no question that we are pleased with them. And it was a good opportunity set. It wasn\u2019t a fantastic or great opportunity set. And so it really demonstrates the potential of our franchise, all of the businesses, all of the segments first half on first half growing double-digit percentages, with really a modest improvement in the backdrop. Certainly in that macro backdrop, we see all kinds of things, which we have mentioned, GDP accelerating, CEO confidence, tax reform clarity, now that the reform act is behind us. All of those things suggest that momentum is strong and so there is a lot to play for in the back half of the year and going forward.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.","Marty Chavez","Hello, Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","Good morning, Marty. Hi. Couple of questions for you. You pointed out that you guys were the number one provider or underwriter of leverage loans in the quarter. Can you give us some color on the underwriting trends you are seeing there since you are such a strong player in this market? For example, debt to EBITDA or other type of metrics that you guys look at, are they becoming more aggressive, less aggressive, can you share us some color there?","Marty Chavez","So, sure. I will start by saying that we have been extremely successful in taking out bridges indicating risk. The vintages are profitable certainly in a small number of situations that have been a bit tougher. We have been well protected by the flex. And as we look at that business, we are seeing all kinds of evidence of the industry at large, our competitors re-pricing and changing the terms. And that\u2019s a dynamic that obviously is a good thing. Terms, as you have alluded to, had gotten tighter, but more recently they have re-priced. Our focus remains there always on the velocity of that book. And as for the LBO book itself, I would say it\u2019s important to acknowledge the size of that book is small. It\u2019s order of $7.5 billion and there is a couple of dozen transactions in the book and no one of those transactions is more than $1 billion. So, all of those parameters remain really well-controlled.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And in looking at your net interest income, you pointed out that it\u2019s at a run-rate of about $2.5 billion. Just under, I think 7% or so of total revenues. What do you see that, over the next 3 to 5 years, as Marcus grows and as you grow your corporate loan book, what do you think that can reach as a percentage of revenue?","Marty Chavez","Well, we have certainly highlighted for you that we are emphasizing in our strategy not only expanding the client base and delivering more products and services to that expanded client base, but also revenue growth, earnings growth, more recurring, stable, fee-based revenues. And so I am not going to give a percentage overall firm target because we don\u2019t think about it in that way as a specific target, but it is something that we are working everyday to grow over the long-haul.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Al Alevizakos with HSBC. Please go ahead.","Marty Chavez","Good morning, Al.","Al Alevizakos","Hi, thank you. Hi, Marty. Thank you for the color that you gave on the equities business. I really appreciated the disclosure regarding the cash and the derivatives. However, I was mostly interested about prime brokerage. You basically suggested that the numbers were flat year-on-year despite the fact that it seems like all your peers said that year-on-year revenues were up. So I was trying to understand whether if it was an issue primarily with the margins or something happened regarding your volumes and you couldn\u2019t grow the business. And I have got a second question on asset management as well.","Marty Chavez","So, let\u2019s start with that first question on prime. Yes, the revenues and securities services year-on-year are essentially flat, but inside that, it\u2019s important to say that client balances grew year-on-year, net spreads compressed and hence flat revenue all-in.","Al Alevizakos","Okay, thanks for that. And then from a modeling perspective, I am just trying to understand on the asset management. First of all, is there any kind of seasonality in incentive fees that we can use going forward? And then secondly, would you say, I know that incentive fees are one-off by nature, but was there something particularly one-off this quarter?","Marty Chavez","Yes. So there is no particular seasonality that I can think of to share with you on the recognition of incentive fees. These incentive fees are difficult to predict and they did in part drive the revenue beat in that segment. In this case, they were triggered by harvesting and the variety of funds, but one of them that I will mention is our Vintage 5 fund. So the harvesting of that triggered the recognition of the incentive fees in this quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.","Marty Chavez","Hello, Brian.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Hey, good afternoon or good morning still. Quick question on the NII that\u2019s in the I&L, I know you gave the run-rate of being $2.5 billion. Is there a way to kind of give what\u2019s been the biggest driver or what\u2019s the biggest contribution to that run-rate right now? Is it the merchant bank? Is it the corporate lending initiatives? And then kind of what was the corporate lending growth quarter-on-quarter?","Marty Chavez","So it really is loan growth, very, very broad-based. And so if you look at our HFI loans receivable, they grew $3 billion on the quarter. So, they now stand at \u2013 I am sorry, 3%. They now stand at $74 billion and in dollar terms, they grew $2.4 billion. And there is a whole variety of components of that growth and essentially all of them grew and contributed to those figures that I just gave you. And it\u2019s really across corporate, private wealth management, our institutional lending and financing or SSG business as well as Marcus.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Great. And then just real quick of stress test that given your results in some of these specific loan categories tended to be much worse from what peers were specifically kind of looking at how your results came out within residential mortgage. So did that affect how you manage that business going forward, because it\u2019s hard to see how when the Fed has given you almost 50% cumulative losses that you have got to get an appropriate risk-adjusted return or risk adjusted return on invested capital with those kind of loss rate assumptions being built in? I mean is that just a portfolio that you can walk away from at some point?","Marty Chavez","Well, we certainly look as you know at all of our businesses through a large number of metrics and the way they are treated in CCAR is certainly one of the many metrics. And it\u2019s an important one overall at the firm level. It\u2019s a binding constraint for us. And certainly, as we look at CCAR and we have been very public in saying this, we saw differences, divergences in our calculations from the Fed. We are always looking for more transparency and I am going to comment on an individual asset class as it plays through CCAR, but certainly more transparency into the process, in the modeling, in the calculations would benefit everyone.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.","Marty Chavez","Since there are no more questions, I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank everyone for joining the call. On behalf of our senior management team, we hope to see many of you in the coming months. Any additional questions arise in the meantime please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to Heather. Otherwise, have a great summer and we look forward to speaking with you on the third quarter call in October.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does include the Goldman Sachs second quarter 2018 earnings conference call.

This call is being recorded today, October 16, 2014. Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.","Dane Holmes","Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm's belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain and outside of the firm's control. The firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements.","For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2013. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets and Global Core Excess. And you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that is posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com.","This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent.","Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, will now review the firm's results. Harvey?","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through our third quarter results, then I'm obviously happy to answer any questions.","Third quarter net revenues were $8.4 billion; net earnings, $2.2 billion; earnings per diluted share, $4.57. Core to our strategy over the past few years has been a consistent focus on strengthening our relative position within the industry. Our success begins with a fundamental approach of engaging our clients, understanding their challenges and then addressing their needs. That is the foundation for expanding the breadth and depth of our existing relationships and the basis for building new ones.","For the first nine months in 2014, revenues are 1.4 billion higher than this time last year. The increase reflects the combination of greater client activity in certain businesses and a strong market position. For example, as client activity picked up in global M&A, you saw an increase in our market share. Our global market share in announced M&A for the year-to-date of 29% is up 300 basis points compared to 2013. Our volume advantage to our next closest peer is more than $100 billion.","We have also been focused on making sure that we are well positioned to deliver operating leverage as client activity increases. In 2011, we announced an operating efficiency initiative. This initiative was subsequently increased twice and ultimately reached nearly $2 billion. We continue to expand upon that prior initiative to grow margins and increase returns. The benefits of those efforts are demonstrated in our year-to-date results. We had 1.4 billion of incremental revenues and nearly $1 billion of incremental pre-tax earnings. Ultimately, the embedded operating leverage contributed to an improvement in our year-to-date annualized return on common equity to 11.2%. We have also achieved this result by being a prudent allocator of our global resources. Getting this right not only drives positive results for our clients, but also for our shareholders.","Now let me take you through the quarterly results for each of our businesses. In Investment Banking, we produced third quarter net revenues of $1.5 billion, down 18% compared to a strong second quarter. Importantly, our investment banking backlog increased again during the quarter, reaching its highest level since 2007. Third quarter advisory revenues were 594 million, up 17% from the second quarter on an increase in completed activity. Year-to-date Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&A. We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the third quarter, including Hillshire Brands' $8.6 billion sales to Tyson Foods, InterMune\u2019s $8.3 billion sale to Roche Holdings and Gates Corporation\u2019s $5.4 billion sale to Blackstone. We're also an advisor on a number of significant announced transactions. For example, we\u2019re advising on TRW Automotive's $13.5 billion sale to ZF Friedrichshafen, Siemens' $7.6 billion acquisition of Dresser-Rand and Corio's \u20ac7.2 billion sale to Kl\u00e9pierre.","Moving to underwriting. Net revenues were 870 million in the third quarter, down 32% compared to record second quarter results. Equity underwriting revenues, up 426 million, were 22% lower sequentially as industry wide activity decline in the third quarter across secondary offerings. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in global equity and equity related and common stock offerings. Debt underwriting revenues decreased 39% from a record second quarter to 444 million due to reduced activity particularly within leverage finance.","During the third quarter, we remained committed to meeting our clients' diverse finance needs, whether it was Alibaba\u2019s $25 billion IPO, Sysco\u2019s $5 billion financing in support of its acquisition of US Foods or ADP's $1.6 billion high-yield offering.","Turning to Institutional Client Services. Net revenues were $3.8 billion in the third quarter with FICC Client Execution of 2.2 billion and Equities of $1.6 billion. ICS includes a one-time $270 million gain related to the tender of a portion of our trust preferred security. Excluding the fixed portion of the one-time gain in DVA, FICC Client Execution net revenues were $2 billion in the third quarter, down 11% sequentially. Mortgages declined quarter-over-quarter as clients were less active amid a relatively stable backdrop of prices. Credit declined significantly as increased volatility, wider credit spreads and lower issuance provided a more difficult backdrop. Currencies, interest rates and commodities were all higher sequentially as volatility and volumes generally increased from relatively low levels.","When you exclude equities portion of the one-time gain in DVA, the results within this segment were as follows. Total Equities net revenues were $1.5 billion, down 10% sequentially; Equities Client Execution net revenues of $372 million were down 26% quarter-over-quarter reflecting lower net revenues in cash products; commissions and fees were 745 million, relatively flat with the second quarter; securities services generated net revenues of 343 million, down 8% sequentially from the seasonally stronger second quarter.","Turning to risk. Average daily VaR in the third quarter was 66 million, down 14% relative to the second quarter, mostly driven by interest rates.","Moving on to our Investing & Lending activities. Collectively they produced net revenues of $1.7 billion in the third quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of 876 million, primarily reflecting company specific events including IPOs and net gains in public equities. For example, one of our investments, Mobileye went public and our investment generated 285 million in net gains during the third quarter. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were 606 million and benefited from net gains on certain investments due to asset sales and net interest income. Other revenues of 210 million include revenues from the Firm\u2019s consolidated investments.","In Investment Management, we reported third quarter net revenues of $1.5 billion. Management and other fees reached a record 1.21 billion. During the quarter total assets under supervision increased $8 billion to a record $1.15 trillion.","Let me quickly walk you through the long-term flows. Long-term assets under supervision had net inflows of $13 billion with 7 billion in equity assets and $6 billion in fixed income assets. This was largely offset by foreign currency translation which drove net market depreciation of $12 billion. As we have discussed before, the key to long-term success is delivering strong and consistent performance for our Investment Management clients. Across the global platform, 81% of our client mutual funds' assets ranked in the top two quartiles on a three-year basis and 76% ranked in the top two quartiles on a five-year basis.","Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits, was accrued at a compensation-to-net revenues ratio of 40%. This is 300 basis points lower than the Firm's accrual in the first half of the year. The lower compensation accrual reflects stronger year-to-date revenues, greater clarity on full year compensation levels and our continued efforts to improve operating efficiency across the firm. Third quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.3 billion, down 4% sequentially.","Now let me quickly run you through some key stats. Total staff at the end of the third quarter was approximately 33,500. This is up 3% from the second quarter due to summer hiring. Our effective tax rate was 31% year-to-date. Our global core excess liquidity ended the quarter at $180 million. Our Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio was 11.8% using the advanced approach. It was 11.1% under the standardized approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished the quarter at 4.9% based on the final rules. We repurchased 7.1 million shares of common stock for $1.25 billion during the quarter. And finally, we announced an increase in our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.55 to $0.60 per share.","Before we turn to Q&A, let me leave you with some concluding thoughts. A constant in our history as a public company is an unrelenting desire to provide world class service to our clients and superior returns to our shareholders. Given the dynamic nature of our industry, meeting that objective requires adaptability. Since we went public in 1999, there are several examples that are readily available. We went from 250 billion assets in 1999 to 1.2 trillion in 2008 and then back to approximately $870 billion today. And along the way we made Goldman Sachs a stronger firm. We increased our common equity from $10 million to over $70 billion and substantially increased our liquidity pool which now fits at $180 billion. We have expanded our global footprint and increased the diversity of our franchise. Our number of offices is up by more than a third to over 50 with one quarter of our staff located in Bangalore, Salt Lake City, Singapore and Texas.","Back in 1999, we had approximately 3,000 people in our technology division. Now we have nearly 8,000. They represent close to a quarter of the firm. We also built an Asset Management business, largely organically, from a few hundred million assets under supervision to 1.15 trillion today. By adapting, we\u2019ve fundamentally improved the strength of our Firm, our opportunity set and as a result our ability to deliver for our clients and our shareholders. Going forward, we will make any necessary changes to continue our history of providing superior client service and generating industry leading returns. It\u2019s what our clients, our shareholders and our culture demands.","Now just before I take your questions, I\u2019d like to make one additional closing comment about the market environment we\u2019ve seen over the past week and particularly yesterday and this morning. It\u2019s clearly an environment that reminds all of us about the power of investor sentiment and how fragile it can be at times. Yesterday in particular, it was clearly a market in the morning where investors were, quite frankly, shooting first and asking questions later. We've seen this market reaction in the past. And while painful, it\u2019s somewhat a normal part of how markets function. Clearly investors are now debating whether we\u2019ll see lower rates for longer and more importantly whether the global economy is slowing or continuing to grow. These are questions that the market has certainly debated before. We\u2019ve always believed that over the long term markets follow fundamentals.","In speaking with our economists only yesterday, they would argue that nothing has fundamentally changed in the past few weeks or certainly the last 24 hours regarding the long-term outlook for the global economy. That doesn\u2019t mean it will continue to grow, but it certainly doesn\u2019t mean it will stall. For us, in any environment, it\u2019s always about staying close to our clients. Yesterday was a difficult day for many of them. Our focus is being there for them. We have the intellectual capital and the financial capital to help address their needs and we remain committed to doing it.","With that, I\u2019m happy to take any of your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI. Please go ahead.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","Hi, thanks.","Harvey Schwartz","Good morning, Glenn.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","Good morning. So Investment & Lending continues to do great and the future being what it is with this quarter. But I\u2019m just curious, you mentioned the good IPO market obviously, but if you could break down maybe on the equity side what was realized gains versus marks and then if we\u2019ve seen any changes in the composition of the overall asset base between equity debt and lending assets?","Harvey Schwartz","There hasn\u2019t been a major shift from the -- if you look at the Investing & Lending balance sheet, you won't see a major shift in terms of the quarter. As you know, the investing and the lending business, it\u2019s a long term business and so you will see changes overtime. Obviously, as I highlighted, we continue to harvest. Part of that is obviously driven by the strength in the market but also part of that is driven by the idiosyncratic strength of the portfolio. And so it continues to perform quite well.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","But no breakdown on realized or unrealized on the equity side?","Harvey Schwartz","So it's not a question of realized or unrealized. I mean that's why I am struggling with that point. In terms of when you are talking about things of, for example public versus event driven events, but we've always mark to marketed the portfolio as we work through. And so a good portion of the events over the past quarter were all events and IPOs as I highlighted.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","Okay, good. That's all I was really calling calling towards.","Harvey Schwartz","Sorry, I got confused by your wording.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","No worries. I confuse myself too. I appreciate the comment on some of the balance sheet data that everyone is looking for. Maybe just one more thing on total losses absorbing capital, you are at the highs, you have tons and you turned out a lot of your long-term debt. You also have among the highs short-term wholesale funding at last look which the Fed has focused on. And so last quarter you did a bunch of repositioning ahead of CCAR and reducing balance sheet and the repo book. I am assuming that no call-out means no big changes this quarter. But if you could just comment on repo book size, short-term wholesale funding and if any more adjustments are needed?","Harvey Schwartz","So at this stage we don't feel there is any adjustment needed. As we highlighted and we focused on in the last quarter, the balance sheet did come down pretty significantly. I will say with respect to the balance sheet, as you know, it\u2019s always going to be dynamic. And we'll always take our cues from the clients in the marketplace. But as you saw in the quarter, it basically went up $9 billion. And when you compare the quarter end to quarter end second quarter to third quarter liquidity pool, basically all of that's in the liquidity pool. So that was any growth in the balance sheet.","In terms of the balance sheet, we are going to continuing to remain very disciplined in terms of returns. And as you said, there was no response in terms of the CCAR process last year which drove us to reassess our ROE hurdles that we required and we did that in conjunction with our clients. But we will continue to focus on it. But as you said, the Firm's capital levels and liquidity levels remain quite high. I mean at this stage, 20% of the balance sheet is our liquidity pool.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","All right. Last one is -- I appreciate the comments on the market. In the past, when there were big spikes in volatility, if that happened in a short period of time, that was typically bad for the broker dealer community. But inventories are down like, I don't know, 80%, 90%. I am just curious if big spikes and volatility are less painful this go around given all the changes in broker dealer balance sheets?","Harvey Schwartz","So I think the comment with respect to the short-term reaction function as it relates to market volatility. As I mentioned, yesterday, today, particularly difficult days for our clients. And if it's difficult for our clients in the short run, markets can be challenging. And so we always root for good things for our clients and for good markets. We will have to see how this period of volatility translates. If you take a step back and you look at the third quarter, when we came into the third quarter, everybody was focused on the fact that there was absolutely no volatility. And as we here see here today people feel like there is too much. So it's a little bit of too hot, too cold. In September, I think a takeaway from September is that in the right market environments you can really see a huge pickup in client activity and then you can see the operating leverage for us.","In terms of the de-risking in terms of the balance sheet that you are seeing across the industry, I don't think that's a 'broker dealer' issue. I think if you look across large global financial institutions and you look at the reduction in risk-weighted assets over the course of the past several years, I think that's a question that we will see overtime as to whether or not that decline in risk carrying capacity along with other adjustments and other regulatory rules, what impact that has ultimately on liquidity for the marketplace. So we will see.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","I hear you. Okay, thanks very much. I appreciate it.","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks, Glenn.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey thanks, Harvey. Harvey, just one thing on the numbers, just in terms of the -- I think you gave the advanced and the standardized and it looks like that might have been the transitional for the general comment. Just wondered if you had the fully phased in?","Harvey Schwartz","Yeah. So the fully phased advanced is 10.6%, fully phased standardized is 10%. And I will remind you again that I think maybe it's a midpoint between fully phased and advanced if you were to think about -- sorry, fully phased advanced. And if you think about how our capital ratios migrate as we take investments out of funds, more or less think of it as a midpoint in terms of the long-term projection. That of course if you assume that between now and 2018, the balance sheet was totally static. ","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, that's helpful.","Harvey Schwartz","Which of course it won't be.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. And then just on composition in the comp ratio, I think the color that you gave is helpful and obviously it's a moving target. When I think about this year, last year, the true-up that you do in the third quarter and then you\u2019re trying to gauge what can happen in the fourth quarter, is there anything that's changing or is this just same process, you\u2019ll see other revenue environment factors in and then you'll readjust the fourth quarter? I just want to make sure the process isn't changing versus what you\u2019ve done in the past.","Harvey Schwartz","Well, absolutely no change in the process. I won\u2019t drag you through the underpinning to the process. We've talked about it a lot. But at its core, it\u2019s just paper performance. That\u2019s the philosophy and that\u2019s how we do it. In every quarter we make our best estimate as to the compensation accrual. And I think the extent to which you\u2019re seeing a change, there is no change in process. But you\u2019ve seen a change over the last two years just in our operating leverage and the cost reduction efforts that are coming in. And so this year's accrual reflects the fact that last year\u2019s third quarter looked 25% better year-over-year third quarter-third quarter and we\u2019re running $1.4 billion ahead in revenues. And so that just gives us greater clarity in terms of the compensation levels. But it reflects I think more predominantly the operating leverage that's in the business.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then finally just on -- I guess you went through some of the ratios on all the regulatory changes that we know and then you\u2019re coming up, whether it\u2019s an SVaR, a few factors, things that are ahead, but it also sounds like the industry is doing some things to maybe get in front of that and whether it\u2019s the agreement on derivatives, there was some chat around the repo markets going to CCPs. So I guess on any of these initiatives that are in the works, is there anything that you would point to that might take care of or deal with some of the concerns that the future regulatory items you\u2019re focused on? I know it\u2019s early, so I know typically you don\u2019t want to comment too much until the rules are out there, but just wanted to get your take, because it does seem a little bit different on the industry just trying to get and find out some of these things.","Harvey Schwartz","I think it\u2019s a really, really important question. I think that when you look at any one of the rules that in an industry we work with regulators on and regulators have put in place new capital requirements, new liquidity requirements under the LCR, leverage tests, in any one of these rules you could have a very active and heated debate with respect to the molecules in the rule and whether this was calibrated too intentionally. But I don\u2019t think you can debate really the concept of the rule. And so I think in concept most of the rules that we\u2019ve seen make sense and that goes back to the initiatives around clearing swap execution facilities. And I think you have to give the regulators a lot of credit quite frankly for creating an immense amount of regulation and proper regulatory response in giving folks a long time line to adjust to it, very important for our clients and for the capital markets.","I think the big open question is, and it's a very, very hard thing for any market participant and regulator to weigh if kind of what\u2019s the collective weight of all of this. And I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll really be able to assess that until a lot of time passes. I think when it comes to things like the discussions around having repo clearing, I think those are good, healthy market reactions. Generally speaking those are a combination of discussions with clients, because they raise concern, regulators observe, for example increased sales in treasury markets and I think it\u2019s incumbent upon all of us as market participants to be thoughtful and creative about how we make sure that we protect our capital markets. But I do think it\u2019s pretty early days in being able to assess these things. But I think the industry is being very active in trying to make sure that we have the most robust capital markets in the world.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Harvey Schwartz","Sure.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Harvey Schwartz","Good morning, Christian.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse","Good morning. Just wanted to follow up on the question on Investment & Lending. Debt revenues in particular were robust this quarter and stands out given the backdrop of credit were choppy in the quarter. You mentioned assets sales. I would appreciate any color on how much asset sales drove this quarter\u2019s revenues and more broadly any color on the long-term drivers of the debt line?","Harvey Schwartz","So in terms of the long-term that was the debt line, again this is just going to be our approach to how we think about allocating capital and when we see opportunities. So, during the period it\u2019s not so much that a specific asset responding to a particular change in credit spreads in the marketplace, but it will be driven by harvesting over a long period of time. So as companies refinance their capital structures, we may be a beneficiary in that, for example if we\u2019re providing mezzanine level debt to a particular entity. And so that\u2019s why we said that it was driven by many things on investment. And of course there is net interest income in there also which is roughly about $200 million.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Just on the investment banking backlogs, you mentioned that remained strong and increased again this quarter. Just curious, do you have any sense of how much of your backlogs that are tied to so called tax inversion deals?","Harvey Schwartz","So with respect to the backlog, the backlog again was the highest it's been since 2007. And actually when we look at it, we look at it across the three categories of advisory, equity underwriting and debt underwriting obviously and all categories were up. So that was good to see. It\u2019s not a question of I think inversions in the backlog. When you actually -- when you talk to our M&A team and you actually look at the data either this year over a long period of time, inversion transactions have not been a significant driver of global M&A activity. And really when you get into conversations with the team, what they'll tell you is it's never just about an inversion or a tax benefit, it\u2019s really about the strategic benefits if the two organizations can come together.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Just a quick clean up question here. In the earnings release you have referenced high impairment charges in non-comp expenses. Just would be helpful if you could kind of size that on what the nature of those charges relate to? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of kind of --.","Harvey Schwartz","I didn't hear -- I heard that you referenced non-comp. I didn\u2019t hear the first part of what do you said there?","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse","You said higher impairment charges within the non-comp line per your earnings release?","Harvey Schwartz","It\u2019s not a material number. We just called it out. But as you know, every quarter we mark-to-market the balance sheet and so assets sitting on the balance sheet. But this quarter it wasn\u2019t material, so roughly about $50 million.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse","50 million? Okay, thank you. And then just lastly for me. You spoke about strengthening your relative position across all your businesses. I guess the equities business is probably the one place where there has been some market share slip based on reported numbers anyway and I appreciate those numbers. I know it\u2019s really apples-to-apples. But was just curious to -- maybe help us frame Goldman\u2019s competitive position in that business and kind of a longer-term outlook.","Harvey Schwartz","So, with respect to longer term outlook and our sense of position in the marketplace, we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with it. We measure the business by our engagement with clients and our ability to deliver and that\u2019s in the prime brokerage business, in our global footprint, our ability to provide electronic solutions in terms of trading, commit capital and obviously our connectivity with our banking team in terms of driving capital markets transaction. And so from a franchise perspective, we couldn\u2019t feel better about it.","Quarter-to-quarter in terms of top line revenue, I know that\u2019s the data that you have available in terms of market share, not really the way we look at market share. We\u2019re much more focused, as I said, on delivering to clients and driving returns to the bottom line at the same time. And so, I think in terms of the long run, we feel quite good. But quarter-to-quarter you may see revenue move back and forth between us and our competitors, but it\u2019s not a big issue for us.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions.","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks, Christian.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Good morning.","Harvey Schwartz","Good morning, Matt.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","You had a pretty big increase in the SLR, I think about 50 basis points versus last quarter and just trying to reconcile what drove that. I think some of it was the assets you actually brought down last quarter that helped the ratio, obviously had positive net income. But was there also a nice benefit from the final SLR rules?","Harvey Schwartz","So there were a whole host of things that drove it. We definitely got benefit from the final rules, about 10 basis points. But then when you go through, there was the balance sheet reduction which was [indiscernible]. So as you know, we took the balance sheet down in the second quarter, but it\u2019s daily averaging in the SLR and so you really didn't see that benefit translate through until the third quarter. And then there is other reductions that sort of -- there is other reductions in terms of CDS in the portfolio in terms of that and then obviously there was a capital, we reduced our significant financial institutional deduction, all these things are contributors in terms of driving the increase in ratio.","I do think that the SLR is a good example of sort of our philosophy on how we approach regulatory reform. But as you know obviously there has been a significant improvement in that, 70 basis points over a fairly short period of time, and as you point out, 40 basis points in the quarter. We have found that by giving our people the tools, waiting till we see the final rule and then just really focused on complying with the rule, we can move the needle. So, this is just all about compliance.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","And where do you think you are on the optimization of that? Can you talk about obviously as you get compliance for Volcker, there will be a material benefit there. But what about just the other opportunities? You had a list of things with CDS and the other reductions. How much more, if any, is there of that?","Harvey Schwartz","It\u2019s funny. We don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think we're thinking about it \u2013 it's not like a baseball game here in terms of where we are in the innings of how do we comply. I think the takeaway here is that the SLR is not a significant issue. As we talked about a year ago, it\u2019s much more reflective about complying with the rules. But this will be a process that will be ongoing. You mentioned the Volcker compliance. As you come out of the fund, again, we\u2019re talking about something that's forward looking to 2018. And if we can make those adjustments, we'd be well in excess of 5% today. But let\u2019s see how it goes.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then just separately on getting compliance for Volcker, there's a lot of focus on that and what it might mean to your equity I&L revenues. But I guess as you think about replenishing the investments with Volcker compliant investments, how is that landscape? Because as I talk to investors, there is some concern that new investment opportunities may not be as good as they\u2019ve been in the past. But what do you think about the outlook for deploying capital in the Volcker compliant manners right now?","Harvey Schwartz","So, as we talked about before, there is a number of ways that we can use our capital. And as it comes out of the funds, capital is fungible. And so we will have the ability to continue to invest in Volcker compliant funds, use our balance sheet, other Volcker compliant structures. And so we feel like we have enough flexibility in terms of redeploying that capital. And of course I think this is the critical point. If the opportunities aren't there, obviously we can look to redeploy it into other areas of the firm that demand the capital or we can look to return it to the shareholders. So from that perspective.","So for us it's all about the process and the environment. As we discuss the environment as being a good one for harvesting, we have been able to put capital to work in certain parts of the world and our global footprint certainly gives us an advantage in terms of seeing opportunities. But it's always been -- investing and lending has always been a very long-term long cycle initiative and we will be very disciplined about the returns. If the opportunities are there and they make sense, we will deploy the capital. If not, we will be disciplined and we will wait.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And we will probably get it in the 10-Q, but you have the level of direct investments now and maybe how that compares to a year or two ago just to show how quickly that's been ramping? ","Harvey Schwartz","I don't have the year or two ago numbers. Dane can follow up with you offline. But it's been obviously a bit of a high class problem as we've been harvesting, values have been increasing. We can come back to you and get to the numbers. The I&L balance sheet at the end of the second quarter was roughly 71 billion.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","","Okay, all right. Thank you very much.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Hey, thanks. That was my questions. I'm good.","Harvey Schwartz","Hey Betsy, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Good morning, Harvey.","Harvey Schwartz","Good morning, Guy.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Securities services had some pretty attractive quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year revenue growth. I was wondering if you can just help us understand the dynamic there, especially in the context of what you had done last quarter in terms of bringing down some of the securities funding transactions, second part, of that stuff.","Harvey Schwartz","I think what you are seeing there may be the allocation of the gain that I referenced as it related to the retirement of the trust preferred securities.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Oh, got it. It's there.","Harvey Schwartz","Yes. So as you know, we don't have a corporate cost center. So just a philosophy and a discipline, we allocate out all cost to all the businesses. In this particular case, there was a gain related to funding. So the Institutional Client Services business, the fixed income equity, they are the biggest consumers of balance sheet and liquidity, so they also get the benefit of the gains. And so that's actually really -- I think when you look at it, you will see that that's probably it. We detail it out in the earnings release.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","So that aside then maybe you can give us a sense for what is the impact on that business of some of the changes that you made with respect to bringing down the balance sheet in the second quarter?","Harvey Schwartz","So that's a good question. So in terms of how we looked at it, it was really, as I said, I would describe it as a two-part process. One is pretty simple and is mathematical. One of the easiest things to do in terms of response to leverage task is actually just to rank the balance sheet in the businesses from lower ROA to higher ROA.","The second part of the exercise is a really high touch exercise where it's engagement in the trenches going through and working with clients and really finding out where we are providing value and where it may need our balance sheet and that's the nuance of the part of the exercise that we went through [indiscernible] and then we will continue to go through. But so far the client engagement [indiscernible] is one of our strongest franchise businesses, so it feels quite good.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Thanks for that. The other question that I had and it goes really back to some of the liquidity points that were being asked about earlier. People have been worried about the impact of the street reducing the liquidity it provides to investors for a while. We heard a lot more about it in the last two weeks of the third quarter. At the same time we know that in the third quarter the [indiscernible] had to begin to make daily reports to regulators based I guess on Volcker and some of the liquidity regs at a pretty deep level of granularity and I was wondering if you felt that this has had any impact broadly on the attractiveness of providing liquidity.","Harvey Schwartz","I would say no. It's certainly not a Goldman Sachs and I would imagine not the case across the market, although I don\u2019t have any visibility into our competitors. You are right when you say that the data requirements in the first submission that went in right around Labor Day, it's a pretty significant amount of data. I actually think that speaks to the opposite reaction function and I will tell you why. You can't create that data overnight. We had to invest quite a bit of talent mind share, technology, operations front office time and federation time in building the systems. And so that's been a process that's been underway I would assume for all of our competitors and certainly for us since the rule came out. So it wouldn't be as though you'd show up reporting and somehow you would change your profile. I don\u2019t know, that seems like a stretch to me.","I think again it's much more -- it's the collection of the rule sets. We did see increased sales in treasuries, we've seen stress -- and I'm talking about a normal market functioning times, not in stress market functioning times -- definitely where balance sheet has felt scarce. And I think under periods where clients want more liquidity, it may be more difficult to find. But we\u2019ll see how this all shapes out. Again, the impact of the collective rule sets of all the rules, balance sheet, whatever, risk-weighted assets liquidity, it\u2019s pretty enormous and I don\u2019t think we can only have positive effects from that over the next three, four, five, 10 years. I wish that was the case.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","And when you add all of that up and going back also to the pricing of securities services and other securities financing transactions, are you in real time seeing that the scarcity value of balance sheet is driving re-pricing that will be favorable to you presumably?","Harvey Schwartz","Well, I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ve never been firm that's first and foremost competed on price. We like to compete on content and we like to compete on the ability to provide liquidity, which may mean being the best price at any point in time for our clients. But our clients understand, they\u2019re very knowledgeable and are increasingly knowledgeable about the regulatory constraints that are on us and really the entire industry where we all have the same rule set. And so as the market responds, I just think everyone needs to be more disciplined and some of that will depend on where your return hurdles are. If our return hurdles are higher than someone else's, then we may be more disciplined than the next market participant I have to say.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Thanks, Harvey. That\u2019s really helpful color. I appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Good morning.","Harvey Schwartz","Good morning.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Just maybe a couple of questions on the regulatory side that I missed it. Did you disclose your LCR or are you over 100% at this point?","Harvey Schwartz","We didn\u2019t disclose the number. We\u2019re still digesting all the data as you know. But yes, we\u2019re in excess of the minimum requirement.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Okay.","Harvey Schwartz","And we would expect given all the focus we've put on liquidity here.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Right. No, that\u2019s fair. And then just maybe a follow-up question on just sort of the Tarullo commentary and the impact and you just talked about how ROE becomes high ROE hurdles. If you think about his focus about wholesale funding potentially a charge on top of the current SIFI charge, he seems to be specifically focused on repo and even the match book. How do you -- do you think is it just too early to start worrying about it because you mentioned you\u2019re not -- you think your balance sheet is fine or do you think is it something that\u2019s going to be an increasingly something you have to focus on and may continue to shrink that market or change the way you do it, just some color there. Thanks.","Harvey Schwartz","So I think it\u2019s definitely -- and we haven\u2019t even seen a proposed rule and as you know our philosophy around these things is we\u2019ve seen and we will continue to assume that regulators will give the marketplace basically a good glide path to adjust to rule changes. And so we would never react or change the business methodology to commentary. We wait to see the rule. We\u2019d engage in an active dialog on creating a constructive rule.","Clearly we\u2019ll be focused on the impact on markets. It would be very interesting to see where this discussion heads. As you know, and I don\u2019t want to address too much, but as you know the SIFI surcharges are really at their core designed around macro prudential regulation, not micro prudential regulation. And so when you look at our proportion of wholesale funding as a percentage of the marketplace, you can argue we're a lot smaller than many of our large universal bank peers. So we'll really see how the rule plays up. But we\u2019ll engage in an active dialog with the regulators just to ensure that we get the most thoughtful rule in investing for the marketplace and our clients.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Okay, fair enough. And maybe just one other quickly on the asset management business. You\u2019ve done a good job in turning around and generating positive flows in fixed income and equities. Is the lack of positive flows in alternatives simply your realizations? And if so, if that\u2019s the case, when do you see -- I assume that\u2019s a higher margin area -- when do you see that kind of inflection point where you start to see net flows turn positive?","Harvey Schwartz","Sorry. Could you say that again?","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Well I\u2019m just trying to think of your alternative AUM.","Harvey Schwartz","Okay.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Your net flows have been zero, but I assume that's because you have outflows from -- ","Harvey Schwartz","Yes, we can break it down for you after the call and Dane can give it to you. But basically what you\u2019re seeing there is the harvesting that you\u2019ve seen in the private equity, but you\u2019ve actually seen growth away from that in the other alternative asset categories. But we can break it down for you.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Okay, that\u2019s great. Thanks.","Harvey Schwartz","The growth has been pretty good.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Hey, good morning, Harvey.","Harvey Schwartz","Hi, how are you?","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Good. Quick question following up on one of Jim\u2019s questions there. So your LCR in excess of the minimum, is that the fully phased in minimum or the first minimum threshold of 80%?","Harvey Schwartz","No, sorry, that\u2019s fully phased in.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Okay. Thanks. And then just a question here on the market and sort of your comments to open up the call. Clearly this has been sort of a tough year for hedge funds and October hasn\u2019t been good either. Just thinking about your business and the leverage to financial players, do you think that we could end the year with a real serious withdrawal risk from some of these, some of big portion of your client base? And did that at all impact your decision to adjust the comp ratio here in the third quarter?","Harvey Schwartz","No, that's not how we do that. I think the composition was really driven by the improvement in top line revenues and the operating leverage we gained by managing our expenses. I think volatility comes in different flavors. A couple of months ago people were saying volatility will never return to the marketplace. And as I said now people feel like we have too much volatility. And so I think there is healthy periods of volatility and less healthy periods and really what we\u2019ve seen in the last 48 hours is concentrated position, liquidation obviously triggered by stop loss selling in multiple markets. And at times as we\u2019ve always seen, selling can beget selling.","Our hedge funds, asset managers and institutional clients are an important part of our focus at Goldman Sachs. But we\u2019ll just stay close to our clients during this period. We don\u2019t think about it in terms of days or weeks, in terms of the performance of our clients. It\u2019s really just a commitment to the long run.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","That\u2019s fair. Thanks for that. And then I guess last one for me and it seems like we chat about this every quarter so I wouldn\u2019t want to disappoint you. But I kind of hear you in the equities business that you don\u2019t want to get worked up over quarterly volatility. But it seems as though the equities business on a revenue basis has been losing share for a period in excess of a year. And while it\u2019s certainly encouraging that engagement with clients remains solid, when do you think that that translates into revenue? And I guess when do you become concerned that the engagement is there ultimately to lead the revenue? So, when do you become concerned about that not translating, I guess?","Harvey Schwartz","So, look, it\u2019s an important question. And as I said before, we run the business for a focus on our clients and then ultimately margins and returns. In any given quarter quarter-to-quarter you can see noise. In this quarter \u2013 again I don't have visibility into our competitors -- in this quarter we certainly, as I mentioned in the [earnings release] (ph) we had a more challenging part of a cash business and equities client institution, so a bit more challenging for us in blocks. Again, I don\u2019t have visibility. But I think if you step back and you look at Goldman Sachs, I think actually you\u2019re seeing it translate into returns. So, when you eliminate for the quarter an 11.2% ROE for the year-to-date, I think we\u2019re doing whatever we can actually to drive to the bottom line. So I think, I actually think you are seeing it.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Okay. Thanks, Harvey.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Steven Chubak - Nomura","Hey, Harvey. Good morning. ","Harvey Schwartz","Hey. Good morning, Steven.","Steven Chubak - Nomura","So my first question pertains to the topic of operational risk. And digging into some of the Pillar 3 disclosures for you and your peers and if you\u2019re thinking of actually running at a much lower level as a percentage of RWA at roughly 15% I believe, at least as of Q2, which compares to the remaining universals or at least U.S. domiciled universals running closer to 25 to 30, I don\u2019t know if you can clarify because that calculation is really determined based on the industry rather than company specific event risk, what\u2019s driving that delta?","Harvey Schwartz","So, you\u2019re right to say we have less. But I think it really correlates more to the fact that we\u2019re just a less complex financial institution than many of our peers. We don\u2019t have the payment systems, we don\u2019t have the consumer banking side of the business, we don\u2019t have that like a lot of our universal peers have. And also as you know this was also driven by loss experience. And when you look at our loss experience over the last several years, it\u2019s been significantly lower than many of our peers. I think that it\u2019s a pretty straightforward answer.","Steven Chubak - Nomura","Okay, fair enough. And then just switching gears over to I&L. We\u2019ve been having more conversations with investors which suggest continued reluctance to ascribe as much value to the contributions simply given a lack of earnings visibility tied to the portfolio again, which at least from my point of view I'd argue it dilutes the contribution from some sustainable fee streams you have there because of lending tied to the private banks. I didn't know given the lack of credit that some have been willing to ascribe to merchant banking and the portfolio gains whether you'd consider updating or amendments to your segment disclosure, at least within I&L, to at the very least disaggregated the merchant banking portion from higher multiple and sustainable revenue streams tied to lending activities.","Harvey Schwartz","So, maybe I think let's step back for a second. So in terms of how we think about the Investing & Lending businesses, if you look back over the history of time -- and again we approach this over the long term -- it\u2019s been a significant builder of book value and certainly a valuable contribution the way that we've partnered with clients over many many years and we do think we have some competitive advantages in that business in terms of our global footprint and ability to source transactions. And so I think its economic value in terms of its contribution as the margin you can see and it speaks for itself.","I think it\u2019s pro-cyclical. So there is always a discussion about its value in different times of a cycle. But we run it as a pro-cyclical business. And so, I think the question of financial statement presentation I\u2019m happy to take offline with you and Dane. As you know we went through a very thorough review as part of our business standards committee process to actually design our financial statements in a way that actually provide an increased clarity around the various business lines. But we\u2019re always looking to improve that clarity.","And so \u2013 look, I think we\u2019re better for having this financial disclosure. At the time we got very positive feedback for it. I don\u2019t want to close and be [quippy] (ph) with you, but yeah, do I think generally speaking the marketplace is undervalued than Goldman Sachs' business, yes. But I don't if it's necessarily the result of the financial statements, but we are happy to look at it.","Harvey Schwartz","All right, fair enough. No, I appreciate the color, Harvey, and thank you for taking my questions.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Good morning, Matt. Good morning, Harvey. Thanks for taking my question. You mentioned you certainly had some nice improvement in the SLR ratio quarter-over-quarter. Have you said or disclosed what buffer you might have ultimately above the 5% target that everybody is focused on? We have several conversations with investors trying to guess that or estimate that for various companies.","Harvey Schwartz","Yeah. No, we haven't focused on a buffer yet. Remember that the balance sheet is very dynamic. And so as we comply with the rule and you can see we are making significant progress, but we haven't determined any buffer and obviously we have a couple of years. Again, I will underscore that as we take our investments out of funds, if you were actually to translate those same assets onto the balance sheet, that gets us to a 5.2, 5.3 level anyway. So there is almost a natural tailwind that creates that. But we will constantly reassess and define all these buffers as we get all the final rules.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, that's helpful. And you mentioned the backlog being so strong and as a combination of a number of different businesses and I am going to ask -- when you talk to the folks particularly in the fixed income side of banking, if the rates actually do go up at some point, how are they thinking about potential future global debt issuance in a period of rising rates given that there has been so much issuance over the past few years at declining rate? I realize it's hard to figure out given the nature of the business tends to focus in many ways and sort of drive by issuance, but how are they thinking about the potential for that type of volume over the next couple of years? ","Harvey Schwartz","Look, my crystal ball on these kind of things has never been particularly good. So remember it was a year plus ago we were getting asked questions when we first hit a new record in debt underwriting a year plus ago about the end of the debt underwriting cycle. And so, and again in the second quarter we had another record this year. So very difficult to predict. I think a lot of it depends on the environment associated around the rate increases. I think if it's again a return to normalized rates around the globe where we don't have so much incredible essential bank intervention and that's associated with global growth, I think you could see growth in many economies around the world, I think you will see an increase in capital markets activity because you will see companies want to issue debt as they grow, as they move away from being financed by local banks. So I think it will be environment centric. If you saw -- part of what we've seen is you see large M&A transactions and the M&A environment is quite active, you see a lot of related debt issuance. So I definitely think there is something of a reaction function over short periods of times to rate levels, I think a lot of it will be correlated with global growth.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Thanks very much. And then just a follow-up for me. The 9 billion of the remainder of investments, Volcker related investments you need to move out of overtime, it sounds like that number really hasn't changed much since the second quarter. Is that what we should understand from your earlier comments?","Harvey Schwartz","Yes, that's right. It's actually right around 8 billion now.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.","Devin Ryan - JMP Securities","Most of my questions have been asked. But maybe just a question on acquisitions and now that we are getting a little bit better picture on the capital and regulatory framework. When you think about where you'd like to expand the business over the next several years, does the door open more to thinking about doing acquisitions or really is there anything that could become more interesting kind of growing inorganically as you guys think about the go forward?","Harvey Schwartz","Look, I think we are the leading merger and acquisition advisory firm in the world. It would be some inconsistent philosophically for us. I just think it would be inconsistent with our core being if we say we weren't willing to consider acquisitions. And so I think you should assume philosophically and culturally that as a management team we'd consider any acquisition if it was accretive in any area of our firm. I do think that as you point out, I do think that the ongoing nature of the regulatory environment probably just makes them more difficult for the industry generally. But we will see overtime. But we are always open minded. And having said all that, I think we've benefited as a firm over many years by keeping our culture intact and doing nothing major. But you've seen us do bolt-on acquisitions from time-to-time. So that's how I'd describe it philosophically.","Devin Ryan - JMP Securities","Okay, helpful. And then just I guess staying on the M&A theme, just as you mentioned being the leader. When you look at the backlog, are you seeing further divergence around trends within the U.S. and Europe and particularly given I guess maybe the divergence is in the economies right now? Or does this feel like the European M&A backlog and what you are guys are seeing over there in terms of the outlook is pulling off the bottom? I know the U.S. has kind of led the charge there?","Harvey Schwartz","So in terms of \u2013 there's nothing really material to share with you in terms of the shape of the geographic backlog. As you know, merger transaction is the most significant decision a CEO, his or her management team and a board makes in a life cycle of a company. And so these decisions tend to come into place over many, many years in terms of how they\u2019re executed. At the margin, obviously markets can drive thinking. Sentiment has been a big factor a couple of years ago in preventing transactions from happening. And then when sentiments shifted, you've obviously seen a huge uptick in activity. But there is nothing I would comment on with respect to global activity. Certainly growth, if we see big disparity in growth around the globe, that may be an influencer, but there's nothing to share with you today.","Devin Ryan - JMP Securities","Okay. All right, thank you. ","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.","Harvey Schwartz","Hi, good morning.","Operator","Marty, your line is open. Please check to see if it's on mute.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks","Well, there we go. Good morning.","Harvey Schwartz","Good morning.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks","I want to make sure that as we looked at the comp ratio, when we typically get these adjustments as we get towards the end of the year which you\u2019re saying reflect operational improvements and efficiencies, is there any thought about permanently kind of incorporating this throughout the year so that it seems more sustainable and less kind of temporary and year-end adjustment?","Harvey Schwartz","Again, there is no change in philosophy on how we\u2019ll this. It\u2019s always going to be a quarter-to-quarter assessment. It\u2019s our best estimate for where we stand at that particular point in the year. And as I said, it reflects all the factors you\u2019ve heard us talk about.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks","And then you mentioned on the debt underwriting, the regulatory pressure on leverage lending and maybe some impact there. Does that feel a little bit more permanent as you move forward given the stance that we\u2019ve seen talked about openly by the regulators?","Harvey Schwartz","So the comment I made about leverage actually didn\u2019t have anything to do with that. That was actually just transaction specific quarter-to-quarter. As I mentioned, the backlog was up at the end of the third quarter across all categories.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks","Okay.","Harvey Schwartz","Specifically what you\u2019re talking about though, it would be interesting to see how that will evolve. I know market participants, regulators, certainly all those at Goldman Sachs are very focused on the compliance with that and that will be very interesting to see over the next couple of years what impact that has in terms of markets where those transactions get financed, at what leverage levels, and that will be evolving story, we\u2019ll keep eye on.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks","And then lastly, the $0.05 dividend increase, while still in that kind of 10% range. Your earnings have grown much higher than that over the last year, revenues were up much more than that, excess capital was abundant, your payout ratio is low and your dividend yield is still relatively low. So seems like you had come headroom to maybe potentially go up a little bit more than that. I just didn't know what what your thought was there.","Harvey Schwartz","So when we assess capital return, as you know our preferred mechanism for capital return is really from share repurchase. We think it allows us to be very dynamic in terms of responding to our clients' needs and market conditions. And so while the dividend has certainly come up meaningfully, I think you should still assume that Goldman Sachs will rely on share repurchase as its predominant tool.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks","Got you. And humor me for one more question. If we look at the market commentary you said with the pain and the volatility coupled with the kind of regulatory Volcker kind of compliance move and your VaR coming down, do you feel like as a market maker you're kind of hamstrung in ability to kind of help the market go through some of these transitions now given all the new regulations?","Harvey Schwartz","I just want to be clear with that. You may have misheard me or I may have misheard you. There was nothing that I saw about Volcker compliance that I think is at this stage preventing people from providing liquidity. Volcker has been pretty visible for a while now. ","The comment I was making is that it\u2019s very hard to assess the collective impact of leverage rules, increases in risk-weighted assets reductions in balance sheet globally in terms of the entire industry and what that means for market liquidity. And we\u2019ve certainly seen areas where people \u2013 I haven't looked at all the data, but most firms at this stage have actually shrunk their match books. I think I\u2019m pretty accurate in saying that. And so all market participants, regulators included, have been asking themselves the question of when we were seeing increases in sales and treasuries whether how much of that was driven by market makers' inability or lack of appetite or not being able to position balance sheet in terms of providing that liquidity at important times.","We'll have to see again how all this evolves. When you look at Goldman Sachs today given the level of our capital ratios, which I described earlier in the call, we certainly have the capacity to deliver for our clients when they need it. ","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks","Thanks.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.","Brian Kleinhanzl - KBW","Good morning.","Harvey Schwartz","Hi, Brian.","Brian Kleinhanzl - KBW","Just quick question, when you look at some of the regulations coming down the road here and also funding surcharge being one of them and the NSFR, both of those would benefit from a greater level of deposit funding on the balance sheet in effect. Are you thinking about growing deposits currently? And if you are, kind of are you thinking about organically or through acquisition or are you just not going to think about it at all?","Harvey Schwartz","So we obviously focus on -- I think in the context at the moment, this will be very interesting because, you mentioned NSFR so let's just use that as an example. I think as an example of a rule and a concept, I think again that falls into the bucket of a good concept because you want good asset liability management across the industry. We spend a huge amount of time on asset liability management the way that we look at secure funding and how we manage our balance sheet and we run a very conservative profile in terms of how we manage that.","With respect in this rule, it will be very interesting because we haven\u2019t even seen the Basel rule yet. I think the big question will be again, when you add this rule on to other rules if there are some long term impact on market liquidity so obviously clients and we will be very focused on that. As this goes to the rule-making process because you specifically make just a deposit, it will be very interesting when you get to the U.S. because as you know in the U.S. it\u2019s a different legal structure in terms of your ability to use deposit funding for certain businesses. And so not only do we need to wait to see the Basel rule, but then we\u2019ll need to see the U.S. rule and how they incorporate just a different legal structure that exists in the U.S. So we\u2019ll have to see how it goes.","Brian Kleinhanzl - KBW","Okay. And just a separate question on the ECM backlog. Is there any specific reason that\u2019s kind of driving strength there? I think you said last quarter Europe was strong in underwriting but this quarter has that changed?","Harvey Schwartz","No, it's just a normal part of the marketplace in terms of people coming to the markets and raising capital for a variety of needs. But there is no key driver.","Brian Kleinhanzl - KBW","Okay, great. Thanks.","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks.","Operator","And at this time there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.","Harvey Schwartz","So again, since there are no more questions, I would like to take a moment to thank all of you for joining the call. Hopefully I and other members of the senior management will get to see you many of you in the coming months. Certainly if there is any additional questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to Dane. And otherwise, enjoy the rest of your day. Look forward to speaking with you on the fourth quarter call. Take care.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call.

This call is being recorded today, January 20, 2016.","Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.","Dane Holmes","Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the Firm's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain and outside of the Firm's control. The Firm's actual results and financial condition may differ possibly materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements.","For discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the Firm's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2014. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets, and supplementary leverage ratio. And you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that's posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com.","This audiocast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, will now review the firm's results. Harvey?","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through the fourth quarter and full year results and I'm happy to answer any questions. Before outlining our results, I would like to discuss the previously announced settlement for legacy mortgage activities. As you know we took a total net provision for litigation and regulatory matters in the fourth quarter of $1.95 billion. The RMBS Working Group matter, was the most significant outstanding piece of litigation facing the firm. As you would expect, following a settlement, there has been a significant decline in our recently possible loss number. We are currently estimating a more than 60% decline compared to third quarter levels of $5.3 billion.","Now turning to the fourth quarter, net revenues were $7.3 billion. Net earnings were $765 million and earnings per diluted share were $1.27. With respect to our annual results, we had Firm wide net revenues of $33.8 billion, net earnings of $6.1 billion, earnings per diluted share of $12.14 and a return on common equity of 7.4%. Revenues were down slightly compared with last year and expenses were significantly higher due to approximately $4 billion of net provisions for litigation and regulatory matters. Despite these headwinds, we grew book value per share by 5%.","The growth combined with our risk reduction efforts, strengthened all of our regulatory capital ratios. Excluding the litigation charges related to the RMBS Working Group, our 2015 return on common equity would've been 380 basis points higher.","2015 presented both challenges and opportunities. The challenges were more acutely felt in the back half of the year, as concerns about global growth intensified, which is reflected in public equity markets, with the MSCI rolled down, 5.7% over the last six months of the year. Credit markets also reflected these concerns, particularly within the non-investment grade space and most acutely within the commodity sector. For example, U.S. high yield spreads were 157 basis points wider in the second half of 2015. And at the end of 2015, the trailing 12 month default rate for U.S. non-investment grade bonds more than doubled year-over-year climbing to 4.3%.","These factors negatively impacted the broader opportunity set for our clients and as a consequence for the Firm. To varying degrees, the firm faced headwinds within certain of our FICC businesses, underwriting within investment banking and our investing and lending activities. However, these significant headwinds were largely offset by client activity in other businesses. Many of our clients decided to pursue M&A as the best means for creating shareholder value. And now M&A volumes for the industry increased by 47% in 2015. The Firm's volumes increased by 81%, a significant expansion of our market share.","Our global equities franchise also posted strong results for the year. Clients continue to place significant value on the integration of our various services; electronic, cash, derivatives and prime brokerage as well as our global footprint. Our performance in 2015 highlighted these strengths. In addition, the combination of continued strong performance for our clients and the diversified set of offerings drove a record year for our Investment Management business. We ended the year with record assets under supervision of $1.25 trillion and robust net inflows, which totaled $94 billion.","Ultimately, 2015 reinforced a long standing operating principle, that there is tremendous value to having a diversified set of global businesses. More importantly, it is the value of being a leader in these businesses that really counts.","Now let's discuss the individual businesses in greater detail. As it relates to the quarter, Investment Banking produced net revenues of $1.5 billion, slightly lower than the third quarter. A pickup in M&A was offset by a decline in underwriting activity. For the full year, Investment Banking net revenues were $7 billion, up 9% from 2014 on the back of a 40% increase in financial advisory revenues. This was partially offset by lower equity and debt underwriting revenues.","Our franchise remains very strong. 2015 was our second highest annual revenues for Investment Banking. We ended the year ranked 1st in global and announced and completed M&A. Our completed M&A volumes were approximately $350 billion higher than our next closest competitor. A record gap, since we've been a public company. We were also ranked 1st in global equity and equity related and common stock offerings for 2015.","Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the fourth quarter; advisory revenues were $879 million, a 9% improvement relative to the third quarter reflects an increase in a number of completed M&A transactions. We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the fourth quarter, including SunGard's $9.1 billion sale to Fidelity National Information Services. General Electric Capital Corporation's $9 billion sale of its Transportation Finance business to BMO Financial Group and HCC Insurance Holding's $7.5 billion sale to Tokio Marine Holdings.","We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the fourth quarter, including DuPont's combination with Dow Chemical in a $130 billion merger of equals, Newell Rubbermaid's $20 billion acquisition of Jarden Corporation and SanDisk's approximately $19 billion sale to Western Digital.","Moving to underwriting, net revenues were $616 million in the fourth quarter down 11% sequentially as debt issuance slowed. Equity underwriting revenues of $228 million were up 20% compared to the third quarter as IPOs increased from very low levels last quarter. Debt underwriting revenues decreased 21% to $440 million due to a decline in leveraged finance activity. During the fourth quarter, we actively supported our clients' financing needs, participating in Visa's $16 billion investment grade offering to support its purchase of Visa Europe, McDonald's $6 billion investment grade offering and Worldpay Group's $3.8 billion IPO. Our Investment Banking backlog improved from third quarter levels and finished at its second highest level.","Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our fixed and equities businesses; net revenues were $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter, down 10% compared to the third quarter. For the full year, $15.2 billion of net revenues were roughly consistent with 2014. FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter down 23% sequentially and included $54 million of DVA losses. Excluding DVA, revenues were down 10% quarter-over-quarter as many businesses were impacted by either lower client activity or more difficult market making conditions. Credit decreased significantly, as the market was characterized by widening high yields spread in the U.S. and low levels of liquidity.","Interest rate in currencies were lower sequentially as client activity declined. Mortgages continue to be challenged as spread widened and the prospect for higher rates and client activity remained generally low. Commodities was essentially unchanged as client activity was muted and energy prices remained under pressure. For the full year, FICC Client Execution net revenues were $7.3 billion down 13% year-over-year, where challenging market conditions and lower levels of client activity in our micro businesses, credit and mortgages, offset stronger client activity and a favorable backdrop for our macro businesses, particularly rates and currencies.","In equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and securities services, net revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.8 billion, flat sequentially and included $14 million in DVA losses. Equities client execution revenues were roughly consistent sequentially at $562 million. Commissions and fees were $763 million, down 7% relative to the third quarter as global client volumes declined. Securities services generated net revenues of $430 million up 13% sequentially.","For the full year, equities produced net revenues of $7.8 billion up 16% year-over-year. In 2015, we benefited from several factors, a better market backdrop and a more favorable environment from securities services. Turning to risk, average daily VaR in the fourth quarter was $71 million down from $74 million in the third quarter.","Moving on to our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $1 billion, primarily reflecting the company's specific events, including financings, sales and gains in public equity investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $299 million which was largely driven by net interest income. For the full year, Investing & Lending generated net revenues of $5.4 billion driven by $3.78 billion in gains from equity securities and $1.66 billion of net revenues from debt securities and loans.","In Investment Management, we reported fourth quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion. This was up 9% from the third quarter, primarily as a result of $190 million in incentive fees largely from alternative asset products. Management and other fees were up 2% sequentially to $1.24 billion. For the full year, Investment Management net revenues were a record $6.2 billion, up 3% from 2014, on record management and other fees and higher transaction revenues. During the fourth quarter, assets under supervision increased $64 billion to a record $1.25 trillion, primarily due to net inflows into liquidity products. On a full year basis, we had long term fixed income flows of $41 billion, equity inflows of $23 billion, and alternative inflows of $7 billion.","Moving to our performance, 73% of our client mutual fund assets ranked in the top two quartiles on a three year and a five year basis.","Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits, remained roughly flat at $12.7 billion for 2015 and translated into a compensation to net revenues ratio of 37.5%. Fourth quarter non-compensation expenses were $4.1 billion and incorporated $1.95 billion in litigation and regulatory expenses. The quarter also included a $123 million donation to Goldman Sachs Gives, our donor advised charitable fund.","For the full year, non-compensation expenses were up 30% due to $4 billion in provisions for litigation and regulatory matters. Excluding litigation provisions, non-compensation expenses would have been down 4% year-over-year.","Now I'd like to take you through a few key statistics for the end of the year. Total staff at year end was approximately 36,800, up 8% from year end 2014. This is a significant increase, so let's breakdown the drivers. Of the 2,800 of incremental staff, a little more than half was due to our continued investment in regulatory compliance and other federation initiatives, largely in technology and operations. The remainder was focused on business growth initiatives, particularly with Investment Management.","Our effective tax rate was 30.7% for 2015. Our global core liquid assets ended the year at $199 billion. While our balance sheet was roughly flat year-over-year, Level 3 assets declined by 33% to $24 billion. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.4% under the Basel III advanced approach. It was 13.6% using the standardized approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 5.9%. With respect to our method to G-SIB surcharge, we currently estimate that we are at or near the lower bucket, given a decline in Level 3 assets and derivative notionals over the course of the year.","And finally, we repurchased 8.9 million shares of common stock for $1.65 billion in the quarter. For the full year, we repurchased $4.2 billion. Year-over-year, our average fully diluted share count declined by approximately [15 million]. In addition, we increased our quarterly dividend to $0.65 per share in the second quarter and paid out approximately $1.2 billion of common dividends during the year. In total, we returned $5.4 billion of capital to shareholders in 2015.","Before taking questions, a few closing thoughts. Clearly, it has been a challenging environment for the entire industry. 2015 marks the fourth consecutive year that we have posted revenues of approximately $34 billion. Excluding litigation charges related to the RMBS Working Group, it is also the fourth consecutive year that we have produced strong relative results and returns that exceeded our cost of capital. We have been able to post consistent, strong relative results despite the difficult operating environment, which is a statement of the strength of our global client franchise, the caliber of our people and our culture of teamwork and adaptability.","Over the past four years, we've also grown book value per share by 7% per annum, returned nearly $25 billion in capital to our shareholders and reduced our basic share count by 75 million shares or 14%. And most importantly we've been able to accomplish these things while maintaining leading positions across all of our businesses, transforming our financial profile, prudently managing our risks, adapting to regulatory change, continuing to invest in our future and positioning the Firm to provide significant operating leverage when the environment improves.","There's no doubt that the second half of 2015 had its fair share of challenges, which significantly impacted market sentiment and client activity. It's quite natural for all of us to be influenced by recent events and we maintain a healthy respect to them. We certainly don\u2019t control the opportunities set, however we do control several things; how we build our client relationships, how we invest in our people, how we adapt to change, how we allocate our capital, manage our risks and control our costs, and finally, how we invest in the future. We believe our Firm's commitment to excellence in these areas has been and will continue to be what drives our performance over the long term.","Thank you again for dialing in and I'm happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen we will now take a moment to compile the Q&A roster. [Operator Instructions]","Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Glenn Schorr","I guess you're in a better position than most to ask this impossible question, but from your vantage point everything you see, are we on the cusp of a tougher credit cycle, balance sheet recession? Are we looking at the wrong things meaning, I'm about to ask you your energy exposure and I should be asking you your sovereign exposure to Italian sovereigns or Italian banks like, I'm just curious to your thoughts on where we are besides the market going down?","Harvey Schwartz","So, look obviously the first couple of weeks of the year have been difficult from a market perspective and the last half of the year and continuing the dramatic decline in commodity prices broadly has been disruptive for the market. I think if you talk to our folks, obviously that sector of prices remain where they are, it's going to be under stress, that's an inevitability. But it does feel at this stage where perhaps the market is discounting some of the benefits of the declining commodity prices, we'll have to see how the market evolves. Look, these things are never going to be a straight line and so it's not surprising to some extent that the markets responding to China, reduced activity volatility in markets this way. In terms of our exposures to that sector, they haven't moved material since early [cost] across the entire oil and gas sector, Glenn. Funded and unfunded we had just more to $10 billion of exposure but to really dial it in for you, funded exposure to non-investment grade entities in that sector was a $1.5 billion as we finished the quarter. So, from our perspective we feel well positioned and in this kind of market environment, its type of market environment where your clients really want you to stay close to them and that's what we're doing.","Glenn Schorr","A glass half full question of this increased volatility across some of the asset classes, using [indiscernible] clients of losing money, but is there any case to be made that [FICC] revenue pie can bottom and actually grow a little bit over the next say two years given the changing monetary landscape things like that monetary policy of landscape?","Harvey Schwartz","We don't generally run the businesses as you know as pretty well. We don't run the businesses for the bull case, but I think that, and there certainly is a bull case in terms of fixed income activity. The stable to improving global growth and we're seeing that in the U.S., and we're seeing that across Europe certainly could be a tailwind diverging monetary policy, could be a tailwind. Look, as we go through parts of the credit cycle it's very natural for spreads to widen after having a period of such strength in the contraction. But even right now you're seeing the market, which has been under stress, be thoughtfully selective about those transactions and there's been a lot of appetite for certain parts of the market. So I think as we look forward over the next couple of years, when you start adding in things like the competitive environments. For all the potential activity around hedging and other activities, I think you could construct a pretty impressive bull case for fixed income and again it's not the way we generally run the businesses, we'll react to that as we see it. But there's a -- there certainly is an upside case.","Glenn Schorr","Okay, I appreciate that. Last one it takes two seconds is, did you say that you're at or near the 250 bucket, was that your comment about the G-SIB at or near the lower bucket, is that what you meant by that?","Harvey Schwartz","Yes, that's correct. I mean that's our estimation. That's obviously not confirmed by the regulators, but that's where we believe we stood at the end of the year.","Glenn Schorr","Got it, okay. Thank you very much.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you, Glenn.","Operator","Your next question's from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Christian Bolu","Good morning, Harvey.","Harvey Schwartz","Morning.","Christian Bolu","So on Investment & Lending, could you remind us how much of the equity portfolio you need to divest before the 2017 Volcker deadline? And just given the current choppy markets, what's your level of confidence that the Firm can divest those assets by 2017? And also remind us what the process for getting an extension from the Fed is if you can't meet the 2017 deadline? Thank you.","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks, so roughly now we're under $5 billion of capital that is sitting in funds alongside our clients, which are obviously legacy funds. The exact number's roughly right around $4.7 billion. And with our expectation given these are legacy funds is that we'll continue to monetize those assets and we'll see how that progresses. There's a lot of runway between here and the compliance date in 2017. We haven't at this stage contemplated seeking any additional extensions and I don't believe the industry has at this stage.","Christian Bolu","Okay thanks. And then maybe just some thoughts on the incremental operating leverage in the model, I mean the Firm has been very disciplined in expenses despite effectively four years of no top line growth. Just curious, how much more you can pull the expense lever to drive margin expansion or do you need some revenue growth there going forward?","Harvey Schwartz","So obviously we've done a lot of work on expenses, we were very early to expense reduction initiatives. As you know we started several years ago and those have continued, for those businesses that have faced headwinds and we've been investing in those businesses that we feel we've had tailwinds. At that point, headcount's up 8% this year and compensation benefits were flat, so we've done a pretty good job at this stage. We'll continue to monitor it, but at this particular -- given all the work we've done we will always look to be more efficient, but I think we chopped a lot of wood here. Now we have really, we believe well positioned the Firm for an uptick in revenues and even though it feels like a long time ago now, you saw that in the first quarter of last year where on a modest up in revenues year-over-year we produced nearly a 15% ROE. So we feel very comfortable about the upside leverage.","Christian Bolu","Okay, thank you.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question's from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, please go ahead.","Michael Carrier","Thanks, for taking the question. Just on the G-SIB surcharge I think you mentioned you know part of that was exiting from Level 3 assets, I don\u2019t know if there's any granularity or clarity on what that was or what you got out of, but just curious on the any color around that?","Harvey Schwartz","So generally speaking, you remember during the course of the year that there was a change to the FASB accounting which was a driver in terms of the NAV and the look through the funds and the other driver obviously, to get back to Christian's question which is as we monetize things they become public equities. As you know the public equity has been hovering between $3.5 billion and $4 billion also and that's part of the monetization process and obviously once the public equity, you have complete transparency on pricing.","Michael Carrier","Okay, got it. And then just on the expenses, I think you guys you have mentioned, you have done a pretty good job of balancing the investing versus the environment, but just want to get your sense when you think about what you're focused on the regulatory, the IT side that you need to invest versus areas where if we are in weaker markets and activity starts to dry up, where can you pull back on the cost front? And so whether it's on the non-com side, although it seems like that's running pretty low ex the legal stuff, or on the comp side?","Harvey Schwartz","Yeah, so I think -- but from a compensation perspective, compensation is always going to be driven by performance, most importantly at the Firm wide level and then obviously bottoms up from individuals to businesses and through [indiscernible]. And so that's where I think you'll see as related to the specific performance. We will always continue to look to be efficient. At this stage, obviously we're making a very significant investment in regulatory compliance. We think it's critically important. We actually think it's a competitive advantage to be best in class and so you'll see us continually invest in tech and businesses and over the long-term, we think it's a contributor to our performance.","Michael Carrier","And last one, just on I&L, given that portfolio and just given maybe the market backdrop, if you can just remind us of what portion I guess mostly on the equity side, would be public that you're going to see more like mark-to-market versus the portion that might be on the private side that might be more driven by models or economic growth that's not going to swing around as much?","Harvey Schwartz","Yeah, so coming into the end of the year, the public portion or public equity portion of the I&L balance sheet was $4 billion of notional.","Michael Carrier","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Harvey Schwartz","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O'Connor","If you look at the size of the balance sheet, it came down by about $20 billion versus the end of the third quarter. Just thinking going forward how do you think the size of the balance sheet trends and then also with respect to SLR exposure?","Harvey Schwartz","Well, so obviously all of our capital ratios give us a great deal of flexibility to respond to client demand, so we feel like we're well positioned. Now, we talk about there's a lot in the past. We went through a pretty significant early shift in shrinking the balance sheet and that was really about a replacing effort. And so we're going to be very sensitive to marginal deployment of capital ensuring that it's accretive in the long run and so you're going to be as we pretty sensitive to balance sheet growth, but obviously given the strength of our capital ratios, we have a lot of capacity.","Matt O'Connor","And I guess following up on the SLR exposure specifically, you're obviously in excess of the 5% needed pre-CCAR, but for CCAR if you needed more, because do you have the ability to bring down some of the SLR exposure with only a modest impact to revenue?","Harvey Schwartz","So, it's interesting the way you ask the question. I think you're basically saying, listen can we re-price the balance sheet in an accretive way? If we could, we should, so we're doing that work today. I think if the world became more constrained then by definition re-pricing would be necessary. And so a lot of it'll be driven by constraints, but if we found ourselves constrained to any particular category, we will make a long-term decision about how we wanted to address that. Look for us as you know, CCAR stress has been a constraint and you saw us react to that a bit ago when we shrunk the balance sheet so dramatically.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. All right, thank you.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Betsy Graseck","Couple of questions, one on I&L again, in the past sometimes you've given us some color on how much has been either realized or mark-to-market and I get the $4 billion on equity component. Just wondering, if you can give us some color on how much of the split between second equity is on -- of realized base versus a marked base?","Harvey Schwartz","Yeah, so as you know Betsy we talk about in the context of event driven and non-event driven and that's what I talked about at the conference in the fourth quarter. So looking at I&L as I said during the quarter, net interest income was really the bulk a driver of the debt line and in terms of I&L relating to non-event driven most of the activity was really event driven or public marks. So things like refinancings, companies going public and then the subsequent public marks.","Betsy Graseck","Okay and then on a question regarding the stress test, a lot of people thinking out loud about what potential scenarios the Fed could throw at us and I'm just wondering on prior stress tests, are you given full credit for the hedges that you have on in the various asset classes that you're trading in?","Harvey Schwartz","We have no transparency in to that level of detail with respect to the Federal Reserve but they're pretty comprehensive in their analysis, so one would assume everyone gets credit for their hedges.","Betsy Graseck","Right. In your own analysis that you're running obviously, you give yourself credit for hedges?","Harvey Schwartz","Yes. In the stress scenario they would perform, so we give ourselves credit, I mean, yes.","Betsy Graseck","Right, of course. Just to make sure.","Harvey Schwartz","[indiscernible] company's scenario on our own submissions.","Betsy Graseck","Correct in both.","Harvey Schwartz","Yes, of course. Just like we'd model the Firm under any stress scenario.","Betsy Graseck","So, when we're thinking about the commodity business that you've got, maybe you can talk through a little bit on how your positioned for the trend that we've been seeing here year-to-date?","Harvey Schwartz","So, we've been very committed to the commodities franchise and obviously we have a very strong banking franchise and so this is a part of the cycle and I'd say, broadly across commodities where clients are going to be in need of advice, they are going to need capital market solutions, they're going to need potential hedging solutions depending on where they sit in the cost structure or scheme of things. And so I think a lot is expected when you marry those two strengths together with our research and analytic tools, I think we feel very well positioned to provide our clients with advice and value and solutions.","Betsy Graseck","Do you see yourself taking share in this environment?","Harvey Schwartz","In commodities -- well just talk commodities in a fixed income context, as I said in my prepared remarks, it's pretty obvious we took share in Investment Banking over the course of the year. I mean assuming you saw the big uptick in M&A, you saw a big outperformance by our team. In terms of the FICC activity, it's hard to see it when activity is low but certainly really not in comparison to commodities where activity has been high to us, we've picked up significant share but that's probably not surprising given how much people have pulled resources out of their commodity businesses or least they said, they have over the last couple of years globally.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. Thanks.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you, Betsy.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Mike Mayo","Hi. I guess, I'll go to energy and how big a deal is this oil price decline to you guys? I mean you've mentioned you only have $1.5 billion in funded non-investment great exposure but your total exposures are over $10 billion. Where could you up potentially otherwise get hurt from the decline in oil prices other than that funded non-investment grade exposure? And where could be industry otherwise get hurt or you might have to pay attention to some of the counterparties that you have?","Harvey Schwartz","So, from a counterparty exposure, our counterparty risk we feel good about right now, I think, I mentioned on an earlier call, if you take the example that the commodity trade houses, our exposure to those is less than $200 million as we sit here today. And I talk about the $10.6 billion that I brought out earlier, $6.4 billion of that -- again this is funded and unfunded, this is not funded, $6.4 billion out of the investment grade, so the maximum potential exposure we can get in non-investment grade companies would be $4.2 billion and that's absolute exposure that does not -- that's not recoveries or anything like that Mike. So, in terms of our capital position, I think we are relatively well positioned. I haven't gone through all the peer banks like you have but look for us, while we're very focused about and we're certainly not being complacent about it, we feel pretty front footed even on a relative basis, we have smaller exposures.","Mike Mayo","What sort of reserves --","Harvey Schwartz","I think Mike for us, if this translates into somehow, which we don't see today but you never discount any possibility, if this somehow translates into a real drag on a long-term economic activity or economic growth, but as I said before when I was asked the question and it's just an opinion, lots of folks have been on this side of this discussion. When we talked to our people internally, it feels like the degree to which the market is focused on energy exposures has managed to discount the long term tailwind to the consumer and a reduction in cost across the globe. But that\u2019s how the markets we act into are now. So there maybe information content in that too.","Mike Mayo","So what sort of reserves do you have against that $10 billion exposure? I guess some of its mark to market but some of it's not.","Harvey Schwartz","So of the $10 billion obviously we\u2019re being thoughtful about our exposure. I can tell you for example the non-investment grade side, those reserves were in high single-digit percentages for that part of the portfolio.","Mike Mayo","So lastly just are you able to hedge some of that exposure, are you helping your clients to hedge? Are you getting additional business activity to do this, and if you could just elaborate on the benefit to consumers because certainly people aren\u2019t paying much attention to that if that\u2019s there?","Harvey Schwartz","I can\u2019t quantify the benefit of consumers to you, but obviously over time, that translates into more purchasing power because obviously it's a good thing that people are paying less in the punt, the obvious offset to that and maybe more acute in the U.S. is obviously there is a lot of pain in this sector and that will lead to increased unemployment specifically in this sector and it has infrastructure spend impact. In terms of hedging, we can hedge on a case by case basis, it really depends specifically on the underlying and where we can and we think we should. Obviously, we do. As it relates to client activity, one of the things about this move because it came down so quickly, is it really did not give a lot of our clients the opportunity to hedge to the downside. Obviously, in these low price levels across commodities you would expect to see a pick up in the consumer side of hedging activity and we expect to start seeing that. But these moves have been pretty dramatic and usually what happens when they are this sudden is there is a bit of stepping back. But certainly we\u2019re well positioned to provide hedges across the broad commodity space.","Mike Mayo","Thank you.","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Guy Moszkowski","So I wanted to broaden out the market share of activity question that came up before with respect to commodities. More broadly, with respect to FICC globally we\u2019ve seen so much retrenchment including a big domestic player recently. So, any signs yet that the retrenchment of competitors in the area is helping market share or helping pricing? And to what extent is what you\u2019re seeing there or the expectation of what you\u2019ll see there really driving some of that investing in the business that you\u2019re talking about?","Harvey Schwartz","Well, we certainly have seen it across parts of the businesses, it\u2019s been somewhat episodic. We talked it before we\u2019ve seen it in securities services and prime brokerage, a bit of a retrenchment. I think that was more regulatory driven as people began to focus on balance sheet and capital related to that business. We\u2019ve seen it in parts of equity derivatives during the course of really now last year, year and a half. And then in fixed income, one of the things that shouldn\u2019t get lost about the fixed income discussion in 2015 for our Firm is that, while it was a difficult market for the micro products for credit and mortgages, it was actually an improved year for interest rates for currencies. And while commodity wasn\u2019t improving, came up very strong year prior, I think that we\u2019re seeing it when activity picks up. Now, in terms of the announcements and the retrenchment from competitors, one of these things is it's not surprising that you need to have a couple of or several tough years and that announcements will generally lag. And so, I think we may see this over the next couple of years now that we\u2019ve been in this period of a tough couple of years in FICC and where the vast majority of the industry has had multiple years of performing below their cost of capital. So all these things -- all these constraints are now really starting to come into the fray, particularly as we get into the 2018, 2019 compliance periods. Sorry, that was a long answer but it was a big question, but it was a long answer.","Guy Moszkowski","No, it\u2019s a helpful answer. So I mean it sounds like you\u2019ve lost none of your confidence in the opportunity there, it just takes a while?","Harvey Schwartz","Well, in terms of the competitive set, I think that\u2019s our read today. Look, in terms of monitoring the businesses, we\u2019re always monitoring the businesses. I think one of the things that, one of the things that we haven't talked a lot about, we haven't talked directly about is our philosophy and how we manage cyclical businesses. Everyone has to acknowledge that financial services is a cyclical industry and one of the things that we've been very thoughtful about is not over investing at the top of the market. So, you didn't see us do that in 2009 when FICC had a record year and making sure that we don't overshoot in the bottom part of the cycle. Now we were early to the cost cutting because we felt the activity levels declining after 2009 and that's how we managed through the cycle and you've seen us do this in the equity businesses and sometimes these cycles are long. We cut 1,000's of people in our equity franchise in the early 2000s but right now given all the work we've done on the cost side, we don\u2019t feel like we need to catch up. So, but we'll see how the year goes, if the trends in fixing can continue, we will continue to manage the business as efficiently as possible.","Guy Moszkowski","And then just a follow-up question, since no one's asked it, I'll ask, I know we're only a few weeks into the year and the market backdrop has been, God awful, but how would you characterize activity levels since the beginning of 2016?","Harvey Schwartz","It's only two weeks, so we're -- I'm not going to really extrapolate it. We generally don't root for the S&P 500 to be down 8% in the first two weeks of the year though.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Jim Mitchell","Maybe we should talk a little bit about M&A with the volatility that we've seen in the market I think some have been concerned I guess about the impact on M&A I guess both in the near term and what it means to for the cycle? Just maybe your just your broad thoughts on where we are in that cycle and what you're seeing in the conversation levels today?","Harvey Schwartz","So, again obviously we had a pretty significant pickup in activity over the last year and Goldman Sachs market share grew dramatically with that. I think you have to take a step back and you have to ask yourself what are the factors that drove the M&A environmental [chord] over the past 18 months and are they still in place? And those core factors, is really limited organic growth, companies were struggling to find top line growth. You had positive but modest economic growth in major economies and companies had done quite a bit of work both on cost and refinancing going into that cycle and there was high level CEO and Board confidence. Those were the factors that drove the big pickup in activity. As we sit here today after couple of weeks of volatile markets, we wouldn't say that those factors are significantly diminished. We saw a very volatile August and yet in the fourth quarter, M&A activity continued and we finished our backlog higher than last year. And so, I think that we'll have to see obviously if markets stand the stress and you get into questions about finance-ability and other headwinds and then if we saw a loss of confidence, but we wouldn't say that two weeks of volatile markets would stop a pretty powerful M&A trend. We will see how these markets keep going.","Jim Mitchell","And maybe just a follow-up on asset management. You had $48 billion of flows in liquidity products in the fourth quarter, what -- that seems pretty high. Can you -- what were the drivers there, is it, it's for the seasonal thing or are you seeing some market share gains there and as profitability improves with higher rates, do you see that as an opportunity?","Harvey Schwartz","When you look across multiple quarters in asset management for us and you look at the flows and you look at the investment of the competitors I think you'd say we're gaining share. Obviously it's been a strategic focus for us to grow that business. In that quarter in particular I think it was a combination of volatile market and increasing rates, which brought money and obviously we're a leader in the money market business and so it was a catalyst for inflows.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.","Brennan Hawken","Just a quick question on energy follow-up here I think you said $10 billion of total exposure, roughly two thirds in investment grade, is it right for us then to apply that sort of two-to-one investment grade, bull investment grade to your funded book as well and sort of back into about $3 billion funded IG exposure?","Harvey Schwartz","Yes, so why don't I just give you the -- I'll just give you the numbers so you will have all the detail. So $10.6 billion is what I would call total potential exposure. Funded is $1.8 billion, unfunded $8.8 billion. And of the funded non investment grade's $1.5 billion, and you could get an incremental $2.7 billion funded on that side. But that's the total exposure.","Brennan Hawken","Terrific.","Harvey Schwartz","And you can fill in the rest of the grid on the investment grade stuff.","Brennan Hawken","Yes, we can back in into the rest, thanks very much.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question's from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura, please go ahead.","Steven Chubak","So Basel published the updated guidance for the market risk calculations last week, I recognized the document and some of the calculations are pretty, the document says calculations are involved, I didn't know if you've done any preliminary analysis on the impact this might have on your pro forma market risk assets?","Harvey Schwartz","Yes, you're talking about the fundamental view of the trading book that came out last week. So as you said it is a pretty big document, I think it was over 90 pages. We had the team going through it, I don\u2019t have any specific quantification for you. I think it'd be too early for me to put that out there and we still haven't even seen an NPR from the Federal Reserve. So we'll to see how this evolves. I would say the high level read is that from the early documents and the early discussion it seems like the regulators in the industry may continue to progress in terms of trying to find the right balance. But at this stage for us I don't see it being a significant impact but we'll give you more detail.","Steven Chubak","All right, I suppose over the last few quarters it does look like the market risk assets have been steadily declining. I didn't know if that reduction was in anticipation of what might be tougher rules or are there other factors that are really driving that decline?","Harvey Schwartz","No definitely certainly not in anticipation of this, I mean just to be clear, we'll approach this rule like we've approached all the other rules. We don't want to try to adjust our business potentially have a negative impact to your clients. The one good thing, regulators have been very thoughtful about the runway to rule adoption. And this is something that we have till 2019. So the industry is going to have time to make adjustments and I think that's in everyone's best interest because it actually will be less disruptive to market, the incentive of this rule is significant and we've seen that in all the rules and so you'll see us approach this rule the way we approached all the other rules. But we haven't even seen as I said a Fed NPR so we'll see how that goes. But any reduction in market risk assets is really a [complexion] of client activity.","Steven Chubak","Got it, okay, and just one quick follow up, I did see that the advance Core Tier 1 did in fact decline quarter-on-quarter. I assume it's a function of the increase in operational risk tied to the settlement but didn't know if it was attributable to something else?","Harvey Schwartz","No that's correct. So the settlement added $21 billion to operational risk assets and it had a corresponding decline in the ratio of roughly 40 basis points.","Steven Chubak","Great, I appreciate you taking my questions.","Operator","Your next question's from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities, please go ahead.","Matt Burnell","Good morning, Harvey. Just a couple of questions, I guess starting on M&A. We've heard across both you and to a lesser extent some of your competitors about the potential for market share gains as some non-U.S. participants back away. But I think that's mostly focused, that those comments are mostly focused on the trading side of things. Given your market share gains in M&A this year, do you get the sense that that's also true with Investment Banking in specifically M&A transactions?","Harvey Schwartz","No, I haven't had a chance to dig through all the lead tables and I may not have this perfectly accurate but the last time I spoke to our team about this, I think it was really that there's a segment of banks which lost share to some of the boutiques and there's firms like ourselves which obviously gained market share broadly across the board, and we took share from everyone else.","Matt Burnell","Okay and then just on FICC and trading, you've given us some helpful commentary and I realize it's early days in the year in the quarter, but I guess I'm curious, so what the level of rate positioning within your client base has been, did that change dramatically late in the fourth quarter with the Fed's action and has it changed much so far this year?","Harvey Schwartz","Not a significant factor, really nothing to comment on that. Obviously, the Fed reserve data, very good job of communicating to the marketplace the first rate increase in December and I think to a great extent that it being a non-event, which is a good thing. And so early in the quarter it was influencing client activity, but by the time the event occurred, obviously it wasn\u2019t significant.","Matt Burnell","And just finally for me, I don\u2019t think you've given these. Can you provide us the fully phased in capital ratios at the end of the year?","Harvey Schwartz","Sure, so under the advanced, we were 11.7 and under standardized 12.9. I remember that on a apples-to-apples basis, that's a little bit conservative just given away some of the items actually transitioned to fully phased in, but that's where we stood at.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Eric Wasserstrom","I've obviously heard everything that you have said this morning and I recognize of course that you don\u2019t run the business to any particular metric ratio, but to the extent that revenue conditions sort of stay as they've been over the past few years and call it around that $34 billion level. Is there a path to generate incremental positive operating leverage for you?","Harvey Schwartz","So it's an interesting question. I'm going to modify it a little bit because of the way I heard it, maybe I'm not modifying because it is the way I heard it. I think you're saying if I knew over the next couple of years, like let's just say we had a crystal ball and with certainty I knew that the Firm is going to [gross] $34 billion over the next couple of years. Now, I guess what you're saying is the thing that we've elected to invest in, we shouldn\u2019t be investing in and so I think we wouldn\u2019t invest for growth because you're telling me it wouldn\u2019t be there, but that's not our expectation. We see growth in parts of our businesses and so where we see growth and where we think we can take share, we're going to invest. And again, we run the Firm for multiple years and so -- but that's the way I would think about answering the question, but we see opportunities.","Eric Wasserstrom","And what conditions would arise or what would be the signals to you that in fact it is appropriate to retrench on some of the growth opportunities?","Harvey Schwartz","Well, we always evaluate -- and at the end of the day, it's really about the dialog with the client. The dialog with the client, so let's take M&A, we just talked about the things are interesting because now the current concern is that M&A may slow down. Five years ago, you'll remember the dialog was M&A is never coming back. And last year, we had dominant market share and tremendous activity levels across the industry. In 2009, our client dialog told us there were factors that were influencing decisions that were delaying decisions, but it certainly didn\u2019t tell us that no one would ever do mergers again. And so when we see, when we listen to the client and we know for example that our clients in fixed income still value the services, they just need to do more volumes, that's how we'll inform our strategy over the long run. But obviously we're not being complacent, you've seen all the things we've done. We've returned significant capital, we've cut costs and we're early to all those things, we have reduced risk, improved our ratio, so we're certainly not sitting still here. Revenues might be $34 billion for a couple of years because a lots going on.","Eric Wasserstrom","And so at times as if then the indication is at this stage there's no change in client dialog or demands or expectations.","Harvey Schwartz","No. Certainly not. After the first couple of weeks of the year, no.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.","Marty Mosby","Building on what you were just talking about, what are the things as the pipeline keeps building quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year that the customers are saying are delaying, so what factors do you need to see some of that pent up demand begin to get released and accelerate some of the activities you have seen even at the levels last year?","Harvey Schwartz","So I think look again at its core, we're correlated to long-term economic growth and what we're really seeing in the markets in the second half of the year was really general concerns about economic growth that might be isolated to specific markets but really that's what was driving activity levels. I think more than anything else client conviction and I mean that in all spaces, whether we're managing a client's money, their conviction, their confidence, whether we're advising on a merger transaction, the CEO and the Board and the CFOs, their confidence levels. The same thing exists in the capital markets businesses and fixed income and equities. Now what leads to that, confidence in economic growth, reduced uncertainty. And so those are the factors that fuel activity.","Marty Mosby","I will ask you I think a more as a peer kind of question but I think it has some pertinence to what's going on. Given the rules that limited your ability and all the market makers ability to take on any risk, turning you basically into a conduit of transactions, when we see these types of disruptions in the marketplace, what are your traders saying in the sense of, how activities and clearing levels and new equilibriums get reached, when there isn't really any buffer still left in the market? So we're seeing some of the ramifications of Volcker now in distressed markets which can have I think some very unfavorable effects just on trading levels to get to a new clearing equilibrium?","Harvey Schwartz","Look, I don't know, if you and I are going to solve that, heated debate on a lot of different sides around the benefits of regulation, which are obviously numerous versus some of the unintended consequences potentially around liquidity. I would say, we feel like we had more than adequate capital and liquidity to be there for our clients and that's how we're positioning ourselves.","Marty Mosby","I guess, I just do you feel like the answers at certain times get to be over blown one way or another because of that unintended consequence?","Harvey Schwartz","I think that is a very complicated question which is very difficult for anyone to answer, which is, there's my own view there is not a rule that has had a big impact on market liquidity or lending across industries. I think something that's very difficult for anyone to quantify is, what is the economic impact of the collection of rules that have been put in place since the financial crises that impact capital liquidity, derivative, all sorts of things. I just think that, it's very hard to anticipate the combined effect of all that. But for us, we're just focused on the clients, Marty.","Marty Mosby","And then do you think the markets evolving to adapt to all that and how far along that process are we and that's last piece of that question. Thanks.","Harvey Schwartz","I think firms are in different places. We've obviously invested tremendously in risk reduction change, technology tools, educating our people. So I think we feel pretty far along the curve. You have seen in our capital ratios and in the Firm's balance sheet how much has changed over the last. But I think it varies across the industry and so I really can't speak to everybody else.","Marty Mosby","Right, thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Thanks. Just a quick question on Investment Management, I mean, you've benefited from a couple of acquisitions there over the last year. Did you actually budget for growth from acquisitions as you look forward and what's the investment in that area expected to be?","Harvey Schwartz","So you've seen us do a number of bolt-on acquisitions, the one I think you are referring to this year was Pacific Global Advisors which was $18 billion in asset and they are focused on the pension and retirement space. We don't budget for acquisitions at all. We do it on a case by case basis and acquisitions that generally are a little bit simplified. They either give us a capability that we don't have today and we think it's better for us to have bolt-on versus build organically or they actually fit a current strength where we can add scale. That's like -- that's kind of the extreme end of the spectrum in terms of how we think about them, but it's a 100% case by case.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay and then just a follow up question on the Basel III and I'm sorry if I missed this, but did you give the RWA for the fully phased-in ratios?","Harvey Schwartz","No, I didn't for the four -- do you want the fully phased-in?","Brian Kleinhanzl","Correct, yes.","Harvey Schwartz","So for fully phased-in, we are at 430 of credit risk and 104 marked risk, sorry about that. I was looking -- that was at standardized, another advance 587 that\u2019s 103 in operational, 353 in credit risk, 103 in market risk, sorry about that.","Operator","Your next question is a follow up from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Steven Chubak","So Harvey just on that same topic, it looks like your standardized RWA sequentially came down 10%. And I just wanted to know, first, what\u2019s the driving force behind that and just given the magnitude of the decline? And also just to clarify, that\u2019s the number that matters for the CCAR submission, if I remember correctly. Is that right?","Harvey Schwartz","That\u2019s correct. So, the standardized is the ratio using CCAR and the driver, the bulk of the driver was really in derivative notionals.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.","Harvey Schwartz","Everyone, thanks for dialing in today. And, myself and the rest of the team, we look forward to seeing you during the course of the year. If you have any follow up questions, please reach out to Dane and the team. Take care and have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs' fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation.

My name is Dennis, and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, October 18, 2016.","Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.","Dane Holmes","Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call.","Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm's belief regarding future events that, by their nature are uncertain and outside of the firm's control. The firm's actual results and financial condition may differ possibly materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see the description of Risk Factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2015.","I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets and supplementary leverage ratio and you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that's posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com.","This audio cast is copyrighted material to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, will now review the firm's results. Harvey?","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks Dane and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through the third quarter and year-to-date results and am happy to answer any questions.","Net revenues were $8.2 billion, net earnings $2.1 billion. Earnings per diluted share $4.88 and our annualized return on common equity was 11.2%. For the year-to-date, net revenues were $22.4 billion, net earnings $5.1 billion, earnings per diluted share $11.24 and our annualized return on common equity was 8.7%.","Relative to the first quarter of this year, the second and now the third quarter, have shown steady improvement. This improvement is reflected in third-quarter revenues, which increased 19% year-over-year. We also had a modest sequential increase which is particularly noteworthy given the third quarter is often seasonally slower.","A few factors contributed to the enhanced operating environment. The markets generally improved with equity prices steadily moving higher. The S&P 500 was up 3.3% in the third quarter. The MSCI World increased by 4.8% and the VIX declined by 15%.","Credit spreads also tightened during the quarter with U.S. investment grade and high yield cash spreads tighter by 12 basis points and 87 basis points respectively. In addition, there weren't any major changes to the global economic outlook over the course of the quarter. For example consensus estimates for global GDP growth remained roughly consistent.","Ultimately a more favorable backdrop and improved client sentiment translated into year-over-year revenue growth in three of our four business segments. Now let's discuss them.","Investment banking produced third quarter revenues of $1.5 billion, 14% lower than a strong second quarter. Although revenues declined sequentially, our investment banking backlog remained robust and was up versus last quarter. Breaking down the components of investment banking in the quarter, advisory revenues were $658 million down 17% compared to the second quarter as industry-wide completed activity declined.","Year-to-date Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&A. We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the third quarter, including ARM holdings \u00a324.4 billion sale to Softbank Group. AGL Resources $12 billion merger with Southern Company and Lockheed Martin's $5 billion spinoff and merger of its IS&GS business into Leidos.","We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the third quarter, including WhiteWave Foods $12.5 billion sale to Group Danone. Hewlett-Packard Enterprises' $8.8 billion spin off and merger of non-core software assets with Micro Focus International and Abbott Medical Optics' $4.3 billion sale to Johnson & Johnson.","Moving down to revenue, revenues were $879 million in the third quarter, down 11% sequentially, due to a decline in both debt and equity underwriting. Equity underwriting revenues were $227 million down 16% compared to the second quarter due to a continued weak backdrop for equity issuance.","However the end of the quarter was significantly more active in the beginning with more than half of the quarter's IPO volume occurring in September. Debt underwriting revenues of $652 million were down 10% quarter-over-quarter, following a robust second quarter.","For the first nine months of the year debt amortizing produced record year-to-date results. During the third quarter, we actively supported our client's financing needs, participating in Postal Savings Bank of China's $7.4 billion IPO, Great Plains Energy's $2.5 billion follow-on and convertible offering to support its purchase of Westar and Fortis' $2 billion investment grade offering for the purchase of ITC.","Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and equities businesses, net revenues were $3.7 billion in the third quarter up 2%compared to the second quarter. FICC client execution net revenues were $2 billion in the third quarter up 2% sequentially.","Credit increased and benefited from strong primary issuance and tighter spreads. Mortgage also increased and included better market-making conditions even tighter spreads. Rates was down slightly as client activity was driven by the continued discussion around potential Central Bank actions.","Currencies was essentially unchanged compared to the second quarter with lower client activity, particularly post the Brexit vote and commodities declined during the quarter as activity remained light. In equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the third quarter were $1.8 billion up 2% quarter-over-quarter.","Equities client execution net revenues of $678 million were up 16% sequentially, reflecting better market-making conditions. Commissions and fees were $719 million, down 3% quarter-over-quarter. Security services generated net revenues of $387 million down 8% relative to the seasonally stronger second quarter.","Turning to risk, average daily volume in the third quarter declined to $57 million, down $5 million sequentially. Moving on to our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $1.4 billion in the third quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $920 million, reflecting company-specific events, sale and gains in public equity investments.","Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $478 million and included approximately $275 million of net interest income. Investment management we reported third-quarter net revenues of $1.5 billion up 10% from the second quarter as incentive fees, management fees and transaction revenues all increased.","Assets under supervision increased $37 billion sequentially to a record $1.35 trillion. The increase was due to net market appreciation and net inflows. Long-term fee-based net inflows of $14 billion were primarily driven by fixed-income products.","Now let me turn to expenses, year-to-date compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior your equity awards and other items such as benefits declined by 13%. This was roughly in line with net revenues.","The 13% year-to-date decline results in a compensation to net revenues ratio of 41%. This is a hundred basis points lower in the funds accrual in the first half of this year. Third-quarter noncompetition expenses were $2.1 billion down slightly compared to the second quarter.","Now I would like to take you through a few key statistics. Total staff was approximately 34,900 roughly flat with the second quarter. Our effective tax rate for the year-to-date was 26.9%. Our global core liquid asset ended the third quarter at $214 billion and our balance sheet was $880 billion.","Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14% using the standardized approach. It was 12.4% under the Basel 3 advanced approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 6.3%. In the quarter we repurchased 7.8 million shares for $1.3 billion.","In terms of capital, our ratios have significantly strengthened over the last several years. This reflects the transformation of our balance sheet and our cumulative effort to de-risk the firm. All of these actions, combined with more than $30 billion of earnings since 2011, position the firm to grow our capital ratios and simultaneously bring our basic share count to its lowest point ever.","Before I wrap up, I want to cover three topics, our client franchise, expense initiatives and new opportunities. With respect to global client franchise, it's in great shape. We have a strong position in each of our four segments, investment banking, institutional client services, investing in lending and investment management.","While many of our clients are currently challenged by the low growth environment, we are committed to partnering with them and they look to navigate these headwinds. On expenses, last quarter we discussed the $700 million savings initiative that we undertook in the first half of the year and we continue to look at additional means of improving our efficiency without impacting our global client franchise.","Focusing on operating efficiency, not only positions us for margin expansion in better environments, but it also provides additional benefits. It allows the firm to maintain its global footprint and to continue to invest in the future, which is an essential component of sustainable value creation.","While there are currently economic headwinds in several countries globally, our focus on efficiency across all of our businesses and regions allows the firm not only to maintain, but also to invest in our client franchise through the cycle. Additionally, our expense discipline allows us to invest in new opportunities. Last week we launched a new online personal loan platform Marcus by Goldman Sachs.","Marcus' goal is to enter the consumer credit market and provide a product that is simple, transparent, flexible and provides consumers with real value. Like any new effort, we are taking a slow and methodical approach with Marcus. We are leveraging all the firm's pre-existing strengths across risk management and technology and we have brought an experienced team of consumer lending professionals to drive Marcus forward led by Harit Talwar.","Before taking your questions, I would like to leave you with one thought. The firm is as focused on navigating today's environment, as we are on preparing for the future. You have to do the first really well to be in a position to do the latter. Thanks again for dialing in and I am happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Glenn Schorr","Hi thanks.","Harvey Schwartz","Hey, good morning, Glenn.","Glenn Schorr","So I appreciate the color around things related to FICC and I've a question of overall backdrop. In the first quarter of '15, the Swiss re-pegged stuff went bonkers for a couple weeks and you made tons of money even more than the overall industry. This quarter it didn't seem like there was too many aha moment.","Credit spreads tightened and they had aftermath of Brexit and stuff, but in your text you point out low rates and slow economic growth as headwinds for FICC. You talk about lower market firms and volatility and equities.","I'm just curious when you look at the quarter we just had in FICC particularly, is it more like you had a nice pickup like first quarter of '15 and you're setting this up for keep calm like things have returned back to normal or is this possibly a little bit higher activity environment given the uncertainty?","Harvey Schwartz","So it's a great question, year-over-year we were up 49% on a core basis. I think in some respects that speaks to a weaker third quarter environment last year, but I have to agree with you. I wouldn't say it was a particularly strong quarter for FICC. Year-over-year I talked about some of the drivers.","I would say maybe the best way to describe, it wasn't so much -- it wasn't so much about tailwind as it was about not having so many headwinds in the quarter and of course we translated nicely for us.","Glenn Schorr","I'll take it if it will get a little bit higher operating environment. One last one on I&L, it's interesting that multiples -- take up multiples were near their highs and you would expect a lot of exits. This one happened to be a better quarter. You talked about some company-specific events, some sales and the up markets, but I guess the question is, is are you finding opportunities that will also put money to work especially on the equity side.","I saw the UFC deal and I am a huge Conor McGregor fan, but that was close to six times, the six times cap. So curious about how you see the investing environment for I&L?","Harvey Schwartz","So the opportunities for a while have been more on the debt side. You've seen the I&L balance sheet transition. When you see it again this quarter it is going to close to 80% debt, but selectively we're certainly seeing opportunities whether they be in what we recall other forms of equity, real estate or other areas, but selectively we've seen some good opportunities in corporate equity. As you're probably seeing, we're in a market now raising a fund, and the reception to that has been quite strong.","Glenn Schorr","How big is the I&L balance sheet now? You said its 80% Fixed Income, but it's over 100 now?","Harvey Schwartz","So just to give you the exact number, it's 98.9 billion, [indiscernible] just under 99 billion, and that's up $1.8 billion quarter-over-quarter. And I said almost 80%. It's 78% really debt and other assets, which leaves you basically with $21.5 billion of what we would categorize as equity.","Glenn Schorr","All right. Awesome. Thanks. Harvey.","Harvey Schwartz","Sure. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Christian Bolu","Good morning Harvey.","Harvey Schwartz","Hey Christian.","Christian Bolu","So a question on your consumer lending efforts, given the firm will be facing a very different demographic than you have historically faced, may we just talk about how you think about reputational risks and how you mitigate it?","Harvey Schwartz","Yes, so it's a great question. So I think the short answer is providing value to the consumer. So one of the reasons we have said so many times and this is going to be a very deliberate and methodical approach and a bit of crawl before we walk in this business is because we're well aware that this is a new effort for us. ","Now and some of this is not new for us, our technology skills, the risk management, but the interface through the technology with this new important client base, it's a different space for us. So we've hired, obviously, people with decades of experience. But I think the greatest mitigating factor is slow growth, monitoring it very closely. ","But also, when we put this together, we took input from consumers, and it really is, I don't know if it's the first-ever, but it\u2019s really is a lending product that is driven by consumer input. And so that means providing them with flexibility, with real value, with simplicity. And that's why we've come out with something, and we got feedback, consumers don't necessarily like and they don't understand the fee structures. ","So we created a no-fee product, no small print. If you call our call centers, people pick up. Some of these things are simple, but they're quite important in terms of what consumers want. And if you deliver what consumers want and you really control your processes, then obviously, you create value and you deliver what regulators want also.","Christian Bolu","Okay. That's helpful. And then just a cleanup question. On the buyback, $1.2 billion in the quarter, which is a bit lower than the first half run rate. I know the last CCAR cycle buybacks were back-end weighted. How should we think about the pace for this cycle?","Harvey Schwartz","So you're right. A year ago, there were some [indiscernible] that attach, which led to more backend weighted profile. This year, we had a bit of flexibility in terms of how we'll approach the next couple of quarters, but a lot of this i6s going to be driven by edging out the environment and demand for the balance sheet.","We would really like to start putting our capital to work if the environment improved from where it is today. But certainly, there's some flexibility in the profile for us to go up a little bit from these levels. But again, certainly not committing to that. You know how we think about capital management, and share repurchase for us is not to be equated with dividends and so it's going to be dynamic.","Christian Bolu","Okay, thank you Harvey.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. ","Michael Carrier","Thanks Harvey.","Harvey Schwartz","Hi, Mike","Michael Carrier","Can you just first, question on capital ratios. Your ratio continues to improve. Based on we had some recent comments by [indiscernible] and where CCAR is heading into '18, did anything change in how you managed through that process?","And then just with your last comments on the last question on balancing buybacks versus investments, are you starting to see some opportunities to make investments? And maybe it's because of market share opportunities globally but just wanted to get your thoughts on that.","Harvey Schwartz","So again, on the ratios, as I mentioned, 14 under standardized and 12 4 are advanced. By the way, just [indiscernible] and I'll know I get the question Mike, its 13.4 standardized fully phased and 11 9 on the advanced fully phased. ","In terms of the stress testing, white paper and govern it relates comments I'd say at a high level, obviously, they put a ton of work into this with various constituencies. We \u2013 our initial frameworks were their framework seem quite awful. And it seems somewhat consistent with the way we actually manage the firm. So we manage the firm obviously on the forward-looking basis in terms of how we stress tests. ","We obviously also manage the spot capital ratios. And under our spot capital ratios, as you can see, we have lots of capacity. And so we'll have to see ultimately the details in the MPR, but again, they did the right thing here by giving the bank the opportunity to make adjustments because as you know, this won't be incorporated into the 2017 cycle. ","And so the extent to which firms need to adapt, will be able to adapt after we see the MPR. But I think our starting point puts us in a great position and again the treatment of share repurchase and we'll see what happens with balance sheet and other things. But we'll take our normal approach in terms of capital management from here. But it seems like the right direction.","Michael Carrier","Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on I&L. When you look at some of the things that the Fed has put out there on physical commodities and some of the pressures on that part of the market versus what you guys have been doing on the debt side, just where do you see the outlook based on maybe some of these potential changes, the increase in RWAs? And what you can still grow versus what could potentially be at risk?","Harvey Schwartz","So that's a great question. In terms of why we just talked about commodities MPR. So the market's been waiting for this for a while. As you know, we've been in the commodity business for decades, and we think it's really important that the Federal Reserve\u2019s taken the lead here in terms of an important area of focus for us in the industry, but especially as it relates to ultimately establishing uniform standards across the industry. So we welcome all that. ","With respect to our business, we've obviously been very vocal in our commitment to the commodity business, and some of that I think maybe that gets misunderstood. So I want to underscore for you a bit. What we're committed to is serving our clients and their needs and you kind unpack that a bit and simplify by saying there's really three activities that are critical to our clients. It's critical for them to hedge, and that's consumers and producers would have commodity price exposure.","Financing of those businesses is critical. And then obviously, market-making activities, which provide liquidity to the markets under a critical component of making those markets function. That's what we're most committed to. You've seen over the years, we've been reducing on balance sheet, investing in commodities.","And so we'll work with the industry and with regulators like we would in any MPR process. But what we're more focused on ensuring that those services from a Goldman Sachs' perspective and across the industry can get provided to clients in a safe and cost-effective way. No different than if we were to approach any of the MPRs.","Michael Carrier","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks Mike.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O'Connor","Good morning.","Harvey Schwartz","Hi Matt.","Matt O'Connor","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the targeted customer base for the [indiscernible] platform in terms of FICO scores, income or however you're defining it?","Harvey Schwartz","Yes. So with this launch and with this one product, we're focused on the prime borrower base.","Matt O'Connor","And I guess, how do you define prime? I mean, it's a pretty big segment overall.","Harvey Schwartz","So we would define it broadly for you. Let's just say above 650 FICO category.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. And then just over time, will you provide more disclosures on this? Because as I step back and look at some of the names I cover, there seems like it could be one of the meaningful new initiatives that's out there in terms of change in the profile the company a little bit, and I think more disclosures over time will be helpful to be able to track the performance.","Harvey Schwartz","Sure. We're happy as it grows, obviously as it becomes more meaningful, I mean just to underscore this. I got an e-mail last that we booked our first loan. So if you want to continue, if you want to consider that continuous updating of financial disclosure, Matt, but I don't mean to make a lot of your question.","Obviously, as it grows and becomes more meaningful, we'll spend more time with you on it. I think the important thing now is that, we make sure that everyone understands the product, the pace we expect to move at, which will be very deliberate and slow. And that in terms of return for long term, if that's kind of where you're getting, obviously, I talked a lot bit about the consumer here but we built this business to be accretive in the long run to Goldman Sachs returns. But we're certain, we're happy to keep you updated.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. And then completely unrelated, any color on the regional performance within fixed income trading this quarter?","Harvey Schwartz","No. There was nothing specific that jumped out. It was really more across the products but it wasn't anything, particularly in the regional clouds.","Matt O'Connor","Okay, all right. Thank you.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Harvey Schwartz","Good morning, Mike.","Mike Mayo","Hi in the past, you've mentioned that you felt some competitors were having a more permanent retreat from the market. Did you see some of the benefit of share gains this quarter as part of your capital markets revenue? And also your comp ratio was up 100 basis points year-over-year. Are you trying to hire more people or pay more in an effort to gain share?","Harvey Schwartz","So with respect to the market share, certainly over the course of the past year, I would say there's been periods, particularly things like some of our core strengths, Prime Brokerage in fixed income, across the regions, we've seen discrete shifts in market share. I would say when we look at it in terms of the core businesses, for example, like credit, as we monitor those market shares, certainly with certain client segments like asset managers, it feels like we're picking up market share. Again, one of the difficult things about market share is you really need volume to grow. ","And even though obviously our performance this year significantly better than last year, it's the best quarter we've had in five quarters. You really need activity levels to pick up from here. Now just in terms in the second part of your question, the 41% of this 49 is our best estimate. ","We told you forever that as a conceptual matter, you should expect in periods where revenues should decline that compensation and benefits expense should lag that and obviously, we talked to you ton about operating leverage. And so as revenues grow, you should also expect compensation and benefits expects to lag that growth because of the operating leverage. But at this stage 41% an output.","Mike Mayo","And one follow-up. Brexit, is this a chance to gain additional share? Or is this just pain that everybody has to share? And do you think more business shifts to the U.S.?","Harvey Schwartz","I would say that Brexit potentially is something that could drive share to the U.S. I think what we've witnessed over the last several years is U.S. firms like ourselves with really, really strong market shares and leading business positions whether you look at FICC, investment banking, equities, asset management, if you're a leader in a franchise throughout this cycle, particularly as activity picks up, I think there is share to gain. I think our European clients need us. But in terms of Brexit, I think it's unclear whether that's having any impact at this stage. It feels like early days.","Mike Mayo","All right, thank you.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Betsy Graseck","Hi good morning.","Harvey Schwartz","Hi Betsy, how are you?","Betsy Graseck","Hi good. I just had a couple of questions. Looking at the VaR that you guys put out in your note obviously in the press release. It seems like volatility actually came down a bit in certain segments and yet the VaR came down as well. And I look at this and I'm thinking is there an opportunity for you to allocate a little bit more in this environment and continue to generate some nice sized trading revenues?","Harvey Schwartz","So I think that observation is correct. I think what's most important about that observation is just the capacity we have under the capital ratios, so obviously. But again, VaR is going to be driven by market volatilities and by client demand. And as client demand picks up or as market volatilities pickup, certainly you would expect that to translate through. We're not feeling constrained at all really only by the macro environment and our client appetite is same.","Betsy Graseck","So in this past quarter it was more function of client demand pulling back because it feels like you have the capital capacity to have had more of allocated this past quarter?","Harvey Schwartz","When you look at it in terms of so you are talking about year-over-year sequentially and you look at -- sorry, my allergies [ph] are bad today. If you look at more sequentially it's kind of mix of our total level is coming down and what I'll call position changes. If you look at year-over-year it's more about position changes. I think your big point is this environment wasn\u2019t a particularly strong environment, again it's the third quarter it's got some of the seasonal characteristics.","Betsy Graseck","Yes. Okay. And then just secondly on Asia, could you give us a sense as to how you guys are reorienting your Asia franchise, I noticed that there was some headcount changes over there and some management changes, so could you give us a sense as to what the strategy is for that region?","Harvey Schwartz","So, as you remember from the last call, we talked about the expense initiatives we launched in the first half, which translated to $700 million run rate savings. Anything you are reading in a press is a bit distorted. This process in Asia it just a continuation of the process that has been ongoing for the rest of the firm. In terms of Asia completely committed to the region. ","Betsy Graseck","They make sense. I'm just saying I think there is also a comment around the Head of Asia was changing and so wondered if there was a shift in focus on?","Harvey Schwartz","No, they are completely unrelated events. If you're sitting at Magic Me [ph] yesterday you would have heard Mark talked about how we joined the firm in 1976 and he just thought this would be a perfect time for him. But now they are completely unrelated in terms of there is nothing strategic in that. ","Betsy Graseck","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous. Please go ahead.","Guy Moszkowski","Good morning.","Harvey Schwartz","Good morning, Guy.","Guy Moszkowski","I wanted to follow-up on the I&L questions. Specifically, maybe you can just give us some color, maybe some examples, of how you have been continuing feed the equity balances to offset the gains harvesting that you have been doing over the past couple of years.","Because you've harvested quite a bit, and yet you have been able to maintain that asset line item in the $21 billion, $21.5 billion range. And in the context of that, maybe you can comment on some of the recent proposals or requests that the Fed has made for congressional action to tighten up.","Harvey Schwartz","So in terms of I&L balance sheet, again you are right to point out that $21 billion, $21.5 billion have been relatively constant. Obviously, that from a smaller component of the balance sheet I mentioned before it's close to 8% and 8% is really lending another item. And so I don\u2019t have details in front of me to give you blow-by-blow breakdowns on where reinvestments are occurring. Obviously, corporate private equity has been slow over the last couple of years, but that $21.5 million 20% of that now is made up of real estate globally. ","And so that's been a meaningful participant. Now why have you generally not seen the asset class going lower? Obviously it's about high class problem. The assets have been performing, the markets have been generally going up over the last couple of years and you've seen that performance as I&L segment. So that's part of the gives and gets. In terms of I think you are -- I think -- I don\u2019t think you are much talking about brokers you are talking about the fed discussions with congress, very early days and we'll see how that evolves, is that your question?","Guy Moszkowski","Yes, I think that there was some -- there was -- before the commodities NPR came out the fed had also I think made some noises about asking for congressional guidance I guess on cutting back on merchant banking that's allowed within broker.","And I was wondering if you had some sense of whether you would be able to continue to seed that equity line and keep it in the range that it's been in or grow it if in fact there're further restrictions on merchant banking.","Harvey Schwartz","Well, obviously the opportunity exist, we think we are providing an important layer of capital, but these conservations evolving, it's super early, so there'd be no way for us to interpret or give you any guidance on that. ","Guy Moszkowski","Fair enough. I guess the other question, also I&L-related is, and had this has to do with the negative operating leverage comment that you had made for the Firm broadly. So for the nine months, your revenues are down; your comp is down not as much, maybe a couple of percentage points differential, which is a negative operating leverage.","But the biggest component of the revenue decline has been I&L. My question is, if I&L had declined in line with the rest of the Firm, would it be possible to keep the comp declining in line as well? In other words, would you have been able to maintain your margin better if it hadn't been I&L that was driving the revenue down?","Harvey Schwartz","So on the competition benefit expense you are right, so revenues are down 15%, you relate any competition benefit expense down 13. Now I wouldn\u2019t -- maybe we characterize that as negative operating leverage I don\u2019t know that's meaningful negative operating leverage and the reason we are able to achieve that almost lock step decline, it was because of the expense initiative we launched in the beginning of the year. ","In terms of contribution of an individual segment, we look at this as firm wide collective as we go through the competition process. And obviously competition as we repeated to you many times before, it's about performance, but it's also about managing the company for the long term and executing our strategy for the long term. So it's not going to be a -- a competition process not going to driven by one segment contribution one way or another. ","Guy Moszkowski","Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate it. ","Harvey Schwartz","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC. Please go ahead.","Fiona Swaffield","Hi.","Harvey Schwartz","Good morning.","Fiona Swaffield","I just wanted to ask -- good morning. About pricing you mentioned -- we talked about market share, but have you seen given that some banks putting less capital to work than others, any impact on pricing in any of your products, and there is the follow-up as well on the tax rate now that is coming lower again what are you thinking about for the future? Thank you.","Harvey Schwartz","So in pricing at the margin it's very business specific, we have seen in some cases that I'll call a rational re-pricing and things like prime brokerage. But again in this low volume environment I don\u2019t know how much that you will see, in other words, the same low volume, low growth environment we have globally that's contributing to what it looks like in the future extraordinarily strong competitive environment for our businesses is the same thing that doesn\u2019t allow for lot of price improvements.","And so I think these one of your things where even though it has taken while you need environment that is challenge for a while or to get competitors retreats of the same challenges don\u2019t allow for price adjustments, it maybe overtime you see price adjustments, but certainly things the more capital intensive parts of the business like prime brokerage where we are market leader. In terms of tax I think in terms of your estimate obviously it will be driven by regional contributions, but I would say 28% to 29% that range. ","Fiona Swaffield","Thank you.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question from the line of Jim Mitchell with The Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Harvey Schwartz","Hey Jim. How are you?","Jim Mitchell","Good. How are you doing, Harvey?","Harvey Schwartz","Good.","Jim Mitchell","Maybe just a question on Asia I guess in a more positive way, you have the Hong Kong, Shanghai connect going into place later this year, it seems like when the Hong Kong Shanghai connect went in you guys had a nice boost in equity trading the industry did in the first half of 2015. Do you expect something similar this time around?","Harvey Schwartz","I don\u2019t know, necessarily we have a strong view in terms of the immediate. I do think that over the intermediate term it's an important development. I think more broadly, well it might not be a straight path to increasing volumes, I think more broadly in Asia our perspective is and with China that we are on a long upward trajectory of activity and our role and ability to work with clients in the region, whether its trading, advisory, capital raising, this just feels like a very long positive trajectory, but it\u2019s not going to be straight line.","Jim Mitchell","Right okay. Fair enough. And then maybe a follow-up on the pipeline. You guys did note you're down year-over-year. Is that mostly M&A and can you give any more color on what you're seeing in terms of the outlook on the pipeline?","Harvey Schwartz","So the pipeline feels pretty good when you talk our M&A team. And the backlog sequentially was up, not down. But the activity levels that I mentioned in terms of completed transactions in the market, obviously down over year after very, very healthy levels.","The best perspective I can share with you is the one I get from talking to our M&A bankers. And it hasn\u2019t shifted much over the course of the year. The same fundamental factors that are contributing to the last two years of M&A activity, generally low topline growth, a desire to drive efficiencies, access to the capital markets, all those factors still in place.","Now regionally the U.S. field is more active then Europe and Asia fields a bit more active than Europe, but I am giving you really very localized commentary. Long-term it feels like the fundamental factors are in place.","Jim Mitchell","And the underwriting side of the equation?","Harvey Schwartz","So in underwriting as you saw, we've had very strong debt performance and we had a record for the first nine months of this year on a year-to-date basis. I mentioned before that half year IPO volume or meaningful portion of the IPO volume actually occurred in September.","So it does feel like we are starting now again into a market where a lot of that activity that got pushed from the first quarter into the second quarter that that still exists. So we feel reasonably good about activity levels in the capital markets on an intermediate basis.","Jim Mitchell","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Chris Kotowski","Yes, I wonder if you could give us some more color on the new private equity fund? I saw a press report saying it's between $5 billion and $8 billion. But if you could just comment on the targeted size and mandate? Is it global or North American? Is it pure corporate equity, or is it broader? And then as a follow-on to that, if it's $5 billion to $8 billion, the Blackstones and Apollos of the world are raising $18 billion-plus. So what's the strategy to put the money to work? Is it to go more middle market? To do fewer deals or to bring in more co-investors? Those kind of my questions.","Harvey Schwartz","No I am happy to talk about it. I don't know if I'll get to all of your questions, but let me just give you the high level. So we are in the market, there is really two fundamental reasons why we decided to engage in the fund raise. One was really to have a full offering for our private wealth clients.","And the second is if you look at the capital regime particular under CCARs as it related to private equity, corporate equity specifically, those capital requirements continue to adjust. So they are giving us the flexibility to utilize the funds and to provide that to our clients. It seem like it made a ton of sense.","Now in terms of the fund size, we have been talking about $5 billion to $8 billion, that\u2019s what the team feels is the right size for the horizon that they are thinking about. So they are not looking the raise the largest one of the world despite the fact that there\u2019s been very significant interest in terms of how we are approaching it and in terms of its focus, its focus will be on corporate private equity.","Chris Kotowski","Okay. And should we assume that you will commit 3% to it? And is it the standard asset management 1% and 20%? And I assume that these will show up on the asset management side? And then kind of related to that, is this all a wealth management, asset management, standalone business that's walled off from investment banking? Or can there be cross-pollination between the two?","Harvey Schwartz","Well the activities, the activities allow for us obviously to work with our investment bankers, but it is an asset management driven product and its broker compliance, in its design.","Chris Kotowski","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning. So first question on non-comp. I think you took a charge here in occupancy. Is there some benefit that we should see flowing through in subsequent quarters from that occupancy charge this quarter?","Harvey Schwartz","Yes. So we took a $63 million charge. This relates to one asset that we leased out. The run rate on that is small, but generally speaking, we look at these things, we look for a reasonably short term in terms of payback, in terms of recouping those expenses but this has been something we were just waiting for the market to recover, but it's a small item.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. And then, hoping to ask a follow-up for your previous comments on FICC. I think you commented that the quarter wasn't a particularly strong one, even though the year-over-year growth was good. And it seemed like you commented that you are gaining share in FICC, at least among some market participants.","But if we look at year-to-date trends in revenue, it does look like some of the U.S. money center banks are growing double digit plus over 2015 year to date, whereas Goldman's revenue is down. Can you help us understand maybe why that's diverging? Is it a business mix issue? Is there something else going on? Are you shifting away from certain clients or what have you? Any help you could give us there, Harvey, would be great.","Harvey Schwartz","Yes. It's no problem. I think that's more environment-specific. So it could be in some aspects, different footprint. All these businesses at this stage in FICC, and we don't have much visibility in FICC competitors, they're all very different. Some of these are enormous balance sheets. Some of them are very big in emerging markets, some are not.","I think when you look at it I wouldn't overemphasize the first quarter '15, which I think is really the factor that's influencing your math. And again I wouldn't overemphasize the performance that we had in the third quarter either, because things just don't shift that quickly.","I think that the third quarter was solid for us. But as I talked about currencies, commodities was down year-over-year. So it certainly wasn't an environment we were hitting on all cylinders and even with that, we were in a double-digit ROE environment. So it feels pretty good to us and the momentum feels good.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. Thanks.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Steven Chubak","Hey Harvey, Wanted to start off with just a follow-up question relating to the earlier merchant banking discussion. Recognize that many of the recommendations are, in fact just that, that have come from the regulators. But just thinking about the strategy for this business, longer term, looking at the activities more broadly, it's been a very good profit source, historically, but it also consumes significant amounts of capital.","And under a CCAR lens, some have speculated it could even be ROE dilutive overall. I was wondering, given the current backdrop and some of the high-end regulatory scrutiny, whether you have considered strategic alternatives for the business, such as an IPO or a spin that could generate value while maybe allowing for some degree of regulatory unshackling?","Harvey Schwartz","So I think you're right to underscore, which I mentioned earlier, the fact that over time, the CCAR requirements under -- let's just use private equity investing and corporate equity have certainly increased. Now the nice thing about that analytic framework is it's perfectly transparent with the global market shops are etcetera. So you can certainly evaluate investments that you're making.","Now we're talking about investments at the bottom part of the capital structure and so in terms of the return profile, we're obviously very selective about how we deploy that capital. But as I mentioned before, one of the nice things about launching this fund is it does gives us flexibility in terms of how to think about deploying that capital and it creates a new important product for our clients. So we have options.","Steven Chubak","Got it. Okay. That's very helpful color, Harvey. Thank you and maybe just one follow-up on the capital side. Actually, we're shifting over to the denominator. It is quite evident that you have made significant strides in mitigating your standardized RWAs. I think it's down about 15% since the end of 2014. But the advanced risk rated assets have actually crept higher.","I know some of that is going to be a function of increases in op risk. But I was hoping you could speak to any mitigation potential that you can achieve on the advanced risk rated assets moving forward, particularly if the Collins floor does end up applying to some of the new proposed capital changes that Tarullo spoke to in his recent remarks.","Harvey Schwartz","Yes. So as I mentioned on the advanced transitional, we're at 12.4% under the current capital regime. Obviously, that gives us more than enough capacity. We obviously have things that roll off and things like that, but not material enough for me to highlight for you.","But to the extent to which I think at this stage whether you look at the supplementary leverage ratio, standardized, advanced, we have the tools in place through our return on attributed equity framework, the ROE framework, which we talked a lot about.","We have the tools in place at this stage and more importantly, the culture, the people engagement across the entire firm. We will adapt if needed but right now we feel we have more than enough capacity.","Steven Chubak","Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.","Harvey Schwartz","Sure. Steve.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Matt Burnell","Good morning Harvey. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple of quick ones. You mentioned that there was the strongest inflow of AUM in the quarter was in fixed income. Any color as to what was driving that and if those were -- was that all liquidity or was it slightly higher margin flow?","Harvey Schwartz","No. So liquidity products, I believe, it's up $2 billion in the quarter. So this was long-term fee-based assets that were really the driver. And the team has done a very good job in their advisory businesses and so that I would say would be the more meaningful part of the driver in terms of this quarter's flows.","Matt Burnell","Okay, and just circling back to another question previously asked. If I back out the charge that you took in occupancy this quarter, it looks like, as well as litigation, it looks like you are running in the last couple of quarters at around 24%, 25% non-comp to revenue ratio.","I understand revenue can be a bit volatile, but it's been trending prior to that at 30%-plus. Is 25% a new run rate? Or is it really going to depend -- should we really think more about the dollar value rather than the ratio?","Harvey Schwartz","We don't target a ratio. You should think of the ratio as an output. Now obviously, we have been very diligent around expenses over the last couple of years reflecting the environment. If you happen to have a lot of historical financials, you would see that market development this quarter was under $100 million.","I think it's the lowest it's been in seven years. So obviously we've been very focused on this, but we don't target a ratio. And a big driver obviously is BC&E and if you saw big activity pickup, that would move with the environment as well. But we're very focused on expenses as you know.","Matt Burnell","Yes, thanks very much. ","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks very much. Hi, how are you Harvey? Just to step back for a moment, can we just talk about how we should contemplate revenue growth across the mix of businesses more broadly? Because I look at what happened this quarter and what's occurred over the course of the year. And in the underwriting businesses and in the advisory business, obviously you know the statistics much better than I. But advisory may be moving to a new, lower plateau than what we've seen recently. And with all the cross currents running through the trading environment and through the investing environment, how do we contemplate the overall go-forward mix of business?","Harvey Schwartz","So I think we don't target the mix, as you know. We focus on the clients in those businesses where, as you know, we have leading market positions and so we feel good about that. I think it's a bit more of what's your expectation for the environment is.","We control the micro issues we can focus on, our client engagement, expenses, capital management. But a lot of the things are outside of our control and I would say that in aggregate, when you look at the vast majority of our businesses, this is not an extraordinary environment, despite the fact that third quarter performance was strong on a relative basis, there's lots of challenges regionally.","You could certainly envision an environment that was significantly better from where we are today. You've heard us say this a lot, but we look for growth and an environment of negative interest rates in vast parts of the world is not indicative of a role that's growing at great pace. So you could see much better environments than we have today, and we hope that ends up being the case.","Eric Wasserstrom","But just from a planning perspective, I mean is there any reason to think that, or that this environment, that those policy dynamics are changing over, let's say, a medium-term horizon?","Harvey Schwartz","Just like I think they could change always pretty quickly for a negative, and we tend to be more contingency planners. You could certainly see things break for the high side. Obviously, rates could move back into positive territory, which should be an indicator and there's been speculation in the market that we might be more in the cusp of that in the United States.","I think the most important takeaway is whether or not we move into that environment in the near term? We're incorporating all those current factors in how we're running the firm today, which in a pretty muted environment, we're able to grow revenues, demonstrate a double-digit ROE and we truly believe we're well positioned in the franchise with significant operating leverage if the environment improves. So we feel quite good about our position, but we are rooting for a better environment for everybody.","Eric Wasserstrom","And if I could sneak in one last one on Marcus. Most firms that do similar kind of lending typically have a 2.5% to 3% pre-tax ROA. How does that compare with what it is you are targeting?","Harvey Schwartz","So that's perfectly consistent with what we're able to generate. Of course, we don't have any legacy infrastructure cost structure. This is all white sheet of paper for us. So we'll see how it evolves, but that's certainly achievable.","Eric Wasserstrom","Okay. Thanks very much.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.","Devin Ryan","Thanks, good morning, Harvey.","Harvey Schwartz","Hi how are you, Devin?","Devin Ryan","Good. So it seems like we are speaking a lot more about your technology footprint on these calls. And you have been increasingly highlighting a number of those capabilities. When we look at those initiatives, like Marcus or Symphony, Marquee, or consolidating the electronic trading book across businesses, and maybe I missed something there, but where do you see the most immediate opportunities to actually move the needle?","And I guess that's part one. Part two is as you think about future investments in the technology, do you think more of the incremental spend from here is going to be more offensive positioning, revenue-producing, rather than defensive?","Harvey Schwartz","So it's a great question. I would say that broadly speaking, and this won't be completely inclusive, but I think you can define our technology strategy as focused on client engagement and those tools and services we can deliver to clients that provide differentiated value to those clients, and you see that doing us in our capital markets businesses and obviously you see us creating that with Marcus.","Two, there are times when we feel like given our core technology skills, we're in a position to develop technology, which will be better enhance outside of the firm ultimately even though we incubated it in the firm, and Symphony will be a great example of that. We feel like as an information sharing platform with better security, better compliance controls, we felt like that was something better utilized by a broad range of market participants.","And lastly, our own technology internally is quite important for making us more efficient and adapting to regulatory change and managing our risks, and that's obviously been very core to what we do. So we look across all three of those different platforms if you will, for lack of better language.","I would say the most important thing in addition to controlling the firm is our client engagement and Marcus reflects that trend as it relates to consumers.","Devin Ryan","Got it, that's great. Very helpful. Maybe just a quick follow-up. Just any update on the momentum in deposit gathering within the online bank? Just how that has been, I don't know if you give any numbers there, but how that's been maybe relative to expectations now that we are a little ways away from the launch?","Harvey Schwartz","So it's more than exceeded our expectations. I think in the past quarter, we picked up another $1 billion of deposits and so the momentum there feels quite good and the team's done an excellent job of transitioning the platform into Goldman.","Devin Ryan","Got it, okay. Thanks very much.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.","Harvey Schwartz","Hey Brian.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Hi Harvey, actually I'm all good. All my questions were asked. Thanks.","Harvey Schwartz","Okay. Great. Thanks, Brian.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.","Marty Mosby","Thanks. Going back to the comp ratio, and what you said earlier about as revenues go higher, the comp ratios should really drift lower. As we are having lower revenues this year, the comp ratios should probably drift a little bit higher than it was last year. Is that the concept you were really pushing forward earlier?","Harvey Schwartz","So this is completely consistent, Marty. As you know, you've been following us forever in terms of broadly speaking and it may not be the case in any given year. But broadly speaking, we've encouraged you to expect that compensation and benefits expense will lag revenue moves.","So you've seen it through the first -- through the year-to-date. 41% is our best estimate but revenues are down 15%; compensation and benefits expense, down 13%. In environments where revenues are up, base case, you should expect a lag in that direction also particularly given how much we've emphasized operating leverage with you.","Marty Mosby","That is what I thought. I've just been spoiled the last two year with revenues being fairly consistent on a year-on-year basis.","Harvey Schwartz","Yes.","Marty Mosby","The other thing I was going to ask was, you had mentioned you had four businesses, which is outlined on income statement very clearly. When you talk about the new consumer business and lending, it really doesn't fit into any of those four. Do you feel like you could put deposits maybe in asset management? But are you thinking about this as evolving into a fifth business? Or how would you tuck it into your overall strategic mix today?","Harvey Schwartz","So three of the four segments are up this year obviously. The one segment, which we worked hard to unpack for everybody is Investing & Lending and this would very naturally fall into the lending segment. Obviously, to the extent to which down the road as an activity in and of itself, if it had material contribution, we could talk about highlighting more, but I think it will give a lot of attention as it grows anyway, it's pretty exciting.","Marty Mosby","Got you. Thanks.","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks Marty.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.","Harvey Schwartz","So since there are no more questions, I just really want to take a moment to thank all of you for joining the call. Hopefully, I and other members of senior management will see many of you in the coming months.","If any additional questions come up, please don't hesitate to reach out to Dane or the team. Otherwise, please enjoy the rest of your day and I look forward to speaking with you on our fourth quarter earnings call in January. Take care, everyone, and thanks again.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation.

I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs third quarter 2013 earnings conference call. This call is being recorded today, October 17, 2013. Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may now begin your conference.","Dane Holmes","Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, director of investor relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. ","Today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm\u2019s belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain and outside of the firm\u2019s control. The firm\u2019s actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm\u2019s future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for our year ended December 2012.","I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, and Global Core Excess. And you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures and regulatory capital ratios that are posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com. ","This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced, or rebroadcast without our consent.","Our chief financial officer, Harvey Schwartz, will now review the firm\u2019s results. Harvey?","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in today. I\u2019ll walk you through our third quarter results, and then take your questions. Net revenues for the quarter were $6.7 billion, net earnings, $1.5 billion, earnings per diluted share, $2.88, and our year to date annualized return on common equity was 10.4%.","While there were some headwinds in the third quarter, our year to date performance remained solid, in what continues to be a challenging macro-environment. On last quarter\u2019s call, we talked about how market participants were trying to assess the outlook for the global economy, specifically whether a recovering U.S. economy could potentially offset slower growth in other economic regions.","In addition, the shifting commentary on monetary policy was leading our clients to question the potential economic and market impacts of reduced quantitative easing. These discussions continued in the third quarter. Ongoing uncertainty around the economic outlook and the traditional seasonal slowdown drove a significant reduction in client activity during the quarter.","This reduction in nationwide client activity obviously impacted the opportunity set in many of our businesses. In investment banking, equity and equity related volumes declined 27% quarter over quarter. Debt [unintelligible] volumes declined 10% versus the prior quarter, and completed M&A volumes declined 36% sequentially.","Within our institutional client services businesses, most product areas also experienced reduced levels of client activity. For example, within credit products, investment grade and high-yield volumes declined sequentially by 13% and 19% respectively when looking at trades data. In U.S. equity markets, stock buy-ins were down 13% to an average daily volume of 5.8 billion shares. ","However, activity improved in September with our investment banking clients. Announced M&A volumes increased significantly, and overall backlog improved to its highest level in five years. During the quarter, we also saw continued positive trends within our investment management business. Assets under supervision reached a record level, aided by $17 billion of net inflows. ","I\u2019ll now run through each of our businesses. Investment banking produced third quarter net revenues of $1.2 billion, down 25% from the second quarter. Third quarter advisory revenues were $423 million, down 13% from the second quarter, reflecting a decline in industry-wide completed M&A transactions.","Year to date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&A. We advise on a number of important transactions that closed in the third quarter, including Softbank\u2019s $21.6 billion purchase of a majority stake in Sprint, Bausch & Lomb\u2019s $8.7 billion sale to Valeant, and Apache\u2019s $3.75 billion sale of selected assets to Fieldwood Energy.","We\u2019re also an advisor on a number of significant announced transactions. They include Vodafone\u2019s U.S. $130 billion disposal of its U.S. group, whose principal asset is its 45% interest in Verizon Wireless; Applied Materials\u2019 merger with Tokyo Electron for a combined value of $29 billion; and Grohe\u2019s $3.9 billion sale of a majority stake to Lixil.","Third quarter net revenues were $743 million, down 30% from a strong second quarter. Equity underwriting revenues of $276 million were down 26% compared with the second quarter, driven by a decline in industry-wide activity. Year to date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in global equity and equity-related common stock offerings and IPOs.","Switching over to debt, underwriting revenues were $467 million, and represented a 33% decline relative to a record second quarter. During the third quarter, there were several noteworthy transactions: BHP Billiton\u2019s $5 billion debt offering, Schaeffler\u2019s $1.3 billion sale of a portion of its equity stake in Continental\u00a0, and ADT\u2019s $1 billion high-yield offering. ","Let me now turn to institutional client services. Total net revenues were $2.9 billion in the third quarter. Fixed client execution net revenues were $1.2 billion in the third quarter, substantially lower than the second quarter, clearly not a good quarter for FIC. The significant decline in revenues was driven in part by seasonally slower activity levels seen across the industry and a more challenging macro-environment.","While rates were up relative to a weak second quarter, activity levels remained muted. Revenues within currencies decreased significantly relative to the second quarter, on difficulty managing inventory and reduced activity levels. ","Commodities decreased significantly versus the second quarter under challenging market making conditions and also lower client activity levels. Revenues within credit decreased significantly on lower volumes. Mortgage results decreased sequentially as clients became more risk averse given the potential for tapering in the U.S.","Turning to equities, net revenues for the third quarter were $1.6 billion, down 13% from the second quarter. Equities client execution revenues were $549 million, down 14% sequentially. If you adjust for the sale of our Americas reinsurance business in the second quarter, revenues essentially flat. ","Commissions and fees were $727 million, down 13% from the second quarter, again reflecting lower market volumes. Security services net revenues of $340 million declined 10% from the seasonally stronger second quarter. ","With respect to risk, average daily volume in the third quarter was $84 million, up 4% from second quarter levels.","Let me now review investing and lending. We produced net revenues of $1.5 billion in the third quarter. Investing and lending includes direct investing, investing we do through funds, as well as lending activities. ","These activities occur across a diversified set of asset classes, including both equity and debt. Equity securities generated net revenues of $938 million, primarily reflecting gains from private equity investments. ","This increase in fair value was driven by company-specific events like IPOs, strong corporate performance, and higher equity prices. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $300 million, primarily from interest income. Other revenues of $237 million include the firm\u2019s consolidated investment entities. ","Switching to investment management, we reported third quarter net revenues of $1.2 billion. Management and other fees were $1.1 billion, 1% lower sequentially. During the third quarter, assets under supervision increased $36 billion to a record $991 billion. Net market appreciation of $19 billion was primarily in equity assets, while $17 billion in inflows were concentrated in fixed income assets.","Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior-year equity awards, and other items such as payroll taxes and benefits was accrued at a compensation to net revenues ratio of 41% year to date.","This is 200 basis points lower than the firm\u2019s accrual in the first half of the year. The lower compensation accrual reflects year-to-date revenues and better visibility on expected compensation levels as we approach the end of the year.","Third quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.2 billion, 4% lower than the second quarter, largely due to the sale of our reinsurance business and lower brokerage, clearing, and execution costs.","Year to date, our effective tax rate was 30.3%. ","On capital, we repurchased 10.2 million shares of common stock for a total cost of $1.65 billion during the quarter. Year to date, we have repurchased 30.8 million shares for a total cost of $4.77 billion. Today, we also announced an increase in our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.50 to $0.55 per share.","Moving on to regulatory capital ratios, our Basel III tier one common ratio on a fully loaded basis is 9.8%, up 50 basis points from the second quarter, driven by a reduction in risk. The risk-weighted assets are approximately $590 billion, $345 billion in credit risk, $165 billion in market risk, and about $80 billion in operational risk.","Our estimate for the proposed supplementary leverage ratio under U.S. rules is approximately 5% for the firm and approximately 6% for the bank. This is our best estimate, subject to change, depending on regulatory clarifications. ","Like all other proposed regulatory requirements, we will work closely with our regulators as we evaluate and finalize the proposal. We believe it is our obligation to support safety and soundness within the financial services industry and the global financial system. As it relates to how we\u2019ll run the business, similar to other regulatory metrics, the supplementary leverage ratio will be an important input. ","Clearly, concerns about the global economic outlook created a more difficult operating environment for our clients in the third quarter. These challenges were amplified by the seasonal slowdown traditionally impacting client activity in July and August. ","However, we don\u2019t build client relationships or build businesses for a quarter. Client relationships and operating businesses require years, often decades, of investment to build the durability that ultimately creates long-term shareholder value.","Across the globe, our investment banking clients seek our advice on their most important strategic decisions. Corporate, government, and institutional asset management clients look to our execution and risk management capabilities across a variety of products and regions. We are entrusted to provide investment management services and offer investment products across all major asset classes through a diverse set of institutional and individual clients, making us one of the largest asset managers in the world.","Our clients often value our advice and services the most when the outlook is less certain, and when finding solutions becomes more challenging. The U.S. government shutdown and the debate in the United States surrounding the government debt ceiling has become a concern for our clients. ","The political complexity involved in finding a long-term solution has created uncertainty about the world\u2019s economic outlook, and as we have all seen, has weighed heavily on market sentiment. Now that the political impasse looks to be resolved for the near term, we\u2019re hopeful that greater certainty will drive improved client confidence and activity levels. Having said that, a long term solution is critical to the sustained recovery for the economy. ","These fluctuations have not distracted us from focusing on the long term drivers of our business, so as a management team, we are focused first and foremost on our clients, building deep, meaningful relationships and providing solutions to their daily challenges. We are focused on conservatively managing our financial profile and being prudent allocators of capital. We are also focused on being efficient operators, while at the same time providing world-class service to our clients","In the end, we are focused on creating long term shareholder value for you, our shareholders.","With that, I\u2019d like to thank you again for listening today, and I\u2019m happy now to take your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Your first question is from the line of Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. ","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","I was hoping to come back to your commentary on FIC. Understanding all of your peers\u2019 business mix is different, but the relative revenue performance this quarter is pretty wide. So I was just hoping you could add a bit more color on how you would attribute that gap to your relative business mix, the positioning issues you noted, and maybe just more challenging comparables.","Harvey Schwartz ","As I said a few minutes ago, clearly a difficult environment for FIC, and we\u2019re not happy with the results. So having said that, with respect to business mix, I think there could be something there in terms of how different franchises are positioned. Certainly as we\u2019ve discussed with you in the past, our FIC business may be somewhat more weighted towards institutional asset managers. ","If I back up for a second, if you remember on last quarter\u2019s call, somebody asked me a question about how I thought the market would respond to the potential changes in monetary policy, and the discussion really is around how data-centric people would be. And of course we came into the summer with less certainly around monetary policy, and then there were events in the Middle East, and then of course people actually couldn\u2019t get data with the government shutdown. ","So I think there could be something in that. So, I think the whole market environment is not good for that particular client base. However, I don\u2019t want to sound defensive. Again, just not a good quarter for us in FIC.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse ","And then you specifically mentioned foreign exchange in your commentary. Can you talk a bit more on what exactly happened in the quarter in that business, and are you able to size the potential facilitation issue and the impact it had on the quarter?","Harvey Schwartz ","In terms of the currency business, obviously it was a business I highlighted, where it was challenging market making conditions and certainly from an inventory perspective. You know, we look at various metrics. ","I mean one metric I could point to, for example, would be the VAR schedule in the earnings release. And as you can see, basically from the first quarter to the second quarter, there was a lot of activity in the franchise, and risk had picked up in foreign exchange, and then you\u2019ll see quarter over quarter it\u2019s a pretty significant drop in the currency line. And that\u2019s virtually all driven by risk reduction.","In terms of the franchise itself, this I will say, we look at a variety of metrics like you would think, all the numbers we can. We look at our own internal numbers, sales activity, where we can get transparency into the market. But there\u2019s nothing in that data that would tell us that when we look at the metrics, client engagement looks consistent with those kind of volumes. So, franchise feels good. We just had a tough quarter.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse ","And then shifting gears to the comp accrual, it\u2019s pretty unusual to see the firm change the accrual in the third quarter. So, I was just hoping to better understand what\u2019s different this year. Is the message that in this still challenged backdrop, your desire is to not fall below a certain return threshold?","Harvey Schwartz ","Well, as always, the comp accrual is based on our best estimate for where we think we\u2019ll end up for the end of the year, but of course we still have a quarter to go. I think as it relates to compensation expense, as we\u2019ve talked about before, it\u2019s obviously the firm\u2019s largest expense, and so this process, no different. This I want to be clear with everyone. No difference in terms of philosophy in the way we\u2019re approaching compensation. ","So it\u2019s still all the same things we go through in terms of the pay for performance culture that we drive, and so we\u2019ll look at all the components, competitive dynamic, performance, as I mentioned. And of course shareholders and ROE and the way we incorporate that in our thinking, that\u2019s always of course an important meaningful component of it.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse ","And finally, with a few more months since the initial proposals have been out, I was hoping you could just update us on your thoughts on supplemental leverage ratio, where the firm may sit today and potential mitigating actions.","Harvey Schwartz ","As I said before, under the U.S. rules, which are proposed, we\u2019re at 5% for the hold co and 6% for the bank. We had time obviously in the quarter to analyze the proposed rule. And again, I caveat this that it\u2019s a proposed rule, will likely change. And of course, it\u2019s not effective until 2018. ","But I think you should assume that that\u2019s a somewhat conservative estimate, the 5% and the 6%, and in terms of mitigating actions, too early for us to really be thinking heavily about mitigating actions. We want to see how the rule evolves. We\u2019ll engage the regulators. ","And the way we incorporate this, for a lack of better language, it will be how we incorporate this into our toolkit will be no different than we do with other regulatory metrics. Just like we talked about at your conference earlier in the year, which is actually rolling out some sample tools has proved to be fortuitous in terms of giving people an example of how we\u2019ll deploy it. But it\u2019s pretty early in the process. We\u2019ll see how it evolves. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI. Please go ahead. ","Glenn Schorr - ISI ","Maybe we could talk about I&L for a second. I wonder if you could provide any update on capital and RWA in I&L, not sure if you feel like breaking out equity versus MES. But I\u2019m thinking down the process of, is there a natural annual runoff rate or realization rate in I&L, and if all that capital generation that you have, if you\u2019re finding opportunities to reinvest it back in? ","Harvey Schwartz ","Really excellent question. We haven\u2019t broken down and disclosed the allocation by those segments in terms of the capital. And I think it\u2019s clear if we think about the capital allocation in terms of sort of the conventional market credit, etc. In terms of the way we\u2019re managing the capital deployment, as you\u2019ve seen, we\u2019ve been in somewhat of a harvesting mode, because that\u2019s what the market opportunity has provided. As we\u2019ve talked about before, we\u2019ve stayed very disciplined in terms of return characteristics. ","As it relates to capital itself, as you know, the investments in funds are deductions from capital under the Basel III ratios. Now, there are transitional provisions, so for example under the transitional provisions, our Basel III capital ratio would be about 100 basis points higher than the 9.8, but I\u2019ve been quoting you the fully loaded. That is the way I would think about it.","Glenn Schorr - ISI ","So from that standpoint, given that the market\u2019s providing you harvest opportunities, but not the same level of investing opportunities, there is a natural runoff. I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth, but the production of the business unit or line item in general has been great, but there should be some natural shrinkage until there\u2019s a reinvestment mode. Is that not a right way to think about it?","Harvey Schwartz ","I would think about it no differently than we\u2019ve approached it in the past, which is there will be cycles when reinvestment opportunities for us and our clients seem more attractive, and there will be parts of the cycle where harvesting is more attractive. We happen to be slightly more in a harvesting cycle. But recently, actually, we\u2019ve seen some good investment opportunities. They tend to be a bit more geographically based, given some of the geographic differences and stress around the world. But that\u2019s no different in terms of philosophy and I think the way to think about how we operate the business.","Glenn Schorr - ISI ","Just shifting gears for a second, you just alluded to Howard\u2019s question a little bit, but just curious, the biggest users of gross balance sheet within FIC, and you guys were early and pushing down Basel III requirements out on to the desk. Is it way early on leverage? I\u2019m just curious on how the leverage focus even is going to start impacting yours and others\u2019 balance sheets.","Harvey Schwartz ","Again, too early to tell in terms of how we\u2019ll incorporate it as an operating metric. But at this stage, based on what we know - again, I want to be really careful about the caveats here, because this is an evolving rule - a couple of things. One, based on what we know about the rule, something that we\u2019ll be able to incorporate again into this toolkit. And separately, remember again, of course, it\u2019s effective in 2018. So in terms of capital planning, given we\u2019re at 5% and 6%, again under the proposal, it could change. Right now, I see it as something that we\u2019ll digest into our processes no differently than other rules have.","Glenn Schorr - ISI ","Last quickie, the Basel III numbers you gave, is that standardized or advanced? What\u2019s the spread between the two?","Harvey Schwartz ","That\u2019s a good question. So, Basel III, again, fully loaded, was 9.8. Standardized is approximately 9.1. So lower than obviously the advanced. And again, referring to the transitional provisions, I\u2019m giving you fully loaded, as though we\u2019re standing many years out into the future. They\u2019re both about 100 basis points higher with the provisions.","Glenn Schorr - ISI ","And just target-wise, we should be thinking of the 7 plus the 2.5, plus a little buffer?","Harvey Schwartz ","Yeah, you know, we\u2019d announced a buffer of 100 basis points and targeting around 9.5. We\u2019re now living with the metric. We\u2019re not too wedded to that particular number. I think the way I would describe it strategically is we want to run with enough capital first and foremost to position the firm defensively. We want to be in an exceptionally strong capital position. ","But also obviously the flipside of that is we really always want to be in a position so we can make capital to our clients. And it\u2019s been an environment, for the last couple of years, which has been trending better, but I wouldn\u2019t call it a first-quartile client opportunity set. And so we\u2019re moving across. And to be clear, it\u2019s 1.5, not 2.5.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Roger Freeman with Barclays. Please go ahead. ","Roger Freeman - Barclays","So I guess coming back to the FICC business, just broadly speaking, and you talk about client activity, client volumes, positioning, and then there\u2019s also sort of the factor of market liquidity, which ties across it too, but your ability to sort of trade around positions. If you kind of think about the impacts broadly on the third quarter, where would you sort of rate those three things? Just trying to think about the balance of the impacts.","Harvey Schwartz ","Well, as I said before, I think from a client activity perspective, when we look at all those metrics, all that looks quite positive. So I don\u2019t think that was an impact at all. Liquidity is always a factor in markets, where you\u2019re in the summer, there\u2019s a fair bit of uncertainty. I wouldn\u2019t overweight it. Again, the shift from the second quarter to the third quarter, we just didn\u2019t execute as well as we would have liked to. ","Roger Freeman - Barclays ","And what\u2019s your sense of how the market environment going forward here, with a whole evening to digest the deal in Washington last night, punting to January, do you think this is a headwind for client risk taking? Or a relief? Or what?","Harvey Schwartz ","Well, certainly a relief. We\u2019ll see how people digest what the events look like coming into the first quarter. But certainly to the extent to which our clients, which are evaluating transactions, whether it\u2019s mergers, debt-equity activity, institutional clients\u2026 ","You know, one good thing about the crisis is it\u2019s made everybody focus on [tail] risk. And even though, as we came into the debt ceiling negotiations, while I think you could have argued maybe the tail risk was maybe quite low, the world and all of our clients are very respective of tail risk. It\u2019s much easier to do nothing than it is to do something. S","o in the short term, got to think having this removed from the marketplace is quite good. The longer term solutions, sort of the continued path back to normalcy, if you will, which I think we\u2019ve been marching along pretty steadily, but it\u2019s been kind of a two or three steps forward, one step back, I think getting to a point where we\u2019re just in a comfortable stride as a global economy, the long term\u2019s quite important, obviously. ","Roger Freeman - Barclays ","And then on I&L, coming back to Glenn\u2019s question, if you think about a future investing cycle, and factoring in the deductions to capital under the new framework, what do you think, and it might be too hard to answer here, but what kind of return hurdles would make that worthwhile? And do you think private equity, like investments, where those firms target 20% plus returns, with that kind of an outlook, is that still viable with the capital holdbacks on this? ","Harvey Schwartz ","There have always been very high requirements to utilize the balance sheet for multiyear capital commitments. And those would be more than enough to be beyond the [unintelligible] of specific capital requirements. So that\u2019s not a concern. So that\u2019s a factor that I\u2019m not worried about. As I said, what we\u2019re really seeing is more of the cyclical back and forth.","But you know, in some respects, and we\u2019ve talked about this before, you either get good new investing opportunities or you get the opportunity to deploy the capital into other businesses, or you can return the capital.","Roger Freeman - Barclays ","On commodities, what does it take, in your mind, to get that business getting, I guess, back to some sort of normalcy? It\u2019s just been challenging for you and others. Can this work inside of a broker-dealer with the capital [unintelligible] rules still to be determined?","Harvey Schwartz ","I would maybe add to your question a little bit. So, the commodity environment has been a little bit difficult. Low volatility and obviously impacted by the macro backdrop. But just to specifically get to your question, the commodity business for us, as you know, we\u2019ve been in the business for 30-plus years. It\u2019s been a central business for our clients. ","The nature of the activity is we\u2019re on the phone with CEOs, CFOs, treasurers. The nature of the business itself, in terms of their objectives, is no different than it would be, for example, for a retailer. It\u2019s about hedging, it\u2019s about managing revenue, it\u2019s about financing activities, timing of cash flows. For example, it\u2019s very akin to receivables financing for a retailer, or managing their expense base for a consumer of commodities. ","Those are all normal corporate treasury functions that we perform now with clients for 30 years. And we\u2019ll see what happens in the regulatory discussion. It\u2019s an important discussion, but it\u2019s not distracting us from the focus on our clients. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","You had a comment that in September you saw a pickup on the investment banking side, and we can clearly see that. I guess just anything on maybe the FICC side, just given the environment in the third quarter, versus what you\u2019re seeing now. There\u2019s still some obviously macro uncertainty, but just any color. I know you guys don\u2019t tend to give too much color in terms of the current quarter, and it\u2019s only a short period of time, but any trends that have been different September and October?","Harvey Schwartz ","Again, you had the July and August normal seasonal slowdown, and then of course you had a pickup in September. But activity from the client base was picking up pretty much really broadly in the early part of September, but then of course people got very focused on the government debate.","So there really wasn\u2019t a chance for people to shift into what I\u2019ll call a mode where they had more conviction. It was still an environment of uncertainty. But I guess if I had to really sort of slice it for you, I\u2019d say certainly there was a seasonal pickup after August, with kind of this backdrop of uncertainty, which fortunately, at least for a while, is behind us this morning.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","And then maybe as we head into next year, and you look at the FICC business, it seems like we\u2019ve kind of gone through this clearing portion in the OTC markets with no big issues. It\u2019s run relatively smoothly. The SEF, it seems like it\u2019s a bigger implementation project for the entire industry. ","If we start looking at February as an important timeline, based on the different scenarios that can play out, meaning they work, they partially work, it\u2019s a complete mess, how do you think it impacts the FICC business heading into 2014 and beyond, and particularly heading into that? Are clients still going to be transacting? Do you think volumes are a bit weak? Just any color on that. ","Harvey Schwartz ","We were, as you know, big supporters of clearing. And I\u2019ll give the market and the regulators really high marks on our clients. A huge amount of work went in by all participants, as you noted, to get clearing off. It was really uneventful, as it should have been, and I think the three stages of client introduction to clearing were quite thoughtful. ","As you pointed out, with kind of the launch of SEF, it was harder. There\u2019s a lot of infrastructure, and it\u2019s complicated for clients, various rule sets. And so it\u2019s going to take a lot of work, from everyone in the industry, regulators, SEF operators, market participants like Goldman Sachs, all of our clients, who have a deep, vested interest in getting this right, to be active in that dialog between now and the spring to really work out all of the issues. ","I don\u2019t think you can read too much into the October launch of Swap Execution Facilities other than there\u2019s a lot of work to do. And I think the regulators were quite thoughtful in pushing out some of the decisions to November 1. Then of course we had the government shutdown, so they haven\u2019t been there to focus on it. But we\u2019re going to all have to pay a lot of attention to this. I don\u2019t think we can, as market participants - and when I say \u201cwe\u201d I don\u2019t mean Goldman Sachs, I mean all of us - we can\u2019t afford to have a total mess. ","I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an option that we should all accept. If it takes longer to get it in place, just like it took longer to get clearing in place, that\u2019s what we should do. It\u2019s just too important for our clients and for the industry. So it will be a big focus over the next couple of months. But there is a lot of work to do. ","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","And then just finally, you guys haven\u2019t said any new, like, ROE or return on tangible equity targets. Obviously there\u2019s still a lot of uncertainty in terms of the rules. When you do look at it in terms of what management, the board wants to generate in terms of return that makes sense, and you\u2019ve been maneuvering, whether it\u2019s on the revenue side, the expense side, comp this quarter, what is still an adequate return between now and when we get clarity? Because obviously once we get clarity then you can make more strategic moves. But just trying to understand, it\u2019s been a fairly long time horizon in terms of we haven\u2019t gotten the rules, and so in this interim, before you can kind of set out that new cross-cycle target, something in the interim?","Harvey Schwartz ","With respect to returns, this is what I would say. Strategically, the way we\u2019re managing the firm is, as we\u2019ve talked about, it\u2019s for the long run. So it\u2019s for the long run positioning. Now, having said that, we\u2019re very sensitive to components of the cycle. And as you point out, this has been a slightly longer cycle. ","So the simplified Cliff\u2019s Notes version of strategy for the firm over the past several years has been 1) extreme focus on the clients globally, 2) to make sure that while maintaining that focus that we\u2019re also managing the cost base, which is why a couple of years ago we announced the multiple series of cost reductions which brought it down roughly $2 billion, and then, along with that, a whole host of efficiency efforts. That\u2019s all been designed to create operating leverage. ","And so we feel like we\u2019re really really well-positioned from an operating leverage perspective. We just need to move back to a market environment that, as I said earlier, is not two or three steps forward, one step back, because that\u2019s really what our clients will need to feel a sense of conviction. And then you get back to more of a run rate.","Now, the rule uncertainty is still pretty significant. And as we digest the rules, we\u2019ll certainly be evaluating them in the context of an overall ROE target. What I would say, because I don\u2019t want you to get off the call without this message, things that are going to be on the balance sheets for multiple years, we are still just as disappointed as we always have been. There\u2019s no change to those return hurdles. And we\u2019re exquisitely focused on that. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. ","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank ","If I could just drill into the equity trading business a little bit. I guess if we ex the reinsurance and DVA both periods it seems like it\u2019s down about 10% year over year. And I realize the base is always tricky, but the three universal banks that have reported so far have been showing up anywhere from 20% to 35%. So any additional color there would be helpful. ","Harvey Schwartz ","There\u2019s ins and outs, as you pointed out, year over year. Last year, of course, we facilitated the Knight transaction, which was obviously a component of revenues last year. And so there\u2019s back and forth, sort of ins and outs. I think when you sum it all up, really what you do is you get to a number that\u2019s more flat.","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank ","And then just on the expense side, as we think about noncomp costs and litigation, just thoughts on those two going forward? ","Harvey Schwartz ","On noncomp, as I said, a big part of the strategy, particularly in this environment, which is very news sensitive from a client activity level, we\u2019re staying very vigilant on noncomp. And just as we have in the past, you obviously would have seen in the earnings release we accrued $142 million for litigation reserve this quarter, $149 million last quarter. We\u2019re evaluating all the normal inputs we would with respect to litigation expense and reserving it quarterly.","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank ","And just lastly, on the comp, and I think you had said this in the prepared remarks, but making some of the adjustments that you normally do in Q4 this quarter, should we think about kind of a more straight line approach in Q4? So if we look at the year to date comp level, about 41%, is that a good starting point as we think about a fourth quarter?","Harvey Schwartz ","We\u2019ll get to compensation in the fourth quarter when we get to it. I more or less went through all the components of how we thought about compensation philosophically, which is no change. So it\u2019s our best estimate, but it also reflects the fact that on a year to date revenue basis, we\u2019re running $500 million ahead. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","A couple of questions. One is just on the comp ratio. I know you talked about it a little bit earlier, but in the past, I know you\u2019ve paid on all revenues. Is that still the same approach you are taking? I just wanted to clarify that, because as was mentioned earlier, the ratio coming down in the third quarter is a little unusual.","Harvey Schwartz ","Yeah, no, I think it\u2019s our lowest accrual for nine months. But it reflects, as it always has, the collection of businesses across the firm. And I won\u2019t bore everybody with all the other components in terms of our processes, but again, it\u2019s our best estimate.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","And then on the FICC, just a little bit of a cleanup question. You indicated the challenging macro-environment obviously. I\u2019m just thinking, from a competitive positioning standpoint, obviously underwriting can tend to be important as to how you are able to generate trading revenues over the course of the quarter. And do you feel like there was any reason that you might have been behind competitors, because you weren\u2019t involved in all of the high-profile deals that were out this quarter?","Harvey Schwartz ","There are certain large transactions, obviously, where we were on one side of a transaction versus others. But that\u2019s going to be in the normal mix of business. And so some quarters we\u2019ll be a big, dominant participant, and other quarters [unintelligible]. But over the cycle, as you know, you\u2019ll see us be involved in most of the significant transactions.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","And then the other question has to do with the SLR. You\u2019ve talked a lot about the [unintelligible] and the Basel common tier one ratio, so I got that. So I\u2019m just wondering, on the SLR side, is that also fully loaded?","Harvey Schwartz ","Well, yes, you should think of it as fully loaded.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","And I know there\u2019s a couple of different ways that you can calculate derivatives. Which way are you guys choosing to do that right now?","Harvey Schwartz ","We\u2019re just following the rules as we understand them. There\u2019s no difference in terms of different alternatives. But we\u2019re happy to discuss it with you more offline.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","Okay. No, I\u2019m just wondering about the CEM approach, or not. I wasn\u2019t sure which one you\u2019re choosing.","Harvey Schwartz ","Sorry, the CEM approach. Earnings [unintelligible] methodology, for anyone on the call who\u2019s not familiar with the shorthand. "," ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer & Company. Please go ahead.","Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Company ","There\u2019s been a lot in the press about how the regulators and the government officials want banks to divest their physical commodities business. There was another article in the Journal this morning. And I wonder if you can talk a little bit about A) how critical is the physical commodities business to the whole of your commodities business and B) if, hypothetically, there were a sale or divestiture of the physical business, does that free up capital above and beyond whatever proceeds you would realize, meaning does the physical commodity business come with meaningful RWAs or other operational risks or charges or things like that?","Harvey Schwartz ","So we haven\u2019t disclosed any specifics around risk-weighted assets or capital associated with physical commodities. The business for us, overly simplified, really splits into two parts. One, there\u2019s investments that we own. And then there\u2019s the franchise, which I talked a bit more about in an earlier question. ","As it relates to investments that we own, they\u2019re on a normal lifecycle where we would intend to hold them for years. As it relates to the commodities franchise, the extent to which we\u2019re involved in the physical business is the extent to which our clients need us to be involved in the physical business because in commodities, which is a bit different from other businesses, obviously, they need to, many times, receive delivery. And so we could be arranged in that. ","Very often, though, under those types of transactions, we are not the holder of title, or may be the holder of title. But it\u2019s important from the standpoint of being able to fulfill those earlier requirements that clients have, hedging, financing, etc. But that\u2019s how I would, very high level, split out the way the physical aspect of our business is part of our strategy, if you will. ","Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Company ","Okay, so it\u2019s important to you?","Harvey Schwartz ","Well, it\u2019s important to our clients, so by extension it\u2019s important to us. Now, we have a long, long investment in the commodity business, and we have, at this stage, no intention of selling our business. We\u2019re very committed to our clients here. And so we\u2019ll just work with the regulators. But ultimately the regulators will come to their own opinion about the business.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead. ","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","Can you size the investment banking backlog? You said it\u2019s the largest in five years.","Harvey Schwartz ","No, we don\u2019t size it, but it\u2019s a pretty significant move up, as I said. I\u2019ll give you a little bit of color. It\u2019s more significant in equity underwriting and in the advisory side of the business.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","And then back to FICC, we\u2019ve heard a lot of reasons why FICC was weak, and you said you\u2019re not happy with it. And I\u2019m still trying to get my arms around it. You said it\u2019s activity, it\u2019s seasonal, it\u2019s Washington, DC, it\u2019s macro. You said for currencies it\u2019s lower VAR and inventory, commodities market making. Credit, it\u2019s volumes. Mortgage, it\u2019s tapering. So let me just ask a real simple question. Do you think the decline in FICC that you\u2019re not happy with is a one-quarter blip, or that some of those factors should continue?","Harvey Schwartz ","It\u2019s just a quarter, Mike. And those factors, obviously, the marketplace has to do with a lot of those factors too, which is why I say we\u2019re not happy with it. But it\u2019s a quarter. We have a very strong FICC franchise, and that\u2019s why I highlighted earlier we react to these things and we\u2019re very data-focused, but when we look into, for example, all the indicators of client activity, it\u2019s just a quarter.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","Well, a follow up to that. Is any of the decline related to how you\u2019re managing the business differently, whether it\u2019s the balance sheet - I know the rules don\u2019t take effect until 2018, but you can take actions now - or the business, due to some regulatory changes, which you\u2019ve talked about, or even how you empower the traders to manage around risk-weighted assets more?","Harvey Schwartz ","No, not that we can see. For example, look at the second quarter and the first quarter. There was no rule implementation or change in management in terms of the way we think about ratios or the proposed supplementary leverage ratio that would have affected the way we run the business - and this is a really important strategic takeaway - on July 1, and the way we\u2019d run it on June 30. Just not a great quarter.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","I know you haven\u2019t disclosed this before, but can you give us some detail on FICC, what are the revenues for currencies, commodities, credit, and mortgage, from the second to the third quarter? ","Harvey Schwartz ","Not beyond what I covered in my opening comments. I highlighted currencies. I think it\u2019s a good example of where we had some challenges. You know, look, year over year I think we have a bigger mortgage business than some other folks, and so you\u2019ll recall last year we were coming into the environment of QE, and so appetite from clients was significantly greater in mortgages. But I more or less covered it in my prepared remarks. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities ","Just wanted to focus a little bit on the inflows you talked about in assets under management, specifically in the $12 billion in fixed income. Can you provide a little more color on what those assets were and sort of your thinking about how that trajectory could continue into the fourth quarter?","Harvey Schwartz ","In terms of those assets, this is a bit of just the result of our strategy, and I want to sound old-fashioned on this, because there\u2019s nothing new here. This is just continued focus on performance. And the fixed income team has done a good job in performance. In terms of flows and broadly speaking where they came from, the flows were diversified. Institutional also from our private wealth franchise, which has had a long, long record now, multiquarter record, of inflows. But really it\u2019s kind of old-fashioned. Nothing new, just performance.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities ","And are the flows generally focused in lower yielding fixed income assets, or slightly higher yielding fixed income assets?","Harvey Schwartz ","It\u2019s a mix. But quite frankly I don\u2019t have that detail with me. I\u2019d be happy to have Dane and Heather follow up with you afterwards. But my recollection is it\u2019s a mix.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities ","And then just secondarily, the quarter end balances for the GCE were down a little bit, and granted maybe I\u2019m making too much of this, but I guess I\u2019m just curious as to why those were down, as you ended the quarter, given that we\u2019ve heard from a number of clients that they were increasing their liquidity as a result of some of the macro issues in DC.","Harvey Schwartz ","If you look at the last two quarters, you\u2019ll see second quarter I think we averaged 180, and then we finished at 183, so there was liquidity building up towards the end of the quarter. In a quiet market environment, you\u2019ll see us generally - not always, of course, but generally - build liquidity. And so you\u2019ll see that the average for the quarter was even higher than the endpoint of June. The average was 187. There were just individual one-off things that utilized liquidity at the end of the quarter as part of our franchise.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities ","And just finally, you talked about this a little bit in terms of the commodity VAR, but overall with the VAR being about $84 million for the quarter, up a little bit quarter over quarter, I guess I\u2019m just curious if the change quarter over quarter was as much due to market volatility, or is that just your positioning within the individual risk categories?","Harvey Schwartz ","It was more due to volatility over the quarter. If you look, for example, in currencies, the decline was, as I mentioned earlier, more related to positions. Same with most of the other businesses. Rates was a little bit the other way, but not much.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. ","Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan","Starting with leverage, I\u2019m more interested in the Basel III proposal leverage, and I was wondering if you could give us also some indication how your leverage ratio would look like under the Basel III proposal which came out recently. ","Harvey Schwartz ","It\u2019s just a proposal, so we\u2019re in the proposal phase on that.","Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan ","What are the issues that you see as nonworkable or, let\u2019s put it differently, in terms of concerns within the Basel III proposal relative to what you see from the U.S. proposal?","Harvey Schwartz ","I wouldn\u2019t want to draw a lot of distinctions between the two proposals. There are certain things that the industry broadly, and obviously you can check, we submitted a letter. I would say collateral for one, the treatment of collateral. I think at the highest level, we like metrics, and I think a leverage ratio can play a valuable role in a suite of metrics. I just think, like all metrics collectively, whether it\u2019s the U.S. rule or the Basel III proposal, I think we all, as market participants, always need to be focused on any unintended consequences. ","So the things that we\u2019re most focused on are things like liquidity pools and how they\u2019re incorporated into metrics. Because we just generally don\u2019t think people should be incented to hold liquidity at the regulatory minimums. And that might not happen tomorrow, but these rules will be in place for a very, very long time, and so we need to incorporate them that way. But as I said, collateral will be one thing that we would be focused on on the Basel III. ","Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan ","And credit derivative notional hedging, is that something where you feel quite comfortable with the Basel III guidelines and the proposal that you could meet a lot of [netting], or do you think that\u2019s something that you would have to change the way you hedge your positions in order to justify the netting under the proposal. ","Harvey Schwartz ","It\u2019s very early to be thinking about responding to these. So, again, let\u2019s start high-level. So, getting gross notional down, it\u2019s a good thing. It\u2019s clean living. Gross notionals certainly can create risk, but not risk in the sense of the way that we think about market risk, and I\u2019m not talking about the market risk in an RWA sense. I\u2019m talking about risk in the marketplace.","I think that the focus on gross notionals is an important one, but I think, again, this is difficult, but I think what you would see the industry do is get very focused on collapsing gross notionals. To date, when the industry comes together to focus on gross notionals, obviously everyone\u2019s focused on the economics. I think you could see people be more open to the economic cost of shrinking gross notionals. But all this is included in our letter.","Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan ","Moving towards the results, just I wanted to come back to FICC. If I look at the percentage decline that some of your peers have shown so far in this quarter, and as I even make an adjustment additionally considering you may be slightly more impacted due to your being more over credit [unintelligible], I calculate that the potential inventory FX impact could be around $500 million in terms of impacting your results. I\u2019m just trying to understand the material decline here in your FICC results, and I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s something that I\u2019m doing incorrectly, looking at it from this perspective of looking at [peer seasonality] giving you slightly more of a decline due to your mix, and then assuming the rest is FX inventory related.","Harvey Schwartz ","I think it\u2019s a little complicated to compare, in an individual quarter, if we\u2019re down a certain percentage and our competitors are down a certain perspective and really take a lot of information away from that. Now, obviously it\u2019s important, but I think trying to draw conclusions on the math is harder, so I don\u2019t know that I can give you any more information as we talked about. I think to sum it up we had a tougher quarter. By the way, we will have quarters where we will have outperformance, and we will have tough quarters. This will be a tough one.","Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan ","But why would you have FX inventory in the first place, a very liquid market. I understand you run your FX with your EM business together. Just trying to understand what are the positions that would hold inventory on behalf of clients.","Harvey Schwartz ","As you would perfectly understand, I\u2019m not going to get into the details about specific positions. But as I said, you can see it in the VAR profile, the derisking, but I can\u2019t give you any more color than that.","Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan ","Last question on this, then. Are the positions that you had in the inventory actually sold, or are they hedged?","Harvey Schwartz ","I think you\u2019re misunderstanding my message at this point. There are no core positions that are something that are a significant concern. It sounded like that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking. I won\u2019t talk about how we manage the risk.","Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan ","Yes, that\u2019s what I\u2019m more interested in, if you still have some notional on the books, or you actually sold the notional. ","","Harvey Schwartz ","No, I didn\u2019t answer the question, actually.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Douglas Sipkin with Susquehanna. Please go ahead. ","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group","I just wanted to follow up a little bit, drilling down on the [iBank] pipeline. Just given the commentary around the trading environment and uncertainty, I\u2019m just trying to reconcile that with the five-year record pipeline, which would require CEO confidence to do things with M&A and equity. So maybe you can sort of relate the two back. While it\u2019s great, it just seems like it\u2019s abnormally high for the environment that we\u2019re in to have such a high pipeline. What exactly are you guys seeing? What\u2019s happening that it\u2019s so big, given the uncertain environment that we\u2019re in?","Harvey Schwartz ","It\u2019s a great question. As you know, the dialog around M&A activity and financing activity, but M&A activity in particular, it\u2019s a very very long lifecycle dialog. And if we had one of our merger bankers in the room, very often, in a particular transaction, not just a client, but the particular transaction could be under discussion for multiple years. In an environment with very high uncertainty, which is a low-conviction environment, obviously, then transactions tend to get delayed. ","So it\u2019s not one of these things that turns on or off like a light switch. So nobody blows the all clear whistle. But I would say there\u2019s certainly a desire in the corporate base to produce growth, and when they see strong underlying synergies, people will take action, but they need a backdrop in which they feel comfortable executing. And as I said, the trend in terms of the backdrop, regardless of the fact that this quarter there might have been a step back in terms of confidence and an increase in uncertainty, the trend is positive. But this is a multiyear phenomenon, obviously. ","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group ","Shifting gears, maybe you could just spend a little bit more on the asset management business. Maybe big picture, just from my vantage point, it seems like you guys are doing a little bit more to buy, build, etc. there. Do you guys have any long term targets as to how big you want that business to be relative to the whole organization? Obviously it\u2019s a capital light business. I know you guys have done some smaller acquisitions here recently. So any color on strategic steps you guys are taking there that are different from maybe three, five years ago? ","Harvey Schwartz ","Well, the focus has been very intense for several years. But as I said before, it\u2019s a bit old-fashioned. The primary focus is performance, and with performance we know we will build assets. We\u2019ll look, from time to time, at acquisitions, if we think they make strategic sense and it fits our business, and it\u2019s additive to our clients and to our performance. But as I said, we\u2019re very pleased with the results in the growth, but we\u2019re relying on something that\u2019s a little bit old-fashioned. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC. Please go ahead. ","Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets","I just had a follow up question on the Basel III all-in look through number, I think the 9.8 versus the 9.3. Could you talk us through, it looks to me like the deductions have gone down, because obviously you\u2019ve got buybacks offsetting profit or more than offsetting profit. And I think the [unintelligible] you said were down $10 billion. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong. But is there something going on in deductions? Or something else?","Harvey Schwartz ","You\u2019ll recall at the end of the second quarter obviously we got the finalized rule. One of the things about that rule, obviously, is there\u2019s the financial institutions deduction. What you\u2019re really seeing is a reduction in a component of that risk, which isn\u2019t a deduction from capital, as you know. And we\u2019ve talked about this before. The fact that our teams have both the tools and the ability to manage the balance sheets, what you\u2019re seeing now that we\u2019ve seen the finalized rule is you\u2019re seeing them take actions that affect the ratio. So, for example, selling certain cash assets. ","Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets ","So it\u2019s not private equity deductions, per se, it\u2019s the other deductions?","Harvey Schwartz ","No. You\u2019re bringing up the subtlety of the significant versus the nonsignificant. And for anyone else on the call who\u2019s less fluent in this minutiae, I\u2019m happy to set up some follow up time with Dane and the team. The significant deductions obviously they will come with harvesting over time. Because we\u2019re in the funds with our clients.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","Just a question on the investing and lending, the equity side. So the language that you used in the press release and I think you also said in your prepared remarks sort of made a distinction between corporate performance and company specific events. Could we generally think in our mind that the corporate performance ones are probably marks to a model, and then the company-specific events are more going to be either realized gains or marks to a market value that\u2019s visible?","Harvey Schwartz ","What I was referring to in the opening remarks, obviously, is public market equities versus private equities. And we\u2019re very rigorous, as you know, in our mark-to-market policies. So we incorporate all variables. I\u2019ll list a few. Obviously specific performance of the asset, which we have visibility into, and the market environment and pending events. So if, for example, we think an asset is going to go public in the next quarter, potentially, that\u2019s the strategic plan for the enterprise, or a subsequent quarter, if that\u2019s there, then we\u2019ll have other valuation techniques, which we\u2019re in receipt of, obviously. But it\u2019s a very rigorous process, as you know. "," ","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","Oh, yeah. I don\u2019t doubt that at all. Is there any color that you can give us on the gains that you recognized in the quarter, how much of that was actually a realized gain versus some element of a mark?","Harvey Schwartz ","Well, it\u2019s all fair value, right? So I think if you\u2019re asking about specific monetizations, no, I haven\u2019t delineated that. But we\u2019re marking the balance sheet every day, as [unintelligible] is realized.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","Let me move on to the SLR. You\u2019re right, if the [unintelligible]\u2019s off, and you\u2019re already basically compliant, as you said. So you\u2019re not going to rush to do mitigation things. But you also had commented on the fact that compression and reduction of notionals was probably a healthy thing. So I\u2019m wondering to what extent you\u2019re engaged in more compression, more maybe looking to redocument existing transactions that are long term in nature into central clearing so you can get rid of the CVA drag on the denominator, the leverage ratio, things like that.","Harvey Schwartz ","So again, just from a risk management perspective, we\u2019ve always been very engaged in trying to reduce gross notionals. As I said, it\u2019s just a good way to run the business. Now, because of the developing rule sets, the whole marketplace is more engaged, and we\u2019re very engaged. And that\u2019s not to imply people weren\u2019t as engaged as we are. ","The nuance I was trying to explain earlier was that people historically, over many, many years, everyone likes to reduce gross notionals, but sometimes couldn\u2019t agree on cost. Now, there\u2019s just a greater forcing function, so there\u2019s more of a tailwind to everybody reducing gross notionals. ","Now, again, this is a little bit of the process of, I think, how we certainly - I suspect the rest of the industry - the leverage ratio, what it encourages you to do is to basically rank the exposures basically from a return on asset perspective, start with low ones, and mitigate from there. And this would be high on the list for the whole industry, I assume. ","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","So I guess that I could interpret your remarks to mean that you probably are spending quite a bit more time and hopefully getting more resolutions when you\u2019re sitting across a table from a counterparty who\u2019s another dealer and getting these notionals down and maybe moving some of these elongated transactions, as I said, into a central clearing environment? Or does that not really work that well?","Harvey Schwartz ","That\u2019s a correct assessment, but it\u2019s just started. We just started, and the industry just started, so it\u2019s early going. But the answer is yes.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","Fair enough. Like I said, I was just trying to get a sense for the direction of travel in that. And then just a final question on the intersection of the I&L business and the comp ratio reduction. I know you\u2019ve generally had this policy of straight lining it for three quarters, but isn\u2019t it economically logical to conclude that the reason that the ratio came down as much as it did is just the degree to which your profit mix this quarter was driven by investing and lending activities that really have inherently a very low compensation ratio?","Harvey Schwartz ","Again, no change in philosophy. I want to be really clear with everyone. It\u2019s our best estimate. It reflects the collective contribution of all businesses, certainly not an individual business segment. And we have reduced before in the third quarter. So it\u2019s not completely out of sync would have what we\u2019ve done historically, but it does reflect all these things I talked about earlier, the fact that we\u2019re running $500 million ahead, we have more visibility into year-end - which is another way of saying best estimate. We have more visibility into year-end, and of course the cost reduction efforts give us flexibility.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. ","Brennan Hawken - UBS ","Just a quick one, at this point, and it\u2019s again on comp. Sorry. I hate to beat a dead horse, but just kind of want to take a slightly different angle on this. During earnings here we\u2019ve seen another dominant fixed franchise cut their comp ratio kind of materially this quarter too. And obviously you can\u2019t speak to the actions of a competitor, but in your view, is it appropriate to assume that as an industry we are maybe rationalizing FICC to a new regulatory and business environment through these actions?","Harvey Schwartz ","I have, as you know, zero visibility. You\u2019d have a lot more visibility in your engagement with our competitors than I would. Not to wax on and make the call long, but I remember the first day I showed up at Goldman Sachs. One of the first things I was taught and mentored was that compensation was first and foremost how the firm did, then how your division did, then how your business unit did, and then how you did as an individual. ","We haven\u2019t changed any of that. If anything, we\u2019re protective of that cultural mantra, and I hope that every new summer hire that we brought in this year, I hope they got the same lecture I had back then. So, again, it\u2019s the same culture, and you\u2019re just seeing it based on performance. And when I say performance, everything: the year to date run rate being ahead in revenues, and also all the multiyear efficiency efforts we\u2019ve built in. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Christopher Wheeler with Mediobanca. Please go ahead. ","Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca ","A couple of related questions. The first one really just touches on what the last gentleman said, because I suppose you\u2019ve been very, very honest about how difficult the quarter was for fixed income. But I guess we\u2019ve seen so many headwinds build up around fixed income since the crisis, and then during the summer we obviously saw the possible issues around tapering, which will come, of course, not just in the United States but elsewhere, where a lot of liquidity will come out of the market, interest rates go up. ","And you guys have tended to be at the cutting edge of thinking through these issues, as you were post-crisis. And I suppose what I\u2019m interested in, and maybe compensation is one of the issues, but what else are you thinking about in terms of that withdrawal of liquidity, which may mean that if you want a market where fixed income revenues are not going to be anywhere near as robust as they were even in the post-crisis period, when you were having to deal with Basel III and the other capital issues?","And I guess relating to that, perhaps linked to it, the 10.4% return on equity, I know you\u2019re not happy with that. You talked about the legacy assets. You\u2019ve always talked about when the markets pick up you will really perform very strongly, because of your clear strengths in the market. But I suppose when I look at some of your diversified competitors in the investment banking space, they are already moving towards the mid-teens. ","And I\u2019m just wondering again, given that you\u2019re normally at the front edge of these things, at what point do you start looking at the business model and enhancing it by looking to broaden it rather than actually perhaps narrow it, as you had to do with Dodd-Frank etc.? ","Harvey Schwartz ","Okay, that\u2019s a big question. So, in terms of fixed income, we don\u2019t really try and predict what happens in terms of the market reaction. And what I mean by predict, I mean over a multiyear period - and let\u2019s just say we go into a period of rising interest rates - a lot of what will determine the size of the market for fixed income - when I say that, I mean the activity levels for us and all of our competitors - won\u2019t be the absolute level of rates, it will be the backup of the environment. And so, again, an environment where it isn\u2019t so news-sensitive, and clients were high conviction, low conviction, and very nervous, is a much better environment for our clients, which, by the way, translates generally to better volumes in the marketplace and better liquidity for everyone.","The best case history is really the equity business, which as you know went through a massive transformation from the late 90s to today, as an industry, and yet revenues continued to grow. So our responsibility to our clients and in running the business is how we adapt. ","So in the past we\u2019ve been good adapters, and we just have to continue to adapt. But the cornerstone of adapting will be the interface with the clients and making sure that we deliver to them. As we\u2019ve done in the past, we just need to continue doing it. But the changing interest rate environment, that will determine strategy over a multiyear period. ","As it relates to returns, look, we strive every day to ensure that we have the highest absolute returns while managing the firm conservatively. And we really want to make sure we have the highest relative returns. For us, this has been a good relative return environment. We\u2019d love to see better absolute returns, but it\u2019s been a pretty strong relative environment.","Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca ","We just talked about rising rates on taper, but [unintelligible] liquidity as well, which I think was one of the great fears that we\u2019ve just seen, and that does suggest the need to realign the business. And I think what you\u2019re saying is that you\u2019ll just keep an eye on that. You have no plans at the moment to do that in respect to something that hasn\u2019t actually started, albeit it will keep going for a long time, once tapering starts.","Harvey Schwartz ","What\u2019s critical about certain changes, or whether or not they change what clients need first, and then how it impacts market structure. I don\u2019t see anything in a rising rate environment that changes market structure. What will change is how clients view the marketplace. Again, if it\u2019s a high confidence, we\u2019re back to more certain economic growth, several years from now, and interest rates are higher, that could be a very positive environment for fixed income investors. But it might not be. All I know is we\u2019ll have to adapt and make sure we respond to it better than our competitors.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. ","Devin Ryan - JMP Securities","With respect to maybe some of the positive secondary impacts of regulation, could you maybe update us on which businesses you feel like you\u2019ve been gaining some market share in, and maybe where you\u2019re seeing some opportunities as competitors are just reevaluating their strategies or how they\u2019re allocating resources?","Harvey Schwartz ","I think it\u2019s too early to see that. Obviously earlier in the year and continuing we\u2019ve seen some pullback from some competitors. I think that\u2019s a multiyear phenomenon as it relates to to impact of regulation. And so we\u2019ll see that again over time. That will be a big part about this operating flexibility that I was talking about earlier. ","The real differentiating characteristics firm by firm - and we all will live with the same rules, we\u2019ll have all the same resources - is which firm can better deliver to their clients and which firm can better adapt. And I\u2019ve talked about this a lot. Adapting too early can be a mistake, and adapting too late can be a mistake, and so we\u2019ll be watching it very, very closely and doing everything we can to deliver to our clients. ","Devin Ryan - JMP Securities ","And then just lastly, not to beat a dead horse on FICC, but we have seen some flows out of bond funds in recent months, and understand they\u2019re small in the absolute, but just given your exposure to institutional asset managers, as you mentioned, did you see any change in client behavior in the quarter or anything that maybe was a little bit concerning just with some of the outflows out of bond funds?","Harvey Schwartz ","It\u2019s been a while now, but obviously I grew up in that business, and I co-headed it before my current responsibilities. I think what clients did is just normal client risk management. Maybe a little different than what you would have seen pre-crisis, because people are just very, very sensitive to potential tail risk. Quite frankly I think it\u2019s a good thing for the marketplace, not a bad thing. But no, I think all the behavior was very predictable.","Operator","And at this time, there are no further questions. Please go ahead with any closing remarks.","Harvey Schwartz ","I just want to thank you for joining today. Look forward to seeing all of you in the upcoming months. And again, if you have any follow up questions, please reach out to Dane, Heather, and the team. And otherwise, see you in January. Thanks again. "],"10085":["The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

My name is Dennis, and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call.","This call is being recorded today, April 19, 2016.","Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.","Dane E. Holmes - Head-Investor Relations","Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call.","Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm's belief regarding future events that, by their nature are uncertain and outside of the firm's control. The firm's actual results and financial conditions may differ possibly materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see the description of Risk Factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2015.","I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets and supplementary leverage ratio. You should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that's posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com.","This audiocast is copyrighted material to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent.","Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, will now review the firm's results. Harvey?","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through the first quarter results and I'm happy to answer any questions.","Net revenues were $6.3 billion; net earnings, $1.1 billion, and earnings per diluted share, $2.68. Net earnings to common included a $161 million benefit related to the successful tender of our APEX securities. The tender added $0.36 per diluted share.","The first quarter of 2016 was challenging. It started with renewed uncertainty about the global economic outlook, with the possibility of a recession even being raised. These concerns included growth prospects from China, plummeting oil prices, a strengthening U.S. dollar, and multiple geopolitical events, to name a few. All these came into focus during an eventful first quarter.","These concerns translated into significant price pressure at the beginning of the quarter across both equity and fixed income markets. The Dow declined by 6% in the first week. This is the worst start in its nearly 90-year history. The index ultimately reached its low point in mid-February, declining 10%. Equity markets in other geographies endured even more material declines during the quarter, with the Shanghai down as much as 25% and the Nikkei down as much as 21%. Credit spreads also widened significantly intra-quarter, particularly for high yield and energy-related issuers.","Global Central Bank activity was front and center again during the quarter. After raising rates in December for the first time in more than nine years, the market heavily debated the Federal Reserve's future actions. In the eurozone, the European Central Bank took additional stimulus measures well beyond what was initially expected by the market. And finally, the Bank of Japan moved interest rates into negative territory.","With all these factors at work, it isn't surprising that it resulted in a difficult operating environment for our clients and, by extension, constrained opportunities in each of our business segments. Within Investment Banking, for example, industry-wide equity underwriting volumes declined by 57% year-over-year.","Performance was challenged for many of our ICS clients. For example, nearly 80% of the largest active U.S. equity mutual funds underperformed their benchmarks in the quarter. As you would expect with markets flat-to-down worldwide, our equity investing business was negatively impacted. And finally, incentive fees declined during the quarter due to limited harvesting opportunities.","With that as a backdrop, let's now discuss individual business performance in greater detail. Investment Banking produced first quarter net revenues of $1.5 billion, 5% lower than the fourth quarter as we saw lower client activity across M&A and equity underwriting. Our Investment Banking backlog decreased since the end of the year but is still up relative to a year ago.","Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the first quarter, Advisory revenues were $771 million. 12% decline relative to the fourth quarter reflects a decrease in the number of completed M&A transactions. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced M&A.","We advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the first quarter, including Syngenta's $43.6 billion cash tender offer from ChemChina; Valspar's $11.3 billion acquisition by Sherwin-Williams; and ADT's $12 billion acquisition by Apollo.","We also advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the first quarter, including BG Group's \u00a347 billion acquisition by Royal Dutch Shell; BT Group's\u00a312.5 billion acquisition of EE Limited; and PETCO Animal Supplies' $4.6 billion sale to a consortium of investors.","Moving to Underwriting, net revenues were $692 million in the first quarter, up 4% sequentially as a pickup in debt underwriting more than offset a slowdown in equity issuance. Equity underwriting revenues were $183 million. This was down significantly compared to the fourth quarter due to a decrease in offerings industry-wide. Debt underwriting revenues were up 16% to $509 million and benefited from strong investment-grade issuance.","During the first quarter, we actively supported our clients' financing needs, participating in Newell Rubbermaid's $8 billion financing to support its acquisition of Jarden, Vista's $4 billion loan and bond offering to support its acquisition of Solera, and Devon Energy's $1.5 billion follow-on offering.","Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and Equities businesses, net revenues were $3.4 billion in the first quarter, up 20% compared to the fourth quarter. In the quarter, we early-adopted the new accounting standard for DVA, which is now captured in other comprehensive income. DVA for the current quarter was immaterial. FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.7 billion in the first quarter, up 48% sequentially, as client activity improved in many businesses from weak fourth quarter levels.","As I mentioned, the operating environment across the FICC complex was quite difficult due to macro uncertainty and volatile markets. This led to a challenging backdrop for our clients with weak investment performance and drove difficult market-making conditions for the firm. The environment in the first quarter of 2016 stands in stark contrast to the environment in the first quarter of last year. Consequently, there was a substantial downward revenue pressure year-over-year.","Interest rates and currencies were significantly lower. Client activity and interest rates held up relatively well. However, activity within currencies declined compared to a strong first quarter of last year.","Credit also decreased significantly as market conditions remained difficult, particularly in Europe. Commodities was weaker as client activity was muted with energy prices remaining low. Mortgages continue to be challenged as spreads widened for some products and client activity remained low.","In Equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees, and security services, net revenues for the first quarter were $1.8 billion, up 1% sequentially. First quarter results in Equities were roughly consistent with the back half of last year but significantly weaker compared to a robust performance in the first quarter of 2015. Net revenues declined 23% year-over-year and reflected the impact of a challenging environment for our clients and the firm.","Equities client execution net revenues of $470 million were down significantly year-over-year. Higher volatility and global equity market weakness at the beginning of the quarter impacted investor conviction and risk appetite.","Commissions and fees were $878 million, up 9% year-over-year as client activity increased in our lower touch electronic channels. Security services generated net revenues of $432 million, up 10% year-over-year on improved spreads.","Turning to risk, average daily VaR in the first quarter was $72 million, up slightly from $71 million in the fourth quarter.","Moving on to our Investing & Lending activities, collectively, these businesses produced net revenues of $87 million in the first quarter. In equity securities, markdowns on public investments entirely offset net revenues in private investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $87 million. Revenues were driven by net interest income. This was partially offset by increased provisions on our corporate energy exposures.","In Investment Management, we reported first quarter net revenues of $1.3 billion. This was down 13% from the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of lower incentive fees and management and other fees. During the quarter, management and other fees were down 6% sequentially to $1.2 billion due to a change in the mix of client assets and strategies.","Assets under supervision increased $35 billion sequentially to a record $1.29 trillion, primarily due to net inflows into liquidity and long-term fee-based products. We had $16 billion of net inflows into liquidity products, $10 billion of long-term net inflows, primarily driven by fixed income and equity products, and $9 billion of market appreciation.","Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior-year equity awards and other items such as benefits, declined by 40% versus the first quarter of 2015. The significant reduction in compensation and benefits expense reflects the more challenging revenue environment and translated into a compensation to net revenues ratio of 42%.","First quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.1 billion, significantly lower than the fourth quarter and 6% lower than the first quarter of 2015. This is the lowest quarterly level since the second quarter of 2009.","Now I'd like to take you through a few key statistics for the first quarter. Total staff was approximately 36,500, down 1% from year-end 2015. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 28%. Our global core liquid assets ended the first quarter at $196 billion and our balance sheet and level 3 assets were $878 billion and $24 billion, respectively. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.2% under the Basel III Advanced approach. It was 13.4% using the Standardized approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 6%. And finally, we repurchased 10 million shares of common stock for $1.55 billion in the quarter.","In conclusion, the first quarter was obviously a difficult period for our clients, the markets and our opportunity set. While clearly we don't control the opportunity set, we proactively took action in key areas that we do control: our cost structure and our capital. In addition, this is the first quarter in a while that we faced significant headwinds across each of our business segments. Given that we operate in a cyclical industry, it shouldn't be surprising that there will be difficult quarters.","That being said, we don't create deep client relationships in a quarter, we don't hire our people for a quarter, and we certainly don't build businesses for a quarter. Our success has been predicated on having a strong culture that promotes both a long-term perspective, while simultaneously being very focused on managing to the current environment. That long-term focus has been the foundation for building a leading global investment bank and creating superior results for our shareholders.","As we look forward, we are committed to remaining nimble and efficient operators, disciplined capital allocators and prudent risk managers. Our commitment to these principles has been and will continue to be the basis for our performance over time.","Thanks again for dialing in, and I'm happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Please limit yourself to one question and to one follow-up question. Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI","Hi. Thanks very much.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, good morning, Glenn.","Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI","Good morning. Maybe we could talk about Fixed Income first. I'm just looking big picture. Revenue is a little more than half the big banks and that was obviously not always the case. I'm just curious, are there specific things about your business mix and client mix that doesn't compare as much versus the past in activity levels, things like credit being real slow right now? And if you feel like any of the balance sheet reductions or Volcker implementation has impacted the forward earnings power?","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Obviously, I don't have great transparency into the competitors' footprints. I don't think that any of the things you mentioned, sort of the balance sheet actions we've taken because they've been very surgical \u2013 although meaningful they've been very surgical over time and very thoughtfully executed. I don't think those are issues and, obviously, all firms have adjusted to Volcker. So, I don't think those are drivers. I think when you look at the year-over-year, obviously, we had a very strong first quarter 2015 relative to the peer set. And I know revenue is the most transparent benchmark you have. But when you look at the performance in the first quarter, obviously we outperformed in the first quarter of last year and obviously much more challenging for us this quarter.","Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI","Yeah, totally fair. Okay. Maybe if we switch over to Investing & Lending. I want to focus on the equity side specifically. In some markets, you had the markets go down and then come back. Asia didn't snap back. So, I wonder if you could talk about the contribution of that in the quarter. And then, more importantly, for the equity dynamic going forward, like maybe size the portfolio fair value versus cost basis, see if there are any marks in the quarter that, knock on wood don't repeat next quarter? And then just see if you can update us on what's left to sell down to get compliant?","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, okay, that's a multipart question. So if I miss anything, get back.","Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI","All right.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, it's fine. So in terms of the I&L balance sheet, let's just start there. The I&L balance sheet is $99 billion. Of that, in terms of \u2013 you spoke about equity, roughly $15 billion of that is corporate equity. In terms of the equity line, both private and public, basically the public portfolio was down roughly $140 million during the quarter and that was offset by private marks. Of those marks that were positive, they were virtually all event-related. And you remember, that's the language you use, Glenn, to describe the fact that there's a sale or a refinancing and then there were negative marks in the portfolio obviously also. So that's really the structure in terms of the course of the quarter. In terms of Volcker, because I think you're asking about the equity funds?","Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI","Yes. Correct.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, in terms of Volcker, basically if we start at the top of, let's just say the waterfall, there's $7.5 billion in covered funds. You then have to take out approved Volcker activities. Then you take out the public money. And the way we've asked you to look at it is there's roughly $4.5 billion remaining. And that money obviously sits alongside our clients in these funds. Is there anything else you asked that I missed?","Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI","No, that's perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning, Harvey.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning, Christian.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So you mentioned a mix shift in asset management impacting revenues. Can you give a bit more color on this and if you expect it to reverse going forward?","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year as we work through, obviously, there are various client segments we work with, whether they're retail clients, private wealth, also institutional clients. And what we're really seeing is a mix shift more to institutional mandates during the period. That had an impact. I think longer term, obviously, I can't predict the longer term. We're looking to basically provide service to all those clients as best we can through long, long cycles. But you're seeing obviously the positive inflows which are quite good. So if you ask me to think of the future, I would point more to the flows than the asset mix.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, thank you. And then on the GE deposits that you got in, just curious how we should think about what kind of economics you can earn on that and any time line for deployment?","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So the transaction closed on Friday. It went quite smoothly. We're up and running under the GS moniker. I would encourage you to think of this really as we've described it, which is, this is all part of our funding diversification. In that sense, we always, as you know, look to have a diversified funding base. This is just an extra toolkit for us in the financing and so we'll view it over time. But in terms of driving revenues, it's really part of our liability management strategy.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, helpful. And then a very quick modeling question for me. Tax rate was a bit lower in the quarter. Just curious how we should think about the go-forward tax rate?","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So in terms of the go-forward, I guess if I was to give you a best estimate, I'd say something similar to last year.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, great. Thank you very much, Harvey.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Christian.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks a lot.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Mike.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Harvey, maybe first just on the revenue backdrop, I just wanted to get your sense when you look at the January\/February trends versus, say, March\/April, maybe areas where you're starting to the see some improving trends. I know in any given quarter it's kind of tough on, I think, the market share standpoint, but I feel like when revenues are weak you can't really tell market share and then when revenues rebound, you can figure out who gained and who lost. But just given some of the competitive dynamics, just wanted to get a sense if you're starting to see any of that in terms of the market share?","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, I just want to make sure understand \u2013 I answer your question completely. In terms of the quarter, the way I would describe it is March was better than February and February was better than January. It's early in April, so it's obviously pretty early in the quarter, but I would say that it really feels like many of the factors that were impacting the market in the first quarter, particularly early on, seem to have abated and although the market feels a little fragile from all that, it feels like \u2013 for the most part, that feels like that's behind us. But we'll see how the year progresses.","In terms of the longer-term observation around the competitive dynamic, again, in a quarter like this, hard to see it when our clients are experiencing such volatility and such stress, but I think based on announcements and parts of the business where we're seeing client flows move, engagement with clients is quite good and we're getting good feedback. So I think a quarter like we just had actually only makes the competitor forward look better, but we'll see.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, that's helpful. And then just on, I guess, I&L and Investment Management, obviously I&L had some pressure and then Investment Management, just like the performance fees were weaker than expected. When you look at what has happened through the quarter and the rebound in the markets, I'm trying to just gauge on the parts of the business that are as simple as markets are up and so you should start to see some improving trends versus maybe on like the I&L, you mentioned the provision on the debt side. So how significant or how much follow through are we going to see that could maybe weigh on that part of the business? And same thing on the incentive fees or the performance fees in Investment Management. I don't know if there's a way to gauge the types of products that generate the performance fees, how much are absolute versus relative or what products are below hurdles?","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, so as it relates to I&L, just to level set everyone, obviously we created that disclosure to provide more transparency, and that is, as you described it, the most price-sensitive asset parts of the balance sheet. And so that's why I provide it that way. So, as I mentioned, for example, there are parts of the portfolio, as you know, that are public equity securities where, again, we may sit alongside our clients. As those are monetized out of a fund, there are restrictions and lockup periods. And so that portfolio, as I mentioned, was negative roughly $140 million during the course of the quarter.","And so there will be some element idiosyncratic movement. Sometimes that portfolio will outperform. When you look at history, it has generally outperformed. Even if you take the last eight quarters including this quarter, the entire I&L segment has generated $11 billion in revenues. In terms of incentive fees, it's going to be specific, obviously, to performance, which has been solid, but obviously markets are going to have an influence on incentive fees also.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning, Matt.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Can you hear me?","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Matt, are you there?","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yep. Can you hear me?","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. We can hear you now.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Sorry about that. Just a big picture question. Can you just talk a bit about the disconnect between the markets, the improvement that we're seeing there and what still feels like sluggish client activity, maybe better than January\/February, but here's the S&P up a couple percent year-to-date, credit spreads have tightened. I guess the question is, like, is it a timing issue where we need more stability for activity to pick up in a bigger way, or is it the underlying economy's not strong enough? Just any big picture thoughts you have on that disconnect?","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So something that I think you're certainly seeing a pickup \u2013 if you look at IPOs, I think there were something in the first couple weeks of April approaching 40 IPOs during the first couple weeks. So certainly elements of the marketplace which obviously slowed down very specifically. But I think after a tough first quarter like the whole market has experienced, I think that there may be a slow reaction function in terms of how various market participants engage the marketplace. But it feels like, as I said before, the most significant factors impacting the first quarter seem to have abated, at least for now.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just kind of on an incremental basis, like where do you feel like the engagement \u2013 you mentioned the IPOs picking up, but I guess a timeline? Usually you see trading pick up first and then M&A tends to lag, or what do you think we see beyond IPOs in terms of areas that start to pick up first, assuming we get a pickup in activity?","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think generally I would agree with your statement over very long periods of time, but I think in terms of the M&A cycle that we're in now, while off a little bit from the levels of 2015, the level of dialogue there feels quite good. As I mentioned, our backlog across advisory, equity and debt is up year-over-year after a strong year. So the dialogue and level of engagement feels quite good at this stage. Certainly there was an element to the first quarter which had a bit of a chilling effect for a period, but right now the dialogue feels good. We'll see how it goes in the future.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just separately on expenses, obviously good cost control in a tough revenue quarter. You did mention about continuing to manage to a difficult revenue environment if that continues, but maybe just expand on that? We've seen some things in the media about further cost cuts coming. So, anything you can elaborate on the cost side would be helpful.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So obviously we're \u2013 look, we always have our eye on ways we can look to operate more efficiently. We've talked about it a lot, that this is a performance-driven culture, and the performance wasn't great in the first quarter and as a result you saw compensation and benefits expense down 40% year-over-year. Again, that's our culture, and so you're going to see those adjustments.","In terms of other cost initiatives, I know there's been a lot of stuff in the press. I guess I would really summarize it as follows. I would just say we're shareholders and we're doing things that you would expect shareholders to do.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. All right. Fair enough. Thank you.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Mike.","Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi. The CEO letter talks about secular changes versus cyclical changes and you guys have been steadfast saying that the markets are simply in a cyclical lull, they'll recover. They haven't recovered but you've kept your infrastructure. So at what point do you say maybe these cyclical lulls are more permanent and you need to take more dramatic actions? And it looks like year-over-year your trading is the worst among the five big U.S. wholesale banks.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So I think I just want to clarify one thing. Because I think one of the messages that maybe gets mistranslated as it comes across is \u2013 and let's just pick FICC, because I think that's really what you're talking about when you talk about trading. We have expressed a commitment to FICC. What we mean by that, very explicitly, is we're committed to our clients and we're committed to providing superior returns over the cycle. Commitment does not mean inaction, and I think that's what gets a little bit confused in this message. And actually, as far as I can tell, Mike, all of our U.S. peers, they're committed to FICC, too.","But back to Goldman Sachs for a second. If you think about the things we've done over the last couple of years, since the middle of 2013 we've taken the ICS balance sheet down 25% and FICC RWAs, market and credit down 30%. On the cost side \u2013 we've been very focused on the capital side, and on the cost side since the beginning of 2012, we've taken FICC related head count down 10, and we've taken compensation down by more than 20%. So, I wouldn't say that there's been any inaction. However, I would reiterate that we've been quite committed to our clients and committed to the return.","Now, look, this has been, and I admit it, because I agree with you, Mike, this has been a tough period and this has been a long cycle. But we have a long history of managing our business across the cycle. In 2009, we didn't overinvest in the top, and we're going to be thoughtful about not underinvesting but we are certainly responding to the last several years of decline in (30:04) revenue.","Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","I guess, as a follow-up, I mean, what else can you do? You've danced pretty well the last three to four years without revenue growth, but it seems like you're getting to the end of what you can do and your return on equity is now in the single-digit range, and I think consensus has it in the single-digit range for the year. I know you would not want to see that. So what are your other options?","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, look. I think you're right to point out that for four years running we are one of the very small handful of firms that have had double-digit ROEs. This is a quarter, I certainly wouldn't sit here and tell you, we are happy about this quarter, but we will do what it takes over time to make sure that we deliver for our clients and maximize the returns for our shareholders in a prudent way. So we are quite focused.","Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","All right. Thank you.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Betsy.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Couple of questions on the fixed income line or the debt line on the I&L?","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, typically I think the NII is around $225 million quarter, and I know you posted $87 million, and you indicated the delta is largely due to energy. I'm just wondering, should I take that to mean that the reserve, or the provision, or the mark-to-market in energy was around $138 million or is there more there?","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So the NII was roughly $240 million and then the offset within provisions, and the majority the offset, about two thirds was in energy related.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. So that feels like it would probably double the reserve ratio that you had posted last quarter. Is that \u2013 it would more than double it. Is that a reasonable assumption? Or maybe you could talk us through how you're thinking about them?","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, it is not. When you actually look at it \u2013 I think the best way to look at this is with the funded portion of the non-investment grade portion of the energy portfolio. It was high-single digits last quarter, and it remains high-single digits.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And that's because you either used some of the provision to \u2013 you wrote off some of your exposure? Is that accurate or...","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, the exposure \u2013 why don't I just walk you through it?","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Sure.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So \u2013 yeah. So in the oil and gas sector, this period, including funded, unfunded, investment-grade and non-investment grade was $10.7 billion. That's up from $10.6 billion in the fourth quarter. Now let's just focus on non-investment grade. Non-investment grade is $5 billion. That's up from $4.2 billion. In part, obviously that's driven up by ratings downgrades and actions by the ratings agencies during the course of the quarter, and the funded portion of that is $1.6 billion, and that was up about $100 million. So you can kind of matrix back through all that, and you can see the shift in the portfolio was a result of the ratings agencies.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And then just ticky-tacky, is the fully phased in for the capital ratios, the CET1, the SLR?","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So on the fully phased-in ratios, they are flat quarter-over-quarter, advanced is a 11.7%, and standardized is 12.9%.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. All right. Thank you.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Betsy.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous. Please go ahead.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Guy.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research US LP","Hey, good morning. So I'm going to ask a question that's really going to drill down on one that came a couple of minutes ago on the degree of commitment to FICC in particular. Goldman is obviously a leader in applying technology to traditional voice trading businesses and other things, and you've been pretty vocal in the past about how you transformed equities, and foreign exchange, and cut head count while picking up market share and the process. It seems like FICC has really reached a tipping point recently because of regulatory change and what's going on in the markets and yet the digitization process is maybe trickier in FICC. And, so I was hoping you could give us some color on how much transformation do you expect in the capital structure and the expense structure of fixed income for your business?","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, first and foremost I'd say the thing that drive the strategy is not digitization in and of itself, it's how we engage our clients. You're right to point out that the equity business went through a pretty significant evolution. While that evolution in historical perspective feels short, it was a multiyear process that really began in 1999 and it finished in the mid 2000s and continues to evolve. I don't know necessarily that I would agree with that we're at a tipping point. It's all about opinions. But it feels like we're in an evolution where obviously clients are looking for efficiencies and we're looking for efficiencies, but the reality is that a vast majority of the fixed income market is more bespoke; it won't lend itself to that. But to the extent to which we can deliver to our clients and drive efficiencies, we're obviously very focused on it.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research US LP","So, is it right though, for us to think that there is going to be a significant transformation in the cost structure and the capital structure that you apply to FICC over the next couple of years? Or would that be too dramatic?","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well I think, look, you've seen some of the evolutionary steps we've taken in terms of the balance sheet reductions and the risk-weighted assets that I talked about earlier. It may be the case that over periods of time, depending on how much client activity there is, but the extent to which it shifts to electronic channels like we've seen under the regulatory framework for swap execution facilities, those transitions happen very, very quickly, and we adjust very, very quickly.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research US LP","Okay. That's helpful in terms of perspective. Thank you very much.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan Securities Plc","Yeah. Morning, Harvey.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Kian.","Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan Securities Plc","Just wondering on market share movements, how you see that progressing, considering we have clear strategies of reduction of some of the European IBs as well as Nomura now. How do you see that coming through in your numbers? Do you see that at this point? And how you position to take part of these market share gains as others are retrenching?","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, as you and I talked about over the last couple of years, I don't think we would have imagined a couple of years ago that the industry would be in a position where three of the largest firms were going through a change in leadership and what appears to be a very, very significant change in strategy. That change in strategy is different for all of them, some of them it's geographically driven, some so far, some of it is pulling resources back from certain businesses like derivatives.","To us, it feels like the feedback is quite good. Obviously difficult to see that in a really tough first quarter, but I would say on the ground, the feedback is good and it continues to improve our position. With respect to how we're positioned, I think we feel tremendously well positioned given our footprint.","Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan Securities Plc","Okay. And in respect to your fixed income business, looking at your VaR in commodities, it declined a lot year on year, although volatility must have gone up in the commodity space. I'm just wondering it looks to me there's been a proactive reduction overall in the first quarter. Do I understand that correctly? And did that have an impact on your revenue impact in FY 2016? Just trying to put the picture together.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, as I spoke about in the early remarks, commodities were down year-over-year, that really \u2013 the VaR reductions you're really seeing are more reflection of the environment. While there was volatility during the course of the period, obviously in commodities, client flows were pretty muted as people really were a bit taken back, I wouldn't say in shock, but a bit taken back by the depressed energy prices and the movement down. It didn't translate into lots of activity during the course of the quarter.","Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan Securities Plc","And if I may, just follow-up on that, do you see an improvement through March and April, both in liquidity terms and in terms of a client activity in the space?","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. As I said before, March was better than February and February was certainly better than January. So I would say that's been the general trend. As I said before, the factors that really were impacting the market so severely in the first quarter, at least for now, they seem to have abated.","Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan Securities Plc","Thank you.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of James Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hey, good morning.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Just wanted to \u2013 I hate to beat a dead horse, but maybe just talk about FICC a little bit, maybe just more strategically? With regulators sort of turning their eyes to the buy-side and potentially cracking down on leverage and forcing more liquidity, do you worry that that just sort of postpones any cyclical recovery in the investor class trading? And then I guess as I corollary to that, could you \u2013 is it possible to sort of pivot towards more the plain vanilla flow businesses that are \u2013 corporate-driven flow businesses that the big universal banks seem to be benefiting from in terms of stability? Is there opportunities set there to kind of crack their market share on those businesses?","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So I would say with respect to the liquidity dynamic, if I had to rank factors and it's very hard to quantify these things, I would say factors like conviction around the markets because of the sharp decline in the oil price and obviously the negative interest rate environment and the big shift to, as you said, the buy-side holding lots of assets, I think those are as significant a driver in the current environment as is regulation, given that banks are holding less inventory globally. I think that underpinning all of that is that when you look at the client base, regardless of how much velocity may be in their current trading activities quarter-to-quarter, the core needs in terms of their need for liquidity and our desire to provide it, that remains. So I think the core of it is the same.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And do you see any value in trying to sort of capture more market share in the corporate-driven flow business?","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The extent to which we can \u2013 sorry, I didn't mean to ignore the last part of your question.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think you're right to say that, obviously, the big universal banks, they're two or three times our size, they have a much bigger lending profile and a bigger retail commitment. So they will naturally participate in some flows that, given their size, we won't participate in. But the value is really in servicing the client and so the extent to which we can provide value to a client, obviously, we want to make sure we're doing that.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay, that's helpful. And just maybe just one quick question on M&A activity and capital restructurings in the energy space, it's been a hot topic of whether we see some significant pickup in activity in that space as prices stabilize. Are you seeing that? Are you seeing sort of conversations and potential activity pickup there that we could see later in the year?","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So we saw, obviously, to the extent to which there were financings in the first quarter, they're obviously energy-related financing activity and we were very involved in that. I would say that, look, the space has been under extreme stress which emerged over a fairly short period of time, measured more in months than years, and so I think our expectation that there will be active dialogue across the industry. Whether or not that manifests itself immediately in the near term, we'll have to see, but obviously the industry is going through quite a bit in this price environment.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks for your help.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.","Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. Just a couple quick ones. On trading broadly, thinking about the importance of hedge funds to your trading business, should we temper our expectations for a bounce back here in your revenues, even if we see some market improvement, given the pressure that that client base has experienced this year?","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, look, we think of all of our clients as important, but obviously, we've had a big commitment to the hedge fund industry across equities and fixed them for a long time. We're always rooting for their performance, and so to the extent to which they have improved performance, it may be a catalyst for increased activity. Because in periods like we went through in the first quarter, obviously, they have a tendency to derisk and it reduces trading velocity over many months, although it may be, for example, an active day from time to time. But I think sentiment seems to be improving, but we're going to have to say, as I said before, it's still a little fragile.","Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, okay, thanks. And then just one more follow-up on the backlog. Could you maybe help us out a little bit on, number one, how we could see \u2013 I think you indicated in the press release that sequentially down quarter-over-quarter on the backlog. But I would have guessed that there might have been maybe some extension from 1Q into 2Q, so could you maybe help me understand that? And then also if you can give any color on some of the deal funding markets and high yield markets and whether there's been some healing and improvement in the backlogs there, given how stressed they were in 1Q? Thanks.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. So, as I mentioned, the backlog was down sequentially, but it's up year-over-year. When you look across the business, the advisory portion of backlog was down versus very strong level at the end of the year, but that's up year-over-year. Versus the end of the year, as we would imagine, given what happened in the equity markets, the equity backlog is up and obviously we had a bit of an outperformance, it looks like, versus the rest of the industry on debt underwriting, and that's down sequentially. In terms of the high yield markets, over the last couple of weeks, still a bit selective, but they seem quite strong, one of the largest transactions was done just last week and so the markets are quite receptive to good solid transactions. Are you there, Brennan?","Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Oh yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Thanks. Appreciate it.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No problem.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Steven.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","So, Harvey, I appreciated the color that you've given on some of the factors that were impacting market liquidity, and I know that one of the Fed Governors had recently spoken on the topic and suggested that that reduction in liquidity is a cost worth paying for to help the overall financial system. And given the regulators' willingness to sacrifice that liquidity to ensure improved safety and soundness, I'm just wondering how that informs your strategy on balance sheet and inventory management? Have you considered the fact that there might not be any relief on the regulatory side in the context of your longer-term strategy for the business?","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So I think \u2013 look, you have to give the regulators a lot of credit over the last several years for making \u2013 and I'll focus more on the U.S. financial system, including things like CCAR. I think that the safety and soundness of the large U.S. banks and the whole system, they deserve a lot of credit for driving some of that. Obviously, we made a lot of changes to our balance sheet even prior to the regulations, but I think you have to give them a lot of credit for it. I think that all these good benefits which we all benefit from, they come at some marginal cost. It's very hard to measure that marginal cost.","I don't know. I have yet to see a very good analysis that breaks down in great detail the impact of negative rates, the fact that we had declining spreads for multiple years that increased asset holdings for mutual funds compared to the shrinkage of bank balance sheets and come up with something that really does a great cost-benefit analysis. I don't think we've seen that. But I think we have to argue the benefits are pretty clear.","Now, as it informs our strategy, look, we have an obligation to deliver to our clients and we have an obligation to make sure that we comply with the rules in the way that we can most thoughtfully. And so that's how we approach our strategy. To the extent to which there was demand for the balance sheet and client activity picked up and that demand was accretive to returns, we'd be happy to grow the balance sheet, given the strength of our capital ratios. But we just haven't seen that, so you're not seeing us do this. But over time, the system is going to have to balance liquidity needs and I think that will happen. It just may take a while.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Got it. And I know you touched on some of the emergence of some of the electronic trading platforms. I'm just wondering has that in fact translated into improved liquidity in certain product areas.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I think if you go back to history, even ignoring the recent regulatory changes that both clients and market providers participated in, if you go back to some of the formation of Tradeweb back into the early 2000s, I think all of those vehicles, and there may have always been challenges at the start, whether it's TRACE reporting or Tradeweb or things like that. I think over time, those generally have been at the margin, maybe not in all cases, they've contributed to increased liquidity. I think so far the markets have adjusted to things, as I said before, very well and the regulators have done a very good job of introducing swap execution facilities and gradually implementing these things.","So I think the extent to which those things have occurred has been helpful. I think where most people talk about liquidity in the marketplace really relates to transacting corporate credit and high yield credit and I don't know of a technological solution that is sort of a cure-all for that. It's all very bespoke and that may be an area that for a while the market struggles with, but not just because of regulation, it's because of all the factors I talked about before.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thanks, Harvey. And one more just follow-up from me. I was hoping you could actually provide some color, just given the focus in the press on Brexit in terms of how you're thinking about the possible impact on your UK operations and maybe more specifically what strategies you're considering to maybe help mitigate the potential impact.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, obviously, we're paying very close attention to it, whether we're monitoring it from a market and credit risk perspective or from a strategy perspective. As you know, under the framework, as we understand it, it's a multiyear transition to the extent to which Brexit goes under it. But we feel when we look at it, again I want to caveat this given there's a lot of uncertainty \u2013 when we look at it, we feel like in terms of our physical commitment to the region that we're well prepared. But again, there'll be a lot that all of us will learn to the extent to which the referendum goes through on June 23. But that'll be a multiyear process.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Understood, Harvey. Well, thank you for taking my questions.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, Harvey. Thanks for taking my question. First, I want to focus a little bit on Investment Management. Revenue was obviously a bit weaker, as you've described. Guess I'm curious as to how you're thinking about the pre-tax margin in that business over the relatively near-term, say the next 12 to 18 months? By my calculation, it's been running in the low 20% range. Do you have designs even in a not so supportive market environment to be able to improve that?","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So we're obviously always focused on running the business efficiently. We don't target a pre-tax margin for the business. So over time, you may see that move as we're investing in the business, as we're taking on different types of asset pools, but we look at it across the whole business, but we don't target it.","Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then just moving on to capital returns, I notice that you issued some preferreds this quarter. I think in the last CCAR test, your constraining factor, in terms of the stress test at least, was the Tier 1 ratio. The preferred issuance should help you with that. Does that help you in terms of thinking about future capital returns?","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The preferred that you saw us do this quarter was the exchange of preferreds. So we were net neutral on the preferreds this quarter.","Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","But you're right to point out that last year \u2013 all the things you point out about last year are accurate. Look, we utilize preferreds to the extent to which they are consistent with our capital plan and our objectives. Generally speaking, as you've heard me say before, we view them as reasonably expensive securities, and so we're not desirous to use them beyond where we think they sort of fit optimally in the capital structure.","Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then just quickly, lastly on energy. It sounded like the vast majority of the increase in the noninvestment grade side was from downgrades. Were there any net draws on the exposure this quarter?","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","There were during the quarter. They weren't material, but I don't have that number off the top of my head.","Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Harvey.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks. Harvey, I just wanted to follow up just a bit on the pipeline issue. Was there any \u2013 particularly on M&A, has there been any pipeline fallout because of change in political circumstances globally or here domestically because of the change in the Treasury's stance on inversion transactions?","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, there was one large transaction in the marketplace which looks like in part in response to Treasury actions. It's no longer in the marketplace. We were a participant in that. But I would say that's a minimal factor in the status of the backlog. And so, no, I'd say these are small impacts.","Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. And so to the extent that macro conditions seem, let's say, broadly unchanged over the past several months, does that continue to support what is generally a very high level of M&A? Or is the tide turning in some way in your view?","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So it feels like the fundamental conditions for I'd say an elevated level of M&A activity, they all feel like they're still in place. And those things are challenged top line growth, slow to very moderate GDP growth globally, and so it all feels like it's still in place.","Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.","Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, Harvey.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Devin.","Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC","Just want to ask the revenue question maybe another way and maybe from the top down. Just when you think about asset productivity at the firm level or revenues per asset, is it really all about increasing velocity here as client activity hopefully improves? Or are there some things that you can point to around maybe remixing how the balance sheet is weighted over time? I know it's fluid, but just trying to think about the size of really proactive opportunities to improve asset productivity by changing the balance sheet mix outside of just a pickup in client activity?","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So we really try never to drive balance sheet to different parts of the firm in a top-down way. It really comes bottom-up, and it comes bottom-up because it's in response to exactly what you're describing. It's client activity. If our bankers need more capital and more liquidity for their clients because they're financing M&A transactions, but we can't \u2013 obviously, from the top, we can't control that from the leadership of the firm. And so it's really in response. So I would say velocity broadly, whether it's in M&A, debt, financing, the ICS businesses, that really is the driving motor for the firm. Obviously, we look to be as thoughtful and efficient about our balance sheet as capital as we can in the context of that, but it really is about velocity and activity levels.","Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up on expenses. As you guys think about just further steps that could be taken from here to reduce expenses if the backdrop remains challenging, I know you're always evaluating those, but are we at a point where the focus is really on reducing costs or maybe the footprint in low return areas that would reduce revenues but they'd still have a positive net impact? Or are there still some costs in the system that can be removed that don't touch revenues? I ask just because you guys have already done so much on this front.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, thanks for acknowledging what we've done over the last couple of years. Look, we're net ROE focused. And net ROE, as I just talked to you about, that's going to be driven in part by client levels of activity. And so, for example, as you know, at the beginning of the year, we go through a firm-wide review of resources, and when you look at that over historical time periods, that's resulted in about a 5% adjustment to resources in the firm. This year as we went through that exercise, parts of the businesses that were more challenged, like fixed income, they elected to take more significant action. And so they would have been greater than 5% during this period. But they're just responding to the market environment and there has been demand for their services in the short run.","Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC","Great. Thanks, Harvey.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Brian.","Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Good morning. Just a quick question on energy or the commodities overall within FICC. I mean, you mentioned during your comments that the client activity was low due to the low energy prices, but I think you then clarified that as saying it was really the drop in energy. I just want to make sure I got that straight and that you can still grow the business even at a low level of energy prices, or was it really just because energy prices are low, revenue is going to be low?","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. It's great question. It's less the absolute price level; it was more the shock and the nature of the decline. And so when you think about the precipitous nature of the decline and you go through the various client segments, so think about producers responding to that decline in prices and, for example, certainly you didn't see much incremental addition to hedge portfolio activity. On the consumer side, when you get those moves down so quickly, they tend to be a delay until you find some price stability. And for investors, I think the move was so volatile that it was difficult for investors to participate. We've certainly seen some stabilizing in those flows and increased market participation over the last several weeks. But what we saw in the first quarter, really not surprising in terms of client behavior.","Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then just one question. I know before we get into the next quarter's earnings, we'll have the CCAR results, and over the last couple of years you've been, I guess, not shy about using amalgam with regards to CCAR. Can you kind of outlay how you think about capital return as well as whether or not you're going to always be aggressive in your capital ask within the CCAR process? Thanks.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So I wouldn't \u2013 just to get a little ticky-tacky on language, I wouldn't that there's a shyness or lack of shyness or aggression or anything like that. We very specifically and carefully go through our capital plan and we ask for what we think is appropriate. And so that's the way I would describe it.","Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Bove with Rafferty Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets, LLC","Good morning. I was wondering, if we take as a given that your balance sheet is in pristine condition and that you're the very best, or among the very best in each one of the businesses in which you operate, we run up against a situation that the world has changed dramatically so that we are now nine years into Goldman Sachs not being able to come close to what it did in 2007. Its revenues have been flat-lining for, let's say, five years. Its earnings, pre-tax earnings this year, certainly last year, are half of what you did in 2007. When does Goldman say the time has come for transformational change, that we must do something radically different because we are getting nowhere? We're just treading water for nine years now. The stock is going nowhere. Earnings are going nowhere. Revenues are going nowhere, and yet we are the very best at what we do. When do you start saying we've got to do something radically different? We've got to change?","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, I guess, I would say a couple of things. First, Dick, over the last several years, as you pointed out, we've been a $34 billion firm. However, we have changed. During that time period, we sold off $2.5 billion-plus worth of businesses, and we replaced those revenues. You've seen us grow our Asset Management business. Over the time period, when you look at our performance versus the peer group, and I thank you for acknowledging we're the best, we've continued to outperform the peers. We've grown book value. We've returned $25 billion to shareholders over the past four years, and so we have done many things.","We can't control what happens in terms of the environment. We don't believe negative interest rates are going to be here forever. We don't believe the client activity is going to be low forever. And you really have to look at this over long periods of time. Look, I will go back to book value, Dick. If you look at it over the past decade, we've grown it by threefold. I think that's contributing value.","Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets, LLC","No. I totally agree with you. I don't see anything wrong with Goldman Sachs. I see things wrong with the world and that Goldman Sachs' position in the world is where things are wrong. And what I'm wondering is, when do you think about doing a massive merger of equals? When do you start thinking about entering new business lines which are radically different from the ones that you're in now under the understanding that you can't get anything more from what you're doing other than waiting for the tide to come in? In other words, when do you get control of your destiny as opposed to sitting here for nine years, letting the world control where you are and what you're doing?","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, again, it's all about language, Dick. I would agree with some of the things you're saying. I certainly wouldn't agree with your statement that we are sitting here, waiting for the world to do what it does. If we felt like there was a client segment or a transaction we could do that would benefit our shareholders, and we could deliver to those clients, we would do it. We're open-minded. There is a reason why we're the leading advisory firm in the world. We would take our own advice, Dick.","Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets, LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","Thanks. Harvey, we'll go from the strategic to the very tactical of my questions here. We've harped on this in the past on kind of the timing of the comp ratio. Year-over-year the expenses were right in line with revenues. But if you look from sequential, you had a 13% reduction in revenues and a 29% increase in your overall compensation. So that combination really created a squeeze on your returns, which if you would have adjusted for that, would have raised your return on tangible common equity by 1.5 percentage points, 2 percentage points in this particular quarter. So just was curious, in the past, it's worked in your favor. This quarter, it really didn't.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, look, at this stage, it's our best estimate, Marty, in terms of where we think the year will go. Obviously, the performance was challenged in the first quarter and you saw competition of benefit expense come down 40%. It's pretty meaningful.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","No, it was. I am just saying, sequentially the pattern, it just throws you off, and it creates the pressure on returns in a first quarter that's not strong, but weak. Whereas if you were on the average for the year and kept it kind of constant for the average, then you would have a much more kind of just leveled out playing field that we'd just have a dramatic shift between fourth and first quarter. So that's the way...","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I understand your point. It really is our best estimate. We're going to have to see how the year progresses.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","Fair. The other thing which I know is a hard question to be able to answer, but it's kind of important when you start thinking about just what are the core earnings and trying to take out some of the volatility that happens from quarter to quarter. The I&L business gives you increased tangible book value, it has been a contributor, so there's nothing wrong with it, but the volatility does create pressures and then also advantages in certain quarters. What is your just range? And just kind of you're not think out the recession, but just kind of think about it in general, what would be the range of outcomes given that you do have some NII in there and you would typically have some flow of deals? And it could be a broad range. I was just kind of thinking when you budget or plan for some normality, what's your kind of aspect to what you think about there?","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, when we budget and plan for it, it really is a process through which, because of the nature, again, this is a long-term business, where we're committing long-term capital, it really is done under a very controlled process where the businesses request that capital. As you pointed out, we had roughly $240 million of NII in there. And now the majority of the balance sheet, and this has been in transition over several years, the balance sheet has transitioned more to debt and lending activities, but that is not something, again, that we drove top-down. That was driven by the client demand and the opportunity set. As I said, look, you have to look at this over the long term. As I said earlier, including our first quarter, it's driven $11 billion of revenue over the last eight quarters.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","Right.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","But you have to look at this at the long term because it's going to be \u2013 it's pro-cyclical and there's going to be volatility quarter to quarter.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","And then the recent history of zero this quarter to $1 billion would be kind of the range we've been seeing. Is that kind of what you would see?","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I would say that this has been a pretty extreme quarter. You have to go back to the third quarter of 2011 or back to other periods where markets have been extremely volatile to see this kind of performance. But, again, it reinforces what we've told you already, which is, it's price sensitive, it's pro-cyclical and quarter to quarter, you really have to look at it over the long term.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","I got you. And you adjust for those two pieces, you put it to an average in I&L and kind of the average compensation ratio for the year and you're really at 9.5% kind of returns. So that's the benefit you'd have as you kind of roll forward. So, thanks.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, that's your job.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","That's right.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Marty.","Operator","And at this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.","Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, hey, everybody, since there are no more questions, I'd like to take a moment to thank all of you for joining the call.

I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, July 15, 2014. Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.","Dane Holmes","Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm's belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain and outside of the firm's control. The firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements.","For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2013. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets and Global Core Excess. And you should also read the information on the calculations of non-GAAP financial measures that is posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com.","This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent.","Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, will now review the firm's results. Harvey?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through our second quarter results, then I'm obviously happy to answer any questions.","Net revenues were $9.1 billion; net earnings, $2 billion; earnings per diluted share, $4.10; and our annualized return on common equity was 10.9%.","The operating environment for our businesses was mixed during the second quarter, with favorable stable conditions in certain businesses and headwinds in others. It was an environment that, in the end, reinforced the benefits of a global, diversified business and a strong client franchise. All of this helped position the firm to continue to generate strong relative returns.","Over the course of the second quarter, there was a lot of focus across the industry on the challenges facing market-making businesses. Most importantly, how an environment defined by low volatility weighed on client activity and risk appetite. Given how much has already been discussed on the subject, I won't go through the statistics. Suffice it to say in several markets, volatility is at historically low levels.","During the quarter, we continued to see an increase in CEO confidence and a significant pickup in M&A activity. Year-to-date, announced M&A is up more than 70% to $1.8 trillion for the industry. It is nearly double that rate for our firm.","Historically, increased M&A activity has been a favorable sign for a few reasons. First, it traditionally coincides with a positive trend in economic activity and client sentiment. Second, it generally translates into greater client activity, for example, currency, interest rate or commodity hedging.","During the second quarter, financing markets also remained strong, driving our clients' demand for debt and equity underwriting services. As you would expect, rising asset prices created a favorable environment for our equity and debt investments. The quality of the underlying portfolio and favorable markets have also helped drive 8 straight quarters of strong Investing & Lending revenue performance.","And finally, continued success in growing and preserving our clients' wealth has driven solid net asset flows within our Investment Management business. I'll talk more about this later, but it's important to note that assets under supervision reached another record this quarter, finishing at $1.14 trillion.","So while Institutional Client Services is currently facing a lower level of client activity, our other businesses are seeing significant demand for our services. In a mixed operating environment, it's all about being diversified and staying close to our clients. Historically, this has been critical to generating superior returns. It's as relevant today as ever.","Now let me take you through each of our businesses. In Investment Banking, we produced second quarter net revenues of $1.8 billion, flat with the first quarter. Our Investment Banking backlog increased during the quarter, reaching its highest level since 2007. As you would expect, advisory activity was a significant driver of the increase. Second quarter advisory revenues were $506 million, down 26% from a strong first quarter. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&A. We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the second quarter, including Sallie Mae's $7.2 billion spinoff of its education loan management business and Illinois Tool Works' $3.2 billion sale of its industrial packaging segment to The Carlyle Group.","While the reduction in completed transactions quarter-over-quarter contributed to the sequential decline in revenues, we experienced a significant increase in announced M&A, which should benefit future quarters and is reflected in the growth of our backlog. For example, we're advising on DirecTV's $67.1 billion sale to AT&T, Covidien's $42.9 billion sale to Medtronic and Holcim's combined EUR 40 billion merger with Lafarge.","Moving to underwriting, net revenues were a record $1.3 billion in the second quarter, up 16% compared to the first quarter results, with significant strength in Europe. Equity underwriting revenues of $545 million were 25% higher, as industry-wide activity increased in the second quarter across IPOs and secondary offerings. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in global equity and equity-related common stock offerings and IPOs. Debt underwriting revenues increased 11% sequentially to a record $730 million due to issuance activity in the high-yield market, particularly merger-related activity. During the second quarter, we were committed to meeting our clients' diverse financing needs, whether it was Apple's $12 billion investment-grade offering, the AUD 2.3 billion financing of Transurban Group's acquisition of Queensland Motorways or B&M Value Retail's GBP 1.1 billion IPO.","Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and Equities businesses, net revenues were $3.8 billion in the second quarter, down 14% compared to the seasonally stronger first quarter. FICC Client Execution net revenues were $2.2 billion in the second quarter. Excluding DVA, net revenues were down 22% sequentially, reflecting reduced levels of client activity during the quarter. Currencies was higher sequentially, although volatility in volumes remained relatively low. Mortgages was roughly flat, while credit decreased modestly. Interest rates declined compared to the seasonally stronger first quarter. Commodities revenues declined significantly, following a robust first quarter as volatility in client activity decreased.","Total net revenues for Equities in the second quarter were $1.6 billion. Excluding DVA, results were up 2% sequentially. Equities Client Execution net revenues of $483 million for the second quarter were up 16% quarter-over-quarter. Commissions and fees were $751 million, down 9% relative to the first quarter on weaker volumes. Securities services generated net revenues of $373 million, up 6% sequentially due to seasonally stronger client activity.","Turning to risk. Average daily VaR in the second quarter was $77 million, down 6% relative to the first quarter, mostly due to lower equity VaR. The overall decline was driven by both lower levels of volatility and risk.","Moving on to our Investing & Lending activities. Collectively, these businesses produced net revenues of $2.1 billion in the second quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $1.3 billion, primarily reflecting company-specific events, including financings, as well as divestitures.","Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $604 million and benefited from net gains on certain investments and net interest income. Other revenues of $215 million include revenues from the firm's consolidated investments.","In Investment Management, we reported second quarter net revenues of $1.4 billion. Management and other fees were up 4% sequentially to a record $1.2 billion, reflecting the increase of assets under supervision. Following a large performance fee in the first quarter, incentive fees were down quarter-over-quarter.","During the second quarter, assets under supervision increased $59 billion to a record $1.14 trillion. This growth was driven by long-term net inflows of $21 billion into fixed income assets. We also had market appreciation of $23 billion, principally in equity and fixed income assets.","Let me provide you with some detail on our Investment Management business. There are a couple of current themes that are really important to our clients. First, clients are concerned about the potential for rising interest rates. As a result, we saw institutional, private wealth and retail clients seek unconstrained fixed income strategies. Second, our clients are focused on outsourcing portfolio management functions to both create greater efficiencies and focus on their core competencies. They are also engaging us as an advisor to gain expertise and enhance their decision-making around asset allocation, portfolio manager selection and risk management. The demand for an outsourced asset management function and advisory services, particularly for our insurance clients, also contributed to net inflows for the quarter. Additionally, many clients have been looking for other opportunities to generate incremental yield and uncorrelated returns in their portfolios. As a result, we saw continued net inflows into our yield-focused strategies, as well as our liquid alternatives funds.","And finally, clients have a continuing demand for defined contribution retirement solutions. We have been focused on growing our defined contribution product offering. To that end, we completed the acquisition of Deutsche Bank's Stable Value business, which contributed $11 billion of inflows this quarter.","Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits, was accrued at a compensation-to-net revenues ratio of 43%, which is consistent with the accrual for the first half of 2013.","Second quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.4 billion, up 4% sequentially due to higher net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings. Total staff at the end of the second quarter was approximately 32,400, down 1% from the first quarter.","Our effective tax rate was 30.3% year-to-date. The lower rate this quarter was driven by earnings that were permanently reinvested abroad, as well as changes in the earnings mix.","Moving to capital. As I mentioned on our last conference call, the Federal Reserve approved the firm coming off the parallel run, and therefore, starting this quarter, our capital ratios are subject to the transitional provisions of Basel III. Our Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio was 11.4% using the advanced approach. Under the standardized approach, our ratio was 10.9%. During the quarter, we repurchased 7.8 million shares of common stock for $1.25 billion.","Now I'd like to spend some time on our balance sheet. Over the past few months, we have received greater clarity on the role of the balance sheet across a variety of regulatory requirements, most notably CCAR and the supplementary leverage ratio. During the quarter, we undertook a comprehensive analysis of our balance sheet. We began the process by examining the return on asset characteristics associated with different businesses. Through that analysis, we identified opportunities to reduce balance sheet with a de minimis impact to our client franchise and earnings potential.","As you would expect, the quarterly reduction largely impacted lower-return asset activities within our matched book and other secured financing transactions. By managing our balance sheet, we've achieved a number of benefits: first, we responded proactively to comply with regulatory developments; second, we improved the overall efficiency of our balance sheet, and third, we positioned the firm to provide additional risk capacity to our clients if needed. Going forward, we will continue to assess our positioning to ensure that we comply with new regulations and remain prudent allocators of an increasingly important financial resource.","In closing, our management of the balance sheet is just one recent example of our firm's mindset and our broader culture of adjusting to a changing environment. In the past, you've heard us use the words adaptable and nimble. While adapting to an evolving backdrop is simple in concept, it can be difficult to implement. Successful implementation requires many things. It requires a culture of collaboration. It requires a talented and dedicated team, and you have to provide them with the necessary tools and analytics to make prudent risk-return decisions. However, the most important factor is our connectivity with our clients. Their needs ultimately inform our actions.","Adaptability has always been important for our industry. However, it may be even more valuable in the current environment, given the numerous regulatory and economic changes underfoot. We do know that regardless of the environment, adaptability has been and will continue to be an essential ingredient to serving our clients and producing superior returns for our shareholders.","Thanks again for dialing in, and now I'm happy to answer any of your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI.","Glenn Schorr - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","First question is a follow-up on your comments on the balance sheet reduction. I'm just curious for any type of example of a low-ROA business that doesn't have a broader client implication that's helping reduce the gross balance sheet. I'm assuming it's something in repo land, but just more interested in learning.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Glenn, thanks for dialing in. So as I said, we started this exercise as we got basically increasing feedback on role, effectively, that balance sheet was going to play. And one of the significant inputs into the process, obviously, was CCAR. And so the way we approached it and one of the good things about working with the balance sheet is this notion, and I'm oversimplifying it, but you can effectively sort your balance sheet by return on asset, low to high. Now that doesn't mean necessarily that all low-ROA activities can be taken down. But in this case, it seemed like we had some opportunities that, as I said, would allow us to comply with the rules and give us a lot more flexibility. One example would be the matched book, which, of the $56 billion reduction in the quarter, came down $25 billion approximately.","Glenn Schorr - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, I get that. Maybe we could switch over to I&L for a second, and you mentioned the results have been great now for 8 quarters. I'm curious on the double-edged sword of the markets continuing to do better and the environment's good, produces good revenues, but we still have that little shadow hanging over us. It's a good shadow, but $9 billion or so in Goldman capital in the Investing & Lending function that eventually has to work its way out. Good environment to work its way out, but I don't know if you could provide any update on the asset side of what's in equity, debt and lending buckets, how much of the $9 billion you've worked through and maybe if you're working towards July of '15 or July '17, because I know we don't know those rules yet.","Harvey M. Schwartz","So it's a great question. So in terms of how we think about the process in terms of complying with the rule, first, let me remind you, this capital, obviously, sits alongside our clients, in funds that our clients are co-investing with us in. So we're harvesting it at a pace that obviously makes sense for those funds and the performance associated with those funds. I won't go through all the numbers, because they haven't moved so materially since the last time I gave you an update. But on the last call, when I walked you through basically a waterfall of flows, the number ended up being roughly $9 billion. Now that was based on the January numbers. If you look at kind of midyear, we're at an $8 billion number now, give or take.","Glenn Schorr - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess the no big change is just a function of markets keep moving higher, so your assets grow with it. So you sell some, but it goes off. Okay, I got that.","Harvey M. Schwartz","So I mean, with respect to the capital, the reality is that as it comes off, we have the flexibility deploying that capital in any way that we think is in the best interest of our clients and the firm, or obviously, we can look to return it. And that will be opportunity-driven in the franchise.","Glenn Schorr - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, and I've noticed some direct investments being made. That's cool. Last 2 are quickies. One, what was the SLR ratio, and two, what's the geography of the market gain? Like what line item did it go through?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So in terms of the SLR ratio, on the last call, we were at 4.3%, and then you have to make some adjustments. During the course of the quarter, you probably saw that we issued $2 billion in preferred. That adds 10 basis points to the ratio. That gets you to 4.4%. Balance sheet and other basic actions we took during the quarter gets you up to 4.5%. And again, an important fact on this is the one you mentioned earlier. As the capital comes out of the funds, which is punitive from the standpoint of the significant financial institutions deduction, that has to come out, obviously, before you have to be in compliance with the supplementary leverage ratio in 2018. When you do that math, we're north of 5%.","Glenn Schorr - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Cool. And the last cleanup was just the geography of the market gain.","Harvey M. Schwartz","So as you know, we keep all those items in our Investing & Lending section.","Glenn Schorr - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, in Equities?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Yes.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","First one on, just the optimization of the balance sheet. So I understand a lot of the commentary. I guess, can you provide any color on maybe the return impact to the overall firm or what the returns were in the areas that you're exiting? And when you look at the broader balance sheet and given the current relationships and the activity levels, is there much more to do, or was this the bulk of it and you'll just keep an eye on it going forward?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So as I said, the impact, de minimis, and that has a lot to do with how we approach this. So at the beginning of the quarter, when we began this exercise, as a management team, we didn't pick $860 billion as a hard-line target. This is a very iterative process that we go through. We set multiple targets. And just to give you a real sense, our initial target, we basically said, look, let's work down to an $875 billion level. And as we went through it, we realized that there was more capacity in terms of our ability to build in efficiencies and still work with clients and really no impact at the margin. But importantly, as I said before, this allows us to comply with the rules. And again, builds in flexibility in terms of how we deploy capital. In terms of how we go forward, our process will continue the same way. There won't be hard targets to get down, and we'll just continue to reassess.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just on the Investing & Lending segment. So Glenn hit on the capital side, I think it's obviously a hard business to predict, and so maybe ex the mark-to-market gains that we all try to predict, but can you give us any color on like the current MOC [ph] or the IRR of the portfolio, the seasoning, like normal exit premiums? Just anything to get a sense on how things are doing and what we can expect over the next couple of years as you're running it down or exiting those positions.","Harvey M. Schwartz","So I mean, just for clarity purposes, obviously, the debt line has interest income in it. The equity line has equity positions. To give you some sense of how we look at it in terms of the underlying quality of the portfolio, if you look at the performance in the equity line this quarter, give or take, about 2\/3 of the performance was driven by IPOs, other event-related activity in terms of the quarter. And so what you're seeing is the strength of the portfolio as we work through it. In terms of predicting the pace, obviously, some of that is driven by market conditions, but that's really about how these entities are run ultimately within the funds, and the performance has been good. And again, I know there's always some skepticism about the future performance, but as I pointed out, when you look at the last 8 quarters, it's been pretty steady. So we'll see how it goes over time, but the quality of the portfolio feels good.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just Investment Banking and Investment Management, both those segments, the trends have been very strong, and it's been fairly consistent. When you look at the outlook, obviously, the M&A backdrop, that's easy to see. But when you look across those 2 segments, where do you see the big opportunities at this point in the cycle versus -- are there areas where you're starting to get concerned? Are the risks rising in the overall market that we could start to see some decrease in activity?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So why don't we just start with the Advisory business? I mean, I think if, when we were doing this call a year ago, there was a lot of concern or question around, look, almost -- for lack of better language, will M&A ever come back? And now we sit here in an environment where there's lots of activity. And maybe in retrospect, sitting here, that doesn't look surprising because as sentiment shift and CEOs get more confident and global economic activity stabilizes, starts to grow, you start to see it. For us, during the slower part of the cycle, the slower part of the cycle was really aimed at making sure that we stayed connected with our clients. And I think you see it in some of the statistics. For transactions greater than $1 billion, we are in 60 of the transactions out of 175, and that's, give or take, roughly a 35% market share. And as I mentioned on the call, our market shares have continued to grow on a relative basis during this. Now when you think about other parts of the Investment Banking set and you think about debt, this was a big discussion again we had last year. I remember we hit a record in debt performance in the first quarter of last year, and there were a lot of questions about whether that's sustainable. So I think as economic growth continues to improve globally, the opportunity for Goldman Sachs to provide advice to our clients, capital to our clients, I think it feels pretty good, but it will be environment-driven. But it seems like there's some capacity from here.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse.","Chinedu Christian Onwugbolu - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","In the past, you've spoken about the strategic importance of growing the wealth management business. There's been some talk in the marketplace about Goldman expanding their business by acquisitions. Can you remind us about your ambitions and growth plans for that business and how you think about using M&A for growth?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So the business has been a strategic growth focus for us for a number of years. We've taken a number of steps in that business, and this goes back multiple years, to really improve performance. And what you're seeing is you're seeing quality of performance, which is now driving pretty significant inflows and growth into the business. In terms of acquisitions, our philosophy on this is pretty straightforward. If we believe it's accretive to the business and we can provide value to our clients, we'll consider them. I mean, largely, what you've seen us do are bolt-ons. I mentioned the Deutsche Bank Stable Value business. That follows an acquisition we did a couple of years ago, and that's about building scale in a space where we feel we can provide value.","Chinedu Christian Onwugbolu - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's helpful. Just switching over to FICC, apologies if I missed this on your prepared remarks, but clearly, June saw an improvement in activity levels. Could you provide a bit more color on which businesses and which regions did better? And also, I'd appreciate any insights into how July is progressing so far relative to June.","Harvey M. Schwartz","So in terms of the quarter, as we all saw in the beginning of the quarter, there were some pretty negative forecasts related to kind of general client activity across Fixed Income and Equities. As the quarter went along and investors felt more comfortable, certainly, post the actions of rate policy announcements out of Europe, there was a more significant pickup in activity. I would say that relative to historical markets, volumes, and clearly, you're seeing it in volatility levels, really feel like they're bottoming a bit. But activity improved across the business broadly.","Chinedu Christian Onwugbolu - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Nothing on July, I take it, then?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Bit too early to tell.","Chinedu Christian Onwugbolu - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's fair. Just my last question, really, is more of a broader question on Goldman's long-term competitive positioning. I guess the period post-crisis was really marked by industry consolidation, and since then, there's been significant growth in the non-bank financial sector. And as we move into stronger macroeconomic conditions, it seems to me that there'll be a lot of competition for Goldman's clients. I'll be curious on how you see Goldman competing against -- or competing in the sales and trading businesses against the balance sheet might and customer flow that the money center banks enjoy and also how Goldman competes against less-regulated firms such as the independent M&A brokers and the alternative asset managers.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Okay, so why don't we start with Institutional Client Services? So we obviously have a very long history in these businesses, and one of the things we benefit from is the diversification of the business, so currencies, commodities, interest rates, by the way, also the leadership position we have in equities, client brokerage, derivatives. And our ability to commit capital has always been a defining characteristic for our clients. And so we feel that our competitive position now, relative to the rest of the market, it feels to us like it's a pretty good position. And so we'll have to see it evolves. We've seen pockets of areas where, when volatility has picked up, and I've talked about it in the last quarter, for example, in commodities, as far as we could tell, it felt like there was some kind of advantage, given our commitment and long history in the business, when the markets were volatile. But these are pretty quiet markets, as we discussed, some of the most historically low levels of volatility that we've ever seen. But the competitive position, when we think about our people, ability to hire, the talent, it feels strong.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can you talk a bit about some of the ancillary businesses or business that you get from M&A and the timing of that? So obviously, we've had a lot of announced M&A, and I guess I usually think about the ancillary business occurring closer towards when the deals are actually completed. But just kind of a broader conversation, if you could talk a bit about the other businesses you get from the deals.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Sure. So as I mentioned, the largest part of the growth in the backlog was in the announced, and obviously, we're extremely active in terms of our position in the marketplace. These transactions, as you know, they can take 6 to 9 months to close. Lots of the transactions we've seen have either been cross-border or they've had a debt component, and so there are a variety of different hedging elements that will go on associated with those transactions where we're providing advice. In general, those corresponding activities tend to happen around closure also, not in all cases, but for the most part, given the fact that there's always uncertainty about whether the transaction will be completed.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So still a lot of that benefit, one would think, to come then?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Yes. Again, as I said, the backlog growth, which is the highest it's been since 2007, the backlog growth quarter-over-quarter really was driven by M&A and the announced transactions.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just a bigger picture question on rising rates on the Fixed Income businesses. I guess in the old days, people used to think rising rates are bad for investment banks because they hold all this inventory, and you get marks on the way up. Although a higher rate environment, once you get there, might be better for activity. But I've noticed that for the industry overall, the inventory levels have come down pretty significantly versus a year ago. So I'm just wondering how you think about -- if we can split it, like the impact of rising rates as it's occurring versus once you get to a higher level.","Harvey M. Schwartz","So it's a great question. If you look back in history in periods of rising interest rates, it's all very contextual. A lot of it depends on the base that you're coming from and whether or not the market was expecting or not expecting the move in the first place. In the end, it all relates back to is the rise in interest rates something that is a stimulus to activity, so we don't see inflation in the forecast. If you had rising rates as a result of inflation, and you had -- or struggling unemployment, I think generally speaking, that would be bad for activity. But in an environment where it's more of a return to normal, and we've been at such managed low levels for so long, but a normal environment with good, solid, stable economic growth, that may bode well for client activity. But again, it's all going to be activity-based.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, on the comp ratio, you have historically done adjustments in the back half of the year, usually, in the fourth quarter. And I think last year, you did some in the third quarter as well. And just if you could comment on that, especially in light of the -- I think the FICC trading comps are pretty easy in the third quarter a year ago, but how, when we put it all together, think about the comp ratio at the back half of the year.","Harvey M. Schwartz","So the 43% that you've seen this quarter, the first half of the year and actually, the first half of last year, for this quarter, obviously, it's our best estimate of where we think we are. We're reviewing it every quarter. Last year, you started to see some of the benefits maybe earlier than we have in the past versus -- in third quarter versus fourth quarter, just because of the cost savings that we had built into the enterprise. And so we'll continue to evaluate it every quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. One's a ticky-tacky on the SLR that you mentioned earlier. I know in your Fixed Income presentation from May, you had the SLR at the end of 1Q '14 at 4.2%, and then the press added the 10 bps to get you to 4.3%. So then on top of that, the balance sheet adjustments added another 10 bps to get us to 4.4% at quarter end. Is that the right math?","Harvey M. Schwartz","No. So I have it at 4.3%, 4.4%, 4.5%, but there's a rounding in there, too, right, so when you go back and forth.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then if we assume all of Volcker-noncompliant $8 billion goes away, that's what gets you to above the 5%.","Harvey M. Schwartz","No, just to be ticky-tacky, too, just so we're very clear, so the $8 billion is what still needs to be managed after you take adjustments for things that are already public, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. The significant financial institution deduction itself is actually bigger, so that's $9 billion. And so once that's out and with extensions, as you know, the final compliance date is July 2017, as we know it now, that precedes the 2018 SLR requirement. That gets us north of 5%. Is that clear?","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes. And then on the balance sheet freeing-up that you did, you have the relatively low-ROA assets that are not necessarily helping clients as much. I mean, I would think that you're doing that in part ahead of the significant M&A calendar that typically comes with lines of credit, bridge loans, et cetera. Is that fair?","Harvey M. Schwartz","No, we don't -- again, from that perspective, we feel like we have more than enough capital adequacy and certainly more than enough liquidity in the balance sheet to support those franchise activities. This really was directly correlated to, basically, information that we've gained from the discussions around supplementary leverage ratio. And as I said, a significant factor is CCAR.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So then the M&A activity, obviously, announced, as you indicated, up significantly, so we should have a nice second half here into '15. Any lines of credit that you're extending with those activities is on your books today. Is that correct?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Yes, so the way they generally work is if we're committing to a financing, if we're left lead, then those show up as either unfunded commitments, or if they become funded, they show up as funded commitments. That's correct.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great, okay. And so part of that's already in the footings?","Harvey M. Schwartz","That's correct, yes.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, as the Volcker-noncompliant rolls off and you're using the capital to reinvest elsewhere, I'm thinking about the fact that your clients have been involved with you on these noncompliant Volcker assets because they are alternatives. They are giving you, potentially, uncorrelated risks -- uncorrelated returns, I'm sorry, and that there's certain elements of this that might look akin to alternative investments. I'm just wondering what the strategy plan is for increasing your offerings in that area of asset management business.","Harvey M. Schwartz","So in terms of the capital, I'll make a couple of points as it comes out. So obviously, we run a very large asset management business, and those clients can participate in that, as I mentioned, as they wish. So obviously, we run a very big alternatives business aside from the capital that's in these funds. Also remember, we can invest those dollars in other Volcker-compliant funds for our clients, and we can offer them those options. We can also co-invest with them in Volcker-approved structures, so there's enough flexibility where certainly, we feel like we can respond and deliver to our clients' needs.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Yes, I get that. I'm just thinking there's some opportunity to expand the offerings even further.","Harvey M. Schwartz","If you want to -- there certainly are as the capital moves around. But if you want to follow up with Dane and the team later, we can break down for you a bit how the alternatives asset line actually moves in terms of activities that we're being asked to exit and those that are growing side by side.","Operator","Your next question's from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division","I have 3 questions around balance sheet optimization. The first is, what's left? So you reduced total assets by $56 billion. How much more is there to go? And also, the risk-weighted asset decline was only $5 billion versus the $56 billion. What's your priority looking ahead?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So that's a great question, Mike. So in terms of the balance sheet, again, we're going to continue to reassess as we go forward. Standing here today, there certainly may be some room, but as we approach the third quarter, there are no strategic initiatives at this stage. But I would expect it to be around this area, but we'll see how things evolve. Again, it's going to be very much client-driven. In terms of the metrics, I think this is a great example of when we're complying with the various metrics, some are risk-based, and those are less -- those like the leverage ratio or leverage tests, are, by definition, not risk-based. And so the reason why you're not seeing a corresponding meaningful reduction in RWAs and you actually saw an increase in our Basel III advanced ratio from 11.3% to 11.4% is because this really is in response to those non-risk-based measures.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Got it. As it relates to loan growth, what are your priorities for growing loans, and do you think that loan growth in the industry is accelerating?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So it's hard for me to see across the industry in terms of how it's accelerating. It feels like it may come off the bottom a bit, but I guess I would say the following, which is an important takeaway. So lending for us has always been an important component of how we provide strategic capital to our clients. Obviously, predominantly, our corporate clients and obviously an important component of our private wealth business, we don't target loan growth. Again, these activities, while well collateralized, particularly, for example, in private wealth, while well collateralized, again, this is risk-based capital, and so the way we manage it is through a limit process and through an individual approval process. And so we'd be pretty reluctant to target loan growth.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Can you just elaborate on your comment? You said loan growth does not seem to be accelerating. It's just a downfall...","Harvey M. Schwartz","No, I said I don't have great view into the industry. It's been growing for us over the past year when you look at it, and we've just seen opportunities to work with our clients more closely, so we've been extending more capital. I don't have great view into the industry.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division","And lastly, if you feel confident enough to restructure your balance sheet and downsize so much, does that mean you have better -- enough clarity on SLR and other regulations to set an ROE target anytime soon? I know I ask that every quarter, but it seems like you're making progress.","Harvey M. Schwartz","So I got to say, Mike, actually, I don't think a quarterly call would feel complete for me if you and I didn't have this discussion. So I think we should plan to have it next quarter, and if we need to, we should have it the quarter after that. I don't mean to be glib, but I do enjoy the discussion. So how are we thinking about capital? And you're right. We're getting increasing clarity. In terms of our strategic priorities over the last several years, we've been focused on a number of things, most importantly, obviously, growing the franchise. And you're seeing pretty significant growth in areas where there's activity: Advisory services, Investment Management. Obviously, we've seen more headwinds in other areas where there's been low volatility. But the most important thing is our focus on our clients. The second thing is about building, and we've talked about this a lot, operating leverage into the business so that we're positioned to grow returns when the environment improves and continues to improve. And so we're going through all these steps. In terms of returns in absolutes, we're being disciplined about how we deploy the balance sheet. You saw some of that this quarter. And in the end, Mike, look, we just aspire for better returns. In this environment, you've seen us do, give or take, 11% for 2.5 years, but we continue to look to aspire for better returns. And I think maybe the balance sheet this quarter, even though it's just 1 quarter, taking it down $56 billion, I think that's a good example of some of the steps we're taking.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division","I mean, the 11% ROE is so far below where you've been historically. The question is, do you just stay here for a long period of time?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Well, I don't know. My crystal ball has never been quite good on these things, but we could certainly have a discussion around -- if volatility picked up and you saw activity levels, I think that the future will be what it will be. Again, what we try to do during this period where it's been so much lower is find the right balance. And by balance, I mean protecting our client franchise, at the same time, building these efficiencies. And look, I think when you look at it over the cycle, I think our returns, on a relative basis, they look pretty good. They've been superior.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP","First, I just wanted to revisit the tax rate comments that you made in terms of having made some permanent offshore reinvestment decisions. Is this something that will continue and accelerate going forward? Should we begin to think about tweaking down the core tax rate that we use in computing earnings?","Harvey M. Schwartz","No, so there's 2 things here. One is obviously as we review capital needs around the globe, in this particular quarter, we made an election to permanently reinvest capital. But it's also earnings-mix-driven. And so in terms of the capital needs, I think you should treat that as a one-time event. Earnings mix will be what it'd be, driven by client activity around the globe.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP","Got it. So this isn't a call to begin to shave a point or 2 off the tax rate that we use in forecasting?","Harvey M. Schwartz","No. We're a high tax payer.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP","Just wanted to make sure that we get fully phased-in Basel III ratios, core equity Tier 1.","Harvey M. Schwartz","So again, the 11.4% was the transitional and 10.9%, and fully phased-in would be 9.8% and 9.3% -- sorry, 9 -- yes.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP","All right. Advanced and standardized, in that order, is that right?","Harvey M. Schwartz","That's correct. I'm sorry. I misspoke. I said 9.3% and I should have said 9.4%.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP","9.4%? Okay. Great.","Harvey M. Schwartz","There's the transitional ratio and then there's the fully phased. And so when I went through it, I just misspoke. I apologize.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP","Got it. That helps. You obviously mentioned, both in the release and the press and your comments before, that headcount is down about 1% off the end of last quarter. Obviously not a big number, but just makes me want to ask if you can give a say, year-to-date, what the puts and takes are. If not quantified, at least where are you adding and where are you rationalizing, by key line of business?","Harvey M. Schwartz","All right. So well I think in terms of the aggregate, as we come into the third and fourth quarter, our new analysts will be coming on board, so you should expect that year-end headcount will continue to come up a little bit. We've been very focused on the pyramid, as we referred to it, over the last several years, and also simultaneously investing in those areas that have been growing, like asset management. And Gary spoke about this at a recent conference, if you take Fixed Income as an example over the last couple of years, headcount has been down roughly 10%. And so it's very business-specific-driven in terms of how we're adjusting the resources.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP","Got it. So mostly down in Fixed Income, up in asset management, pretty much stable everywhere else, is that the right takeaway?","Harvey M. Schwartz","That's about right. And also I would say, in general, we feel pretty comfortable in terms of how the global business is right-sized at this stage.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP","And when you made that comment about the pyramid, does that refer to the fact that in order to try to make the lifestyle implications for the junior staff a little bit more manageable, you've upsized what, 10%, 15% in terms of the analyst class, is that what you're talking about?","Harvey M. Schwartz","No. I was talking more about -- I'm glad you asked me to clarify. I was talking more about post-2008, when we normally get sort of a, call it, every other year, series of retirements of partners, many people elected to delay what otherwise were retirement plans. They just felt like they needed to be here. And so we've just seen some acceleration of that, but it's been fully expected.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP","Got it. Okay. Yes, that helps. Final question, just to revisit the balance sheet exercise that you went through, and thanks for talking about that, that's very interesting. Is there some way that you can quantify for us the ROE impact over the next year or 2 of having made the changes that you've made, assuming that you can do what you want to do with CCAR?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So obviously, we can't predict future CCAR results, and so that's difficult to assess. I think when you think about how any firm, certainly Goldman Sachs, needs to manage capital in an environment of multiple constraints, it's about finding the right place to comply with the rules, and at the same time, building maximum flexibility, so you can be there for your clients when they need you to be. And when you have excess capital, be in a position to return it. And that's what all these exercises are about.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP","So you didn't -- you didn't undertake it with the thought that if you optimize in this way, you could add 100, 200, 300 basis points, over time, to ROE in a normalized environment. It's more about, as you said, being prepared to provide more risk and remediation when the markets call for that, that type of thing?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So the way I would think about it is, less figuring out a target in terms of capital flexibility and the CCAR process, because again, we don't have much visibility, we don't know what next year's test is going to look like. The key driver of the exercise is the dialogue we have with clients as we undertake it. And so as we work through that process and we feel the capacity is there, then obviously, it's the more efficient way to deploy our capital. And so we'll see how future CCAR tests go, but look, certainly having more capacity in terms of flexibility is preferred, but again, the key driver is going to be how our clients -- what our clients need from our balance sheet. And as I said earlier, in this case, we're able to reduce the $25 billion out of the matched book.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC.","Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I just have 2 questions, please. One was regarding the deductions, because I was surprised that the look-through, although fully phased-in, ratio hadn't improved more. Could you just go through those again? I think you mentioned an $8 billion number, but then also a $9 billion number. And then the second question was really on the non-compensation expenses underlying. They seem pretty steady, give or take, taking out litigation in the last 3 or 4 quarters. Is there a target to keep them flat over a period of time, and is there quite a lot going on in the background for that to happen?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Okay. So I'm really glad you asked the first question, because I certainly don't want to leave anybody confused on this topic. Those are different numbers. That's the important takeaway, they're different numbers. The first number, the $8 billion, that relates to the dollars in funds that we need to ultimately remove from those funds as we harvest alongside our clients to comply with the Volcker Rule. And the reason I highlighted that in the last call, it's roughly $9 billion, now it's a bit north of $8 billion, was when you look at our financial disclosure, you would see roughly a $14 billion number in terms of total investments. But there are capital, there are capital allowances, there are assets that are already public, there are other funds that are approved, and so I just want to make sure you have some scale. And that number has moved down to roughly $8 billion since January. Okay, that's one number. They just happen to be very close in size. Under the Basel III capital rules, you get a certain allocation for which you are allowed to have dollars invested in what they call significant financial institutions. For us, that is a dollar-for-dollar deduction from capital that is $9 billion. Now as we comply with the Volcker Rule, that $9 billion comes out just side-by-side, which is why we give you some sense of that and its future impact on our capital ratios. Is that clear?","Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just to clarify, the $9 billion deduction under the calculation you disclosed hasn't really moved because of maybe some other offsetting factors? Or...","Harvey M. Schwartz","Okay. So that number is driven by the aggregate. And so that number, again, is a different number versus the $8 billion that is still in funds but isn't yet public, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So that includes, for example, that includes assets that are already taken public but are still sitting in the funds and they're working through the sell-down process. And just remind me, what was your second question, Fiona? I'm sorry.","Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just on the non-compensation expenses, if you strip out litigation they're very flat over a long period of time.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Yes. So we're staying very focused on non-comp. As you know, several years ago, we went through an exercise to take out roughly $2 billion of cost out of the enterprise. At this stage, we continue to stay very focused on it, but there hasn't been any material movement.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So I just wanted to kick things off with, actually, a big picture FICC-related question. So shortly after Basel III and Dodd-Frank, at a number of investor conferences, you guys highlighted, I suppose, the potential opportunity for FICC industry fee growth in the context of the paradigms, let's call it, of FX and equity electronification, suggesting that we could actually see some improvement in the revenue backdrop. And I thought it was quite telling where, flash forward to the Bernstein Conference last month, I felt as though your comments, as well as Gary's, were a bit more measured on the long-term outlook. And Gary specifically highlighted some challenges to FICC digitization, and relating to that, he even made some explicit references to TRACE. And the TRACE experience, I guess, in my mind, is more of a cautionary tale where you saw really meaningful spread compression in terms of corporate bond pricing and only a modest volume improvement, resulting in a net revenue decline. So we're now 4 years into the adjustment process within FICC, and I'm wondering whether your fundamental outlook for the FICC industry has changed, and more specifically, whether we should even read into Gary's explicit references to TRACE in the context of your views on FICC.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Okay. So let's back up and let's just take history into context a bit. In FICC, and actually in Equities, the advancements in technology, if you will, we would say that's been a secular change that's been in place for well, well over a decade. And whether it was in Equities where, back in what some people call the good old days, you have","$0.06, $0.065 commissions, which collapsed with electronification and decimalization and other rules that the regulators put in place, I don't remember, actually, Gary's explicit comments about TRACE, but I think his point was that when technology first gets adapted, there's an adjustment process that goes through. Now if you look at it over multiple years, I think our experience with TRACE would be similar to the experience we saw in the government bond market with Tradeweb, and the same as I described with Equities where you go through a market adjustment period, but for example, in our, in TRACE, again, I don't remember exactly Gary's comments, but I think he was mostly speaking about the high-yield market when it first came onboard. At first, when TRACE came onboard, I think it was actually disruptive to liquidity. That was the feedback we got from clients. But then as the market adjusted, over time, we actually found that our leverage finance and high-yield franchise got stronger. Now I could give you a whole host of examples like that. Again, the government bond market, when we started trading government bonds on Tradeweb, everyone said that business was over, just like, by the way, they said the same thing when the euro was created. And over time, these businesses have generally -- we've been in a position where we've been able to provide more value to our clients, enhance liquidity to our clients. Now in terms of the last couple of years, obviously, the regulators have been quite effective, and I think they deserve a lot of credit for deploying clearing. We're in the early stages of swap execution facilities. It's not our sense that those things have been headwinds for the business. This has really been much more climate-driven in terms of the low volatility, but it's something we stay quite focused on.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. So essentially, your view hasn't really shifted?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Now, that was a long-winded answer, but you did ask for big picture, so I apologize if that was...","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","No, it's extremely helpful, so I appreciate it.","Harvey M. Schwartz","No problem.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And then shifting gears and moving on to preferred issuance and your capital structure. So you noted that you had issued $2 billion in the preferreds in the quarter, and to my knowledge, you're the only universal bank which is actually at the 150-basis-point RWA target that's contemplated under Basel III, which -- I guess I can interpret it 2 different ways: either you've taken advantage of the cheap cost of issuing, perhaps, in the current backdrop and have no intention of tapping the market anytime soon; or, in an effort to cover the current SLR shortfall, which currently exists, you actually plan on issuing additional prefs from here in order to optimize your capital structure. I was hoping you could at least explain what's driving the preferred issuance plans going forward.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Yes. So I think the simple question are we full, we'll assess it as we go forward. You also saw in the quarter that we launched a tender for trust preferreds, which is capital that under the Basel rules didn't qualify. And so you should think of this as adjusting in terms of -- again, in complying in response to the regulation, so trust preferreds aren't considered valuable capital and so you'll see preferreds come into the mix.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","But do you have any intention of issuing additional preferreds from here? At least in, call it, the next -- in the near to intermediate term, because you are essentially full?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Yes. We'll continue to evaluate it and we'll see how we proceed. But again, this is all part of our capital planning and consistent with our CCAR plan, so...","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then just one last one for me on the topic of, I guess, the term that we've used internally is bindingness, but the need for U.S. SIFIs to manage to the multiple binding capital constraints that you had talked about earlier. And as far as we can tell, there's 4 constraints that really seem to matter. So you have the 2 risk-based targets, advanced and standardized, and clearly, you screen quite well in those metrics. Separately, we look at CCAR. And clearly, you've been able to support outsized payouts over the last couple of years while getting past the stress test. And then, lastly, we have the SLR. And your comments indicated that you could -- that pro forma, I suppose the reduction in the Basel III deductions to financial institutions, that you'll be just above the 5%. But when looking at required capital levels, it looks as though it's actually going to be highest under the SLR. And while I don't want to ask you for, once again, for an explicit ROE target, I wanted to get a sense as to how you're thinking about the relevant binding constraints and how you plan on -- whether you plan on optimizing your capital position based on the 4 that, I guess, I had just mentioned.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Okay. So as you mentioned, there are a number of constraints, mostly risk-based, right? CCAR, Basel III, standardized -- I'm sorry, advanced, standardized, a bit mix, but also risk-based, and then non-risk-based, which is the bucket I would put the leverage ratio or leverage test into. In terms of the supplementary leverage ratio, because we would agree with you, based on the Basel III advanced and standardized, lots of capacity at this stage. So let's begin honing on the supplementary leverage ratio. A couple of factors. Again, we haven't seen the final rule, so we'll have to see the final rule in the context of the denominator. We don't have to fully comply until 2018 and so the reason I give you the natural adjustment that will happen in terms of the $9 billion coming out of funds is because it's such a tax on the current capital position. And so as that comes out, you can see the flexibility. Now because we haven't seen the final rule, we haven't really taken any steps to mitigate it. As you know, our policy is to see the final rule, and when we see the final rule or have some very strong sense of the final rule, then we're willing to look at how we should comply. Now how do we do that? And we've talked about this in the past, but we'll, we begin, again, by providing tools to the businesses, and then as a leadership group, we figure out the best way to deliver capital to our clients, and at the same time, comply with the rules. Now CCAR obviously as an annual test, last year for us, was a binding constraint. And so you'll see us adjust there as we can as well.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So how do I reconcile those comments that the rules haven't been finalized, so you haven't been actively mitigating, with the balance sheet reduction that we saw in the quarter?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So as I said, the leverage ratio has an impact there, but also CCAR a significant factor.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Just a quick follow-up, maybe just on the balance sheet question. It was very helpful, you talked about the matched book coming down $25 billion, but the total balance sheet down $55 billion. Could you give any color on the other $30 billion?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So it's $56 billion in total, roughly $25 billion out of the matched book. It was various back-and-forth items in terms of just basically things, as I said, mostly secured client financings, client cash, things like that.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. Just kind of broad-based. And then if we think about the...","Harvey M. Schwartz","Again, the takeaway, low ROA, Jim.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Right. Right. No, I here you. And then on the -- just not to beat a dead horse in the SLR, just wanted to make sure I understand this. Sequentially, it seems like you didn't -- if I look at it the right way, it doesn't feel like you got a lot of benefit on the SLR from the reduced balance sheet. And is that a fair way to think about it? Is it just sort of a timing thing, because it's under the SLR guidelines it's average and you did most of that towards the end of the quarter or should we see more to go on the SLR in the next quarter? Just trying to run the math, it doesn't feel like there was a lot of benefit on the balance sheet reduction in SLR.","Harvey M. Schwartz","There were certainly benefits. The big things that factor into the SLR are...","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Obviously, derivatives.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Correct. And so when I say that we haven't taken any steps to comply with those rules, we're going to wait until we see the final rules on that before we really begin to address that. That really has to do with credit derivatives and the way various maturities are treated.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Right. And you haven't really done much there in terms of whether it's compression trades, things like that yet, as you await the final rules, is that sort of the takeaway?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So compression trades have obviously picked up over the last, call it, year or so within the industry. But again, in terms of addressing that item, we really want to see the final rule before we take any steps.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. So there still could be more to come there?","Harvey M. Schwartz","I would expect that.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And then lastly on SACCR, do you still think it's 10 to 15 or have you refined that at all, in terms of the benefit? Because again, some of your peers have been more aggressive in saying it would help them more significantly.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Yes, I didn't include that in the numbers today. We're not -- it's not 100% clear to us that in the final rule, SACCR is going to be a component. It's no different than it was. I did mention it on the last call, but again...","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","The 10 to 15.","Harvey M. Schwartz","But again, I don't think we should necessarily -- we don't want to count things that aren't necessarily, we think, in the final rule. So we're just giving you kind of the mark-to-market on this today, and then we can give you adjustments because we know that other capital has to come out of the funds. So those are things we know. But if it does come to fruition, it's 10 or 15 basis points also.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Right. Okay. And then just switching gears, just last question. In asset management, seems like the performance definitely picked up. You've had good flows, particularly in Fixed Income, and Equities is doing better as well. But alternatives seem to be still be choppy, even though there's been industry-wide good flows, is that just still struggling performance there or just the type of funds you're offering? How do we think about -- seeing -- when -- how should we think about flows improving on the alternative side?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So when you -- so our alternative performance has been strong also. What you're seeing is the mix of the harvesting versus areas like fund-of-funds. And Dane and the team can give you a breakdown on sort of how those flows, but you can see the growth there also.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay, so it's more of the harvesting.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer & Co.","Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just curious if you can say -- I mean, $56 billion isn't a lot in assets, and if you view them as CCAR-onerous, surely every other financial institution in the world also views them as CCAR-onerous. So just curious, who took your side of the trade? Or, I mean, is it non-bank financials? Is it funds? Is it -- or is it just that it's a complete tear-up and those positions don't exist in the marketplace anymore?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Yes, it's a good question. So obviously, we have no visibility into our competitors' strategies and certainly how they're thinking about CCAR. I think that a lot's been written about the repo markets. Certainly, our $25 billion reduction in the matched book had no marginal impact in terms of the repo market, but I think this will be interesting to watch how it evolves because, as mentioned earlier, large banks have multiple constraints. Each bank will address their constraints, in they think the way that's most impactful for their clients. That's how we approached it. And so we'll have to see how it evolves in terms of, ultimately, if all firms adopted this strategy, what impact that has on liquidity and how liquidity gets provided, but it's very early in that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So a quick one, first, on the market piece. I think you had told Glenn it flowed through I&L, but can you give us a sense of how much the Equities revenues were impacted by the gains from that transaction?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So I'm happy to tell you, it was roughly $50 million in terms of market's contribution.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Perfect. And then insofar as the non-comp, just following up on Fiona's question, was there any impact from the sale of the reinsurance business from last year? So like when we look at '13 versus '14, how much should we think about dropping out of non-comp from the sale of businesses? And then if you could also maybe give us a sense of variable and fixed in that line might be helpful.","Harvey M. Schwartz","You can see in the insurance line in the expense base, and then if you check the earnings release, I think we have the detail there. But the reinsurance revenues for the first half of last year were roughly $315 million, I think, $317 million to be specific, but we can give you the full number. But Dane can follow through on the insurance reserves that came out. When you actually look at it, 6 months to 6 months, year-over-year, when you look at that sale, basically, revenues are pretty much flat year-to-year. We replaced that with, obviously, other activity in the franchise.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes. No, I'm sorry, I was asking about the non-comp side, on the expense, but okay. And then last one, quickly, is security services. So you guys are tracking to be up a bit here on last year, but pretty well below still prior years. And so I just was kind of curious as to what maybe might be driving that sort of moderate bounceback, given markets at peak levels and some competitors highlighting some strength in that business.","Harvey M. Schwartz","So in terms of our prime services business, that franchise feels incredibly strong to us in terms of its differentiating characteristics. In terms of performance, that'll be driven by a number of factors: balances, the degree to which market participants are short and borrow stock. And so I think it just really reflects the current environment.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So you think it's far more cyclical and not anything specific to the franchise or anything, any changes that you guys have made?","Harvey M. Schwartz","No, definitely not. Definitely nothing in the franchise. As I said, the franchise feels quite good. Part of that business is about lending stock into short positions and sourcing short positions. And in this kind of marketplace, where it's been steadily rising and you have lower conviction, you don't see as much of that performance. But the franchise feels quite good.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones for me. Just in terms of the -- it looks like the pace of buybacks increased a little bit this quarter, perhaps that was just a second quarter phenomenon coming out of the CCAR approval. But I'm just curious as to how you all are thinking about potential buybacks through the course of the year, given that you got a pretty sizable, about 5 quarters of buybacks, available at this point.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Right. So we did $1.25 billion, as I mentioned, in the quarter. And so -- again, one of the things in terms of the way we approach the capital planning is we really don't want our folks and our investors to think of stock repurchase as a dividend. So one of the things we don't do is we don't announce our stock repurchase capacity at the beginning of the year because we treat it dynamically, it'll be environment-driven. In this particular part of the environment where you see our capital ratios are very high, we just felt like we're in a position to return that capital, and that will be our philosophy going forward.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just a question on the operating risk, RWA. I think you mentioned last quarter that, that was about $90 billion. I guess I'm curious as to whether or not that's changed at all, given some of the litigation issues that have beset other companies. And obviously, you all have had a little bit of litigation running through the P&L as well.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Yes, so when we came off the Basel III parallel run, we didn't -- we weren't asked to make any significant adjustments to up risk capital. It hasn't moved materially quarter-over-quarter, but we will continue to assess it, and the extent to which we have isolated events and we take reserves, it will impact it accordingly.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Douglas Sipkin with Susquehanna.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just wanted to drill down a little bit on Fixed Income, both primary and secondary. First, I guess -- and so we have the Fed finally announcing they plan to be done with buying, I believe, in October. Anyone inside the organization thinking that could be a little bit of a catalyst for FICC, particularly volatility in treasuries, or is it still really more based on just overall market environment? Because it is continuing to feel like them in the market has been a hindrance for other levels of activity.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Well, I think if you were to look back 1 year ago, and I think it was May 22 in 2013, the initial announcements of tapering came out. I think you -- look, I think you have to consider it a pretty extraordinary success in terms of the way the Federal Reserve has navigated that announcement and the process and the way the market has responded to it. There was obviously some initial volatility because there was some uncertainty on what tapering means. Our sense is that it's been executed quite well. The market understands it. The communication has been good. And so, in a sense, I don't want to say anything is always fully baked in, but I think the market has adjusted to the notion of tapering and so there's not a lot of new information in it for the market to adjust to. Now of course, that's always in the context of what's happening in the global economy and political events and everything else, and so there's always other factors. But I think, narrowly defined, I think we'd call tapering a success.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","But just expanding on that, I mean just the fact that, potentially, they were maybe crowding out players in the market, and to the extent that doesn't exist anymore, you're not seeing that maybe as a little bit of a boost to the business, post-October or as we get closer to the deadline where they're done.","Harvey M. Schwartz","It's a factor. There are a number of factors. I think sentiment, global growth, what happens with volatilities and trends are bigger, but it's always -- it certainly is a factor.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just second question. Obviously, the banking continues to be very strong. The debt origination continues to be very resilient. It looks like Europe and maybe some of the high-yield markets in Europe have been really good this year, and I'm just wondering, for the longest time, people would talk about the potential disintermediation of the European lending market versus the bond market being a driver for your industry. I mean, is that something we're starting to see a little bit more of now, with some of the constraints on the banking sector there, that the bond market is picking up. Can you maybe elaborate a little on that, because it did look like European credit, particularly high yield, was really good for the industry this quarter?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So obviously, we've had a long commitment to our European business. And as they work through the geographic regions associated with their part of the crisis, certainly, we've seen opportunities to work very closely with clients. I think the shift from, as you -- we would call it and you would call it, bank-related financing, the debt capital markets, is something that's underway. But that's certainly, I think, a long-term trend and so we'll see it evolve over many years. Now where you have seen, obviously, a huge amount of immediately picked up activity across Europe, was basically in the equity capital markets. We obviously rank #1 there, but the amount of capital raised was pretty extraordinary in the quarter, over $180 billion, 600 [ph] deals in the first half of the year alone. And so there's a lot of activity in Europe.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Eric Edmund Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered. I just wanted to just follow up on your comments on the VaR. I'm just trying to reconcile the continued compression across volatility in most products, and well as some of the balance sheet reductions. And yet it would seem that some of the more -- well, basically all of the FICC products didn't seem to show too much movement, so I'm just trying to understand the dynamics.","Harvey M. Schwartz","So as I mentioned, quarter-over-quarter, the bigger mover was in Equities, and that was a combination of volatility and risk coming down. When you look across it, most of the movement in the quarter, when you look across the various asset classes, was more volatility-driven, again corresponding with the extremely low vol levels that we've talked about.","Eric Edmund Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And the -- so the balance sheet actions, I guess, didn't have much of a role. And I guess, is that reflected then in the limited changes around RWAs? Just...","Harvey M. Schwartz","Yes. So again, this is this important distinction between those regulatory measures that deal with things that are risk-based, like the Basel III rules, and those things that are not risk-based or not as much risk-based, like leverage tests. And so this was really, as I said, not risk-based parts of the balance sheet, low ROA portions of the balance sheet like the matched book.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Just 2 quick questions. On the Basel III ratios that you gave, what was the risk weighted assets for the advanced and standardized, and the breakdown there?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So in terms of the quarter, under the advanced, $592 billion, and under standardized, $619 billion.","Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then as you're repositioning the balance sheet, as well as looking forward to next year's CCAR, how do you think about the dry powder that you have with the excess capital that's available that could be deployed into the other businesses. When you submitted last year's CCAR, you were at like a 9.2% under the Basel III standardized. Is that the right way to think about the floor in the capital ratios that you would target to manage the business?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So as we've talked about in the past, we have a target of 9.5%, we're running at an 11.4% level, so clearly, we feel like we have more than enough capital capacity to deploy that capital. And so we feel like we have a lot of flexibility at this stage to respond to our clients' needs. In terms of future CCAR tests, we'll see how they go.","Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","But would that target move lower now, now that you're doing these balance sheet actions?","Harvey M. Schwartz","It's something we'll look at. It's possible, I certainly don't see it moving any higher.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.","Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Just a couple quick follow-ups here. So first, with respect to the comments on competitive positioning, debt underwriting, you highlighted it was a good market, but you guys have also been moving up the league tables quite a bit there, both within investment grade and high-yield, so that's also showing up within results. So would you attribute that to something that Goldman is doing specifically in those businesses, just given, maybe, better economics, or are peers becoming less competitive, which is creating openings? Just trying to get some perspective there. And then with respect to deal financing, it doesn't sound like that there's any issues that you're seeing, but do you expect any impact just from greater regulatory pressure on the more highly levered deals?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So in terms of our position, obviously, we've been participating in some large significant transactions, and the more that you see -- the more you see financing driven by advisory activity or merger activity, given our role in that marketplace, you'd expect us to be more significantly involved. Now obviously, the debt business has been a very important business to Goldman Sachs for a number of years. Historically, we haven't been the most aggressive lender certainly, we haven't felt the risk return in terms of that activity. But you know, in the most important transactions, where content and execution are at a premium, we've done a pretty good job of staying involved. We won't always be, but we've done a pretty good job. In terms of -- I mean, you're talking specifically about the leverage finance rules. Again, a bit of a work in progress. Obviously, a very significant focus for the regulators. I think this is one of these things where the market, over time, will find its way in terms of those clients that want to use significant leverage. But at this stage, I think the whole market and the industry is sort of adjusting and working its way through. I think at this stage, it hasn't -- it certainly hasn't impacted people's ability to get transactions done in the way they want to get them done.","Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","I appreciate the color. And then just secondly, just maybe coming at the balance sheet topic again. I really appreciate all the detail in the prior questions. But when thinking about the mechanics of the ROE and what's going to drive it higher over time, just from a really simplistic perspective, profit margins are already back to where they were in 2007, and so it sounds like improving asset productivity is going to be the primary contributor. But when you look at the mix of businesses today at the firm, is there anything that has changed where you feel like there should be further upside in profit margin from where we were during the prior cycle?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So as we've talked about, we feel like we have significant operating leverage from here. Maybe the best way to characterize that, it's a bit of a blunt metric, but if you look at our compensation ratio, call it, post-crisis versus pre-crisis, it's been averaging 900 basis points lower. And so it's a pretty significant change in the cost structure of the firm in terms of the steps that we've taken, and yet when you, and I think this is really important to underscore, when you look at our results and you look at our relative position in M&A, or as mentioned, in the debt activity or certainly in equity, our performance in Institutional Client Services or the growth in asset management, we've been able to achieve all that simultaneously. And that's with certain of our businesses, particularly Equities and Fixed Income, really in a low vol kind of a headwind-oriented environment. And so if we went through a period where we saw revenue tailwinds, we feel like we're well-positioned in terms of our clients and the franchise, and certainly, there's meaningful upside in terms of operating leverage.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Andrew Lim with Societe Generale.","Andrew Lim - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Sorry to flog a dead horse, but small questions on SLR. Do you have particular targets in mind going towards in 2014, or indeed, towards the 2015 CCAR for what SLR you envisage?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So certainly, no targets yet. We want to see, again, the final rule. And again, I think the regulators have done a very thoughtful thing here. In terms of the compliance, given there's a multi-year compliance glide path, if you will, to 2018, we haven't set a target yet. When we see the final rule, we'll work with it, like we have with all the other rules, and then we'll eventually have a target that we'll manage to. As I said earlier, without really taking significant steps, right now, when you add up all the math, the preferred, the balance sheet exercise, and obviously, the capital that will come out from the significant financial institution deduction, we see ourselves achieving something that's in excess of 5%, but there's no target set yet.","Andrew Lim - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Right, I see. And in terms of managing that SLR, can you state explicitly whether you can issue more preferred stock over and above that 150 basis point limit on RWAs for the purposes of contributing to the numerator in your SLR?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So I think we have the flexibility, I don't know necessarily that -- again, we'll see the final rule. I don't know necessarily whether it will be a preferred, to use that language, our preferred approach in terms of complying with the rule.","Andrew Lim - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","So it's not your preferred approach, but you can do if you wanted to, is that correct?","Harvey M. Schwartz","I believe we have the capacity. But again, that would be also something that any firm would have to work through with their CCAR plan, et cetera, right? We're just talking about capital management outside of CCAR, right? So we're being very specific now.","Andrew Lim - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Okay. Okay. And then, sorry, how much could you reduce your balance sheet by if you reduced your compression trades, theoretically?","Harvey M. Schwartz","I don't know the number off the top of my head. Sorry.","Andrew Lim - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Right. Okay. And then very lastly, just thinking about catalysts to turning around the weak trading environment, obviously, we're living in a world of very low volatility. I think you yourselves and other banks talk about a subdued economic environment causing this low volatility, but to my mind, it's not really that bad. Global economic growth is still positive, and especially in the U.S. and the U.K. I mean what do we really need to get a turnaround in volatility in trading volumes? Are we missing other catalysts here to fall into place?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So in the end, it's going to be economic growth. And look, I agree with you, we've come off a very low level in terms of economic growth and it's positive. But economic growth in the long-term is really what's going to drive sentiment and sentiment will drive activity and not all businesses participate in sentiment in the same way. Again, we've seen a big sentiment shift year-over-year in terms of the way CEOs are thinking about merger advisory activity. Hard to tell when that sentiment shift will change in terms of driving more position changes in terms of the way people think about their portfolios. We'll see.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.","Harvey M. Schwartz","So again, since there are no more questions, I and the team, we just want to thank all of you for joining the call. Hopefully, we'll get to talk to you, and myself and other members of management will get to see you in the coming months. Of course, if there are any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to Dane. Otherwise, everyone, enjoy the rest of your day, and look forward to speaking with you on the next call.

Marty?","Martin Chavez","Thanks Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in.","I'll walk you through the second quarter and first half results then I'll be happy to answer any questions. In the second quarter, we produced net revenues of $7.9 billion, net earnings of $1.8 billion, earnings per diluted share of $3.95 and an annualized return on common equity of 8.7%.","Taking a step back to review our year-to-date results, we had firmwide net revenues of $15.9 billion, net earnings of $4.1 billion, earnings per diluted share of $9.10 and a return on common equity of 10.1%.","As you can see, the first six months of 2017 reflected improved performance. We were able to achieve this despite what continues to be a challenging operating environment in certain businesses. Our revenues were up more than $1.6 billion or 12% compared with the first half of last year.","Meanwhile expenses were up only 6% demonstrating the positive operating leverage that is embedded within our operation. Despite a difficult backdrop for our FICC business, the firm grew pretax margin by 340 basis points, versus last year and our ROE increased 260 basis points.","The improvement stems from having a diversified set of leading global businesses. Weakness in FICC particularly in commodities was offset by stronger results in investing in lending, investment management and underwriting.","As all of you are aware, many of the themes that we discussed during the first quarter continued into the second, rising market values and low volatility. On one hand, rising market prices were supportive of capital markets activity, investment management performance and our investing and lending activities.","We recorded our third best quarterly revenue performance in debt underwriting, reflecting our multiyear effort to improve our relative positioning with our clients.","Another area of strength is investment management, where we posted record management and other fees and assets under supervision and investing and lending generated $1.6 billion of revenues in the quarter with net interest income within debt securities and loans reaching more than $400 million.","On the other hand, low levels of volatility sequentially lower in several fixed asset classes, negatively affected the FICC environment. The current backdrop has been particularly challenging for our FICC franchise creating headwinds in areas that are core strength of the firm.","For example, we are a market leader in commodities, but it was a challenging environment on multiple fronts. In addition, our clients place significant value on the firm's long-standing commitment to market making as well as our strength in derivatives. The client activity levels understandably declined given the low volatility environment.","With that as a broad overview, let's now discuss individual business performance in greater detail. Investment banking produced second quarter net revenues of $1.7 billion up slightly compared to the first quarter. Our investment banking backlog increased since the end of the first quarter.","Breaking down the components of investment banking in the second quarter, advisory revenues were $749 million, roughly flat for the first quarter. Year-to-date Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&A.","We advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the second quarter, including C. R. Bard's $24 billion sale to Becton Dickinson. Amazon's $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods and DuPont Fabros Technology's $7.6 billion merger with Digital Realty Trust.","We also advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the second quarter, including Syngenta's $43.6 billion sale to ChemChina, HPE's $13.5 billion spinoff and merger of its enterprise services business with Computer Sciences and Private Bancorp's $5 billion sale to CIBC.","Moving to underwriting, net revenues were $981 million in the second quarter up 4% on a sequential basis. Equity underwriting revenues were $260 million down 16% quarter-over-quarter due to lower follow-on offerings.","Debt underwriting revenues of $721 million reflected continued strength across all products and were up 13% relative to the first quarter. During the second quarter, we actively supported our client's financing needs participating in QUALCOMM's $11 billion bond offering in support of its acquisition of NXP.","Intrum Justitia's \u20ac3 billion bond offering in support of the combination with Lindor and Banco Macro's $766 million follow-on offering.","Turning to institutional client services, which comprises both our FICC and equities businesses; net revenues were $3.1 billion in the second quarter down 9% compared to the first quarter.","FICC client execution net revenues were $1.2 billion in the second quarter down 31% sequentially as volatility and client conviction remained low and led to weaker client activity quarter-over-quarter. All of our businesses produced lower net revenues quarter-over-quarter.","Rates was down significantly. Credit, mortgages and currencies all declined. Across many of these products, volatility trended lower in the quarter and clients were less active. Commodities was also significantly lower and was our worst quarter on record.","Not surprisingly given the results, it was a difficult quarter on all fronts. The market backdrop was challenged. Client activity remained light and we didn't navigate the market as well as we aspire to or as well as we have in the past. Nevertheless, the firm remains committed in every way to help our clients manage their commodity risk.","Now moving to equities, which include equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the second quarter were $1.9 billion up 13% sequentially. Equities client execution net revenues of $687 million were up 24% compared to first quarter due to stronger results in cash products.","The business continued to operate in an environment with global equity market strength. Commissions and fees were $764 million up 4% versus the first quarter as volumes increased modestly. Security services generated net revenues of $441 million up 15% quarter-over-quarter due to seasonally stronger client activity.","Turning to risk, average daily VaR in the second quarter was $51 million down from $64 million in the first quarter, the byproduct of lower volatility levels.","Moving on to our investing and lending activities collectively, these businesses produced net revenues of $1.6 billion in the second quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $1.2 billion reflecting sales, corporate performance and gains in public equity investments.","Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $396 million and as I mentioned before, included more than $400 million of net interest income.","In investment management, we reported second quarter net revenues of $1.5 billion. This was up 2% from the first quarter, primarily as a result of higher management and other fees, which were a record for the quarter.","Assets under supervision increased $33 billion sequentially to a record $1.41 trillion. The increase primarily reflected $23 billion of net inflows in connection with the acquisition of a portion of Verus Investors and $17 billion of net market appreciation. This was partially offset by net outflows in liquidity products.","Now let me turn to expenses; compensation and benefits expense for the year-to-date, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits was accrued at a compensation to net revenues ratio of 41%.","This is the lowest first half accrual in our public history and a 100-basis points lower than the accrual in the first half of 2016. As we discussed last quarter, the reduction in the accrual rate reflects the completion of the nearly $900 million expense initiative that we announced last year. Second quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.1 billion down slightly from the first quarter.","Now I'd like to take you through a few key statistics for the second quarter. Total staff was approximately 34,100 unchanged from the first quarter. Our effective tax rate for the year-to-date was 19.1%. If you exclude the tax benefit related to the settlement of equity awards, our effective tax rate for the year-to-date would have been roughly 29%.","Our global core liquid assets ended the second quarter at $221 billion and our balance sheet and level III assets were $907 billion and $21 billion respectively. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.5% under the Basel 3 advanced approach on a transitional basis and 12.2% on a fully phased-in basis.","It was 13.9% using the standardized approach on a transitional basis and 13.5% on a fully phased-in basis. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 6.3% and finally we repurchased 6.6 million shares of common stock for $1.5 billion in the quarter.","For the four quarters CCAR cycle for 2016, we provided shareholders with nearly $7 billion of capital through share buybacks and common stock dividends. In terms of this year's CCAR test, the Federal Reserve Board did not object to our plan, which includes the potential for share repurchases, an increase in our common stock dividend and the issuance and redemption of capital securities. We are pleased with this outcome and believe we have flexibility to manage our capital going forward.","Now for some brief summary comments. The first half of 2017 provided two important reminders. First is the value of having a leading diversified franchise. Despite a difficult first half of 2017, where one of our major businesses FICC, we posted 12% year-over-year revenue growth and a 10.1% return on common equity.","In addition, we were able to produce $9.10 of earnings per diluted share. We benefited from leading positions in many of our businesses and while their relative performance may vary in any individual quarter, their collective value has been central to our outperformance over the long-term.","The second reminder is the ongoing and long-term benefits associated with being a prudent manager of both cost and capital. Over the last several years, we've been looking for ways to operate more efficiently. This includes shifting our organizational footprint to different locations such as Salt Lake City where we now have more than 2,300 people.","It is meant leveraging technology to improve internal productivity and find engagement. It has also meant returning more than $35 billion of capital since the beginning of 2012 and in the process creating our lowest ever share count.","This has positioned the firm to provide more operating leverage to shareholders and it has also given us the capacity to make strategic investments such as markets and expand our investment management business by acquisition.","Ultimately, we know that by recruiting and retaining the best people and providing our clients with the best advice and service, we are well positioned to outperform over the long-term. Our commitment to these ideal is unwavering.","Thank you again for dialing in and with that, let's move to the Q&A portion of the conference call. I am happy to answer all of your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] Our next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Glenn Schorr","Hi thanks very much.","Martin Chavez","Good morning, Glenn.","Glenn Schorr","Good morning. So, I definitely heard all the commentary on FICC and I think commodities is one of the things that stands out that's makes you different than the others, but maybe we could talk about the mix of clients and how much that adds to may be the differentiated performance that we're seeing meaning you see more volatility dependent right.","We've talked about in the past and when VaR's low your revenue struggle more than others. Is there anything that Goldman can do to broaden the mix of both clients and products to be less volatility dependent.","In the past, you had a relationship with Sumitomo that brought a bigger lending mix. I am just thinking out loud.","Martin Chavez","Sure Glenn. Obviously, that's a question on our mind as well as yours and so to step back for a moment, while there are nuances and everyone's franchise is a bit different as we all know, our franchise emphasizes providing liquidity to active asset managers.","So, it really isn\u2019t just a question of low volatility. It's more a sequence of low volatility, less dispersion, less client activity, reduced opportunity set and lower revenues. Also, as you mentioned and I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have a leading commodities business, which has a greater weight in our franchise than in other franchises.","And it was a challenging backdrop for commodities really challenging on all fronts and in addition, while it was a potentially better business environment for mortgages year-on-year, we have a smaller way of mortgages in our franchise. So those are some effects that are likely there.","To get to the second part of your question on actions that one can take, I can tell you that everyone in our FICC business is intensely focused on this topic and at a granular, molecular level working on it as are all of us in the leadership team.","So much of it is blocking and tackling. So, in no particular order, we're looking to see where potentially there are gaps in our client coverage and onboard new clients and serve them. Also, the ongoing question in every business generally is how do we do better with the clients who are already clients of the firm.","How can we cover them better? How can we have a greater impact with them? How can we provide them new solutions to their challenges and that is really an iterative process of communicating with the clients?","Our business starts and ends with them and those communicating with them, coming up with new products, technologies, tools, analytics, workflows and iterating that we have on offering that is what they're looking for and that's something that we're going to continue doing and we're totally committed to it.","Glenn Schorr","Maybe the related follow-up is more cyclical than that structural peace and just I guess I would scratch my head at times and say why is volatility so low like theoretically we've been waiting for this inflection 0.4. The U.S. to be off QE to start raising rates, which is different than what's going on in Europe and Asia.","You've had some currency movements, some commodity. You would have through this would've been a better valuable backdrop and people would've wanted you liquidity, but it's not happening.","Martin Chavez","I am sorry, I interrupted.","Glenn Schorr","No, I don't know. Are we hooked on idiosyncratic events and actually these asset class moves aren't good enough?","Martin Chavez","What I would say there Glenn is really on predicting when anything will be different than it is just looking back historically one year ago exactly at this time, I don't think any one of us would've predicted the strong client activity, market environment of the second half of 2016.","It arrived and we had the capacity to serve our clients when they became more active on the back of any number of events happening globally. As for the environment generally, one can think of a number of possible drivers that would -- that would change the environment, some things that would potentially be supportive.","The greater client activity would be of course economic growth, confidence, pro-growth policies, but ultimately our business is driven by the clients and their activities.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Martin Chavez","Thank you, Glenn.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Martin Chavez","Good morning, Michael.","Michael Carrier","Good morning. Just one more question on the FICC side. You mentioned in terms of looking at the business and maybe some of the client gaps the market share. I guess when we look at the first half of '17 its weak and maybe commodities is a bigger part of that.","But I think even in '16 when we look at the global competitors, it seems like the FICC business has been a little bit more challenged. So, I am just trying to figure out how far along to gain that process is the management team or is the FICC franchise in terms of reassessing whether it's a client, the product mix to try to diversify and broaden some of the growth opportunities?","Martin Chavez","Well it's a good question and so let's go into some other effects that may be going on here and also caveated by saying that we don't have transparency into our competitor's FICC businesses, but I'll note that historically we'd had strength in derivatives and this was a weak quarter like the first quarter for derivatives.","Also, it's likely that some of our competitors have bigger corporate footprints than we do as well as bigger financing footprints than we do and so while four of our business in FICC has been as I mentioned providing liquidity to active asset managers, it isn't a matter of just focusing on active asset managers and having a leading active manager franchise.","It's also a question of how we can deepen our impact with the clients and have a leading cash offering as well. So, it isn't one or the other. It's a question of doing both. Similarly talking about asset managers, we can have a great asset manager franchise and a great corporate franchise and working on both.","And so, this is something that all of us are evaluating and making changes and working on and we're committed to it. We know we need to do better.","Michael Carrier","Okay. And then just a follow-up I guess on CCAR and just capital priorities, given the combination of some of the maybe challenges on the trading side, but then also just evaluation of the stock, is there anything changed in terms of how much you guys are focused on capital return verses reinvesting in the business, M&A activity and if there is areas I know you guys been active on the asset management side, but anything else on that front?","Martin Chavez","Well just a few thoughts on CCAR. We learned a lot going through the process for a few years now and without question the process makes the industry safer and sounder. This year, the Federal Reserve's analysis showed that the 34 banks could withstand $0.5 trillion in stress losses and continue lending to the clients.","It's a robust process and it's evolving every year and ultimately regulators have the authority for capital. Of course, we have our view and detailed analytics of what's the right amount of capital to hold.","At various times in the past, as you know, we've resubmitted on CCAR, which is another way of saying that we believed that we had more excess capital than we could return or deploy. This year we did not resubmit and we deem it important to operate from a position of strength.","I have therefore excess capital and also to have excess capital to deploy to the clients and we're ready and looking forward to increase opportunity and increase client activity and therefore more opportunities to deploy capital.","Michael Carrier","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question is from line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Guy Moszkowski","Good morning, Marty.","Martin Chavez","Good morning, Guy.","Guy Moszkowski","So, you talked a lot about customer sets and just very, very low levels of volatility and activity and I think a lot of that is manifest to the market. So, we get that. That said, you've said now twice in last quarter's call and this one that you could've navigated the markets better and is that only with respect to commodities? Is that more broadly and can you just give us a little bit more color on what you mean by that?","Martin Chavez","Sure, so looking at our FICC businesses as we discussed, year-on-year they all declined except for mortgages and sequentially they all declined and while there are nuances, the primary driver across most of the businesses and I'll get to commodities in a moment, the primary driver for the decline sequentially or year-on-year was lower client activity with all the drivers that we discussed, lower volatility, less dispersion, less opportunity set.","Commodities as a story of challenges on all fronts and there it was lower client activity and also a difficult market-making environment as you know in market-making if I could use for a moment a store analogy though is more complex than the typical store, our clients we need to have in our store that the clients are seeking and we need to have a capacity to create the products that the clients are seeking and sometimes clients are also selling us products they go into the store, which is maybe different from a typical store.","And all of this is happening in a dynamic market environment where the value of all the products in the store is moving up and down and so managing that central problem of risk management in a market-making business requires choices and art and science and it's an uncertain process and you can make the choices and have less than good outcomes.","And so that's what I mean when I say it's challenging market environment and also, we didn't navigate the markets and making those choices as well as we -- as well as we want to and as well as we typically have.","Guy Moszkowski","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then turning the page to equities, which we haven't really talked about much, but where you actually had a pretty meaningful improvement relative to both of the reference quarters and looking in particular at the customer execution.","Are you starting to see some of the benefits of the investments that you've made in quant-oriented products? Did you just have a very successful period in terms of equity derivatives despite the fact that VaR wasn't greatly.","Actually, you said, cash products and it doesn\u2019t sound like it was that, maybe you can just give us a little bit more color for how you saw such a significant increase in execution results?","Martin Chavez","Guy, I would be very happy to go into some significant detail on our equities business. As you mentioned it was an environment of higher equity prices and low volatility and then you asked the questions why is this -- how is this different and I would note several things.","First, our volume held up rather well and you can see that in the commission line, which we break out. Then looking at the equities client execution line and you referenced this, we had a better cash results globally and beyond the U.S. we had better cash and derivatives results.","And we noticed our market share going up not just with our active manager client, but also the passive managers as for providing capital and equities client execution we observed increased demand around a variety of events. The European elections also as we noticed last year around the Brexit referendum in addition as it relates to equities client execution we observed a normalization in the markets in Asia.","And to get to another part of your question we are observing the positive results of investing over multiple quarters in both execution and in and in capital commitment and then in addition I would note corporate activity remained healthy and is typically not correlated with the activity of the active manager clients.","And so, I\u2019m referencing all of these because they're all interesting and useful observations and notions that we can apply in our other businesses. For example, in the fixed business we've already begun applying some of these and for instance U.S. corporate credit and now our extending it to Europe and into our other businesses.","Guy Moszkowski","So perfect. And just one more from me which is sort of part question part observation on the CCAR results. If the question is would you ever consider changing your policy to tell us what you were approved for like most of your peers do -- all your peers do. I think analyst investors are grown up enough to understand it's not a commitment that it's just an approval. But the observation part of it is I just don't think you\u2019re doing yourself any favors by not telling us?","Martin Chavez","Well I appreciate you\u2019re sharing that observation Guy and I\u2019m not going to make a prediction about what we will or won't do in the future. Obviously, we do think about this a lot and we have observed that the other banks who went through the CCAR process disclosed their authorizations.","We just see it as such dynamic process and as you said it's not a commitment and we know you understand that nevertheless because it's an authorization and were constantly reevaluating it we haven't disclosed it and that's where we are.","Guy Moszkowski","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jeff Hart with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Jeff Hart","Hey, good morning. My question is more on a macro level as we\u2019re looking at potential LCR and SLR easing. I\u2019m kind of sitting back trying to think how much LCR\/SRL easing could potentially increase the financing available to clients and therefore kind of boost trading volumes overall market activity.","But I guess I'm kind of looking back at 2Q 2014 we got the final SLR rule and we saw your repo book really kind of decline that quarter. How much would easing there help overall trading activities \u2013 kind of attracting trading activities as opposed to just helping Goldman Sachs I mean give a feel for how big an impact that had in your trading businesses back in 2Q 2014?","Martin Chavez","Oh sure, it\u2019s a great question. I\u2019ll just step back for a moment to observe the executive order and then the treasury report that followed it which I know all of us I have reviewed. There is order of 100 recommendations in that report as you know.","And about two-thirds of them roughly our activities that the regulators could undertake that don't require legislative authorization and the report did get a bit more specific on the ratios that you mentioned are particularly SLR and there's certainly been a lot of commentary and research out of the market about what changes to the SLR might create in terms of capacity.","And there's many views on this as you know SLR was the most binding metrics for us this year it was the first time that it was incorporated into the CCAR process although as to how the CCAR process will evolve with stress capital buffers and other proposals, but it\u2019s really not knowable.","We also note and you know that various regulators have expressed different views on recalibration for instance Governor Powell was broadly in favor and the Chairman of the FDIC Mr. Gruenberg not so.","And so, I wouldn't want to speculate too much beyond saying that if the treasury report\u2019s recommendations were to be adopted by the regulators and as I said that's not knowable right now, but if it were potentially a recalibration such as that might change the way that we think about our prime brokerage business and the matchbook business.","But as for how that will show up in client activity and revenues there's many inputs to client activity and this is just one.","Jeff Hart","If I mean \u2013 has the availability of financing the kind of active trading accounts been a meaningful deterioration I guess maybe problem over the last couple of years.","Martin Chavez","I wouldn't say it's a problem it's just we\u2019re continuously evolving and responding to the regulatory environment capital plan it\u2019s a planning processes it\u2019s complex, it\u2019s nonlinear it\u2019s changing and not sure that that any of this has really much of an affect on whether there are alpha opportunities for the active managers.","Jeff Hart","Okay thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Betsy Graseck","Hey good morning.","Martin Chavez","Good morning Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","Two questions just one you mentioned in our prepared remarks that some of what you think you'll be doing or focusing on as an organization is just play no blocking and tackling could you just give a sense as to what you mean by that I have my own views but I wanted to understand what you meant by that?","Martin Chavez","Sure, so blocking and tackling is actually a very broad topic and a lot of this is just what any business would do. It's our people across the firm at all levels of seniority meeting with clients.","There is no substitute for going to visit clients and talking with them and understanding their objectives, their benchmarks, their challenges things that are working for them, things that are not, understanding how they see the value that we\u2019re adding to them whether it's in liquidity provision or other services.","Understanding ways in which we can have a better engagement with them and for instance a topic that we've been working on for some time now ways of extending and sharing our analytics and data with them as a way of bringing them the relationship strengthening the relationship and leading potentially to more activities.","So, there is certainly just this aspect of that\u2019s constantly changing because the client needs and requirements are changing for risk management products and services and the format, the package, the way in which they want those services delivered and the only way to know about that is to work with the clients at various levels front, middle and back across the client organization, engage with them and iterate.","We've done this in other businesses as I just mentioned we've seen the fruits of doing this and for instance are equities business which is led to new offerings over the last few years but it's really something that applies very broadly across our businesses.","And investment banking a few years ago we identified an opportunity to do better with our clients and to cover more clients and debt capital markets. And you\u2019ve seen the results of that multiyear effort in our league table rankings and in our revenues in investment management, the opportunity to provide holistic solutions to clients for instance CIO outsourcing on and to deliver that organically as well as through acquisitions.","And so that's an example and really, we see all of these approaches and techniques as applying very broadly across all our businesses and there is a huge emphasis in doing that in our FICC business as well.","Betsy Graseck","Got it, okay. And then just separately switching gears to Marcus, there's been some contrary I think Lloyd and others have talked about, the take a rate that you've had.","Could you give us a sense of progression from here, are you looking for the same level of growth that you've been able to generate and how much over the course of the next couple of years do you anticipate taking your risk capital and applying it to utilizing in Marcus?","Martin Chavez","So, as you know with Marcus, we saw an opportunity not the very long ago given our market position, our strength in technology and analytics and that fact that we didn't have bricks-and-mortar branches or legacy systems or credit card and just looking at all of the activity in this burgeoning world of digital consumer finance, we saw an opportunity.","And we put together deliberate methodical organic plan. Lloyd mentioned some of our progress according to that plan where we crossed the billion-dollar threshold in loan balances and this customer centric plan is progressing and we're executing according to plan. We don't have loan balance targets and we're excited about this business and believe that it can generate high-teen ROEs.","Just stepping back, like to take a minute to put Marcus in a broader context of all the ways that we're seeking and delivering growth opportunities for the firm.","First one is the market, another one is expanding the franchise, another would be improving our relative positioning and then also new products and opportunities even in our mature competitive market such as banking, institutional client services, investment management there is opportunities to close market share gaps, improve the client mix, do better with the clients and we've taken purposeful op actions to make that happen.","There is in the area of the consumer a number of new opportunities that we're evaluating including Marcus which is the first example and an opportunity to leverage our strong brand into areas beyond our traditional franchise and Marcus is one such greenfield opportunity where we don't need a leading market share for it to be a significant opportunity for us.","Betsy Graseck","And then last, does it help with CCAR at all?","Martin Chavez","I\u2019m sorry, could you repeat that, I didn\u2019t hear that.","Betsy Graseck","The markets revenue stream, the NII associated with it, does that help at all with CCAR there an opportunity to improve the optionality in the capital structure by having this type of revenue stream come through?","Martin Chavez","I think it's a little too early to answer you on that when Betsy. Marcus really isn't - it's not a material NII story at this point its really much more return on attributed equity story and as you know CCAR is included constantly evolving process.","Betsy Graseck","Sure. Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning, Marty. Thanks for taking the question. I got a follow-up on FICC. So, you spoke to the market making and issues of setting risk book but just wanted to dig in a little because sequentially bar is down for you guys but yet stable at many of your money center competitors which I would think should normalize for market volatility.","So, could you square those two factors going on? Did something happen where early on the market making difficulties you ran into were early on in the quarter and then you guys cut back a bit on the balance sheet that's what lead to the bar decline versus peers sequentially? How do that all shake outer or any increase color will be helpful?","Martin Chavez","Everyone's approach to bar in the way in which people incorporate bar into the businesses is different. We don't have bar targets and bar is an output of client\u2019s activity, client demand for capital as we discussed and as you noted it declined from $64 million to $51 million sequentially, so call it 20% and looking across the product areas, really, it's lower volatility as the main driver in currencies, there's a bit of a positional driver in addition to the ball driver.","And then also there is a diversification effect so there was increased correlation and just the change in the bar as its measured in the different product areas but led to a change in diversification effect so that was a small contribution to bar. But really, it's not a matter of cutting it back. It's just a matter of - there was less client demand for the bar capacity.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. And then another follow-up here on the commodity comments that you made earlier. So, a few years ago, Goldman disclosed to breakdown of your FICC business with commodities being roughly 8% of ICS revenues.","It seems as though your commentary suggests that that has increased in recent years. Can you give us a sense about how large you think on average that's trended over the last couple of years versus this several years ago disclosure at this point?","Martin Chavez","So, I would just observe that out of the 73 quarters that we've been a public company, it was the worst quarter for the commodities business and we don't break out further - the contribution of the individual product lines.","There is a lot of reasons for that but really, we just think of it as a business that serves the clients holistically across a number of different products. And that's where I\u2019ll leave it.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. Is it possible just to clarify a bit here. Was it - given it's a worst commodities quarter on record, does that mean that it might have actually even been in - there could've been a negative revenue figure or was it positive or is that something you can't disclose?","Martin Chavez","I'll just say we don't disclose the product break-out.","Brennan Hawken","Got it. Worth a shot. Thanks Marty.","Martin Chavez","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Jim Mitchell","Hey, good morning. Maybe a question on the derivatives bigger picture. You guys always had superior risk management that enables you to be kind of top market share in derivatives.","But I guess the question is then, how much do you think or are concerned about maybe structural headwinds on the demand side when you have greater transparency in the markets you have pressures on fees and flows on active managers and passives and even exchanges are trying to grab market share from OTC markets.","At what point I guess do you start to rethink that business and your advantage in the business or was it something, hey, we just have to maintain our top market share and hopefully it comes back. Just, how are you thinking about the response to any - I guess continue pressure in that business relative to the peer group?","Martin Chavez","Sure. It\u2019s a great question. So just to one micro point that you made on exchange versus OTC, I'll note that that it's often the experience that they really - if they might seem like there and our position to one another.","But often there's actually a virtuous cycle where the availability on exchange liquidity actually makes it easier for market makers to make markets and OTC products, therefore hedging more on exchanges so it's a virtuous cycles. So, I wouldn't necessarily see those in our position.","As for derivatives versus cash, again it wouldn't see it as one or the other why not why not both and of course we're going to continue investing in our historical strength in derivatives and stay with our clients over the long term not just in the quarters where there are extremely active.","But I\u2019ll just note that as or product formatter or package right there, there's so many different formats and they are constantly evolving right.","So for a particular kind of risk, you could have futures, derivatives, cash, systematic trading strategies, ETFs, and it just goes on and on, and really as opposed to attempting to predict which product format is going to be appealing to the client, I think that would be really brittle to have a prediction and move everything in that direction and really the way we're seeing it, the way we see generally everything is preparing the firm to respond to a variety of different market states and a variety of different client needs.","And so, if the clients are in some period of time and it could be - secular could be cyclical doesn't it doesn't matter who knows if the clients are looking for cash solutions, then building strength in cash solutions is part of what will do.","We have experienced and I\u2019ll just note, the equities business is one example of defining commissions and commissions are at a small fraction in the equities business of where they were, say 15 years ago and that has not been an optical to constantly evolving the business and finding new ways to serve the clients and I expect that kind of learning and things we've learned and observed in our U.S. corporate credit business to be a valuable observations that we can extend to all of our businesses.","Jim Mitchell","That makes sense. Just maybe one quick follow on that. Just, do you think there is a correlation in say hedge fund clients' willingness to take on leverage in the derivatives markets.","Is it correlated you think with sort of flows like their desire to stay more liquid and therefore don't want to take on say more illiquid assets like derivatives and that's something we should be watching to see an inflection there. How do you think about what is driving their decision-making process?","Martin Chavez","There you know would be tough to speculate on their thought process. Of course, we talk to them and all the time and what they're telling us is that this whole backdrop of lower volatility, less dispersion, leads to less conviction and a lower opportunity set for them and for us.","Jim Mitchell","Okay, great. Fair enough, thanks.","Martin Chavez","Thanks Jim.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.","Steven Chubak","Hey Marty. So, I had a follow-up question on the line discussion on derivatives. There was a report that was published a few years ago by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, which show that derivatives actually contributed more than 50% of your fee revenue.","And giving the impact that weaker derivatives had on results this quarter and recognizing as you notice, there are lot of different derivative product formats we need to think through. How is that mix evolved in recent years and how should we expect that to project longer-term?","Martin Chavez","So, great question Steven, I\u2019ll just note that we don't really - while of course we have all kinds of analytics, we don't really break out the business in that particular way.","We have noted that that ratio between cash and derivatives, for example in the rates business just to give one example, where there is for instance stock data repositories, and there is other data sources.","It seems there is more activity really across the industry in the product format of T-bills in future but of course swaps - old swap continue to be a hugely important part of that business.","Again, I'll just go back to what I mentioned which is something we believe profoundly which is that we go where the clients lead us and of course it's iterative, we have ideas for new products and solutions and we work on that with the clients and we see if it fits their needs and we evolve from there and we plan for a variety of different outcomes.","So is there a trajectory on more derivatives versus cash in the future or less, that's really not how we think about it. It's much more a matter of being prepared to offer the clients both and it's become increasingly much more dynamic and just that kid of dichotomy of cash or derivatives.","There's product formats that are being created really all the time and having the capability and capacity to operate across products and across different kinds of product format, it's caught our franchise.","Steven Chubak","Got it. And just one follow-up for me on the discussion on the treasury white paper and the SLR in particular. We and many of our clients are going to the exercise of trying to assess the cumulative benefits that could accrete to you as well as many your peers.","And you noted that the SLR and CCAR appears to be your binding constraint today. But will the constraint that appears to be nearly as binding is the 4% Tier 1 leverage in CCAR?","And didn't know if you had any thoughts just to whether you anticipate that in a similar vein or fashion that CCAR would be applied to that measure as well or how you're thinking about binding this in the event that you get some of those reforms as outlined by the treasury pushed through?","Martin Chavez","Well, it's a great question Steven. I would say that we don't really other than the observation which you can see on the Fed's website that SLR was binding this year, we don't really - I don't think it would be useful to call out a particular rule.","There is - as we look at the way, the rules written, they are having a powerful effect on systemic safety and soundness and even before the election and the executive order and the treasury report, regulators were already beginning to step back and look at the totality of the rules and see all the ways that they interact.","Just as one example, Governor Tarullo gave a very thoughtful speech on stress capital buffer concept as a possible evolution of CCAR.","We don't know when or if that concept will appear in CCAR but interestingly that approach links capital returns, balance sheet, risk-weighted assets, bought and stressed ratios really in a manner that is very aligned with how we think about capital planning and all of these metrics and feed into one another and there's an interplay.","So, I don't think it would be useful to speculate on any one metric other than to say, we do, we build analytics, models, processes and we set ourselves up so that we can respond to the client in a variety of different regulatory and market scenarios.","Steven Chubak","Thanks Marty.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital. Please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good morning, Marty. I don't know if I heard you correctly and I apologize ahead of time but when you're talking about the FICC business, obviously customer behavior and markets the lack of volatility was a contributor to the week number in FICC but I think you also said you weren't as happy about your navigating or your company is navigating in the markets.","If that is - if I heard it correctly, how much of the downturn was due to the customers versus your own trading capabilities and how does that compared to the first quarter when you compare the two?","Martin Chavez","I think to go back to that store analogy, there is - well it would be - maybe a wonderful utopian thing to be able to operate the two and say one is client activity and one is when it navigating the markets.","There really interwoven and so in making prices to clients, they want to buy so we sell, they want to sell so we buy. There's choices there and then in the strategies that we employ to manage the resulting basis risk, this strategy is there and we step back in and at the end observe the results.","And it was a comment that I really wanted to make very particularly about the commodities business. As for the rest of the FICC businesses, it really was a story of lower client activity very good.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good and then coming back to the investment banking pipelines, can you give us more color geographically or industry strategic versus financial. What are you guys seeing in that pipeline?","Martin Chavez","Sure, so it \u2013 I look at the backlog and really, it's driven primarily by underwriting but looking at banking broadly I would say the CEOs are confident, the conversations are happening all the time and strategic M&A in the U.S. those discussions are occurring especially in technology and consumer retail in natural resources in Europe.","I would say it's hard to predict given the Brexit uncertainty there is healthy activity and we certainly see opportunities in Europe for debt underwriting.","In Asia, we're still seeing the trend of Chinese buying and international assets. And we remain optimistic over the long-term and as for the debt markets again no predictions here other than to note what we all know which is that trends in rates, and spread and volatility in M&A activity all drive demand for issuance.","And even though rates have moved up overall financing tasks are still quite low by historical standard.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. And then just finally, can you guys give us any additional color on the treasury's proposal for retrofitting the Volcker rule just how you guys are seeing as it involves?","Martin Chavez","Again, I would say there is the treasury's proposal and there is discussion about how Volcker might evolve as it relates both to market making as well as to the Volcker covered funds. I wouldn't make any specific comment on how Volcker might evolve other than to observe and with the regulators, multiple regulators have talked about this publicly.","They\u2019re taking opportunities to step back and potentially recalibrate what I would say is that as and when this recalibration occurs we'd expect the regulations to continue to be thoughtful, to protect the system and at the same time to support growth and well-functioning market.","Gerard Cassidy","Really appreciate it. Thank you, Martin.","Martin Chavez","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Al Alevizakos with HSBC. Please go ahead.","Al Alevizakos","Hi Martin, thank you for taking my questions. My question is basically we talked a lot about equities and obviously the performance is very strong particularly after I think the relative underperformance in Q1.","And I wanted to actually touch on the equity capital markets on ECM I was surprised because the figure was actually weaker than I was expecting. And it was coming off a weakest Q2, 2016.","And I also believe that the biologic numbers were pointing up overall materially for the quarter. So, would you mind telling me if there was something special where all you think like it was kind of one-off that\u2019s going to be reversed in Q3?","Martin Chavez","That\u2019s a great question, so as you noted year-to-date our volumes are strong and outperforming and of course the quarter is important and useful and standard are construct. And at the same time \u2013 it can also be relatively arbitrary boundary. But working within that boundary sequentially they were lower follow-ons.","And year-over-year lower converts and as for the drivers of the revenue results as they think from the volume results it's something that is a very complicated output. There is audio break where one can get conflicted out sometimes in smaller deals.","There is actually fewer underwriters and as you know everyone is part of the league table, but at least your underwriters, there's fewer things to share among and so there is a lot of effect going on there as for what the actual drivers are. As we always do we'll look into it and respond.","Al Alevizakos","Great. And if I can turn your attention into the I&L division. You've already spoken about the NII strength. And you said that the figure is more around US$400 million. I'm just trying to get a feeling on the recurring part that relates to your increased lending through corporate and private banking versus the standard kind of one-off interest that's coming from your equity investments.","Could you kind of give us an indication whether you start seeing more and more recurring NII shift in the division?","Martin Chavez","Well, looking at I&L portfolio, right now it stands at just over $106 billion and that's almost $4 billion increase sequentially and 79% of that is lending. On that NII figure that we quoted more than $400 million that is recurring.","Al Alevizakos","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Martin Chavez","Welcome.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Thanks Marty. So, couple of quick questions here. On the deposit front, I know you've been growing and kind of consumer I guess we'll call those consumer deposits and I know that everyone has been growing markets that much.","So, what other businesses are being funded by those deposits?","Martin Chavez","I am sorry, I didn't hear the last part of the question. Could you say that again Brian please?","Brian Kleinhanzl","Yeah, which other businesses are utilizing that deposit funding? Are you supporting I&L?","Martin Chavez","All right. Sorry, yes. So, well our private wealth management business is an example of one of those businesses as of the first quarter is about $29 billion of loans and commitments to our private wealth management clients and that's up about $1 billion sequentially.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. Thanks. And have you seen any specific impact from MiFID II on your overall businesses both in equity and FICC that play a role in the results this quarter?","Martin Chavez","I would say it's significant certainly in terms of the effort across our businesses and really as you know MiFID II is an extremely broad undertaking, arguably broader than for instance the U.S. regulatory changes since the crisis.","I would just call out a couple of major areas of MiFID II. So, on execution services as that evolves we're staying close to the clients and then as for research, it's crucial we believe to continue to provide differentiated strong content into the scale player with differentiated content that the client's value.","Potentially there is some mind share impact because this is a big list across the industry with a singular go live date in early January of next year, but as for whether there is a long-term impact, it's too early to assess.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.","Martin Chavez","Well first I would like to thank all of you for calling in. I've met many of you and I look forward to getting to meet all of you in person. If you have any additional questions please don't hesitate to call Dane and I wish you all a great summer. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation.

My name is Dennis, and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, January 16, 2019. Thank you. ","Ms. Miner, you may begin your conference.","Heather Miner","Good morning. This is Heather Miner, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Today, we will use a new earnings presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.gs.com. No information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures appear on the earnings release and presentation. [Technical Difficulty] reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. ","Today on the call, I am joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon; and our Chief Financial Officer, Stephen Scherr. As noted on the agenda on Page 1 of the presentation, David will provide introductory remarks about our strategic priorities, perspectives on the macro environment and an update on 1MDB. Then Stephen will walk through our financial performance. They'll be happy to take your questions after that. ","I'll now pass the call over to David. David?","David Solomon","Thanks, Heather, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. I'm very happy to be here with you, and I look forward to joining this call in a more regular basis. I'm going to start off this morning by reiterating that I'm fully committed to an active and ongoing dialogue with our shareholders and our broader stakeholders. I'm excited about our new call format and presentation, which is an initial step as we continue to enhance engagement and disclosure. ","As shown on Page 2, it is important to underscore that our overarching priority is to execute our core mission: Serving our diverse client franchise, which includes corporations and governments, institutions and individuals; executing on our client-centric model will drive long-term sustainable value creation for our shareholders. We remain committed to delivering a full range of services to our clients, including advice, market liquidity, investment management and financing. As many of you know, John, Stephen and I are conducting a comprehensive front-to-back review across each of our businesses, including 3-year forward plans to identify opportunities to strengthen or expand our client footprint and to operate more efficiently. We are also pursuing new ways to deepen our existing relationships and expand our client footprint by developing new products and business platforms. ","As our strategic business reviews are progressing, let me highlight some early findings, which are shown on the right side of Page 2. Starting with our market-making business in FICC and Equities, we've spent a significant amount of time, evaluating all aspects of our businesses, including our delivery model, with a focus on providing best-in-class client experience and execution. To achieve this, we will continue to invest in automation and platform enhancements. We are also actively engaged in pursuing opportunities to grow our addressable market by broadening client relationships and improving our mix of products, services, particularly the corporates. ","Specifically as it relates to FICC, we have a leading institutional market-making franchise. Clients tell me we have differentiated people and capabilities, particularly in the intermediation of large complex risks. But let me be direct. We're fully cognizant of the reduction in the industry wallet over the past decade. And as Stephen mentioned at the Bank of America Merrill Conference, we will not be complacent waiting for the market to return. We are running the business with a clear perspective of its revenue potential. ","Over recent years, we've made significant progress on improving capital utilization and reallocating capital away from FICC commensurate with its potential in order to grow strategically, important and higher returning businesses. We will continue to optimize capital in the business. We also see an opportunity to further reduce expenses. We're investing in automation as we expect many businesses within FICC to evolve similarly to equities. All these efforts will position our franchise to remain a provider of choice while improving returns for our shareholders. ","Secondly, we have a world-class alternatives investing franchise, which has generated strong returns over 3 decades. We have one of the most unique sourcing platforms given our global footprint of broad network. Our franchise presents us with extraordinary opportunities to partner with clients to invest their capital alongside our own. Based on our track record, there is an opportunity to raise additional third-party funds across equity, credit and real estate, thereby augmenting fee income. Simultaneously, we can continue to monetize on-balance sheet investments and optimize capital consumption. ","Next, on cash management. As we evaluated opportunities to improve services to our clients and expand our franchise, cash management presents an illogical area for us given the breadth of our corporate relationships and the size of that wallet. In addition, the pace of technological change in the payment space gives us confidence that it is appropriate time for us to address this opportunity. We are now 6 months into a 2-year build, and our firm will be first to use a cash management platform later in 2019. In addition to validating the product, doing our own operational payment flows will reduce costs and operational risk. Among all -- assuming all progresses as planned, we expect to launch the product to clients in 2020. ","Lastly, as we bring markets and the business of Investment Management closer, we will continue to evolve markets from a single product to a multiproduct platform. We now serve 3 million customers through our lending and savings products in Clarity Money. We plan to further enhance the platform to include multitiered mass affluent digital wealth offering, which is currently in development. We are confident this collaboration will be a catalyst for the successful execution of this strategy over time. ","Across these and other investments for growth, combined with a significant focus on operating efficiency, we are beginning to deliver on our commitment to enhance the durability of our revenues and our earnings. We continue to review our strategic priorities with our board and plan to communicate a more comprehensive update to the market in the coming months. Additionally, later this year, we plan to share specific metrics and financial targets we will use to hold ourselves accountable. Ultimately, we will operate the firm to drive leading shareholder returns over the cycle. ","Before we discuss our results, I'll make a few observations on the operating environment. Some of which are highlighted on Page 3. Recently, there has been quite a disconnect between the weak market sentiment and the optimism we continue to see in corporate board rooms. The fourth quarter, particularly December, was characterized by a decline in investor sentiment with respect to the global growth outlook. A concern that central banks would continue to tighten into a slowing growth environment cause weakness in equity and credit markets and resulted in an increase in volatility of many macro assets. While this has created challenges for many of our institutional investing clients, it is also driving potential future opportunities for active managers to add value. ","In addition for now the absolute level of activity in the real economy remains fairly robust, and this is reflected in broad CEO sentiment and our Investment Banking transaction backlog. Despite the global uncertainties, including U.S. China trade policy, Brexit, the planned removal of monetary policy stimulus in Europe and the recent yield curve flattening, our economy still see global growth of 3.5% next year, including 2.4% in the U.S., 1.6% in the Euro zone, over 6% in China and an acceleration to 2% in Latin America. Notwithstanding the mixed market and macro backdrop, we remain actively engaged with our clients across our franchise. Corporations continue to seek advice for strategic transactions, and there is a need for both equity and debt financing. Financial markets are open, and investors continue to need execution services, intellectual capital, hedging and liquidity solutions. Clients continue to need comprehensive asset wealth management advice, and individuals need simple and transparent financial services that add value. ","Next, I'd like to take a moment to address the ongoing investigations related to matters with the Malaysian sovereign development fund, 1MDB. I want to proactively address some of your questions that I know are on the minds of our stakeholders. ","First, we are cooperating with the Department of Justice and other regulators and are focused on a timely but deliberative process. We believe that we have established important facts in our own review of this matter over the last 3 years, and we, of course, would like to provide more information to you. But for now, this is still an open investigation, and we will naturally respect that process. ","It's very clear that the people of Malaysia were defrauded by many individuals, including the highest members of the prior government. Tim Leissner was a partner at our firm, by his own admission, was one of those people. For Leissner's role in that fraud, we apologize to the Malaysian people. As you would expect, we have looked back and continue to look back to see if there is anything that we as a firm could have done better. At the same time, I want you to know before each transaction considerable due diligence was conducted. When control functions in other -- in the firm asked if each transaction whether any intermediaries were involved, they were told no. Tim Leissner himself said no intermediaries were involved in the transaction. As detailed in the government's charging documents, Leissner purposely concealed from the firm his scheme with Malaysian government officials, IPIC officials, 1MDB and Jho Low. ","Significantly, and again as a part of our due diligence efforts at the time, we sought and received written assurances from both 1MDB and IPIC that no intermediaries were involved in the first 2 transactions. And in the final offering, the government of Malaysia itself and 1MDB represented that no intermediaries were involved in the offering. All these representations to Goldman Sachs have proven to be false. Also during this period, 1MDB's outside auditors with access to the books and records issued clean audit opinions. ","In addition, I want to address the issue of Jho Low and how he was viewed during and after the transactions. We declined Jho Low's request to open a private wealth account in 2010 because we could not verify the source of his wealth. Out of prudence, we also declined to advise or represent Low on other opportunities he presented to us between 2011 and 2014. That said, during the same period of time, Jho Low's involvement in a number of transactions unrelated to 1MDB was well known to a number of financial institutions, including us. ","In fact, before, during and after the 1MDB transactions, Low engaged with major companies, investors and other financial institutions in acquiring highly visible assets, from media to real estate. Clearly, a lot more is known about Jho Low today and at that time. This has been a difficult time, but I'm proud of how our firm has remained focused on our clients. Our client franchise, including in Asia, remains extremely strong. There are always important lessons to be learned from difficult situations, and it is a priority for me that we are self-critical and reflective to ensure that our culture of integrity, collaboration and escalation only improves from this experience. Please appreciate that I've tried to be as forthcoming as possible on my comments on 1MDB. I know that many of you will have additional questions, but I'm sure as you can understand, I can't say much more. ","With that, let's switch gears and review our performance as highlighted on Page 4. For 2018 full year, the firm reported solid results. We generated firm-wide net revenues of $36.6 billion, our highest in 8 years. We delivered a return on equity of 13.3% and return on tangible equity of 14.1%. Importantly, we are making significant investments to further expand our client franchise, grow revenues and enhance the long-term earnings profile of the firm, the cost of which is being funded by the embedded operating leverage in our businesses. ","In summary, I'm extremely pleased with our performance. We delivered a solid year, and our 2018 results leave us on strong footing to pursue our strategic objectives in 2019 and beyond. The team I have assembled to execute on our priorities, including John and Stephen, have an increased sense of urgency and discipline to help move our business forward. ","With that, I'll turn the call over to Stephen, who will walk us through the details of our financial performance. Stephen?","Stephen Scherr","Thanks, David. Let me begin with an overview of our financial results on Page 5 of the presentation. The firm reported fourth quarter net revenues of $8.1 billion, resulting in $36.6 billion for the full year. We had net earnings of $2.5 billion in the quarter and $10.5 billion for the full year and earnings per share of $6.04 in the quarter, resulting in $25.27 for the full year. ","Before I begin the detailed discussion of our results, I want to cover a few adjustments to our financials. First, to increase transparency and make our results more consistent with our competitive set, we now present our net revenues before credit provision. We have added a credit provision line to the income statement, and prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. This has no impact on our bottom line results, but will give a basis for clear comparison. ","Second, expenses related to consultants and temporary staff previously reported in compensation and benefits expenses are now reported in professional fees. This also has had no impact on the bottom line, but does result in $280 million being transferred between the line items for the full year. This change also reduced headcount by approximately 3,400. ","In addition to the changes in the presentation of our financial statements, I would call out the following 2 items. First, our fourth quarter results included net provisions for litigation and regulatory matters of $516 million. Our total provisions for litigation and regulatory matters in 2018 amounted to $844 million. This obviously elevated our operating expense line for the year. ","Second, our tax rate for 2018 was 16%. This rate includes a $487 million discrete benefit from a true-up of our prior estimate of the impact from 2017's tax legislation. The benefit reflects the impact of updated information, including subsequent guidance issued by Treasury. The 16% rate also includes the $269 million benefit related to equity-based compensation for the year. These 2 items, the tax true-up and equity-based compensation, account for approximately 6 percentage points of the decrease in our tax rate from our projected normalized rate of approximately 22% to 23%. It is important to highlight that pretax earnings increased $1.3 billion or 12% in 2018. This equates to an increase of approximately 130 basis points in return on common equity after normalizing for taxes year-over-year. This improvement in our operating performance was despite materially higher litigation expenses. ","Now let me turn to the results overall. As David mentioned, the environment in 2018 turned out to be mixed. The first 3 quarters demonstrated continued strength in global equity and credit markets despite geopolitical uncertainty. The fourth quarter witnessed higher levels of market volatility, increased client engagement and negative performance across virtually all asset classes. Against this evolving backdrop, we concentrated on serving our clients and investing to drive our business forward. ","Our overall performance in 2018 demonstrates the value of our diversified business model and the strength of our client franchise. This is reflected in the balanced revenue contribution from across our businesses as shown on the pie chart on Page 5 of the presentation. Further, 61% of 2018 net revenues were generated by fee-based or more recurring sources versus 48% just 5 years ago. ","Turning to Page 6 and our individual segments. Investment Banking had an outstanding performance in 2018, producing near-record results. In the fourth quarter, the business produced net revenues of $2 billion, up 3% versus the third quarter as a significant pickup in M&A completions helped offset a decline in underwriting revenues as the difficult market backdrop slowed issuance volumes globally. Advisory revenues were $1.2 billion, up 31% relative to the third quarter, reflecting growth in completed M&A transactions. We ranked #1 in announced and completed global M&A for both the fourth quarter and the full year. We advised on nearly 400 transactions that closed during the year, representing approximately $1.2 trillion of deal volume. We also participated in announced transactions totaling nearly $1.3 trillion, which included over $450 billion from transactions below $5 billion in deal value, reflecting progress in broadening our client coverage. ","Moving to Underwriting. Market volatility, declining equity prices and wider credit spreads weighed on issuer sentiment as net revenues were down 21% sequentially in the fourth quarter to $843 million. For the full year, Investment Banking net revenues were $7.9 billion, up 7% from 2017 on increases in both Financial Advisory and Underwriting. For 2018, in addition to our leading advisory position, we held the #1 position in equity underwriting globally. We were #2 in high yield and #4 in investment grade, reflecting our multiyear commitment to build our debt underwriting franchise. ","Our Investment Banking franchise overall remains very well positioned and continues to grow. The strong performance reflects our continued focus on building long-term client relationships and our ongoing investment in talent and capabilities. We are ending 2018 with an Investment Banking backlog meaningfully higher than where we finished 2017, notwithstanding a decline versus last quarter. This increase comes despite the robust revenue production of 2018.","Turning to Institutional Client Services on Page 7. Net revenues were $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up 2% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. That's despite higher volatility and a difficult market backdrop, particularly in FICC. For the full year, ICS generated $13.5 billion of net revenues, up 13% compared to 2017, driven by healthier volumes, better wallet share and improved execution in certain of our businesses, notably in commodities. FICC client execution net revenues were $822 million in the fourth quarter, down 18% versus 2017 amid challenging market conditions, particularly in credit and, to a lesser extent, in rates. Credit accounted for roughly 3\/4 of the year-over-year decline. Results were impacted by a deteriorating environment in high-yield and distressed credit as spreads widened. Lower levels of liquidity further exacerbated the challenges. I would also note that there was no one particular position to call out as having a material effect. ","The remaining decrease reflected lower results in rates while the other FICC businesses were relatively consistent with last year's performance. While the fourth quarter was challenging due to the market environment, the overall business improved in 2018. For the full year, FICC net revenues were $5.9 billion, representing 11% year-over-year growth. Importantly, we continue to seek improvement in FICC performance through our strategic initiatives. ","First, we successfully increased our wallet share by 65 basis points since 2016 with our institutional client base per coalition. However, this provided a minimal top line benefit so far given the market backdrop. Nevertheless, we continue to broaden our client and product footprint and deepen our relationships to drive higher rankings and market share. ","Second, we remained focused on leveraging our best-in-class Investment Banking relationships to better serve corporate clients. Our efforts are beginning to yield results in commodities and foreign exchange. This is important as we are not relying on a market turn to yield better results, but are looking to expand our client footprint. ","Lastly, we remained focused on continued investments in engineering and electronification. The enhancements of platforms and processes will allow us to better serve our clients and further streamline expenses and capital. Our new platforms enable us to innovate at a faster pace, scale our businesses and deliver differentiated client-centric solutions to our institutional and corporate clients. To demonstrate the momentum we see, revenues in our FICC electronic business were up more than 40% last year. ","Moving to Page 8. In Equities, as it relates to the fourth quarter, the story is a better one. Net revenues were up $1.6 billion, up 17% year-over-year. Equities client execution net revenues were up significantly versus a challenged fourth quarter of 2017, with better performance in cash. Commissions and fees were 9% higher, attributable to increased client activity, following the significant uptick in volatility, particularly in low touch where we continue to gain market share. Security services net revenues decreased slightly, reflecting lower average customer balances. ","For 2018, Equities produced net revenues of $7.6 billion, up 15% year-over-year. During the year, we continued to benefit from industry consolidation and ongoing efforts to increase client connectivity. Our share of global equity market volumes increased by over 100 basis points versus 2017 and included growth across all regions, reflecting a multiyear positive trend. We are optimistic that the theme of consolidation to scale providers can continue into 2019 as MiFID II only went live 12 months ago. ","Moving on to equity Investing & Lending on Page 9. Equity securities generated net revenues of $1 billion in the quarter, reflecting continued strong results in private equity investments. Approximately 1\/2 of the net revenues were generated from real estate, which primarily reflected gains from sales. For the full year, equity Investing & Lending generated net revenues of $4.5 billion. Our global private and public equity portfolio consists of over 1,000 different investments and remains diversified across geography and investment vintage as seen on the slide. We continue to reinvest to drive future long-term performance, with 47% of the investments in the portfolio made in the last 4 years. The equity balance sheet ended the quarter at $21.4 billion, including a public portfolio of $1.4 billion and $20 billion of private equity. Revenues in equity I&L are also generated from our CIE investments of $13 billion, substantially all in real estate. ","Moving on to debt Investing & Lending on Page 10. In the fourth quarter, net revenues from debt securities and loans were $912 million, largely driven by net interest income of roughly $800 million. For the full year, debt Investing & Lending generated $3.8 billion of net revenues, including net interest income of approximately $2.7 billion. I would point out that before accounting for future growth, we begin 2019 with an annualized net interest income run rate of $3.2 billion. Our debt Investing & Lending balance sheet, as shown on the lower left of Page 10, ended the quarter at $113 billion, which includes $94 billion in loans and $11 billion in debt securities. Our lending is franchise adjacent and continues to remain conservative with approximately 85% of our loan portfolio secured as of year-end. This quarter, we took provision for loan losses of $222 million, reflecting loan growth. ","Turning to Investment Management on Page 11. The business produced net revenues of $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter, which were flat sequentially. Management and other fees were $1.4 billion; incentive fees were $153 million; and transaction revenues were $186 million. For the full year 2018, Investment Management net revenues were a record $7 billion, up 13% year-over-year, largely driven by growth in incentive fees and management and other fees. Assets under supervision finished 2018 at $1.54 trillion. For the full year, assets under supervision increased $48 billion resulting from $37 billion of long-term net inflows primarily in fixed income and equity assets and $52 billion of net inflows into liquidity products. Those were offset by net market depreciation of $41 billion primarily in equity. Over the trailing 5 years, we attracted total cumulative organic long-term net inflows of approximately $215 billion. The business remains well positioned for growth as we continue to invest in people and make bolt-on acquisitions to enhance our product offering to better serve our clients. ","Now let me turn to Page 12 for expenses. As we continued to invest in our businesses, we will not lose focus on our expense discipline. It remains a priority for David, John and me. Before going through the details, I'll reiterate that we are undertaking a full review of our firm-wide expense base. Relatedly, and as part of the front-to-back reviews, we are holding businesses to a higher level of accountability with a focus on operating efficiency. For 2018, operating expenses were $23.5 billion, up 12%. Nonetheless, we maintained a stable efficiency ratio of approximately 64% as revenue growth funded investments in our business. ","Let me take you through the components of our operating expenses. Compensation and benefits expense was up 6% for 2018, amounting to half the rate of growth in revenues. This translated into a compensation and net revenues ratio of 33.7%, down 190 basis points versus 2017. On a like-for-like basis, our compensation ratio declined approximately 100 basis points year-over-year. ","Fourth quarter other operating expenses were $3.3 billion, which, as I mentioned earlier, included litigation expense of $516 million as well as a donation of $132 million to Goldman Sachs Gives, our donor advised charitable fund. For the full year, other operating expenses rose 20%, and roughly half of the increase related to client activity and investments for growth. This included an increase of $656 million in provisions related to litigation and regulatory proceedings, approximately $300 million of higher expenses relating to accounting changes due to the revenue recognition standard. But substantially all of the remaining increase of $892 million from investments to drive growth and higher activity reflected in brokerage, clearing and exchange fees. ","Moving on to taxes. As mentioned earlier, our tax rate for 2018 was 16%. Based on our current interpretations of the rules and legislative guidance to date, we expect our 2019 tax rate to be between 22% and 23%, excluding the impact of equity-based compensation. ","Turning to Page 13 on Capital. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 13.3% using the standardized approach and 13.1% under the advanced approach, up 20 basis points and 70 basis points, respectively, versus the third quarter. The improvement in the advanced ratio reflected 80 basis points related to lower credit risk weighted assets due to inclusion of the firm's default experience into the determination of probability of default calculation. Our supplementing leverage ratio finished at 6.2%. ","For the full year, we repurchased 13.9 million shares of common stock worth $3.3 billion, contributing to a reduction in our basic share count of 8 million shares for the year, reaching a record new low. In addition, we paid out approximately $1.2 billion of common dividends over the course of the year. In total, we returned $4.5 billion of capital to shareholders in 2018. ","Turning to balance sheet and liquidity on Page 14. Our global core liquid assets averaged $229 billion during the fourth quarter. Our balance sheet was $933 billion, down 3% versus last quarter. We continue to shift our funding mix from unsecured long-term debt to deposits. In our consumer deposits business, we have raised over $35 billion, including nearly $7 billion in the U.K. Raising incremental consumer deposits continues to benefit the firm through increased funding diversification, lower financing costs and capacity to increase business in our bank subsidiaries. For example, in addition to carrying out the vast majority of the firm's lending business, GS Bank USA conducts rates, an increasing component of our FX business. ","Before taking questions, a few closing thoughts. We entered 2019 well positioned despite the recent market volatility. We remain committed to serving and growing our global client franchise, building on the progress made in 2018 and further expanding our addressable market in 2019 and beyond. To achieve this, we continue to invest in our franchise to broaden and improve our client capabilities through technology, talent and by engaging in new disruptive activities. ","Lastly, the management team is motivated by the initial learnings from our front-to-back reviews. Our early work indicates the need for certain change, but also reinforces the strength and breadth of our franchise. We will share more with you in the coming months. The continued push to evolve our businesses will enable us to grow and deliver attractive long-term returns for our shareholders. ","With that, thanks again for dialing in, and we'll now open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.","Glenn Schorr","And I want to talk about I&L. And it's a combo of -- in equity, I heard your comments about the public piece is a small piece, and I heard your comments about realizations were half from real estate or half of it was from real estate realizations. But curious if you can remind us how markets work in the private piece because, obviously, the public markets were down a lot, how much you use on DCF cash flow, EBITDA growth versus public comps?","Stephen Scherr","Sure. Thanks, Glenn. I appreciate the question. So in the I&L space, and I'll focus on the equity side as that's in your question, the private portfolio obviously is now a much larger component of the whole relative to public securities. And when we look at valuation in that private portfolio, I would tell you that on a revenue basis in the private portfolio, about 50% of that revenue comes from events relating to the underlying companies and 50% relates to the operational progress in that particular business. And I'll just give you a couple of examples just to give you a sense of it. So if you look over the course of 2018 in the private portfolio, we saw sales across a number of different names: Hearthside Foods, Ipreo, PSAV, Paycor, Centaur Gaming. All of those were either sales or partial sales.","And together, those five names contributed to more than $500 million of revenue in the overall results of the firm. I'd also point out that in the context of events that play out, obviously, those are sales or partial sales, but there are other situations in which there are incremental rounds of equity that comes in to a particular name, where there's other financing that goes on around a name. Two names that I'll point out, which were significant contributors to the P&L in the I&L side on equity was Woowa, which is a Korean investment; and a name you'll no doubt know, which was Uber, as there were a -- there was a transaction in the tender into SoftBank into which we and others participated. And that, too, contributed to an uplift in the P&L relating to that name. So the point I want to convey to you is that much of what happens in the context and 50% of the P&L on that private portfolio is not related to modeling per se but rather is generated off of an event, an observable event that goes on. The other half relates to general performance of the business. And on that, as you could imagine, we deploy a number of different metrics in terms of how we arrive at valuation. But I think the important element to convey on that side is that there's a long history in the investing side, particularly in equity, in both sourcing interesting and sometimes unique opportunities for businesses that demonstrate stability and growth trajectory. And that performance feeds into the methodology we deploy against the private portfolio. And again, this is independent of event-driven situations themselves.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. That's all very helpful, and it sets up for my follow-up on -- but I love the idea of the opening up of I&L. I'm curious in the vintage disclosure, it's hard to tell. But have you done any big raises in any of the prime funds in the last year or 2? And then more importantly, where are you in the process? In other words, I love the concept, house performance. Do you need to add staff? Do you need to build out on distribution? Or is it as simple as get your docs order and put out a new fund?","David Solomon","So I'll start, Glenn, and I'll just comment. Obviously, we've been in these businesses for a long time. And as I know you appreciate, there's been an evolving multiple businesses, and there's also been an evolving regulatory front that let us down certain paths with respect to the businesses. We do raise funds, and we have gone back in, for example, our traditional merchant banking private equity business to raising a fund. In the last 18 months, we raised an $8 billion or $9 billion fund. That's called Goldman Sachs Capital Partners VII, which is pretty much all client money. We have a plan, a current plan that raises -- and has a number of fundraisers over the course of the next couple of years. That's an existing plan, and it's something we've been doing. What we've identified that we think is a real opportunity given the scope of the magnitude of all the platforms over the firm is to add some resources and broaden the plan to raise more money off the capital given the uniqueness of our platforms and the uniqueness of our sourcing capability. And when you look at that opportunity and you compare what would be significant growth for us compared to other people that are in that business given our platform, our investing resources and our capability to manage money for institutional and individual clients, we have meaningful growth without setting overly ambitious targets. So we are in the process of outlining that all in a much more clear way. There will be some hiring and additional resources that need to be added, but it's not a significant build because the fundamental investing platforms exist, and there's more opportunity to leverage that.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier","Stephen, maybe one more, just on the I&L business. It's obviously one that's tough to predict. But when I think about some of the sales that you mentioned and how that drove the benefit in the quarter, can you give us any kind of color or indication of maybe what the value is in the portfolio versus, like, the cost base? Just to get some sense on maybe what the potential, like, realizations as you have these sales over the next year or 2 could potentially be?","Stephen Scherr","Sure. Thanks for the question. I think it's difficult for me to give you a sense of the delta in the [Technical Difficulty] relative to where we carry it. I would ask you to sort of rely more on the progression and the stability and sustainability of this business just in terms of what it has produced for many, many quarters over several years in the context of the investing. And I think that the strength of that franchise and the strength of the investing is sort of an adjacent thread that runs across the whole of the firm, which is that the Investment Banking franchise is an extraordinary sourcing engine off of which we look to make these investments. And we try to find opportunities where there is considerable opportunity for growth. What I sense in your question is the sort of distinction, if you will, between realized and unrealized gain. Part of what I wanted to point out in answering the prior question is that there's a good deal here of realized gain in the book and a continual velocity turn in the portfolio, and sales or partial sales sort of are one part of that. And then looking at the performance of the business is quite another. David and I have committed ourselves, and I've said this now several times, that our ambition is to put more light into the I&L segment, just given what it produces and how it is a major component piece. I know that you asked on the equity side. Let me just spend 2 seconds on the debt side of I&L, which I think has even greater durability and predictability to it. So this is where we are making debt investments or expanding credit in and around the adjacencies of the firm, whether it's the corporates or others who are themselves clients of the firm. We're doing that high up in the capital structure, and we've developed a portfolio that is about 85% secured.","And that has thrown up, as I said in my comments, about $2.7 billion of net interest income, with a run rate exiting Q4 of about $800 million in the quarter. And we think that's part of a more durable, more visible, more recurring set of revenue as part of the overall I&L picture itself.","Michael Carrier","Okay. And then just as a follow-up. Just on the expense side. So obviously 2018, I think you got some moving pieces with the -- some of the legal. But just when you think about some of the investments that you guys have been making in some of the new growth initiatives on the technology side, how should we be thinking about the run rate going into '19 and '20 in an environment where obviously the market has been a bit more volatile more recently?","Stephen Scherr","Sure. So let me make one sort of opening comment on expenses generally and these investments. We are very cognizant of where we on the market, volatility in the market and the like. And we will be mindful of the pace of our investment spend and the cadence of it in the context of the market. We know where our priorities lie. And as into the extent the market changes or circumstances change, we know where there are levers to sort of throttle back if, in fact, we need to. So that whole investment cadence, if you will, can remain very agile, and we'll be mindful of it. If you look at '18, we had an increase in overall expenses of about $2.5 billion. About $700 million of that related to compensation, $1.8 billion related to noncomp. Again, in the noncomp, about half of that related to higher provisions for litigation and rev rec, which sort of isolates in on about $892 million of increase in spend relating to investments that we view as driving growth and higher activity in BC&E. All of the investment spend in the different projects that David and I have been talking about, whether that's in Marcus or whether that's corporate cash management or whether that's the building incremental platforms inside the securities and trading business, is in that $892 million. As I said, 2019 will be a continuation of the investment. My view is that the rate of growth in that expense, while it will grow, the rate of growth will be less than the rate of growth that we saw in '18, and we're going to continue to look to deploy existing operating leverage in the business as a source of that investment spend in the business overall.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Bernstein.","Chinedu Bolu","David, maybe just stepping back a little bit here. Curious what you think will drive superior long-term shareholder returns. I think over the last two years, the firm has actually executed pretty well. You delivered better than peer revenue growth, better than peer core ROEs. Despite that and put into their side, the stock has underperformed even before the 1MDB issues. So what changes going forward? Is there some reason you think the market will finally start to give the stock credit for revenue growth at ROE? Or are there just other metrics you should be focused on to drive shareholder returns?","David Solomon","Sure, and I appreciate the question. Obviously, we're cognizant of the way the market is looking at our business mix, and we're also cognizant of the performance of the stock. It's very hard for me to predict, and I won't try to predict when the market will recognize our returns and our progress, but it's our job to stay focused on delivering those returns for shareholders. And over time, if we do, I'm confident that we'll be balanced in an appropriate way. We've been very focused for a number of years on diversifying the platform and moving forward. I do want to say, just to put in context and to highlight maybe in a different way, some of the progress we've made. And many of you obviously have been following the company for a long time. ","If 3 to 5 years ago, we said on one of these calls that in 2018, we would have a year where our FICC ICS revenues were less than $6 billion, we were making significant investments in building out a digital consumer platform and we happened to be in a situation where we had [indiscernible] litigation expense that we would deliver $36.6 billion of revenues and a 13.3% return, people would have said, not possible. And the reason that that's happened is we have been working for a number of years to broaden our business, expand our addressable wallet and, at the same point in time, increase the durability of our revenues. And you can see from the slide that we put up at the beginning that over the last x number of years, 5 years, we've moved from less than 50% more fee-based recurring revenues to over 60% today. We continue to be committed to that. And as we're developing a plan to move forward, we see things we can do in the existing businesses and adjacent build, some of which we mentioned, where we feel very confidently that we can continue to push returns higher, especially if we also continue to be focused on running the firm more efficiently, which as Stephen stated, we're very committed to doing.","So I think we're in a position where we have opportunities to continue on this path that we've been on. I think one of the things candidly that we need to continue to do better, and I hope you see through this call we are committed to doing, is we need to do a better job giving you information and explaining what we are, what we do, how we do it. I think we're making progress. But I think candidly, we have work to do, and we're going to continue to remain focused on that. And we hope over time, if our focus on expanding the business and diversifying the business while staying true and excellent in the things that have always been core to the business while communicating better, ultimately, the market will follow. And so that's what we're going to stick to and do.","Chinedu Bolu","I appreciate the candor, and what I sense is a sense of urgency in your voice. On FICC, you talked about optimizing the business. So just help us level set here kind of what are the margins or ROEs in the business today. What can you exactly do to help that business get to an ROE that's closer to the firm-wide ROE? And then on FICC top line, I guess if increasing electronic volumes and improving wallet share aren't driving material revenue growth or material revenue share growth, what do you think will actually drive revenue share growth going forward?","David Solomon","Okay. So I'm going to start, Christian, by making a couple of comments, and then Stephen will go into, I think, a little bit more detail on some of the specifics that you mentioned. But I just want to start by saying that I really like our FICC business. It's a really big, important business. But we're not confused by the fact that the available wallet in market intermediation for large institutions has materially declined over the course of the last five years. One of the things that's been interesting for me over the last two years once I became president and I started spending more time with the broader diverse array of our clients, I'd always go out for the last decade, more than a decade, and see Investment Banking clients. And they always told me how extraordinary they thought are people were, the way our teams work together, the way the executed. As I've had an opportunity over the last two years to go out and spend a lot of time with Securities division clients and with clients of Fixed Income, they say exactly the same thing. Your people are really differentiated. Your risk takers and the capability is really differentiated. ","Your execution is really differentiated. We have a very, very strong client franchise business, but's it's in a business where there's been fundamental change and wallet change. I would highlight that if you go back and look at our wallet market shares before the financial crisis in 2005, '06 and '07, our wallet shares were in the 8%, 8.5% range. And if you look at our wallet shares today, our wallet shares are around 12%. And so there was an aberration during the 2009 kind of period where the wallet shares peaked, but we've continued to build this franchise, and we're laser focused on building it. The one thing that I said in my comments that I just want to reiterate is we accept the size of the wallet share that exists, and it's our job to run the business well based on that wallet share to allocate capital over time efficiently and to run that business in an effective way from a cost perspective, and we continue to do that while continuing to invest in the client franchise. And so Stephen, I think, will make some comments to add on some of the more specific detailed parts of the question.","Stephen Scherr","Christian, so just to pivot off of David's comments. I mean, I think the objective here is to identify the appropriate TAM. I mean, what's the addressable market that we're playing for? And you are absolutely right to point out that our increased market share, and David was referring to it, among institutional clients has not, in the last couple of years, demonstrated revenue conversion. And so part of that is moving us in a direction to expand our corporate coverage and corporate touch point as it relates to the FICC, and that's using channels that exist and relationships that exist in Investment Banking. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've seen modest improvement in that, particularly in commodities and foreign exchange. And it's against that addressable market that we're going to take and are taking in part of -- as part of the front to back of U.S. to the proper expense size against that wallet and against that TAM, the amount of debt and liquidity we need to put against that business, the amount of risk that we need to take on in the context of intermediating risk for clients and then, ultimately, the amount of capital to put against it. This is not something that David and I have just woken up to.","In fact, if you look at over the last several years, 3 to 5 years, there has been a lot of work on going inside the business to reduce expenses by about 30% in that period, reduce RWAs by about 40% in that period. And most importantly, an active and engaged move to reallocate capital around the firm, moving it away from a smaller business in FICC and putting it against Investment Banking or other businesses around the firm. And so while we have not sort of put as much headline to a lot of that activity as perhaps some of the other institutions, this is an evolutionary process that we've begun. It now has a greater sense of urgency and purpose in the context in which David described it, and I think we have a clear view, along with those running the business, about how to get to the right place and the right size of input allocation to the business itself.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.","Guy Moszkowski","First of all, before I ask my question, I just want to say I think it really does serve shareholders very well that you're doing this new, more fulsome strategic review and outlook. So I just want to thank you, I guess, on behalf of everybody for that. It's very useful to see.","David Solomon","Thank you, Guy. I appreciate that.","Stephen Scherr","Thanks for the feedback.","Guy Moszkowski","Yes, no worries. So I just want to follow up on Christian's questions on FICC. I was hoping maybe you could quantify for us the capital reallocation and the expense reallocation that you alluded to both in your prepared remarks and also in answering his question.","Stephen Scherr","Yes. I mean, I think the quantification that I can give you is really sort of part of what I was responding to in terms of Christian's question, which is in the last five years, as I said, we've taken expense down 30%, RWAs by 40% and reallocation of capital. I think my hope and my expectation is that David and I will be back to you over the course of the next several months with a very clear indication about the specific allocation of resources. And I'm not hesitating other than part of the front-to-back review that we are engaged in right now is to answer the very question you're asking, which is, again, understand the addressable market, including an expanded set of customers and clients that we will focus on and then being quite clear about what our taking that market can be and then the inputs to driving that business, whether it's expenses, liquidity, capital and otherwise. And my expectation is we'll be back to you with a clear view as to how that will take lift over time.","Guy Moszkowski","Okay. That's helpful. And obviously, we'll be looking for that. Follow-up question is in a different direction and just follows up on the comments that you made about the 1MDB situation and the litigation reserve bill that you quantified. The -- I guess my question would be, can you give us a sense at this point as to about how much bigger your reasonable -- reasonably possible loss or RPL will be that we'll see in the 10-K?","Stephen Scherr","Sure. So again, just to sort of be clear with folks as to what we said. So the fourth quarter litigation expense was $516 million. For the full year, we took litigation expense of $844 million. And as we sit here now, and so my comment on the RPL, which will obviously be disclosed in the K, now is premised only on what we know now and nothing more, so that could change. But based on what we know now, the RPL will be in the neighborhood of about $2 billion, independent of the reserves that I otherwise listed off for you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew O'Connor","I was wondering if you could talk a bit more about how you're thinking about the optimization of capital. Should we expect it to be kind of moving from one area to another area of the firm? Or are you hoping to maybe free up some more capital for shareholder buybacks and dividends and things like that?","Stephen Scherr","So I would say that there's a couple of variables in terms of the deployment of capital as a general matter. First, we obviously look at opportunities to deploy capital in accretive opportunities around growth initiatives, and so we'll continue to do that. And that is, in effect, redeploying capital from businesses that show less promise in terms of their overall return to those opportunities, both existing and new growth businesses, that show higher promise. Secondly, and I don't have to tell you, that there are limitations obviously to what we can do in terms of share buyback by virtue of CCAR, and we will continue to be as prudently aggressive as we can be in terms of the return of capital within the confines of CCAR. And obviously, we have yet to receive the scenario planning for this year, but that will factor in as best we can. And so I think that's the way to think about the deployment of capital, generally speaking. One, being an internal reallocation based on growth. But second, and in the growth sense, we want to invest in areas which will carry accretive returns for our shareholders and that can grow. And so our ambition and our MO will be just around that.","Matthew O'Connor","And then maybe a question for David on the capital theme still. You're clearly reviewing the businesses. You're looking to make the revenues more annuity-like than they've been. Is there something that you think you can accomplish organically? Or do you think it -- maybe it'll be supplemented by deals? And obviously, within deals, you've done some small bolt-on ones. But there does continue to be some questions, I think, among investors and analysts about the need for a bigger deal to help balance out the business. So maybe if you can just comment on your thoughts on that.","David Solomon","Sure. So look, as you would expect us do, we'll look at all options to grow the franchise both organic or inorganic. We're extremely focused on the organic opportunities, and we actually think the plan we're developing, which is an organic plan, can drive to meaningfully higher returns over time. And the preference would always be to drive organic progress in the business. I've said to many of you in meetings I've had in with you individually, and I'd say it here, we'll look at inorganic opportunities. I think you'll continue to see a few smaller add-on opportunities across our businesses, particularly when you look at asset management and wealth management. But the bar for doing significant inorganic move is extremely high. And as someone who's been around M&A for a significant portion of my career, I know the bar to do that should be extremely high. But it's our job as a management team to be well-versed on any opportunity that we think can advance our returns and our cost for shareholders, and we'll operate that way as we move forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with the Wells Fargo Securities.","Michael Mayo","If I can try a 1MDB question. So how much of this is related to the U.S., like were the securities -- were any of the securities -- U.S. securities or any of the buyers in the U.S. or any of the transaction structure in the U.S.? And the reason I ask is to help determine whether or not the Securities Exchange Act of 1933 or 1934 apply?","Stephen Scherr","Mike, thanks for the question. These securities were all reg S securities sold to non-U.S. buyers. And we're not structured in the U.S. nor under Reg S. We're destined to be sold to U.S. buyers.","Michael Mayo","All right. That's helpful. And then a more general question. 1MDB certainly is in the news. There's been many articles talking about the morale of employees and the potential impact on customers. What is the spillover effect of 1MDB on customers, employees, business or any other way other than what's happening in the legal and regulatory realm?","David Solomon","Sure, and I appreciate the question. Obviously, we think about this, and we monitor it carefully. First, I'll talk about employees first, and I think morale and the firm for employees is high. Employees feel good about the performance of the firm. They do not like the fact that we're dealing with the situation in 1MDB. And certainly, I think people here are extremely angry and upset about the fact that we had a partner of the firm involved in such a significant fraud. And as I said in my remarks, that's something that we have enormous regret about. But the business has performed well. I think people recognize that this is something that we're going through a deliberative process of resolving. But people feel good about the firm, our client franchise, the work they're doing with our clients and the way the firm's positioned. In terms of our clients, we obviously are extremely engaged with our clients and are talking to our clients on a regular basis, and I would say the impact on our client franchise at this point across the globe has been de minimis. I'm not, in any way, shape or form, not aware of all the noise in the press and all the articles. And I read them, I watch them as you do. And I, for a moment, would not say that the impact of this is a reputational dent to the firm that we have to and we'll work through. But that said, as we deal with clients and we stay focused on our clients, we're executing for them. And I think you also have to be cognizant of the fact that a lot of what gets in the press and where it comes from has motivations in the context of the resolution of what's a difficult process.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Question on the cash management business that you talked about at the beginning of the call, David. I just want to understand how much the investment is going into the technology side and how you're investing in the plant and equipment in terms of the banking licenses globally that you need in order to have this type of offering. Or do you partner with local banks? And then I have a follow-up just related to that and how you're thinking about the loan growth.","Stephen Scherr","Sure, Betsy. It's Stephen. I'll take that. So in the context of corporate cash management, you'll remember that our interest in this was in part a view that when we look at sort of the most significant relationships that we had in Investment Banking across those corporates that they were paying a considerable amount to the market, almost equal to that, that they pay in the market in which we participate, namely our Advisory and Underwriting business, but they were paying in and around Treasury services and corporate cash management. And given that this had historically been kind of the problems of lending banks, the fact that we have picked up our lending and credit into these, sort of gave us an entry point for this conversation. I'd also say that what we perceived was a pain point among corporate treasuries that the technology and the platforms they were working with were underwhelming. And what's more, if you look at what banks have been paying on operational deposits, it's been de minimis. And so from our perspective, this is something where with a clean sheet of paper, we can build the technology, we can design it, edge your way to address those pain points. ","And candidly, from a competitive point of view, the operational deposits are quite attractive to us even if we pay rates well above that, which are being paid by other banks just in the context of substitution for wholesale funding. When you look at the technology that we're building, I would say that there's a certain element of it which is synergistic with other technology builds that we have been undertaking, including Marcus and including what we've been building and strengthening the legal equity of GS Bank US. So for example, the development of the payments hub, which is obviously central not just to what we do in the context of Marcus, but equally what we would do in terms of corporate cash management. This business has developed over the last 5 or 10 years in terms of the ability to make use of many, many vendors to build this in the cloud, to integrate those vendors in a way that would have required organic build inside the organization, in a way that's not necessary now. I think as we build this and as we grow this, we're going to be selective. And we won't be all things to all people out of the box. We will select certain currencies among the major currencies where we will play. There are interesting vendor solutions that can take you to secondary and tertiary markets, where you don't necessarily need to build correspondent banking relationships on as proliferated a basis as you had 2 years ago. And so we intend to do that, that way. And so I think the technology is at hand. It's the right time to be doing this, and I think we can execute this. I'd also point out, just as an aside, that the first customer of this platform, in fact, will be Goldman Sachs such that we can reduce the cost of our own operational deposits outside of the bank, and I think in the process, de-risk the firm from that perspective.","Betsy Graseck","And when you think about how you get paid for this business, I mean, historically, in the industry, part of it has come from lending. So I just wanted to confirm if that's part of how you're expecting to get paid, but also how you think about the capital allocation to the loan book, not only in corporate, but in consumer. Awhile back, there was some commentary that maybe Marcus loan growth would be slowing. So if you can touch on that and also how you think about the balance sheet utilization towards loans versus towards buybacks.","Stephen Scherr","Sure. So I just want to be clear. When we look at the P&L prospect and we model out what returns we can get, return on lending is not part of what we look at in the context of corporate cash management. I'll come back to your lending question. But in the context of corporate cash management, there are basically 3 components, okay? One, and the most significant, are operational deposits. They are useful to us. They're probably more useful as a substitute for wholesale funding. The second, which ties back to an adjacency into our securities business, is the captive FX that plays out in the context of corporate cash management more generally. And then the third, which candidly is probably the smallest of the three, is fee-for-service.","When I was referring to lending, what I was pointing out was that for a long, long time, this was a business that was sort of exclusively in the province of lending institutions to corporates. Over time, we have grown our corporate lending book for reasons obviously unrelated to corporate cash management because it wasn't in the plan years ago but as part of what we've been doing strategically and growing and developing in terms of a broader set of products and relationships with corporates. That has been ongoing. That will continue to go on. It will go on with all of the attending risk issues and the like. But the P&L, if you will, that's generated from that lending, is not a motivating factor. It's just me pointing out to you that it had been, in effect, a gating item in a way in which corporate cash management had been thought about. And so we are a lender and a more prolific lender in that regard, and therefore, think we have more sort of access and right and title to sort of play and compete for this business.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken","Curious on Marcus deposits. We've heard here in the last few days a few banks commenting on the likelihood that we could see retail deposit costs increasing even if we don't see any short-term rate increases. If that plays out in 2019, could you maybe let us know how you would think about keeping your position competitively in the market at the upper end of that bound as far as payout goes, how you would adjust? Just how should we think about that as far the market deposits go?","Stephen Scherr","Sure. So I think if you look historically from the time that we acquired the GE deposit platform in the U.S., I would say that the beta was lower than where it's going, meaning it'll remain lower than one, but in the rate environment in which we were in, it was very little by way of movement and rate. There's been more acceleration of rate in the context of where interest rates have been moving. Our objective in the U.S. has always have been -- has always been to be in the top kind of 2, 3 or 4 in the sort of tables as rate paid. And I would point out that while we're not particularly motivated to pay more than we need to, the draw on these deposits is obviously rate dependent. And even at levels well beyond that which we're currently paying, these remain very accretive sort of funding to the firm relative to where we fund on a like-for-like duration in the wholesale market. And I think the diversification overall that's brought to us by these retail deposits is positive. And so that's kind of the story on rate. In the U.K., I would say that we opened up to be perfectly candid with much more demand than we had anticipated, and I think that'll give us an ability to moderate sort of the acceleration of rate in that. And I think we were the beneficiaries of sort of hitting a nerve in the U.K. market where we were paying more than the high street banks, and deposits came our way. But the influx of that, I think, will give us more maneuverability on the rate side.","Brennan Hawken","Terrific. I appreciate that. And then for my second question, while we've seen spreads net back and the loan market recover here, CLOs and levered loans became a big topic in the fourth quarter. So could you maybe let us know how you manage the risks of the warehouse? How much of your warehouse is funded with third-party equity? And if it is fully funded with third party, how you manage counterparty risk to those providers?","Stephen Scherr","Sure. So that can go in a number of ways. I'll start by saying that our CLO exposure is small. It's in the neighborhood of about $2 billion, about half of that is funded. If you look more broadly at our risk exposure in terms of leverage lending and the like, it remained small on relative terms. If you look at our underwriting book, our underwriting book skews heavily toward investment grade. And if you look at LBO risk, it's single digit in terms of where it sits and appreciably lower than where it was certainly if you go back to the financial crisis itself. And so we feel very good about our risk. I would say that we come into '19. And as I and others from a risk perspective look at the book, we feel comfortable at the flex that we have in our underwriting commitments. We are pleased at sort of the underwriting concessions. We're seeing flow of funds back into bond funds and loan funds, took a turn into January relative to the outflows that we saw in December. We're seeing investment-grade deals move. We're seeing caps in the term. So all of the, if you will, indicators on the dashboard are playing more favorably than what we've seen in the past, and I think we're very, very comfortable in terms of where we are in overall risk.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.","Steven Chubak","So I wanted to start off with a question on some of the efficiency commentary. And I have to say I was quite encouraged by the remarks really from both of you, Stephen and David, on focused driving efficiency, the higher accountability from the individual teams. And one of the interesting things that's been a big focus from investors is when we benchmark your efficiency ratio against the peers and really focusing in on the businesses that are comparable. The efficiency ratio range for the peers sets about 55% to 70%. It looks like you shook out somewhere closer to 64%, so already closer to that midpoint. And I'm just wondering how -- whether you can give us some insight to how you're thinking about long-term efficiency goals, really how you're benchmarking yourself across the peers as you continue to drive that focus on efficiency across the individual teams.","Stephen Scherr","Sure. So thanks for the question and for the comment. I mean, our view on efficiency ratio and the migration there is that we need to look across all expenses, particularly as we're building out sort of more platform-driven businesses, which will be less compensation, if you will, expense intensive and more operationally intensive. And obviously, the marginal margin as you build scale around those will increase, and so hence, our turn in that direction. I would point out that if you look at the efficiency ratio, we report a number which is flat year-on-year, again notwithstanding growth and expense of 12%. But equally, litigation reserves in that number took that number in a direction where it would have been about 230 basis points lower in terms of the efficiency ratio than where we reported it. I'm not suggesting that what we reported is anything but correct, but just to give you a sense of the migration. It's hard to know right now and to give you a sense of what the forward target would be. I think over time, you should expect us based on the revenue -- the durable revenue that David was talking about and recurring revenue on the basis of platform that we will extract greater efficiency in the business as the business skews in that direction and as we run through this front to back. And in the coming months as we meet and sit with more of you, my hope is that we can guide you, directionally speaking, to where this will go. But the downward trend is one that we hope to continue to realize.","Steven Chubak","Stephen, those insights are quite helpful. Just one follow-up as it relates to some of your comments on the marginal margin improving, and I know it was a little more than a year ago when you initially laid out those growth targets on the revenue side of $5 billion. You had talked about a marginal margin of 50%. Clearly, that's required some frontloading of investment. But I'm wondering with about half of the incremental revenue growth still ahead of us, how we should think about that incremental margin on the next $2.5 billion of revenue growth that [Technical Difficulty].","Stephen Scherr","[Technical Difficulty] example of that is in any lending business, when you are in a growth mode, you continue to have reserve build right to the point at which you are at a comfortable, steady state. And from there, you start to see the margin increase. And so I think that each of these businesses, whether it's corporate cash management or Marcus, are all in their early stages. They haven't yet hit their stride, notwithstanding our expectation that they'll hit the targets we set for them in 2020. Those targets were, by no means, a limit of where we think we can take the firm in terms of the overall growth trajectory generally. I would also say that the commentary on efficiency and higher marginal margin should not be limited exclusively to kind of the growth initiatives themselves. So look at FICC, for example. FICC over time, and David was talking about this, there's an element of platform electronification as a means of which you can drive higher volumes in a narrowing a bid-offer spread. And I think even there, as we progress the initiative to build out those platforms, we'll realize greater margin. Again, that's an incumbent business. So the commentary is not limited to those on the growth side.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","James Mitchell","Maybe a strategy question in retail. I always think of Goldman's core competency is creating wealth management, and you kind of led with retail banking. And just -- I appreciate the comments on starting to build out a digital wealth. Have you thought -- or is it in your plans to think about also building out more of a complete brokerage platform as well to kind of leverage your gain throughput through your institutional platform?","David Solomon","So as we talked about, as we think about Marcus and we think about Marcus as it started with one plan -- with one product. Our plan has always been to build a platform, and that platform would be digital, and it would be a storefront over which we could distribute multiple products, some products that we originate and come off our platform, some products maybe that we distribute for others. There's always been a focus on the fact that we have a massive wealth management business at the very, very high end. And we've always shied away from broadening that footprint or making it more retail, for another lack of term, because the only way you could do that previously was to basically own a big brokerage. And there were a lot of reasons why we didn't think, for us, that owning a big brokerage was something that we wanted to do as we thought strategically going forward about where the firm would go. But now with a digital platform, we have opportunities to acquire clients and feed clients into our platform on a much more effective cost of customer acquisition basis. And so our vision is to continue to build out that platform and add more products and more connectivity into our wealth management business over time.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.","Devin Ryan","Great. I guess, first question here, you gave a little bit of a preview, so I'm just going to ask another one on the front-to-back review. I think it's largely been viewed as kind of a net cost-cutting capital reduction exercise. But on the other side of that, do you have any early reads on what specific existing businesses look like they might deserve more investment or more capital than maybe you previously realized? And just so that we know, is this going to come with first quarter results? Or when should we expect this?","David Solomon","Sure. So first, obviously when you want a front to back and you look at your businesses, there's an element of cost-cutting and capital allocation. But the real purpose of looking at businesses front to back, the starting fundamental purpose is to understand your addressable market and the opportunity set and then with your resources to figure out the most effective way to deliver on it. So I want to be very, very clear. As any new management team would do in any large company, as they start down the path of evolving a strategy, you really want to look at the opportunity you have in businesses and then your ability to deliver on those opportunities. And so at a high level, the purpose of the front to back was both opportunity and then also efficiency, as you highlight. Stephen has a couple of other comments just with respect to kind of the detail.","Stephen Scherr","Well, I would just point out, I think that this is going to cascade down in the organization, meaning our ambition is to put more of the costs in the direct control of the businesses so that they are owning the front to back. In effect, they ought to own their pretax line, meaning they're owning both their revenue line and the cost base. Now I should point out that we will keep certain functions in at the core, as you would expect us do from a control and risk point of view. So there'll be elements of ops and elements of tech that are held at the core. And needless to say, second and third line of control remain at the core. But we're looking to sort of put costs into the control hand of the business and driving businesses to a greater efficiency proposition in terms of how they conduct themselves.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Can you guys share with us -- and I apologize if you have addressed this. But what impact do you think the MiFID changes has had on your equity business? Obviously, you had good numbers this quarter, year-over-year growth as did some of the large -- your large competitors. Can you give us some color? We're 12 months into it, what have you guys seen from the changes with MiFID II?","Stephen Scherr","Sure. So what we have seen from MiFID II is really market share consolidation, and it's played out at one level by geography and then another level in terms of individual firms. So we've seen more share consolidate, and that consolidated share move out of certain of the European banks and into the U.S. banks in terms of share of equities. And then within that, it's become kind of a tight game of which, needless to say, we are a major player. And so our expectation is that we're going to continue to see that consolidation. My hope is that we continue to benefit from that share consolidation. And I think we do so in part because we've developed over many years, and we'll continue, research platforms and high-value content that we can play out. And the share comes back to us in -- as a consequence.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.","Stephen Scherr","Okay. Since there are no more questions, we would like to take a moment to thank everybody for joining the call. On behalf of our senior management team, we hope to see many of you in the coming months. If any additional questions arise in the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out to Heather. Otherwise, enjoy the rest of your day, and we look forward to speaking with you on our first quarter call in April.

Harvey?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Thanks, Dane. I would like to thank all of you for joining us today. I will give an overview of our fourth quarter and full year results, and then David and I will take your questions.","Full year net revenues for 2012 were $34.2 billion. Net earnings were $7.5 billion. Earnings per diluted share were $14.13, and our return on common equity was 10.7%. Fourth quarter net revenues were $9.2 billion. Net earnings were $2.9 billion, and earnings per diluted share were $5.60. The operating environment in 2012 was defined by a few significant trends: Substantial central bank activity, improved economic data in the United States and continued political uncertainty. For example, actions and commentary by the European Central Bank played a significant role in moderating concerns about a European linked tail event. At the end of 2011, the ECB announced that it would enhance its long-term refinancing operations to provide term liquidity.","The ECB further demonstrated its commitment during 2012 by affirming its support for the euro and its willingness to make outright purchases in the secondary bond market. In the United States, the Federal Reserve also took steps to support markets and economic growth, announcing further increases in monetary stimulus during the year. In 2012, the U.S. economy posted stable to improving economic data, particularly with developments in unemployment and housing. Over the course of the year, the U.S. economy added nearly 2 million jobs and the housing price index increased by 4% over the past 12 months.","Despite the systemic benefits of Central Bank activity and improved U.S. economic data, our clients continue to struggle with the complex set of issues facing the global economy and the political backdrop. The most obvious recent example was the debate in the United States surrounding the fiscal cliff. These factors translated into mixed activity levels for our corporate client base. For example, global debt issuance increased by 11% year-over-year, with high-yield issuance increasing 38%. In contrast, global equity underwriting volumes were only up 1% and completed global merger and acquisition volumes actually decreased 18% in 2012 and remain very low as a percentage of market capitalization.","We experienced lower activity levels in most of our businesses and general risk aversion by our investment clients. This was offset by improving asset prices and lower volatility, which created a more favorable market-making environment. Although equity and fixed-income asset prices trended up over the course of the year, volumes generally declined given the previously mentioned factors. For example, U.S.-listed equity volumes declined 18% in 2012. And as we all know, the S&P 500 declined by 13%.","While macroeconomic challenges persist, our leadership teams remain focused on enhancing our returns. Drivers of our long-term success include focusing on our clients, prudently managing our risk profile and being disciplined about capital and expenses. I'll now review each of our businesses.","Investment Banking produced fourth quarter net revenues of $1.4 billion, up 21% from the third quarter. The increase was due to higher equity underwriting revenues following a weak third quarter and continued strength in debt underwriting. For the full year, Investment Banking net revenues were $4.9 billion, up 13% from 2011 due to a robust environment for debt issuance. Within Investment Banking, fourth quarter Advisory revenues were $508 million, flat with the third quarter. Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&A for 2012. We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the fourth quarter, including Kraft's $36.1 billion spinoff of its North American grocery business; Walt Disney's $4.1 billion acquisition of Lucasfilm; and Dollar Thrifty's $2.3 billion sale to Hertz. We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the fourth quarter: Ralcorp Holdings' $6.8 billion sale to ConAgra; the $4.5 billion sale of eAccess to Softbank; and Gambro's $4 billion sale to Baxter International.","Fourth quarter underwriting net revenues were $897 million, up 37% sequentially as issuance improved relative to the third quarter. Equity underwriting revenues of $304 million increased 61% compared to the third quarter, reflecting increased fuel activity. Goldman Sachs was ranked first in worldwide equity and equity-related and common stock offerings for 2012. Debt underwriting revenues increased 27% to $593 million due to our involvement in several significant transactions and a favorable new issue environment.","During the fourth quarter, we participated in noteworthy underwriting transactions, including AIG's $6.4 billion sale of its remaining stake in AIA; AvalonBay Communities' $2.2 billion follow-on offering; and Clear Channel Outdoor's $2.7 billion high-yield offering. Our Investment banking backlog increased compared with the end of the third quarter. It was also higher than year end 2011.","Let me now turn to Institutional Client Services, which is comprised of FICC and equities client execution, commissions and fees, and securities services. Net revenues were $4.3 billion in the fourth quarter, up 4% from the third quarter. Net revenues within Institutional Client Services improved as the fourth quarter included an approximately $500 million gain from the sale of our hedge fund administration business. Full year net revenues of $18.1 billion for Institutional Client Services were up 5% relative to 2011 and included a $714 million DVA loss. Excluding the impact of DVA, revenues were up 13% year-over-year and benefited from an improving market environment with tighter credit spreads, higher equity prices and lower levels of volatility.","FICC Client Execution net revenues were $2 billion in the fourth quarter, including a DVA loss of $79 million, and were down 8% sequentially as certain businesses reflected seasonally low levels of activity. Credit revenues increased significantly as client activity was supported by a favorable market backdrop, which included a relatively benign macro environment. Robust primary issuance and tighter credit spreads also helped.","Currency revenues also increased. Commodities revenues were higher compared to weaker third quarter results, although absolute levels of client activity remained pretty low. While rates and mortgages were lower sequentially, both businesses were strong contributors to the franchise. For the full year, FICC Client Execution net revenues of $9.9 billion were up 10% relative to 2011. Excluding the impact of DVA, revenues were up 20% compared to 2011, as markets in 2012 were less turbulent and benefited from an improved backdrop in Europe, modest growth in the U.S. and strong central bank activity.","In equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and securities services, net revenues for the fourth quarter were $2.3 billion, up 18% sequentially and included $47 million in DVA losses. Excluding the impact of DVA, revenues were up 12% relative to the third quarter. Equities client execution revenues decreased 10% sequentially to $764 million, reflecting fewer client-driven opportunities in our cash market-making business. Commissions and fees were $722 million, roughly flat with third quarter levels. Securities services net revenues of $818 million reflected the $500 million gain on sale that was previously mentioned. For the full year, equities produced net revenues of $8.2 billion, consistent with 2011.","Turning to risk. Average daily VaR in the fourth quarter was $76 million, down from $81 million in the third quarter.","Now I'll review Investing & Lending, which includes both direct investing and investing through funds across various asset classes, as well as lending activities. Investing and lending produced net revenues of $2 billion in the fourth quarter. Our investment in ICBC produced a $334 million gain in the quarter. Other equity investments generated $789 million in gains, reflecting realized and unrealized gains on private equity investments and mark-ups related to public equity investments, as equity markets were stronger in Asia and Europe.","Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $485 million, largely driven by tightening credit spreads and net interest income. Other revenues of $365 million consists primarily of operating revenues from our consolidated investment entities and are largely offset by equivalent expenses. For the full year, Investing & Lending generated net revenues of $5.9 billion, driven by a $408 million gain on our investment in ICBC, $2.4 billion in gains from other equity investments, $1.9 billion of net revenues from debt securities and loans, and $1.2 billion of other investments.","In Investment Management, we reported fourth quarter net revenues of $1.5 billion, up 26% from the third quarter, primarily as a result of $344 million in incentive fees generated from the firm's alternative asset products. Management and other fees were 5% higher at $1.1 billion. For the full year, Investment Management net revenues were $5.2 billion, up 4% from 2011 levels and stronger incentive fees.","During the fourth quarter, assets under supervision increased $14 billion to $965 billion, largely due to net inflows of $15 billion into other client assets, mainly as a result of Advisory mandates. Total assets under management were essentially unchanged. On a full year basis, assets under supervision increased 8% as other client assets received $39 billion of net inflows. We ended the year with $111 billion of other client assets. Assets under management increased 3%, reflecting net market appreciation and was partially offset by outflows.","Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior-year equity awards and other items such as benefits, increased 6% to $12.9 billion for 2012 and translated into a compensation-to-net-revenues ratio of 37.9%. It is important to note that our lower compensation ratio in 2012 is, in part, a byproduct of our efficiency efforts that began in early 2011.","Fourth quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.9 billion, 24% higher than the third quarter. Other expenses were significantly higher, reflecting net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings of $260 million, an increase of approximately $200 million over the third quarter. Based on the provision taken this quarter, combined with previous reserves, we have fully accounted for the independent foreclosure review settlement. The fourth quarter also included a $157 million donation to Goldman Sachs Gives, our donor advised charitable fund. Finally, depreciation and amortization increased by approximately $100 million, driven by impairments to certain investment entities and our New York Stock Exchange designated market maker rights. For the full year, non-compensation expenses were down 4%.","Total staff at year-end were approximately 32,400, down 3% from year-end 2011, and 9% from year-end 2010. Our effective tax rate was 33.3% for 2012. During the quarter, we repurchased 12.7 million shares of common stock for a total cost of $1.5 billion. For the full year, we repurchased 42 million shares for a total cost of $4.6 billion. Historically, our financial success has been a function of broad and deep client relationships, our best-in-class people, our disciplined approach to locating financial and human capital and a culture of collaboration and partnership. The value of this partnership is highlighted in challenging market environments and drove our results in 2012.","Looking forward, we believe that we are well positioned to expand our client franchise globally. For corporate clients, we will continue to leverage our strong M&A, equity and debt underwriting positions. For investing and other institutional clients, we will continue to rely on the quality of our content and execution. We will remain very disciplined in our approach to expenses, balancing near-term benefits to our margins against longer term revenue opportunities.","As we gain greater clarity on regulatory changes, particularly capital requirements, we will respond accordingly. For example, given the Basel III capital changes that we incur as an owner of our own reinsurance business, we are considering a potential sale of the majority stake in the business. We have strong risk-adjusted capitalization, which provides protection to shareholders against tail events. In addition, our capital levels also create opportunities. First, it positions the firm to help our clients navigate an uncertain economic event. It also allows us to provide capital where capacity is diminished. We are committed to effectively deploying our capital and maintaining dry powder to meet future client needs.","We will also return capital to shareholders when appropriate returns aren't available. And our capital trends in 2012 reflected our measured approach as our estimated Basel Tier 1 capital ratio increased from approximately 8% to nearly 9%, despite returning $5.5 billion to shareholders via share buybacks and dividends.","We are encouraged by the early signs of improvement in the markets and economy but remain cautious given the complexity of the risk and challenges. The quality of our advice and execution in today's challenging markets serves as a foundation for maintaining long-term client relationships and ultimately meeting the needs of all of our stakeholders.","Everyone at Goldman Sachs remains steadfast in their commitment to serving our client franchise. We have a deep appreciation for our responsibility to all of our constituents: clients, shareholders, regulators, our employees and, of course, the broader financial system. We believe that there's a shared interest among our constituents to manage the firm in a way that supports economic growth and sustainability. Our firm is fully committed to filling that responsibility.","With that, I'd like to take a moment to thank David on behalf of the firm for his significant contributions to Goldman Sachs over his 32-year career. There is no doubt that our clients, employees, regulators and shareholders have all benefited from his unwavering commitment, sound judgment and devotion to the firm's culture and principles. As a personal note, I really want to thank you. You've been a tremendous partner, David, and not only during this transition. I truly can't thank you enough. I look forward to working with you as a member of our Board of Directors. For those of you who aren't keeping track, this is David's 55th consecutive earnings call. It is only fitting that he provide some closing comments. David?","David A. Viniar","Thank you, Harvey. As many of you know, I spent my entire career at Goldman Sachs. So it's all I know. I always believed that it was a special place. That is a perception which has been validated over the last several years given my experiences during this period of stress. I witnessed the strength of our client franchise, the quality and dedication of our people and the commitment of our shareholders. It was an honor to be asked to join the Board of Directors. I look forward to continuing to serve as a steward for shareholders in that role. It is a responsibility that I take with full confidence in the strength of the client franchise, the financial health of the company, and the caliber and devotion of our people. I would also like to thank all of our shareholders, debt investors and research analysts for their support of the firm and me, personally. I leave knowing that I am turning the role over to Harvey, who has the skills and judgment to warrant that same level of support.","Thank you, again, for listening today, and now Harvey and I are happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instruction]","[Audio Gap]","Your first question is from the line of Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I think everyone would acknowledge 2012 was a pretty tough year for the industry, but yet when all is said and done, the firm posted nearly 11% return on equity. Just given where revenues and where you decided to accrue comps, can you just discuss the significance of that 11%? Is that in a threshold ROE that we should think about that you don't want to fall below in a challenging environment?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So what I would say about 2012, obviously, as you mentioned, certainly some elements of the marketplace were particularly challenging. What put us in a position to achieve the ROE, really, were the steps we took over the last 2 years in terms of managing expenses and being quite disciplined. But in terms of what we're able to achieve in the future, we're going to have to see what the market opportunity brings to us. But this was a year where, like all years, we took everything into account, performance, the competitive dynamic. And as I said, we benefited from the steps that we took over the past 2 years. But quite frankly, I don't think  -- while we'll be pleased with the performance of the environment, it's not particularly aspirational. We'd like to do better.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then switching gears, Harvey, with respect to Investing & Lending, you noted the improved realization environment and mix, as many of your investments have been in the ground for a few years now, I was hoping you could provide us some thoughts on how you think about the realization pipeline, give us a little bit more detail on that appetite to sell today if markets were cooperative.","Harvey M. Schwartz","So the ability to monetize, as you know, is really driven by 2 factors. Obviously, it's market performance, but it's also the idiosyncratic nature of your own portfolio. So in the past year, obviously, there are opportunities. You could argue that our performance exceeded that of the marketplace in terms of what you might expected. But that was this past year, and our portfolio performed well. I think in some quarters, it will perform well; in some quarters, we won't perform as well relative to the marketplace, but the market will drive that. Certainly, over time, with events around the world, we feel like we'll see attractive investment opportunities. But in terms of the scheduled monetization, difficult to predict.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just finally, for me, I realize we are now 10 trading days into the new year. But just given all that happened at the end of 2012 with the fiscal cliff and so forth, just curious how the year has begun.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Too early to tell with only 10 business days into the quarter. You could paint a picture of concern given events in Europe and certainly, events in Washington that could be disruptive. If you talk to our economist, our economist would say that we'll see pretty modest growth for the first half of the year in the developed economies and it'll exceed that in the growth economies in maybe the second half of the year. But it's difficult to anticipate that. We do feel pretty well positioned from a business point of view, whether in our Investment Banking franchise and certainly across the firm, to capitalize on opportunities. But too early to tell.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I think risk-weighted assets were down 8% quarter-on-quarter, but GAAP was down only about 1%. I know those are different animals. Just curious what drove the RWA in the quarter and then if you had any thoughts on as we look forward, obviously, just on what's the path going forward for RWA.","Harvey M. Schwartz","So I wouldn't focus so much on the quarter-over-quarter move, more so, really, on the end of last year to the end of this year. So that's roughly 100 basis points, 8% to nearly 9%. And as we've said before, as we get visibility into the rules, we will deploy our teams with tools, and we'll be able to react. So what we're really seeing over the course of the year is the effort to be more efficient with capital and, of course, the earnings performance. And so we will continue to react as we get more visibility into all the rules.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So is that a way of saying that as the rules come out, I think this quarter, many companies have been pushing through getting other model approval. This was a little more driven by that versus actual assets going out the door?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Yes, we're not in a position to comment on any model approvals.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. How about in a different way. And I understand the sensitivity. As the rules come out, I think Goldman's, historically, been very good at pushing out whatever the new rules are to the trading desks on the technology on the desktop and it makes the company more efficient in that manner. Can you just maybe comment where are we in that process? And am I correct to say that, that is how we can envision higher ROEs going forward?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Well, the way I would think about it is the performance is going to drive the ROEs, and that will be about our competitive position and ability to deliver our franchise to our clients relative to others in the context of what the market provides. With respect to managing our capital, I think you should expect us to continue to be disciplined. And when we get visibility around rules, we will look to be particularly responsive. But we want to be very careful not to overreact before we have a rule, and we don't want to underreact after we have a rule. So we hope to do more.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Excellent. On the positive side, the competitive landscape has definitely shifted a little bit. I think there's a lot of pressure under some of the European Investment Banks to do some form of shrinkage, small or large. Do you view that as big opportunity? I know that over the past year or so or 2 during the European crisis, you guys have commented that it might be your best near-term opportunity. Is that still in motion? And how are you going about positioning for it?","Harvey M. Schwartz","I wouldn't say that it's the best near-term opportunity. I think those things are always difficult to weigh. But I think if you -- if you're thinking about sort of longer-term strategy across multiple years, certainly, capacity leaving the industry broadly and specifically opportunities in Europe, we think we're well positioned, and they look attractive to us, but we'll have to see what materializes. I think the reason why I focus on near-term is it's very difficult to be too precise about how these things unfold and certainly when.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Got you. Last one's a quickie, and I -- if you're schooled in David Viniar answers, I know it's going to be a quick answer, too. But this year, revs were up 19%, comp dollars were up 6%, and non-comp was down 4%. That's a fantastic mix for shareholders. I know we can't predict the future, so let's just make believe for a second that revenues will be flat on the go-forward basis. In a flat revenue world, does comp ratio stay and non-comp expenses keep trending lower?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So I think you have to go back again to the -- to how we manage the company and how we think about compensation specifically. So there are a whole host there of factors that go into that. One is going to be how our performance is and certainly, that's going to be reflected in compensation. The competitive dynamic is certainly in there. And then, of course, this is a balance issue, obviously, in terms of providing returns to shareholders. And this year, we hope we got the balance right. As I said, we're not satisfied. We'd like to do better. But again, it will be determined by what the market opportunity provides us in the future.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So we've seen 2 quarters where core revenues have probably come in a bit better than expected, not only for you, but the industry. It feels like activity may be stabilizing, hopefully improving. But when we look at the liquidity reserve, it still seems pretty high. I think in the past you said when the environment gets better, you could see that trend down. So I guess basically, does that relationship still stand? Do you sense any improvement? Or are there still enough regulatory uncertainties on liquidity and funding side to remain ultra conservative?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Well, I think what I'd say, just as a matter of principle, we're always going to be conservative with our liquidity. I'd like to say there's 2 core lifebloods to the firm: one is our clients, and the other is our liquidity. And so we're going to stay very focused on both. Look, there's a lot of uncertainty in the world, and I agree with you that when you look back over the past 6 months, certainly, the world feels a bit better. Clients, generally, although there was a fairly significant amount of risk aversion, got better towards the end of the year. And we'll see how this year goes. But there's still a lot of things in front of the world, so I wouldn't expect any significant shift.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just a follow-up on Glenn's question on the RWAs. Maybe just -- like when you look at the rules and trying to manage the assets and the capital, what percent -- I know it's a easy question, probably tougher to answer, but what percent of the rules do you feel you have clarity on? Meaning, like what inning are we in that process, fully getting clarity so you can manage your assets?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So, yes, that's a hard question. I would say that I'll try to be as narrow as possible. I would say that on capital, I don't know. Maybe we're in the sixth inning in terms of capital rule visibility. Maybe some people could argue the seventh. But that's kind of it using a baseball analogy. I think the broader issue is the collective visibility into all rules, whether it's Volcker, the impact of Dodd-Frank, things that impact globally. And so -- and there, I don't think we have a lot of collective visibility into the weight of that. And actually, I think it's difficult for the regulators to really assess all of that, which, quite frankly, is a concern for the industry and, obviously, it's a concern for the global economy.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Right, okay. And then last one, you mentioned just the reinsurance business maybe putting that up for sale. Just wondering, I mean, it might be too early, but any size of that business? And maybe same thing on Investing & Lending, you guys have said in the past, there's areas of that business where it's on the lending side. So you'll continue to operate that business and then there's other areas that will wind down over time. So any update on the assets or the revenues related to those businesses and then capital that would be released and redeployed elsewhere?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So I'm not in a position to comment on the reinsurance business beyond what's in the release. What I would say with respect to Investing & Lending is those are core competencies of the firm. And so when we've -- for example, when we had visibility on part of the Volcker Rule, we took steps around certain businesses. But at this stage, this will be about how we adapt to rules as we get further visibility. And so I don't know necessarily that we would say we'd deemphasize anything in Investing & Lending at this stage. Now of course, over time, as businesses like the reinsurance business are maybe better held in other people's hands and we can be a minority owner because of capital reasons, then we'll make those decisions. But that'll be on a business-by-business basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","One question to follow up on that. I'm just sort of assuming that if you guys hold the minority stakes then in the reinsurance business, it would probably be below the Basel III threshold to avoid a hickey.","Harvey M. Schwartz","[indiscernible]","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then also how should we think about [indiscernible] shot, how should we think about a comp ratio on [indiscernible] revenues [indiscernible] that would be at a lower rate than it would be for other businesses in the firm? But can you maybe provide some color to help us out on that front?","Harvey M. Schwartz","I think it's really important to emphasize the point that when we think about the comp ratio, we think about it in terms of the aggregate of the firm. And then within that, we compensate across the various business units, and we build it up individual by individual.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So -- but you'll clearly take into account revenue mix when you start to think about those allocations, right? Because that's basically what is the sum of the parts.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Yes. I would say it more simply. We don't look to overpay anybody.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So then with that in mind, then you could easily say that given the competitive environment right now for talent on the Street, that the improvement in the comp ratio should be at least somewhat sustainable for the benefit of shareholders here in the near-term, is that fair?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Well, I guess you could surmise that. As far as I can tell, even as capacity has been leaving the industry, there's been a huge demand for Goldman Sachs people. And so the competitive dynamic in aggregate may feel much better. But for very talented people at Goldman Sachs, they're very attractive.","David A. Viniar","Brennan, it's David. You've heard me say this many times before, so I'll just say it again. We don't set a comp ratio. We don't start the process and say here's the comp ratio. We compensate our people individually, and we take into account the performance of the firm, the competitive environment all the time. And we're always looking at those things. So it's hard for us to say what it's going to be going forward.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, no, that's fair. Unfortunately, we have to set a comp ratio in our model, so I've got to give it a shot. And then I guess last one for me, any color on deferrals? I mean, it's been sort of my understanding that you guys have historically had less deferred comp than peers, which clearly gives you greater flexibility. We're hearing a lot of noise around deferrals here given the calendar and where we are. But do you intend to try to keep that flexibility? What's your view on that front?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So there are no deferrals. And I think you're right to say that you have to be very thoughtful when you do that because there's a bit of mortgaging the future. And so, no, there's been no deferrals. I'm sorry, no additional deferrals.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, I was going to clarify that.","Harvey M. Schwartz","I'm getting my -- I got my last bit of mentoring from David there.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski from Autonomous Research.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP","The CFTC obviously pushed back timing of some of the OTC reforms with respect to central clearing, at least to -- pretty close to the middle of the year. And I know this is kind of a narrow question, but I'm just interested in how you think about it. All else equal, would you expect that revenues in FICC from or broadly from OTC Derivatives transactions would be higher in the first half as a result of just that change, or is not -- that not the right way to think about it?","Harvey M. Schwartz","I think it's a good question. I think that the only case study we have is really history. And when you look back over history, history is proving that -- a couple things: One, it's proven that rule changes, and the ultimate impact on market structure, incredibly difficult to predict. I would say -- and I didn't really feel this way about a year ago. I thought that the rule delays or uncertainty around rules, I didn't think was having an impact in terms of client activity. I do think as we get more clarity on rule certainty, it may ultimately impact client activity to the positive. Now having said that, I wouldn't trade off that delay for bad rule-making, and I think the CFTC and other regulators have been pretty thoughtful about taking the steps to delay rules because the single most important thing is that the market has an opportunity to adapt because we just -- we don't want to increase systemic risk while the regulators are trying to put the rules in place. So I think all these delays have been quite thoughtful.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP","And from a competitive perspective, just to one of the points that you just alluded to, as the changes in the regulatory environment, for example, Basel III capital requirements get better understood and your competitors move closer to full adoption, do you feel like the pricing dynamic for transactions that have a big slug of capital that has to be priced into them has become more rational?","Harvey M. Schwartz","I'm not so sure it's necessarily capital rules. I think broadly speaking, it's a level-playing field and so we all have the same rule set. The way we have to differentiate ourselves is by leaning into our strengths. And we have a history of our clients wanting capital, and we want to differentiate ourselves by providing capital. And so I think it's really how you execute. Everybody's going to live with the same rule set.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP","But do you feel like over the last couple of years, competitive pricing has really been rational with respect to what those medium- to longer-term capital requirements are? And if it hasn't been as much so as you would've liked, do you feel like it's gotten closer?","Harvey M. Schwartz","I think that -- and now we're getting into more art than science. I think that competitive response as it relates to things like capital changes, that's a very -- that's something that plays out over the intermediate to long term. In the short run, you can see a rational behavior by competitors, which can't be explained by any capital rule. I would say -- and I'm not sure this is related all to capital, but I do think that the crisis itself at the margin had made people much more disciplined about their capital deployment. And so, for example, I don't even know if this is an indicator that you could extrapolate into your question, but in the fourth quarter, there was an amazing amount of log activity. There were days where David and I were working with our teams in banking and the financing group on sometimes 4 or 5 inquiries. If you ask me on that particular day in December, did pricing feel a bit more rational? Yes. But I couldn't tell you if that same day occurred this January, whether or not it would be as rational. But over years, the market makes people more rational.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP","Yes, it's helpful. And then one last question, which follows up a little bit on something that was being talked about before. In Investing & Lending, as you'd said, when it became very, very clear that proprietary activities were going to be precluded, you shot a bunch of that down. What other business adjustments, not necessarily shutdowns, but significant changes to parts of I&L, are you either doing or contemplating? For example, in the lending and distressed debt trading parts of the business?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Well, I would say there are obviously a number of rules that can have incremental impact there, Volcker being one of them. But we'll see Volcker when it comes out, and we'll respond accordingly. But also, those businesses obviously tended to have more capital. And so we have no immediate plans for any changes, but to the extent we need to respond again, we'll do it.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP","David, farewell. Thanks again so much for all your help over the years.","David A. Viniar","Thanks, Guy, I appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Roger Freeman with Barclays.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Let me just pick up there on Guy's question. On I&L, I mean, you've kind of got, I think you said, a decent amount of clarity on the capital portion. There's still other pieces, including Volcker, outstanding. But -- and some more of this sort of traditional, sort of the equity investments area, I mean, is that -- that's an area that presumably you'd continue to invest in or maybe even pick up again because I think that's been somewhat of a lull, if the returns are there, right? I mean, you'd look at this just like any private equity investor, just with the return threshold based on the capital requirements, right?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Yes, it would be just like that.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then separately, in -- on comp, the -- so some of the reduced ratio sounds like it kind of came out of the restructuring efforts over the past 1.5 years or so. Like how much of that sort of decline in the ratio do you attribute to that versus sort of the market environment, competitive environment?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Yes, we don't -- we don't think about it that way in terms of parsing it. I understand why you'd ask the question. I think that what we would say is the following: obviously, there was a lot of operating leverage in the business this year, and you see the translation of that in terms of the increased revenues into all the metrics. But in terms of how we think about commenting, David discussed it earlier, it's going to be performance-driven and then we take all of those other factors into account, including the balance and what our shareholders need.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then -- and I guess you've kind of touched on this, but the liquidity levels remain still at the highs. With the environment more stable at this point, what do you kind of look for to bring that down, if you have any plans to?","Harvey M. Schwartz","I have no plans to bring it down, so I haven't looked at it.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. That's it for now. Okay, thanks and good luck to you, David.","David A. Viniar","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","One kind of nitpicky question. But on the Investing & Lending in the debt side, can you give us a sense as to realized versus unrealized?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Yes. I think it's something like a little more than 1\/2. Feels like it.","David A. Viniar","On the debt side, remember, there's interest...","Harvey M. Schwartz","I'm sorry, on the debt side.","David A. Viniar","There's interest in there as well. And I would think that it would be more unrealized on the debt side than realized. But we can come back to the breakdown. But remember, a big part of that is interest also.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Right. No, I'm definitely taking the interest piece out. Just asking on the noninterest piece. Okay. And is that...","Harvey M. Schwartz","Yes, we can follow up with you. I don't think I'm far off, but we'll double check for you.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. All right, cool. And then on the equity side, we can follow up on that, too?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Sorry, can you repeat the question?","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","On the equity side, the realized versus unrealized. Is that mostly unrealized? Is that fair?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Yes. It's a bit more than 1\/2 on that also.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. All right. And then I know we discussed the clearing question. I just wanted to understand how you're thinking about managing the potential outcomes here. Because as initial margin does get charged to the buy side, whether or not it goes on schedule or is a little bit delayed, how are you thinking about setting yourselves up for what could be a changed behavior on the client side when initial margin comes through?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So this is an important question because you could extrapolate, in some respects, our strategy and philosophy around reg reform pretty broadly in this context. So it's incredibly important for us to serve our clients as best we can today. And so hard to truly anticipate what any will change, initial margin, for example, will have on their behavior, but we know we need to be there for them today. And so we'll adapt as they adapt. And again, this is a very careful balance because our view is you need to be incredibly focused as the rules come into frame, clearly. I think that's obvious. But there can be quite a penalty, I think, paid for overreacting. And so if you ask me -- if I answer the question very narrowly, we have no explicit plans to adjust around that. But when we see the rules and we work with our clients, we'll work with them as closely as possible to adapt and make sure that their needs are fulfilled.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Right. So we have some examples of this in the energy market, right, because we've already seen some rule change and had some behavior move from swaps to futures. And so I'm just wondering if that has given you any sense of experience with regard to how you might behave as the other products come online.","Harvey M. Schwartz","I don't think it's as much, for example, swaps to futures, although it could be, and it could end up looking just like the energy market. But clients, of course, have been large users of futures for many, many years. And so they always could have used futures. So that was always a choice. I think a good example of regulatory reform impact would be the collection of rules, whether it was decimalization or Reg ATS, et cetera in the equity markets in 1999. I think it was in 2000 in the early part of the decade. And I think that had transformational effects, obviously, on the equity markets. We all know that now in retrospect, and that forced us to make significant changes in our business. We had to reduce staff significantly. Back in the day, a very small portion of what we did in the equity business was electronic. Now, on any given day, the vast majority of what we do will be done electronically. And so I think it's hard to predict, but the key issue is being very close to our clients during that period. But it's really about how we adapt. And so I'm not trying to evade your question. I'm just saying it's too early to speculate on how we'd adapt. But we just have to execute.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Right. So be nimble and carry some capacity to manage through it?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Yes. I mean, I can't imagine reducing capacity and then trying to rebuild it. That would be really hard.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.","Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just kind of always believing that people's actions speak louder than what they can say sometimes. Looking at your share buybacks and going back to 2010, every single quarter, the kind of the share buyback has been in the range of somewhere between $1 billion and $1.5 billion. And conversely, every single quarter since late 2010, your tangible common equity at the end of the period has been $63 billion or $64 billion. So I'm curious, which is the target and which is the plug? Is it that you've decided that at this kind of level of profitability, yes, $5 billion or $6 billion a year is the right amount of buyback? Or is it just that $63 billion, $64 billion is all you need to run a world-class investment bank and anything above that, you can return to shareholders?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Yes. So I wish the science was that precise. But unfortunately for you all, and for us, it's not that precise. It's much more dynamic. And the way I would frame it is we want to be very conservative about our capital. And that's the first priority. And so we will evaluate it on a quarter-by-quarter basis. And certainly now with CCAR, we work hand-in-hand with our regulators to make sure that we have a conservative capital plan.","Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. But I don't know -- just as a follow-up to that, I guess. In the context of JPMorgan allocating about $40 billion to its investment bank; BofA, I think is in the same area code; and obviously all the other banks and European banks generally have less than that, what would be the argument that you need more than $63 billion; $64 billion of tangible common to run a world-class investment bank?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Well, as it relates to us, like I said, we want to be conservative about our capital, but we also want to be positioned because capital can make us -- can put us in a very competitive offensive position. I don't know how JPMorgan and BofA allocate their capital, but probably a better question for them.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","If I could circle back to the OTC derivative topic here, just as we think about the FICC businesses specifically, have you talked about the mix of cash versus noncash?","Harvey M. Schwartz","I'm sorry, did you say can I talk about it? I couldn't hear the exact question. I apologize.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Sorry. The question is, within the FICC trading businesses, have you talked about what's driven by cash versus noncash?","Harvey M. Schwartz","No, we've not.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I had one large investment bank, when I was talking to them about the whole potential revenue give-up from swaps, they had noted to me that probably only about 15% of FICC revenues were noncash. And obviously, within that, there would be some structural stuff that wouldn't be at risk.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Yes. So we haven't talked about it. I'll give you the following observation. Certainly, post 2008, there was a real desire, I think a very rational desire and a natural shift by the whole industry, driven by the clients to really focus on simplicity away from complexity. So you lost some of the most -- what I'll call the most complex aspects of derivatives, the correlation businesses and things like that. And I don't see those returning. So I don't see those as lost revenue opportunities although who knows, maybe someday, far away, they will. But I think that because of that, you've seen a mix shift that was to cash, but that feels to me like it's been in place for a while.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And just any comment on whether it's for you or you think for the fee pool overall that 15% is noncash?","Harvey M. Schwartz","No. No comment on that.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just separately, as we think about kind of the FICC revenue drivers, whether it's this year or beyond, I get a lot of questions that debt issuance has been so strong the last couple years. How can that be repeated? Credit spreads have tightened so much, how can that be repeated? And then obviously, when you talk to people in the business, they remind you that secondary trading has been weak, and it's been very low-margin business or a lot of low-margin business. Can you just talk a little bit about the puts and takes and if there's any way to quantify the drag from weaker secondary trading or some of the opportunity as you move away from lower margin areas to higher margin areas?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Well, I think that in all these businesses, and let's just take the securities vision because you're talking about, for example, cash bond trading and secondary market activity, we benefit from basically the diversity and the collection of businesses. So yes, credit -- the credit business may be busier than the mortgage business in a particular day and a particular month. So that's how we think about it. In terms of secondary volumes, it's not really particularly surprising to me. Although maybe if you'd asked me this question a year ago, I would have gotten the answer wrong, that just given the incredible influx of capital into the bond space, that managers themselves are not rotating positions as much. It's been very directional. And so I don't know. I wouldn't be making any forecasts that secondary bond trading levels would be dramatically lower or dramatically higher the second half of this year, for example.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, on the reinsurance business, and I apologize if you disclosed this in the Q, but within the equities business, you talk about -- in a footnote, there was $1 billion of reinsurance revenues for 2012. Is that all one -- driven all by one company or the one stake that you're talking about? Or would there be a couple other pieces in that as well?","Harvey M. Schwartz","At this stage, I really can't comment beyond what's in the footnote.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I just would like to get maybe your thoughts longer term. I think if we look at the return profile, certainly, double digits is positive. But I think a good contribution came from private equity, which, under the Volcker Rule, may shrink over time and the core business being dragged down by still pretty low returns in fixed income. So when we think -- not just the next year or so, but look further out, do you see whether it's long-dated derivatives, things like that? Is it -- are we just missing that there's significant amount of RWA mitigation over time rather than just looking out the next year or 2, but beyond that, that is significant enough to get returns up? Or do we have to see some material improvement in the business mix to get the returns up in FICC?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So again, I'm going to sound kind of redundant here. I think predicting multiple years in the future is really hard. I actually think predicting 6 months in the future is really difficult. And so again, what I would say is the following: we're going to focus on making sure that our institutional clients can deal with us in any business they want, and we want to be best in class. And we're far from perfect. So there's certainly businesses we need to work on, and we can be better and we can take advantage of our improvements relative to competitors. But...","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","But you should have a view though. I'm sorry, you should have a view though, at least internally, of what your long-dated high RWA-type products that you expect to roll off, if there's a lot -- do you have any sense? Or can you give us any sense of is that a lot, a little or just -- that would be helpful.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Yes, I don't have that data with me. But if you're talking about sort of additions that are on the books with clients versus roll off, passive roll off, which we've disclosed previously, yet we obviously -- I think you should -- rest assured, we study all that.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. Maybe just on the liquidity, can you give us any thoughts on what the new LCR ratio language -- how you guys you feel you're positioned for the LCR?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So again, we finished with a strong liquidity position, with $175 billion in GCE. We have no immediate concerns regarding the LCR. We thought it was good. Actually, like a lot of these rules, that the regulators revise the rules in the process, and the final rule deemed more thoughtful and well considered than the proposed rule. But no immediate concern.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan.","Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes. I just wanted to come back to capital. And apologies if I missed it. But have you given the Basel III risk-weighted assets for the quarter, as well as the ratio? And if you have, could you please repeat it?","Harvey M. Schwartz","No, we haven't yet. But we did talk about the fact, obviously, that we finished near 9%, up 100 basis points over the year in Basel III.","Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And you have -- and in terms of -- you have given a risk-weighted asset guidance in the recent presentation, November, of $700 billion relative to about $725 billion in the third quarter, and it sounded to me like a very small number. I know you don't include proactive mitigation in your number. But I wonder, in the $700 billion, how much growth of risk-weighted assets have you included there between that number in the third quarter and the fourth -- in 2013 year end that you've given? Is there material growth in that number?","Harvey M. Schwartz","No. There's no material growth in that number.","Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And in terms of mitigation, can you give us any more details of how we should look at that, considering that you're talking about how your systems are built in order to allocate capital more efficiently? How should we think about the $700 billion versus what is really achievable, even if you talk more in terms of subjective measures?","David A. Viniar","Kian, I'm not quite sure what you're trying to get at. But if you really want details of all of this, we're happy to follow up with you later. You know we're very focused on this. And you can see, we increased where we are by about 100 basis points over the course of the year. But if you want more details on that, we're happy to follow up with you later.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Yes. I think the reason why we're struggling a bit with the question is because quite frankly, you'll see this as we do it. And so it's difficult for us to forecast in a way, obviously, that you'd like us to.","Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes. But you are constantly beating expectations, and you're kind of -- your mitigation seems to be much well ahead of the curve than I think what you're clearly alluding to in the $700 billion, which doesn't include any mitigation for your proactive measures. And I get the impression that the number that could be achieved is significantly lower, and that's kind of what I'm trying to get to. But we can discuss it afterwards. On the -- just on the Investing & Lending expenses, to be honest, I don't understand that line. I mean, you have expense of about $2 billion to $3 billion. I always think about this business like a private equity business. And your cost-to-income ratio, however, is significantly higher, and your expense line is higher. What is in these expenses? I would have thought this should be more like a 25%, 30% cost-income-ratio business but obviously, I don't understand it. So can you explain to me what these expenses are? I mean, I assume there are only a few hundred people. I assume there are only a few hundred people in this division.","Dane Holmes","Are you referring to the segment?","Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes. Yes. Sorry. The segment Investing & Lending where you give expenses on the filing -- in the filings.","Harvey M. Schwartz","I don't know that off the top of my head, so why don't we come back and follow up with you?","Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","But I assume there are only a few hundred people running...","Harvey M. Schwartz","If David can do it off the top of his head, I'd have him answer it.","Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I mean, there are only few hundred -- I assume there are only a few hundred people running in this division. I can't believe there's thousands of -- I would be even surprised if it's 1,000 people. So I'm just wondering why you're having $2 billion to $3 billion of expenses. Is it interest expenses or is it something else? I just don't understand why there's such a big expense level.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Yes, we'll come back to you on it.","Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And last question, staffing. Can you talk about -- and you've done a great job on reducing staffing this year. But can you talk a little bit about staffing trends that you would expect to see in your business this year? And maybe, business or geography, if there's maybe a mix change.","Harvey M. Schwartz","No. So there are no plans one way or another I think worth discussing. That'll all be driven bottoms up by the businesses, as it always is, in terms of the opportunities they see and how they're investing around the world in talent.","Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And should we -- does that mean -- staffing sounds like -- it's fair to say that staffing levels today are not -- shouldn't be too dissimilar to the end of this year.","Harvey M. Schwartz","That'll be very driven by the environment.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of, I guess, quick questions for you, Harvey. First of all, in terms of the net outflows in the non-money market side of things in the fourth quarter, they were negative net 18. That's down pretty visibly from the third quarter, but more in line with the fourth quarter. Is that just a seasonal trend? Or is there something else going on there?","David A. Viniar","Are you talking about in asset management? Asset management?","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes, on Page 12 of the release.","David A. Viniar","Money markets had inflows in the fourth quarter.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Oh, I'm sorry. I meant non-money market flows.","David A. Viniar","Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Yes. I don't think there was anything particular there. I think that's just related more to client and investor activity. There's nothing significant in there.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, in the bigger picture, Harvey, you mentioned that the backlog was up a bit versus third quarter and up a bit year-over-year. I guess I'm just curious in terms of your outlook, if you care to provide it, on M&A. There seems to be a lot of media attention and I think some client attention on the potential opportunities for M&A, given the potential slowdown in the U.S. and possibly in Europe, in those economies, and the cash balances. Is there any greater sense of M&A volumes coming in -- or announced M&A volumes coming in 2013 than you've seen in 2012?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Whether or not things are going to be announced, obviously, very difficult to predict. And I think it's most -- when you talk to our investment bankers and our clients, what they'll say is that the uncertainty in the economic environment globally and certainly the political backdrop in the large economies has left CEOs in a position where they've been quite conservative. And as you see, it translated into all the things you described: large cash holdings, lots of efficiencies. And so I think that will be -- my own opinion, that'll be a lagging outcome in terms of -- when people really feel there's confidence and certainty, then there'll be more motivation to consummate transactions. But very difficult to predict those, as you know.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","What's the dollar amount of the backlog quarter-over-quarter?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Oh, we don't disclose that. Sorry.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. What is Goldman's ROE target?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Is that a question for David or is that a question for me?","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Well, we want to go with the guy who's going to be around to try to achieve it.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Sorry, I didn't mean to make light of that question.","David A. Viniar","You'd get the same answer.","Harvey M. Schwartz","I apologize. So look. With respect to the ROE target, or the absence of an ROE target, there, quite frankly, over the past several years, there just hasn't been enough information in the marketplace, whether it was capital rules, clarity on Volcker, Title VII, et cetera. And so at this stage, we just don't feel we have enough information to give you a target. Now having said that, what you should expect from us and you will continue to see from us is that we remain committed to superior returns over the long term, and we want to provide absolute superior terms and relative superior terms. So that's our focus. But we have no target.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","When do you think you'll have enough information on the capital rules, Volcker and anything else that's holding you back from having a formal target?","Harvey M. Schwartz","I think if you had been sitting here a year ago, you probably would have felt like maybe there's more clarity. But as I said earlier, I think the regulators have done a very, very smart thing, locally and globally, by delaying the implementation, because it's so much simultaneous change. Even in Title VII for itself, which is one suite of rules, the regulators have an enormous task in front of them in terms of rolling out these rules. And so that's just one set. And so we'll have to see.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","The assets are down 2% quarter-over-quarter. What's happening there? And should we extrapolate that downsizing the balance sheet?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Nothing -- there's nothing meaningful in that. I wouldn't read anything into that.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","The buybacks. You certainly got some great prices during the year, but you wind up buying back 8% of your stock but shares only declined by 5%. Is there any way to narrow that gap?","Harvey M. Schwartz","No. But I think if you want to go through sort of the mechanics of share count, I'm happy to have Dan and the team follow up with you.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And then compensation. This is lower than last year, if you look at the entire year. How should we think about the comp ratio? I'm going to talk about the ratio, by the way. How should we think about the comp ratio going forward?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So as we said earlier, we're going to evaluate compensation on a year-by-year basis, and we're going to incorporate everything that you would expect us to, which is performance of the firm most importantly, and then the competitive dynamic and all the other factors that go in. And of course, we have to get the balance right with the shareholders. So we'll evaluate it as the year progresses.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And then last question. Well, David's line was, \"Live to fight another day.\" So Harvey, we want to hear your line. But if you look at the VaR, it's down again. But you have the election over, and seems like sentiments improved in certain areas. I noticed the equity VaR is up, the other areas are down. So what's Goldman's thought process on taking risk as of today?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Right. So I wouldn't read too much into the decline in VaR because virtually all that's attributed to the decline in market volatilities and not actual positions on the desk. And in terms of deploying our capital, we feel quite confident in our ability to do that. And so -- but that VaR number is going to really be driven by client demand and activity, all else being equal. And so as we continue to see a pickup in client activity, positions may change now that may translate into lower things in the number, given offsets, et cetera. But the bulk of what you're seeing in the decline is market volatilities. It's not a reduction in risk or capital commitment.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Just a clarification on that last point. The VaR is what we have to go on, it's the best indicator in your release, and you're saying we shouldn't really rely on that. Then what else can we rely on? I guess do you have an apples-to-apples VaR number that adjusts for the decline in market volatility? Or if I simply ask you the question, did you guys position yourselves for more risk absent what VaR is telling us?","Harvey M. Schwartz","Yes -- no. First of all, I wasn't saying you can't rely on the disclosure. So I want to be really clear on that. I was actually trying to give you extra information by saying the following: There are factors that go into VaR, one being the positions that we have. And then obviously, a big contributor are volatilities in the marketplace themselves. And so all I'm saying is in this particular instance, the decline was mostly attributed to a decline in volatility. It was no top-down directive, for example, to take less risk. Our risk-taking, as I said, will be reflective of the client flows and demand for capital.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Eric Edmund Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Harvey, I hate to come back to the Basel I risk-weighted asset question that Glenn put out several minutes ago, but I'm afraid your answer was maybe too nuanced for me to understand. But it looks like over the past few quarters, your RWAs were in a fairly narrow range of between $430 billion, even $440 billion, and then have fallen quite significantly in this particular quarter. Can you just help me understand better why that occurred?","Harvey M. Schwartz","So the movement there is -- I think what you're going to see there -- and we'll double confirm -- but I think what you're seeing there is probably the knock-on effect of our Basel III mitigation efforts having an impact on the ratio. You asked about Basel I, correct?","Eric Edmund Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Correct. Correct.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Yes. So it's the It's the Basel III capital efficiency efforts that are having a knock-on effect on the Basel I ratio.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Christopher Wheeler with Mediobanca.","Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca Securities, Research Division","A few questions, if I may. The first one relates really perhaps not just to you but to your peer group in the United States, having seen Basel III in terms of capital pushed out really till next year. Obviously, if we look at Europe, that's not really the case. There's a much closer scrutiny by the regulators, particularly, say, in Switzerland, of the Basel III ratios as they stand. And obviously, a lot of European banks continue to deleverage. I mean, do you see the opportunity to actually carry out some slates, which look pretty unattractive under Basel III but would look attractive under Basel I, while we go through this kind of -- this period of transition? Or will your regulator actually find that's something they would rather you didn't participate in?","Harvey M. Schwartz","I don't think that the pace of development, for example, of rule making, whether it's the Basel capital rules or, for example, in the U.S., much farther ahead on, derivatives and et cetera, I don't think that'll drive -- I could be wrong, by the way. I don't think that'll drive material differences in how firms compete in opportunities. I think a lot more of that is going to be driven by relative competitive position in aggregate. And so if you're well positioned in a particular business, that's how margin capitals input. But it doesn't strike me that the gap is so wide. But in some cases, we are seeing competitors, for example, in Europe, exit businesses. And there, for sure, there'll be opportunities. But I think for people that are competing and electing to stay in businesses, you work within the rule set you have and you try and bring your competitive advantage to bear.","Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca Securities, Research Division","I see that. I suppose what I'm really thinking is that, for example, if -- as they are, a number of European banks are trying to sell securitized assets, which have very high risk weightings because they are being scrutinized slightly more closely by the market. But as I said, also by their regulators. Surely, some -- in terms of the U.S. banks, there is this opportunity to say actually, in terms of reporting, we don't have to worry about that from a short-term perspective and the ability to buy some quite attractive assets and then obviously place them out to your clients. I'm just thinking that might be actually quite an interesting opportunity for you. Or do you think it's still something that might lead to sort of some unattractive commentary in the press?","Harvey M. Schwartz","No. I mean, look, we look at Basel III over the long term, too. And like I said, I think it's not the pace. Having said that, do I think some European banks and just many institutions around the globe have maybe been a little slower to sell assets than they might otherwise wanted to be in retrospect. And I think there's opportunities there, but those are opportunities that our clients are very focused on. And if we can be the firm that can bring the collective resources to bear to actually deliver those assets to our clients, then that's a good opportunity for us. But like I said, I'm not sure it's so much rule driven as it is situation specific.","Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca Securities, Research Division","Okay. And then a second question. Really, it's related to what Kian asked you and, I guess, it's a rhetorical question for that reason. But can you give us any clue as to what your Basel III -- or what portion of your Basel III risk weighted assets at the moment are deployed in Investing & Lending?","Harvey M. Schwartz","No. I just can't [ph].","Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca Securities, Research Division","I think that was a pretty much expected question.","Harvey M. Schwartz","Yes. But at least I paused.","Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca Securities, Research Division","Yes, you did indeed. And just a final question really. Obviously, one of your closest competitors sheared a number of jobs in the last few days. And what was intriguing was, I think, something like a 6% reduction in their investment banking staff, but something like 15% in Asia. And I was just wondering, you obviously had another quarter where you were very tight on staff numbers. But is Asia the market you're still investing in? Or is it one where maybe you're also thinking, \"Have we perhaps overlicked the pudding at this stage,\" and we need to also look at our staffing there, as you obviously are in the developed markets?","Harvey M. Schwartz","No. As we look at it today, we think the growth markets broadly, and Asia specifically, look quite attractive. And we're comfortable with our level of investment. Having said that, again -- I'll caveat that. And of course, if the world got much brighter or turned the other way, then we'd adjust. But we feel pretty comfortable.","Operator","And at this time, gentlemen, there are no further questions.","Dane Holmes","Great.

This call is being recorded today, October 17, 2017. Thank you.","Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.","Dane Holmes","Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call.","Today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm\u2019s belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain and outside of the firm\u2019s control. The firm\u2019s actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm\u2019s future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2016.","I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our investment banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets, and supplementary leverage ratio, and you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that\u2019s posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com.","This audiocast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced, or rebroadcast without our consent.","Our Chief Financial Officer, Marty Chavez, will now review the firm\u2019s results. Marty?","Marty Chavez","Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I\u2019ll walk you through the third quarter and the year-to-date results; then, I\u2019ll be happy to answer any questions.","In the third quarter, we produced net revenues of $8.3 billion, net earnings of $2.1 billion, earnings per diluted share of $5.02 and an annualized return on common equity of 10.9%.","Taking a step back to review our year-to-date results. We had firm-wide net revenues of $24.2 billion, net earnings of $6.2 billion, earnings per diluted share of $14.11 and a return on common equity of 10.3%. Year-to-date, our firm-wide revenues are up 8% or $1.8 billion versus the same period last year, reflecting a broad contribution across most of our businesses. Revenue strength in investment banking and investment management helped to offset weaker FICC performance. Our investing and lending activities posted strong performance, driven by the quality of our portfolio, increasing asset prices and the ongoing expansion of our lending and financing footprint.","We are committed to expanding our global client franchise and correspondingly our revenue production, despite the challenging operating environment. As Harvey discussed at a recent conference, we had detailed plans across each of our businesses to drive stronger client relationships and shareholder value creation in the current operating environment. With more than $5 billion of revenue opportunities identified, we are executing across those multiple plans.","As it relates specifically to this quarter\u2019s performance, revenues increased 6% sequentially and 2% year-over-year. A year-over-year increase is particularly noteworthy, given the strength of our performance in the third quarter of 2016.","Importantly, our emphasis on cost efficiency and commitments to operating leverage for our shareholders continued into the third quarter. These efforts have positioned the firm to accrue a compensation-to-net revenue ratio of 40% for the year-to-date, down 100 basis points versus this point last year. As a result of revenue growth and expense discipline, our pre-tax earnings are up 16% to $8 billion and our ROE is 160 basis points higher at 10.3% for the first nine months of the year.","With that as a broad overview, let\u2019s now discuss individual business performance in greater detail.","Investment banking produced third quarter net revenues of $1.8 billion, up 4% compared to the second quarter including strong results in advisory. Our investment banking backlog decreased since the end of the second quarter as replenishment of M&A transactions was lower.","Breaking down the components of investment banking in the third quarter, advisory revenues were $911 million, up 22% compared to the second quarter as deal closings accelerated. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranks first in worldwide announced and completed M&A.","We advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the third quarter including Worldpay\u2019s merger with Vantiv for a combined enterprise value of $28.8 billion, CVC\u2019s 5.8 billion euro sale of its majority stake in Ista to Cheung Kong Property Holdings and Home Shopping Network\u2019s $2.6 billion sale to Liberty Interactive. We also advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the third quarter including, DuPont\u2019s combination with Dow Chemical and a $130 billion merger of equals; Baker Hughes\u2019 $32 billion merger with GE Oil & Gas, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise\u2019s $8.8 billion spinoff and merger of non-core software assets with Micro Focus International.","Moving to underwriting, net revenues were $886 million in the third quarter, down 10% on a sequential basis. Equity underwriting revenues were $212 million, down 18% quarter-over-quarter as IPO volumes declined.","Debt underwriting revenues of $674 million included strong acquisition finance activity. Results were down 7% relative to a very robust second quarter. Year-to-date Goldman Sachs ranked 1st in worldwide common-stock offerings, and also had a leading position in leveraged finance.","During the third quarter, we actively supported our clients\u2019 financing needs participating in Amazon\u2019s $16 billion debt offering to support its purchase of Whole Foods; Japan Post\u2019s $10.8 billion follow-on offering; and Discovery Communications\u2019 $6.3 billion bond offering to support its purchase of Scripps Networks.","Turning to institutional client services, which comprises both our FICC and equities businesses, net revenues were $3.1 billion in the third quarter, up 2% compared to the second quarter, reflecting a recovery in FICC performance. FICC client execution net revenues were $1.5 billion in the third quarter, up 25% sequentially. While volatility and client conviction remained low, improvements across all of our businesses aided performance.","Following a more challenging second quarter, rates improved significantly amid better U.S. economic data and expectations for central bank actions. Commodities posted a modest improvement sequentially. Despite the increase, third quarter results still represented a bottom decile performance. Credit improved given better performance in our financing solutions business. Mortgages and currencies were up modestly quarter-over-quarter.","Now moving to equities, net revenues for the third quarter were $1.7 billion, down 12% sequentially. Equities client execution net revenues of $584 million were down 15% compared to the second quarter. There was a limited opportunity set in derivatives, and low volatility weighed on results. Commissions and fees were $681 million, down 11% versus the second quarter, as U.S. volumes decreased industry-wide. Security services generated net revenues of $403 million, down 9% sequentially, reflecting typical second quarter seasonality. Balances were slightly higher quarter-over-quarter and funding spreads remained relatively tight, given the close to 90% of our stock borrowed for clients were in very liquid collateral.","Turning to risk, average daily VaR in the third quarter was $47 million, down from $51 million in the second quarter, driven by lower commodity price risk.","Moving on to our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $1.9 billion in the third quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $1.4 billion, reflecting sales, corporate performance, and gains in public equity investments. Of the $1.4 billion, roughly 60% was driven by public mark-to-market and events such as sales. Given the favorable market backdrop, we\u2019ve been actively harvesting our portfolio. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $492 million and included approximately $450 million of net interest income. With respect to the I&L balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with $116 billion in total assets. Given our continued efforts to expand our lending footprint, loans receivable were the biggest growth driver, up $8 billion quarter-over-quarter to $61 billion.","In investment management, we reported third quarter net revenue of $1.5 billion, flat with the second quarter. Assets under supervision increased $50 billion sequentially to a record $1.46 trillion. The increase primarily reflected $13 billion of long-term net inflows, $14 billion of liquidity product net inflows and $23 billion of net market appreciation.","Now, let me turn to expenses. As mentioned earlier, compensation and benefits expense for the year to date which include salary, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits was accrued at a compensation to net revenues ratio of 40%. This is 100 basis points lower than the accrual in the first nine months of 2016. Third quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.2 billion, up 2% from the second quarter.","Now, I\u2019d like to take you through a few key statistics for the third quarter. Total staff was approximately 35,800, up 5% from the second quarter and reflected seasonal hiring. Our effective tax rate for the year to date was 22.6%. If you exclude the tax benefits related to the settlement of equity awards, our effective tax rate for the year to date would have been roughly 29%.","Our global core liquid assets ended the third quarter at $220 billion and our balance sheet and level 3 assets were $930 billion and $21 billion, respectively. Our common equity tier 1 ratio was 12% under the Basel III advanced approach on a transitional basis and 11.7% on a fully phased-in basis. It was 13.3% using the standardized approach on a transitional basis and 13% on a fully phased-in basis. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 6.1%. Increased lending and derivative exposures drove declines in the advanced and standardized ratios whereas the SLR was lower sequentially given increases in the balance sheet. And finally, we repurchased 9.6 million shares of common stock for $2.2 billion in the quarter.","On the subject of CCAR, we extensively engaged with our shareholders to solicit views on potential disclosure. Not surprisingly, we got different perspectives on the topic. It is clear at this point that we are the only CCAR bank that hasn\u2019t disclosed. Accordingly, we are disclosing our 2017 CCAR buyback authorization of $8.7 billion.","Of course, the Fed\u2019s non-objection to our capital plan is similar to authorizations we received from our Board and our shareholders; it is limit, not a requirement. We will determine our share repurchases in connection with the opportunities and risks that are present in the market. This includes but is not limited to the $5 billion of revenue opportunities we recently presented on.","To close, let me spend a moment on the $5 billion of growth initiatives. They incorporate opportunities from across our global franchise including investment banking, FICC, equities, investment management and lending. The breadth of these opportunities demonstrates the growth potential of each of our businesses. Client feedback continues to be quite positive; and importantly, there is tremendous energy internally around these initiatives. We believe successful completion of these opportunities would drive an incremental $2.5 billion in annual pretax earnings at a 30% marginal ROE. We look forward to updating you on these initiatives as they evolve. And you should have confidence that the full capacity and capability of this firm is concentrated on delivering on these and other initiatives.","Before we move on to Q&A, I want to thank Dane Holmes. As you probably know, Dane will become the firm\u2019s new Global Head of Human Capital Management in January. He has been a trusted advisor to me and we are all excited about his new role and his continued ability to drive positive outcomes for the firm and our people.","We also want to welcome back Heather Miner as the new Head of Investor Relations. Many of you will know Heather from her eight years in IR previously. We both look forward to maintaining an active dialogue with our shareholders and the analyst community.","With that, I want to thank you again for dialing in, and I am happy to answer all of your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Glenn Schorr","Good morning. So, the balance sheet keeps growing in I&L and it keeps producing, so God bless. A question on the debt side. How much do you think of that balance sheet is relationship lending versus straight investment versus more of an asset management like revenue? And of that $450 million in NII, do you still feel like 400 is about the quarterly run rate, given current balance sheet?","Marty Chavez","Well, Glenn, so let\u2019s go through the lending part of the I&L portfolio. There is, as we said, $61.5 billion of loans receivables held for investment, and that figure increased $7.5 billion on the quarter. And so, looking into the components of that increase, I would say $1 billion of that is related to increased lending in our private wealth management business, and then $5 billion of it as a broad category, we will call it corporate and relationship, and that includes project financing, financing for asset managers, relationship lending, mortgage warehousing. When we think about the net interest income and are investing in lending line; that has grown significantly over time, and we see it as a stable and growing revenue source.","Glenn Schorr","And your comments on capital ratios and SLR, do they constrain your ability to continue to do this? You mentioned your buyback is pretty darn big. Should we be thinking those as trade-offs, or can you do both?","Marty Chavez","So, based on regulatory constraints, as you know from the CCAR results, we do not have significant access today, and CCAR has been our binding constraint. Well, as you know, the test evolves. And so, we don\u2019t know how the test will evolve. But, based on our own assessment of risk, we have significant access, and that gives us the capacity to support the clients. And so, we will continue with the approach that we\u2019ve always had, which is for these capital decisions to remain dynamic with the top priority being -- having strong capital and liquidity to support the clients and to support our growth. You\u2019ve gotten used to the return and we have as well, and we have been through a period of retuning capital, implementing the regulations, all good for systemic safety and soundness. But, we have pivoted to growth. And based on the opportunities that we\u2019ve been outlining to the market, we would certainly prefer deploying our capital resources to support these 30% and ahead of 30% marginal ROEs, we prefer that to buying back our shares.","Glenn Schorr","Appreciate that. One last small one, acquisition of Genesis Capital in the quarter, commercial lender, could you talk about where that fits in?","Marty Chavez","Sure. So, the Genesis is similar in the businesses that we\u2019ve been doing for a considerable period of time in our investment management business. And so, the loans fit within all of our risk parameters and we saw an opportunity for accretive returns, plugging it into our platform and our control and saw the opportunities as to grow it by plugging it into our platform.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Mike Carrier","Good morning, Marty. Maybe first question, just on investment banking, the results came in strong, you mentioned on the M&A side some deals closing and then, you also just mentioned the pipeline down, just any context around that? Because I think on the equity side, it seems like the IPO pipeline is strong, so just maybe any color on the M&A front? And then, given that tax reform is a bit more in that line, just any change or change in the number of conversations in different industries, if we get that as a potential catalyst heading into 2018 or 2019?","Marty Chavez","So, as I mentioned, Mike, the backlog is down sequentially and down year-to-date, and that\u2019s just natural side effect of the strong closings that we had in the third quarter; some of those deals had actually been in the backlog for a couple of quarters. And so, I won\u2019t distinguish the formal backlog from the pipeline. The pipeline, as you noted in equity underwriting is strong also in our conversations with clients on the advisory side. There\u2019s no sense of slowdown. We\u2019re seeing a pickup in client dialogue, particularly I would note in technology, media, telecom, as well as industrials and natural resources. And so, it\u2019s strong for all of the reasons that you would expect that CEOs are confident, equity market support valuations and acquisition currencies, the financing markets are open, the overall levels of financing costs are relatively low by historical standards. That\u2019s all constructive on tax reform which you also mentioned, that is certainly a part of our engagement with clients. And I will also note however that clients, it seems to us, have moved towards saying, well, tax reform would be a good thing but it\u2019s not stopping us from considering strategic acquisitions and sales right now.","Mike Carrier","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just as a follow-up, MiFID II is on the horizon heading into 2018. I know, there\u2019s still a lot of shifting strategies in the industry, in conversations, but any kind of indication on how you think that impacts on the industry and you guys, either from a research standpoint, trading standpoint or market share?","Marty Chavez","Sure, I\u2019ll go through all of them. First, I would start by saying that it\u2019s our view that the MiFID II impact will mean that it\u2019s critically important to have not only differentiated content but also scale and a global reach, all of which we have in our businesses. And so, just going through the various aspects of it, as you know it\u2019s a significant effort and there is a big bank\u2019s go-live date in early January. On the execution side and staying close to our clients, understanding the liquidity provision, execution capabilities that they need and designing them, we have the software, we have the people, and so we are working on all of that and that is progressing.","On the research side, again, it\u2019s important to have that differentiated content and the breadth of research, and the conversations about the price discovery for the research product are progressing. And in our asset management business, we and several other asset managers have recently disclosed our intent to pay for research. There\u2019s ongoing discussions we understand between the SEC and the European regulators that may lead to some form of release. So, we are following those closely. But to put it all together, again, the emphasis is -- MiFID II is going to make it even more important than it\u2019s ever been, and it\u2019s always been important to have scale and depth and breadth, and I wouldn\u2019t trade our franchise with anyone else.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Good morning. You mentioned a little bit of detail within the loan growth this quarter on an earlier question. But, I guess just bigger picture, what kind of goalpost will you be providing to us on the $5 billion of revenue targets, as we think out the next couple of years here?","Marty Chavez","So, on the $5 billion of revenue targets, it\u2019s important to emphasize again that they don\u2019t depend on any improvement in the underlying market conditions or any change in regulation. Of that $5 billion opportunity that we are pursuing over the next three years, $2 billion of it -- $2 billion of the revenue opportunity annually relates to lending. And we called out in our discussions in September the various parts of that market, which we\u2019ve talked about are private wealth management business, GS Select, institutional lending of various kinds. And internally, as you would expect, we\u2019ve had growth initiatives since forever, and you\u2019ve seen some of the results of those, whether it\u2019s in asset management or in our debt underwriting business or growing our asset management business. And so, we have considerable experience and are putting time and energy into the frameworks, the tracking and the measurements of the milestones, and the resources that we are putting against those milestones. And we will of course give you regular updates as these opportunities materialize over the next three years.","Matt O\u2019Connor","And I appreciate the added disclosure, I wasn\u2019t sure everybody did on the CCAR here, and I would just throw out there I think improved disclosure on these initiatives over time, as they take hold, especially the lending and maybe some more breakout effect I think over time would be helpful. You gave the commentary around it but I think having some numbers around as well would be helpful.","Marty Chavez","Well, we definitely are taking that on and going back to what we described in September, there is a breakdown, various aspects of the revenue opportunity as well as balance sheet and capital against it. And so, we will absolutely be having a continuous dialogue with you on that as we progress.","Operator","Your next is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Q - Mike Mayo","Can you talk about the potential for reduced regulatory cost, if there is deregulation? And I\u2019m not really asking about risk appetite or how you might change with that but really just overhead cost to comply with regulations today, and what it could be in the future?","Marty Chavez","So, Mike, we, like all of us in the industry, are noting the various treasury reports for instance, the recommendations. We\u2019ve seen some progress against the recommendations of the first treasury report, for instance. To give just the couple of examples, the OCC has asked for a perspective on the Volcker rule. There has been some news from Basal committee on net stable funding ratio and there are few other examples as well. And so, we are seeing that. And certainly some of the U.S. regulators have been very specific in their discussions about simplifying some aspects of the rules and some others, the CFTC. And so, there is a sense that there is this movement in the topic. But, I would say that for us, absolutely these things are great, if and when they happen. They are not embedded in any of our plans. If and when they occur, they\u2019d be a tailwind to our plans. And as you know, we take a broad and holistic approach to all of these things, not only by training our people but by building all of these regulatory processes into the way we do business.","So for instance being able to do these simulations of our balance sheet and income statement and cash flows several months, 18 months into the future is an important part of how we make decisions and not really seeing it is something that we break out, specifically as a cost and as a cost that would be reduced but certainly I\u2019m happy to say that our focus as just did beyond the implementing of the regulations, which is something we will always do as they arise to growth.","Mike Mayo","Well, as a follow-up on expenses, $3 billion or $5 billion growth initiatives, what are the upfront expenses, were there any in the third quarter and do you expect any special charges or how much the ramp-up?","Marty Chavez","So, on the $5 billion of revenue opportunities, we describe for you the blended marginal margin of those opportunities. And there is a bit of a drag upfront, really relating to hiring to people. So, as we mentioned in September, our lateral hires are year-to-date up \u2013 they doubled from the same period last year and we broke out the kinds of professionals we\u2019re hiring. And you see that coverage and distribution is the major focus of that. As we progress on the initiatives, perhaps there will be some modest upward pressure on the comp ratio but we wouldn\u2019t see that being material in the context of the firm. And we also don\u2019t see any significant charges for this growth.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Betsy Graseck","Could we talk about a couple of things? One is Marcus, I know in the deck last September, you indicated that you\u2019re looking to drive that to $12 billion footings over the next couple of years. Could you just give us a little bit more color on the average kind of person that you\u2019re looking for, and what kind of yields you\u2019re expecting and how you think through the impact of a recession on that business?","Marty Chavez","So, on Marcus, we recently passed $1.7 billion in originations, and we\u2019re on track to reach $2 billion, 10 weeks now, by the end of this year. Our focus is absolutely on prime borrowers. The FICO score realized is definitely above 700. These are small ticket items. And as we\u2019ve said and this continues to be the case, this is organically growing business, we\u2019re doing it slowly and deliberately.","I\u2019ll note that while we have and have had for a long time strong risk analytics, particularly credit risk analytics underlying the business, we\u2019re not leading with underwriting in this business; we\u2019re leading with a better product and service and digital experience for consumers, and that remains the focus. I would also add on the realized losses, they have been less than what was put into the plan. And we are well aware, as all of us are of where we are in the credit cycle. Even though Marcus is a new business for us, the people who are building and leading that business for us are industry veterans and consumer finance, and we\u2019re plugging them in with our long track record of being thoughtful, prudent risk managers for both Marcus and credit risk. And we\u2019ve also supplemented our teams with people who have consumer finance experience across the board from branding and marketing to the 360 degree customer view and of course to all of the control function. And we\u2019re extending the risk culture we\u2019ve always had into this business where we worry about everything and plan for all of the contingencies and don\u2019t take it for granted, and especially remind ourselves every day we\u2019re not leading with underwriting, we\u2019re leading with a better product.","Betsy Graseck","That\u2019ll make sense, that will be helpful if you had a little more detail on that. I know that -- I think you\u2019re planning on giving a little more detail around the granularity of the FICO mix and yields and loss content like we get another card portfolio. So, I will appreciate that when it comes. Just a second question I had was on the dividend. I know you gave the buyback of $8.7 billion for the full year. Are you going to let us know what the dividend outlook is here.","Marty Chavez","Yes, Betsy, I\u2019m happy to mention that as well. So, the Fed\u2019s non-objection to our plan had in the capital plan the option to raise the dividend by $0.05 per share in the second quarter of next year.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.","Brennan Hawken","Thanks for taking the question. Good morning. I was hoping if you could maybe unpack a bit the $5 billion of incremental equity tied to your growth targets. I know, we\u2019ve got -- I think you laid out $28 billion of loan balances. But, I am guessing there is probably some balance sheet consumption on your trading initiatives too. So, could you maybe just give us an idea about that attribution?","Marty Chavez","Sure. So, on the initiatives, we did highlight for you our $5 billion of required equity. I am happy to walk you through it. And again, as with all aspects of what we set out for you and for the market, it\u2019s really -- it bottoms up looking at the activities where the businesses, where these activities are going to occur. So, roughly $2 billion of the $5 billion annual opportunity in three years is related to lending. And most of that balance sheet is in our Marcus, our institutional lending and private wealth management and GS Select businesses, and that totals $28 billion of balance sheet. And to get to the equity, we looked at the businesses that these activities are embedded in and we projected the RWA density out from those businesses. So, it was just that, and bottoms up again.","On the FICC part of the activity, which is a $100 million of the annual opportunities that we identified and that we are pursuing, that one I would see in a bit of a different perspective; FICC capital is dynamic. We see actually considerable scope for the velocity of our FICC portfolio to increase. And so, it\u2019s really portfolio-driven and dynamic, and don\u2019t see considerable or specific equity component attributable to that.","Brennan Hawken","Okay, thanks for that. And then, following up on Mike\u2019s question about MiFID and your response there, I appreciate all of that. It seems as though if we look through your disclosure about the lateral hires that you\u2019ve made recently, both EMEA and FICC sales functions tend to feature prominently in some of those lateral hires. Do you all think that the -- does that have to do with positioning yourself in front of MiFID, do you feel as though that FICC sales effort will become more important and therefore you are trying to invest in bulk up there? Can you just -- or am I jumping on the wrong conclusion from that chart? If you could just help understand that that would be great. Thanks Marty.","Marty Chavez","I wouldn\u2019t see the hires which we\u2019ve been talking about and which as you noted are weighted towards sales distribution. I wouldn\u2019t see them so much as MiFID-related. I am sure that\u2019s in there; of course it\u2019s in there but it\u2019s not the driver. Really there, it\u2019s the coverage gaps that we\u2019ve been talking about. And we saw the opportunity and noted our ability to bring in the talent. So, of the hires, of the offers we\u2019ve been making, the acceptance rate\u2019s over 80%. And we\u2019ve looked and we\u2019ve talked about this in September in some detail, specifically in FICC, looking at all of the clients and noting the ones for whom they say we are a top 3 FICC provider and the ratio of the clients where were a top 3 FICC provider is in the neighborhood of the 30% for banks and asset managers and insurance companies, and this is considerably higher for some other segments. And so just closing those gaps is something that of course requires all the resources of the firm. But it\u2019s a people business and so especially the people, and so that\u2019s the main driver of the hiring.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Guy Moszkowski","So, just -- not to harp, but I wanted to stand a little bit on Betsy\u2019s question about expected loss through the cycle because one of the push backs that I had when I spoken to investors about your growth opportunities is that the implied margins on the loan asset balances don\u2019t seem to many people like they really incorporate sort of full through the cycle loss potential. And I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on that, maybe look at Marcus and maybe one or two of the other lending categories and talk about what your loan loss expectations look like?","Marty Chavez","Yes. So, on loan loss expectations, again on -- I\u2019ll start with the Marcus example, its prime borrowers and that\u2019s an important part of the strategy. And there, again, we imply our analytics. The Marcus business is a new one for us, loan level analytics are the old ones for us, particularly as they relate to securitizations of various kinds. And so we have that prudent and comprehensive approach to risk management and prudent reserving. So, the ALLL against that portfolio or something to get a careful scrutiny and attention from all of us and that will continue and that\u2019s part of our process. And I also shared with you the realized losses are less than what we expected in our plan and that\u2019s so far and that\u2019s where we are in our business growth in our cycle. Let\u2019s go to a different example, which is on our PWM business. These are high net worth individuals and it\u2019s very different business. They are the highest quality borrowers and they are also -- the loans are significantly over-collateralized.","Guy Moszkowski","Fair enough, okay. And maybe just changing the subject and maybe I\u2019ll pursue some of these questions on credit with you offline. But on FICC, you noted that commodities were still sort of bottom decile. I guess that means in terms of your historical quarter revenue experience with commodities, but it sounded like it was better linked quarter. I was just hoping that you could give us a little bit of color, on the one hand what got better but on the other hand, why you still believe that you\u2019re doing sort of bottom decile quarters here.","Marty Chavez","So, to start with, that\u2019s one part of your question. So for commodities business, even though it was an improvement from the second quarter, which I\u2019ll remember, was our worst commodities quarter in our history as a public company of 73 quarters. Now it\u2019s 74 quarters as a public company, as I mentioned, the third quarter commodity performance was bottom decile of those 74 quarters. And it\u2019s on track to have the worst full year performance since the IPO. I would like to step back for just a minute and just quickly go through the sequential drivers, the year-on-year drivers but like to give you the nine-month on nine-month view, a bigger time period as well, because there\u2019s some informational content in that view that you don\u2019t get if you\u2019re just looking at -- if you\u2019re just comparing quarters.","And so, sequentially, yes, our FICC business improved and that\u2019s obviously something that\u2019s good to see. But, it is by no means aspirational. We know we can do better and we know we need to do better. So, it is an improvement. In the sequential comparison in FICC ICS, it\u2019s really rates that drove the majority of that improvement. I\u2019ll get to the other driver in a second. But it\u2019s really the rates business. And there, particularly, in the latter part of the third quarter, there was better U.S. economic data, there were central bank actions, volumes increased, rates broke out of the 10-month trading range, curve flattened, lots of things happened. And so, rates is really the main driver. And the other driver is that the challenges and the inventory challenges we\u2019ve described in commodities, and by the way, this is challenged on all fronts, not just inventory, but the inventory challenges were a little better in the third quarter than in the second quarter. And there\u2019s also a connection to our bar number which declined a bit, $4 million sequentially and the drivers in the bar number going down were all continuing to decline across products but also reduced commodity positions.","So, that\u2019s the sequential story. The year-on-year story, as you know, four out the five FICC businesses were lower; mortgages was the only business that was up. And the year-on-year story is really two main factors, lower client activity across the FICC businesses, particularly in the macro businesses and then the inventory challenges in commodities. But, as I said at the outset, I think if we step back and look at the first nine months of this year in FICC and compare it to the first nine months of last year, you see something different that you couldn\u2019t otherwise piece together, which is, if you look at the delta in FICC, half of that decline -- and so it\u2019s 23% decline, nine months on nine months, half of it is attributable to commodities inventory; and of that amount, half of that occurred in the second quarter. And so, I think that just gives you the whole picture.","Guy Moszkowski","Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. And since I was the guy who gave you such a hard time about the buyback disclosure last quarter, I should certainly thank you for doing it now.","Marty Chavez","We were listening, Guy. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Jim Mitchell","Maybe if you could just talk about your deposit gathering efforts, how that\u2019s progressing so far?","Marty Chavez","Sure. So, deposit gathering is an important part of our financing strategy. It\u2019s continuing to diversify our sources of funding. Our Treasurer, Robin Vince gave quite allusive discussion of this in our Fixed Income Investor Call. We\u2019re happy to say more about it. In the deposit gathering, note that of course as you know, we acquired an online savings account platform that had previously been a part of GE, and we\u2019re gratified to see the growth in those deposits on really essentially no marketing of it. And so, in those deposits, even though there have been Fed reserve raising fund rates over the last several months, the experience in the online savings account has been that the rates gone from 105 basis points to very recently 130, which is near the top end. And so that tells you something, it\u2019s an attracting funding source for us relative to the wholesale market. It also tells you something about realized beta that we\u2019ve experienced so far.","Jim Mitchell","But then, what were the flows like in the quarter?","Marty Chavez","I\u2019m not going to get into the specifics on the flows. But I think, Heather, that\u2019s a good one to get back on.","Jim Mitchell","Okay. And maybe just one question on regulatory change. SLR, I think would be a big positive for you in terms of the leverage constraint but I think there\u2019s been some uncertainty about how or if the tier 1 leverage continues or not. How do you -- how do we kind of I guess try to arms around, do you have a thought on if the SLRs changed, would the tier 1 leverage also change, therefore freeing up some capital or balance sheet, or do you think that remains?","Marty Chavez","So, I will get to that but actually I\u2019ve pulled out the growth in total deposit, this is not just the online savings account; it\u2019s about $7 billion quarter on a quarter. But to get back to your question on SLR, so certainly, there has been a lot of discussion about how the SLR ratio might change. And as we said in the second quarter, if the various treasury recommendations on treatment of central bank cash, treasuries, initial margin at CCPs, if those all come into force, and we don\u2019t have the details, but that\u2019s a roughly 70 basis-point improvement on our SLR of the second quarter; I wouldn\u2019t expect it would be much different from the third quarter.","And so, to the extent those changes happen, it would very likely have a thinking differently more expansively about our prime brokerage and matchbook businesses. And then, I think this has been well-highlighted across the industry, if those changes were to come into effect, it would be equivalent of creating another SIFI in terms of SLR capacity for the various businesses that our SLR intensive. So, these are all potentially tailwinds. And as you know, we and many others welcome the initiatives and the detail of the first and second treasury reports that there -- the potential tailwinds, they are not baked into our $5 billion annual revenue plan.","Jim Mitchell","I appreciate that I was just thinking about the constraint in the CCAR from Tier 1 leverage, which would limit any benefits from the SLR. And I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of do you think that would also change to help free up that capacity or not?","Marty Chavez","I would love to know the answer to that question. CCAR is as you know continuously evolving process. I suppose one way of looking at it would be -- the perfect result would for all of the constraints in CCAR, Tier 1, SLR on and on, all of them to be exactly binding by exactly the same amount; that would be a perfect optimization. But of course, it\u2019s evolving and we don\u2019t know exactly how it\u2019s going to play out. As you know, there was a white paper and governor to rule out just before its departure outlined a variety of proposals and we\u2019ve read them closely, I\u2019m sure you have as well. And we considered the proposal to be thoughtful but many of the important things still remain to be seen and they would have to be in an upcoming notice of proposed rule-making, and that\u2019s when we will get the insight on your question.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.","Steven Chubak","I wanted to start off with two-parter on investment management. So, first just on the quarterly trends. I was hoping you can just shed some light on what drove the decline in management fees linked quarter, just given the strong equity markets that we saw and the pretty health -- continued healthy increasing AUM. And then, just thinking longer term in relation to the $1 billion revenue target to business investment management where we\u2019ve seen pretty substantial secular headwinds and fee pressures, and I\u2019ve got a lot of questions from clients as to what\u2019s giving you guys the confidence that you can hit that $1 billion incremental revenue target. And I was hoping you can shed some additional light on those opportunities.","Marty Chavez","Sure. So, let me start with the first part of your question. Yes, as you noted, we have grown assets under supervision by $50 billion. About half of that was market appreciation. And then looking into the other half; that was again almost evenly split between gathering long-term assets, mostly fixed income and then, also an increase in assets in our liquidity products. And so, on the effective fee, the effective fee actually has been stable sequentially. And so, really the answer to your question is, it\u2019s in the other part of management and other fees; there\u2019s some puts and takes that were slight offsets when you do the quarter on quarter comparison.","Going to the second part of your question on the investment management opportunities that we outlined, which was as we said a $1 billion annual revenue opportunity. Look at that in three parts and the three parts are roughly balanced. But the key to all three parts is what has been the key to that business and the successful asset gathering over the long haul that you\u2019ve seen, which is that it\u2019s broad and it\u2019s deep across asset classes as well as different products and distribution channels, retail and institutional.","And so, to go back to the breakout of the $1 billion in annual revenue growth, splitting it into the three parts, I\u2019ll start with GSAM. So, there, it\u2019s growing our alternatives platform, advisory and insurance, EPS and liquidity products. On PWM we\u2019re hiring advisors, investing in the platform including digital experiences, adding products and services there. And the third part is Ayco, it\u2019s our corporate executives counseling business. And there, we absolutely see opportunities in incoming from our clients on expanding those financial planning services, in two ways. First to more of the people inside the companies that we\u2019re already working with; and then in addition to more companies. So really stepping back, it\u2019s the franchise which is unique in the case of investment management. It\u2019s broad product portfolios, there\u2019s room to grow across the board, and it\u2019s diversified and hence the opportunity set.","Steven Chubak","Thanks Marty, that was really helpful color. And then, just switching over to just one question on the capital discussion, I think as relates to Jim\u2019s earlier question on thinking about various binding constraints, just given your historically strong discipline on managing to what\u2019s your most binding capital ratio, I was a little bit surprised to see the deterioration in the SLR linked quarter. I\u2019m just wondering, if you can give us some insight in how you\u2019re thinking about the need to focus more on some of the growth opportunities which maybe you had, not emphasized as much given your continued strong capital discipline. And separately, we did see your GSIB surcharge also increase last quarter, or your systemic risk score, and I\u2019m wondering how you\u2019re thinking about managing to that as well.","Marty Chavez","Sure. So, I\u2019ll start with the SLR, fully-phased. So, as you know, it declined by 20 basis points sequentially, and that is growth in the balance sheet. And you also saw that in the increase in the balance sheet from 907 at the end of the second quarter to 930. And there, it\u2019s supporting our clients in deploying the balance sheet when we see the opportunities to do so. It was, as you know, in CCAR 2017, the binding constraints, and that\u2019s something that we are deeply aware of. But as we know, much depends on the next evolution of CCAR. And also potentially on recalibration of SLR, there\u2019s been different views from different regulators on recalibrating SLR or not recalibrating SLR, we don\u2019t know exactly how all of that\u2019s going to evolve. Now, can you remind me of the second part of your question?","Steven Chubak","Just around the GSIB score, I think in the past you\u2019d been at 2.5% and it increased to 3% last quarter and how you are thinking about managing that score as you think about some of the growth initiatives?","Marty Chavez","Sure, right. So, also in the third quarter, as the GSIB buffer, we\u2019re again in that 3% range and it\u2019s something that we look at every day and work with divisional leaders as we see opportunities to have a strong balance sheet and capital and deploy it and invest in our business and long-term growth. We can do both. We can both grow the business and return capital. But at the margins, I would say growth is more valuable. And as for where as you know, the GSIB print at the end of this quarter is an important one, and I can\u2019t predict where it\u2019s going to end up in this quarter.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.","Devin Ryan","So, maybe first one here, the securities basis loan arrangement with Fidelity that was announced last quarter was pretty interesting. And I am curious, is that starting to ramp? And it also sounded like there could be more arrangements in the future with additional wealth management firms that don\u2019t have those capabilities. So, really just trying to get sense of the broader securities-based loan strategy, the firm with outside firms and then how big that is within kind of the private wealth piece of the balance sheet opportunity?","Marty Chavez","Sure. So, we highlighted for you in the growth initiatives on annual revenue opportunity of $500 million related to PWM and GS Select together. On GS Select, this is something that we\u2019re all excited about and focused on, which is to again, and you\u2019ll detect this theme in other places, lead with an all digital straight thorough offering. It is extremely early days in that business, and we\u2019re very pleased with the Fidelity announcement that you noted. They saw the innovation in the platform and the opportunities just have a great service. As you know its loans of upto $25 million and is significantly over collateralized, and it\u2019s interesting opportunity. It\u2019s too early to give you progress but it is a part of the initiatives that we outlined, which right now we are aggregating under PWM -- PWM and GS Select together, $500 million revenue opportunity, $11 billion of balance sheet over three years and the implied the yield is evident from that.","Devin Ryan","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And just follow-up here. It sounded like some of the hiring that firm is doing ahead of revenue, could influence the comp ratio a bit but it is sounded like that\u2019s going to be modest. Can you maybe just more broadly speak to what you are seeing in the competitive environment in comp dynamics right now? It seems like there are some of the European firms are more aggressively recruiting again in some of the areas that Goldman is also looking to expand. So, maybe that\u2019s temporary but I\u2019m just curious kind of how that feeds through as you think about kind of the outlook for the comp ratio?","Marty Chavez","Sure. So, I would say that the most important thing to think about for us and we believe for our shareholders is the operating leverage and comp ratio obviously a part of that. You will notice the first half 2:1 ratio between the revenue growth and the expense growth and you\u2019ll also see that ratio in our nine-month results versus nine months of the last year. As revenues grow, I would not expect that ratio to be linear, and we would see even more operating leverage. In the competitive dynamics, as we mentioned and this is continuing, lateral hiring is up significantly, it\u2019s doubled from last year. And we are continuously happy to see, but no way take it for granted that we are very successful and attracting the talent.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital. Please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","Question, lot has been talked about amongst you folks as well as your peers about the lack of volatility in the marketplace, particularly in FICC. With the federal reserve moving into a full unwind next year, have you guys mapped out what the volatility could do because of this changing position by the federal reserve and what it might do for the revenues for your FICC business?","Marty Chavez","Sure. So, we think about volatility a lot and we think at least as much, maybe more about the level of client activity, which is very important for us. And so, looking at the Fed\u2019s announcement, so that has been extremely thoughtful and transparent in its communication, and we would expect that to continue. It\u2019s just part of how the fed operates. We don\u2019t of course know exactly what\u2019s going to happen, and we don\u2019t make predictions. So, we do create lot\u2019s and lot\u2019s of contingency plans and so looking at what the Fed has said, as you know they\u2019ve been very specific, they\u2019ve given us $10 billion a month and then that\u2019s going to increase every three months by $10 billion, and so it gets to $50 billion and letting assets roll off that redemption from their balance sheet and they\u2019ve given us the mix between treasuries and agencies. They said it\u2019s going to -- they expect that mix to be stable with some variations, just depending on the maturities and their balance sheet.","So really, you can\u2019t get much more specific and communicative than that. And also just note that there\u2019s a positive backdrop, so the U.S. economy is performing, there\u2019s improving GDP growth depending on who you talk to, the U.S. is at or perhaps even beyond full employment. And at the same time, all of this unwinding quantitative easing is unprecedented territory, never happened before. So, you could see volatility and spikes showing up in this process, simply because it\u2019s never happened before. We don\u2019t see duly unwind risk priced into the markets. You could imagine of all spikes that that client confidence make market making difficult, you could also imagine a positive scenario with modest fall, more conviction, more activity, all of these things could be catalysts for the FICC business, rising inflation, any changes in central bank policies against the expected trajectory, clarity on U.S. policies of all kinds, tax, obviously regulation, also infrastructure, all of these things you could see as better catalysts.","The important thing to note and pause on is that the Fed has been clear that the economic backdrop is good and that\u2019s generally good for business.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. And then, second question, can you give us some color on -- you talked about the total dollar amount of the capital return on the call today. The dividend payout ratio, is there any guidance where you think that may eventually end up in a more normalized adversary of the next 12 to 24 months where you guys are comfortable to have a dividend payout ratio.","Marty Chavez","So, all we know for now is that a $0.05 increase -- the option to increase by $0.05 is embedded in our capital plan, which is what the Fed has approved. And as for the dividend payout ratio, it\u2019s been around 15% for a while, and I\u2019m not going to predict what it will be in the future. Just that $0.05 is all we know for now, we continue to emphasize buyback, as you know, but really as we said, a month ago and so important for us, we would always prefer to execute on these 30% plus marginal ROE opportunities compared to buying back our shares.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.","Marty Mosby","I\u2019m going ask two questions. One was, when you think of the investing and lending especially on the equity side where you said you all given the market conditions or you said kind of harvesting aggressively. Is part of that related too, because if you look at the increase, there\u2019re about $1.8 billion increase in what you had in the equity security gains. There\u2019s about a $1.3 billion decline in fixed income so you kind of have offsetting effect with those two things, which is letting your overall revenue still grow this year. So, just to know if you all were doing that just because of market conditions, are you trying to balance the mix and so should we expect this when we have some volatility in other sides of the business?","Marty Chavez","Well, you definitely noticed those offsetting effects and we did too obviously. I would say in that area of our business, we\u2019re fiduciaries. And so, we see it as in the interest of our clients to harvest these investments and the asset price levels in the market are supportive. So, it\u2019s a good time. That portfolio as you know while we report on the results quarterly, we think of it over much, much longer time horizon than quarterly.","Marty Mosby","Then my second question is, if you look at the seasonal progression of that comp ratio, given that you do have this investment lending gains your revenues are still kind of at the same level you had last year. So, should we still see the drop off in comp ratio kind of at the end of the year as you true up your bonuses and get all that squared away?","Marty Chavez","So, yes, revenues sequentially are up, year-on-year are up and year-to-date importantly are up 8%, which is significant. As for the comp ratio, of course we -- it\u2019s an important part of our business and we put a lot of time and energy into considering it and setting it appropriately. And the 40% that we took it to, so 40% for the nine months, year-to-date is as we mentioned the 100 basis points lower than last year and at this point it\u2019s the best estimate we have.","Marty Mosby","Yes, usually seasonally we drop down around 30% in the fourth quarter, so just to know if that was still reasonable assumption or is there anything different about this year that would cause that to vary from several prior years where we\u2019ve seen that trend?","Marty Chavez","Of course that trend is there, I would just say go back to the commitment to operating leverage, something we think about everyday of the many things we think about every day. But really, I can\u2019t say more about where we are going to end up this year other than it\u2019s the best estimate, taking in all the information that we have right now.","Marty Mosby","Perfect. So, year-over-year, operating leverage would be something to make sure we kind of still assume, so that would make sense. Thanks, appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Hi, Marty. Yes, a question on capital return with that disclosure that you gave. So, I mean, the share repurchase authorization is up 30% year-on-year. When we look at kind of your DFAST CCAR results, I mean your capital level was up a little bit -- at the starting point was up a little bit year-on-year, the losses that you saw within DFAST were up modestly as well. So, what allowed you, I guess within this year\u2019s CCAR to kind of return more capital? Was there some kind of change in how the Fed looked at RWA inflation or something else? I mean, because I think historically you said -- previous CFO had said that there was kind of check mark to your minimum ratio, is that still the case?","Marty Chavez","Yes. So, the main difference is just the different starting points in the capital ratios.","Brian Kleinhanzl","And there was no other real changes from the Fed side and\u2026","Marty Chavez","Not -- nothing too surprising, right? There were some things that the Fed said they would over a two-year period, and that\u2019s what happened. There really wasn\u2019t any big -- any surprises of note, it\u2019s just the different starting points.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Do you know the capital dollar amounts were only up less than $2 billion year-on-year starting points or really increased by more than that, is it just the ratios are higher simply? ","Marty Chavez","Yes, it\u2019s just the ratios are higher. That\u2019s right.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.","Marty Chavez","Thank you for calling in, and look forward to meeting with many of you over the balance of the quarter. If you have any additional questions, please contact Heather, and for those of you who were not able connect with, enjoy the upcoming holiday season, and thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs third quarter 2017 earnings conference call.

This call is being recorded today, January 16, 2015. Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.","Dane Holmes","Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the Firm\u2019s belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain and outside of the Firm\u2019s control.

I\u2019d also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets and Global Core Excess.

Harvey?","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through the fourth quarter and full-year results. Then I\u2019m obviously happy to answer any questions.","Briefly on the fourth quarter, net revenues were $7.7 billion. Net earnings were $2.2 billion and earnings per diluted share were $4.38. With respect to our annual results, we had firm-wide net revenues of $34.5 billion, net earnings of $8.5 billion, earnings per diluted share of $17.07 and a return on common equity of 11.2%.","Revenues were roughly consistent with last year. We grew net earnings by 5%, book value per share by 7%, and earnings per diluted share by 10%. If we take a step back and assess 2014, there have been challenges to the global economy and therefore the operating environment for our clients.","We have seen a global economy that has been grinding itself towards growth. Different countries are naturally at different stages of the economic cycle and the interconnectedness of these different economies has made the transition to growth somewhat extended, choppy, and oftentimes unpredictable.","Having a global client footprint means that we\u2019re impacted by both global and regional fluctuations. Most importantly, it also means that we're a diversified enterprise. The consistency of our annual revenues is a testament to both the products and geographic diversity of our operations, and the stability they collectively provide.","Weakness in Asia or Europe can be offset by strength in the U.S. Headwinds in institutional client services can be offset by strength in investment banking or investment management. Ultimately, our shareholders own a combination of industry-leading global businesses that have collectively generated superior returns.","We've also achieved our results in the face of significant regulatory change. The financial services industry and our Firm specifically, have been responding to unprecedented levels of new regulation. The regulators and the industry have done a tremendous amount of work here and as a result have made the system stronger, and significantly safer.","Since 2012, we undertook several strategic initiatives to respond to new regulations and at the same time derisk the firm. This included a $55 billion balance sheet reduction over the past year. In addition, we sold our Americas reinsurance business, we sold our European insurance business and we liquidated our investment in ICBC. Along with those actions, we also sold our hedge fund administration business and our ready platform.","In 2012, the businesses and investments that I just listed produced $2.3 billion in revenue. As a result, since then we had to replace in excess of $2 billion of revenues in 2014 just to match 2012 levels.","As I said, the last three years have required us to adapt and source new revenue opportunities at attractive returns. Between 2012 and 2014, investment banking and investment management generated $2.4 billion of incremental revenues. This achievement demonstrates the strength of our client franchise, the diversity of our operations, the commitment and quality of our people and our culture of adaptability.","Now I\u2019ll discuss each of our businesses starting with Investment Banking. Before digging into the details here, it\u2019s worth noting a few achievements from 2014. We were number one in M&A, advising on more than $1 trillion in announced transactions. We also ranked first in global equity and equity-related and common stock offerings.","As it relates to the quarter, Investment Banking produced net revenues of $1.4 billion, slightly lower than the third quarter. A decline in underwriting activity offset a pick up in completed M&A. For the full-year, Investment Banking net revenues were $6.5 billion, up 8% from 2013 on the back of a significant improvement in advisory revenues and modestly higher equity underwriting revenues. This was slightly offset by lower debt underwriting revenues following record results in 2013.","Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the fourth quarter, advisory revenues were $692 million; the 16% increase relative of the third quarter reflects the increase in industry-wide completed M&A. We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the fourth quarter, including Walgreen\u2019s $15.3 billion acquisition of the remaining 55% interest in Alliance Boots, Royal KPN\u2019s 8.4 billion euro of E-plus to Telefonica, Deutschland and Athlon Energy\u2019s $7.1 billion sale to Encana.","We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the fourth quarter, including Allergan\u2019s $66 billion sale to Actavis, Baker Hughes $38 billion sale to Halliburton and Talisman Energy\u2019s $13 billion sale to Repsol.","Moving to underwriting, net revenues were $748 million in the fourth quarter, down 14% sequentially with both equity and debt issuance slowed. Equity underwriting revenues of $342 million, were down 20% compared to third quarter results largely due to a decrease in secondary offerings and private placements. Debt underwriting revenues decreased 9% to $406 million due to a significant decline in leverage finance activity.","During the fourth quarter, we actively supported our clients' financing needs, participating in Becton Dickinson\u2019s $7.2 billion financing to support their purchase of CareFusion, ICBC\u2019s $5.6 billion debt offering and Fiat Chrysler\u2019s $4 billion common stock and convertible offering. Our Investment Banking backlog improved from third quarter levels and finished at its highest level since 2007.","Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and equities businesses. Net revenues were $3.1 billion in the fourth quarter, down 17% compared to the third quarter. For the full-year, $15.2 million of net revenues were down 3% relative to 2013. FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter and include a $55 million of DVA gains. Excluding DVA, and last quarter\u2019s gain related to our trust preferred tender, revenues were down 41% sequentially as certain businesses were impacted by either lower client activity or more difficult market making conditions.","Interest rates were lower sequentially as client activity declined amid a challenging environment. Credit decreased as the market was characterized by widening high-yield spreads and low levels of liquidity.","Mortgages declined versus the third quarter, as volatility and client activity were generally low. While currencies was lower than a very robust third quarter, volatility remain high and client activity were still solid. Even higher volatility and energy markets, commodities improved sequentially and were supported by stronger client activity levels. For the full-year, FICC client execution net revenues were $0.5 billion, down 2% year-over-year. Excluding DVA, the gain related to our trust preferred tender, and the impact of the 2013 European Insurance sale, revenues were down 5% relative to 2013.","In equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.9 billion, up 21% sequentially and included $27 million in DVA gains. Equities Client Execution revenues increased 75% sequentially to $751 million due to a more favorable backdrop with higher equity prices and increased client activity.","Commissions and Fees were $829 million, up 11% relative to the third quarter supported by an increase in client volumes. Security Services generated net revenues of $351 million, up 2% sequentially adjusting for last quarter\u2019s gain related to our trust preferred tender.","For the full-year, equities produced net revenues of $6.7 billion, down 5% year-over-year. Excluding DVA, the gain related to our trust preferred tender and the 2013 sale of our reinsurance business, results were down 4% relative to 2013.","Turning to risk. Average daily VaR in the fourth quarter was $63 million, down from $66 million in the third quarter with the largest decrease coming from interest rates.","Moving on to our Investing & Lending activities. Collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $982 million, primarily reflecting company specific events including initial public offerings and gains in public equity investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $358 million, which was relatively balanced between net interest income and net gains on certain investments. Other revenues of $192 million include the Firm\u2019s consolidated investments.","In the fourth quarter, we sold our investment in Metro International. For the fourth quarter and full-year, Metro contributed $70 million and $325 million respectively to other revenues. For the full-year, Investing and Lending generated net revenues of $6.8 billion, driven by $3.8 billion in gains from equity securities, $2.2 billion of net revenues from debt securities and loans and $847 million of other revenues.","In Investment Management, we reported fourth quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion, up 7% from the third quarter primarily as a result of $200 million in incentive fees largely from alternative asset products. Management and other fees were up 1% sequentially to a record $1.23 billion. For the full-year, Investment Management net revenues were a record $6 billion, up 11% from 2013 on record management and other fees which benefited from growth in our assets under supervision. During the fourth quarter assets under supervision increased $28 billion to a record $1.18 trillion, due to net inflows into liquidity products.","On a full-year basis, we have long-term fixed income inflows of $58 billion and equity inflows of $15 billion. Alternative inflows were $1 billion and included $6 billion from fund of funds offset by net outflows from other private equity and credit funds.","Moving to our performance, across the globe, 83% of our client mutual fund assets ranked in the top two quartiles on a three-year basis. And 75% ranked in the top two quartiles on a five-year basis.","Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits, remain roughly flat at $12.7 billion for 2014 and translated into a compensation-to-net revenues ratio of 36.8%.","Fourth quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.5 billion, 11% higher than the third quarter, reflecting $137 million donation to Goldman Sachs Gives, our donor advised charitable fund. For the full-year, non-compensation expenses were down 4%, primarily due to lower provisions for litigation and regulatory expenses.","Total staff at year-end was approximately 34,000, up 3% from year-end 2013. Our effective tax rate was 31.4% for 2014. Our global core excess liquidity end of the quarter at $183 billion. Our Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.2% using the advanced approach. It was 11.3% under the standardized approach.","Our supplementary leverage ratio finished the quarter at 5%. The Firm is now compliant with the 2018 minimum.","We repurchased 6.6 million shares of common stock for $1.25 billion during the quarter. For the full-year, we repurchased $5.5 billion helping to reduce our average fully delivered share count by 26 million shares year-over-year. In addition, we increased our quarterly dividend to $0.60 per share in the fourth quarter and paid out approximately $1 billion of common dividends during the year. In total, we return $6.5 billion of capital to shareholders while at the same time continuing to grow our regulatory capital ratios.","Now before I take your questions, let me offer some closing thoughts. Looking back on our performance in 2014, the Firm continued to execute on its operating strategy. We remain committed to our clients, providing superior service and execution which is central to building any long-term relationship. The strength of our client franchise is reflected in our returns and our leading market position. For example, we ended the year as the global leader M&A with more than $1 trillion in announced transactions. This is nearly $250 billion greater than our next closest competitor.","We were ranked first in global equity, and equity related and common stock offerings for 2014. We helped deliver nearly $300 billion in equity capital from our investing clients to our corporate clients. We executed more than 2 billion transactions for our institutional investing clients across equities, fixed income, currencies, and commodities. And we\u2019re the trusted investment manager for in excess of $1 trillion in assets. Our track record of performing for our clients has translated into a leading market position within each of our businesses.","Another area of focus has been on our efficiency, well operating efficiency and capital. We announced an expense initiative from a position of strength in 2011. We believe this was an important step, which positioned us to remain externally focused over the past three years. Continued discipline on compensation levels and focus on non-compensation expenses has contributed to 300 basis points of pre-tax margin expansion since 2012.","Our capital philosophy is also clear. Having a strong capital base, not only allows our firm to be front footed in helping our clients capturing opportunities, but also provides protection in more difficult operating environments. The existence of multiple capital regulations has materially increased the need for robust capital planning tools. To try better capital efficiency and comply with new regulatory requirements, we\u2019ve developed critical technology and operating infrastructure to inform our allocation decisions. While they can never replace good judgment, these tools certainly help to inform it.","In closing, Goldman Sachs is essentially made up of our clients, your capital, and our people. Our Firm stands ready to use its financial and intellectual capital to serve our clients through this evolving period in the global economy. We are committed to consistently delivering the Firm and its entirety to our clients and maximizing our impact. And we\u2019re equally committed to generating superior returns for our shareholders through the cycle.","Thank you again for dialing in. And now I'm happy to answer any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Glenn Schorr","Hi. Thanks very much.","Harvey Schwartz","Hey, good morning, Glenn.","Glenn Schorr","Good morning. First one on Investing and Lending. You had mentioned that there are a bunch of sales inside the equity piece. Would you mind just updating us on what\u2019s left in the book equity wise that eventually has to be liquidated for Goldman? And in conjunction with that, have you been replacing on balance sheet to backfill?","Harvey Schwartz","So we will just take a step back. You remember from the third quarter, the Investing and Lending balance sheet was roughly $76 billion, which broke down roughly 14 -- $4 billion of public equity, $18 billion of private equity and the balance really -- the vast majority of the balance sheet in that north of $50 billion. And so in terms of the -- in the equity line, I think what you\u2019re continuing to see is just really the idiosyncratic performance of the portfolio. We\u2019ve guided you over time that over long periods the portfolio will correlate with the MSEI [ph] or other public indices and -- but there will still be times where we will outperform that or under-perform that. And in this particular quarter, there were -- really the vast majority of the gains in the portfolio were driven by things that we refer to as event driven. So it was either the potential for very near-term IPO we took something public where there was a refinancing event. We don\u2019t look at this of course on a quarterly basis, but you will remember I highlighted to you in the last quarter that when we\u2019ve taken Mobileye public it had contributed $285 million in revenues and that would be an example of something that it was down during the course of the quarter, that was down a bit more than $70 million. In terms of reinvesting and the portfolio, our strategy here is unchanged in terms of our philosophy, in terms of how we think about the capital. Where we can deploy capital to our clients and where we can find attractive returns, then we will pursue them, but we\u2019re going to be very disciplined about the kind of returns that we can gain out of the marketplace. And so you will continue to see us do this one good thing in the quarter that you saw was that the regulators finalized the extension of the Volcker Rule and so there will be two one year extension there. So that was good to see as -- I think it was thoughtful by the regulators, because it will -- would have otherwise we might have seen fire sales across the marketplace.","Glenn Schorr","And equity left, Goldman\u2019s equity piece left? I think it went from 9 to 8 to 6, if my memory serves me correctly. Where are we at now?","Harvey Schwartz","So are you talking about sort of -- there is two things that sometimes I didn\u2019t get [indiscernible]. I think if you\u2019re firmly [indiscernible] where the -- our investment is in terms of the private equity portfolio that was -- we were discussing under Volcker before the extensions, that\u2019s roughly around $8 billion. There was some harvesting, but that was offset by some gains. Again, now that\u2019s an extended two years. If you're talking about the significant financial institution reduction which is a separate number that relates to our Basel III capital ratios, that\u2019s now roughly about $5 billion.","Glenn Schorr","Okay, perfect. That's what I was looking for.","Harvey Schwartz","Sorry, I wasn\u2019t sure exactly. I probably should have gotten there faster.","Glenn Schorr","No, I probably should have worded it better. So then a big picture question, a couple of quarters ago, we are all bumming out that every volatility chart points down. Now rates, volatility, oil volatility, FX volatility, credit volatility all thumbs up, and all the banks get beaten up on inventories that we thought were a lot less. So could we talk about good vol versus bad vol and what we are supposed to root for?","Harvey Schwartz","Yes, it\u2019s I don\u2019t know it\u2019s a little -- I guess it\u2019s -- what is it? Is it a Goldilocks? Its too cold, its too hot? We can\u2019t find the right temperature. I think when you look -- I find it very interesting to sort of juxtapose the third quarter and the fourth quarter, because I think it really highlights what you\u2019re saying. We came into the third quarter and as you said everybody bemoaning knew the fact that there was nothing happening in the world in July and then we got into the summer doldrums of August. And then we came back and foreign exchange was very active. There was a lot of momentum and you saw big uptick in client activity in certain parts of the business. Now we come into the fourth quarter and I don\u2019t know if you want to call it unhealthy volatility, but in October we had our -- whatever you want to refer to in markets, now referred to as the Treasury Flash Crash. And then, Greece, the continuation of Russia, a huge decline in the oil price, which of course it started in June, but nearly came into frame in the fourth quarter which weighed heavily on credit markets. And so, I don't think when you look back in the fourth quarter, any of this should be particularly surprising. When you see that much pressure on credit markets, in terms of the ability as a market maker on the course of the quarter, to manage liquidity, I don\u2019t think its particularly surprising, particularly the stress that came under high-yield as a result of the energy decline. Now for us, there were some real bright spots in the quarter in fixed income, which is why we think about it long-term, we will tell you that the energy price has been declining, our ability to be an active and valuable provider of hedging solutions that a market maker do are energy sensitive and commodity sensitive clients. Was it\u2019s a kind of thing you really see. But it's not always going to be case that in a given quarter, I need to pretty unique events we\u2019re talking about. But again, in the end it\u2019s all going to be driven by the client activity, client uncertain types of volatility will drive more client activity. And certain will make people want a recede and be a little more protective. I know we\u2019re all focused on it, but quarter over quarter when you think of the events; I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a surprising actually.","Glenn Schorr","Then the follow-on on that is just, in credit specifically, which is probably the most liquidity-dependent. Do the desks themselves, or do your risk management practices, do you tend to exit positions during times of stress like that or should we be thinking about you are sitting on the same kind of book right now, just at lower prices?","Harvey Schwartz","So we\u2019re always managing the risk components of many of our books, regardless of the environment. And the kind of market that we\u2019re talking about, it\u2019s really very natural on what they\u2019re doing at the desk level. So they\u2019re obviously fulfilling their client responsibilities in terms of making market, but it can be particularly challenging from time to time. But again, this is a long-term commitment. I wouldn\u2019t say that there were any significant support, exposures, in terms of that we are really focused on. But obviously things that have been in frame for a while Russia, Greece, energy whatever the case might be. Obviously we pay a lot of attention to those things. Again, as we\u2019ve said in the past Glenn, it's a moving business not a storage business. And just sometimes moving is harder.","Glenn Schorr","I appreciate that. My times up, thank you very much.","Harvey Schwartz","Hey, Glenn. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Michael Carrier","Thanks, Harvey.","Harvey Schwartz","Good morning, Mike.","Michael Carrier","Hi. Harvey, just upfront you mentioned a lot of the businesses that have been repositioned. I think you mentioned the $2.3 billion on the revenue side. I guess when we look at 2015, near now that most of the rules are finalized; I guess is the vast majority of the repositioning out of the way? I guess because when I look at the ratios, you're basically where you need to be. So should we see ongoing like revenue headwinds, or is the repositioning mostly through?","Michael Carrier","So look we will have to see as all the rules ultimately get finalized. There is still a number of rules out there, but so I\u2019d say things that we very deliberately did in terms of derisking the firm or responding to regulatory requirements like the sales of the insurance business, the other things I listed, there is nothing right now that we\u2019re looking at you should expect to see in the near-term. Having said that, these businesses have always been dynamic, they will remain dynamic and over the next many years things will continually evolve and we look to be very dynamic in all of those businesses, whether they\u2019re market structure changes, whether they\u2019re things like we\u2019ve seen in terms of regulatory driven. I mean it just -- I think this is what you need to do to manage the business as well. So we will continue to focus on capital and make sure we\u2019re using the capital as efficiently and effectively as possible, all these things are just part of daily life.","Michael Carrier","Okay, got it. And then just maybe on the same topic, or somewhat related to it, just in terms of your Tier 1 ratio going up to 12.2, if you can give us the components. It looks like RWA shrunk in the quarter, but just want to know what drove that, and then going forward is there anything else in the pipeline?","Harvey Schwartz","So in the third quarter [indiscernible] it went up to 12\/2 as I referenced. So on the -- if you really want to break that down into the molecules, give or take roughly 10 basis points came from just growth in capital. Another 10 basis points came from various steps we\u2019re taking in terms of managing the capital better and then the balance -- really it was about risk reduction and it was much driven by the drop off in client activity towards the end of the quarter than anything else. So you could see this bounce back. In terms of staff again, we\u2019re going to continue to adjust all the capital rules, and as I said we\u2019ve invested heavily in getting the tools out and as we discussed at your conference, we now have a uniform framework that we\u2019re deploying across the Firm in terms of that how we think about best utilizing their capital ensuring that we position it most effectively for all of our clients and so, again that\u2019s going to be, I don\u2019t know if you want to call part of the new world, but that\u2019s part of the world that we live in now.","Michael Carrier","Got it. And then, last one, just given the volatility that we\u2019re seeing both in the oil markets, more recently in the FX market. Just want to get, your guys perspective of obviously you mentioned on the commodity side that can present same opportunities in terms of more activity. On the flipside is lot of risk associated with that, depending on what happens, just want to see how you guys are managing that risk. In the quarter, was there anything significant particularly in the FICC, just because it was a little lighter than expected. That weight on any of the segments.","Harvey Schwartz","So as I said in the quarter, it really was a tough quarter in the credit business, also when mortgages on a relative basis, but more pronounced in the credit business areas. In terms of the commodity businesses, I think it\u2019s almost worth taking a step back. If you think about over the last couple of years, we\u2019ve often been asked a question hey, it seems like everybody else is getting out of the commodity business. How come you\u2019re not getting out of the commodity business? And for sure commodities have been quite for a little while and we\u2019ve got -- you remember we got that question pretty frequently and the answer give us a pretty straightforward which is when we dealt with our clients we knew the business of hedging, managing their risks, investing in clients. We knew that was an important part of what they did and it ties very nicely into our investment banking franchise where we provided advice and capital to all those clients.","And so, I know it\u2019s a bit of a reminder when you see the fourth quarter where you see a pick up in performance that reinforces that you which really need to listen to your clients when you\u2019re thinking about your strategy in terms of the businesses that you invest in and those businesses you protect across the cycle. And so, part of the consistency that you\u2019ve seen from us is the investment in these various businesses across a long cycle. It might be commodities. A couple of years ago, people were talking about the fact that merger were never coming back. And so from a commodity perspective, in terms of risk, our risks are quite manageable to the sector. You would asked that also, so I just want to finish with that.","Michael Carrier","Okay. Sounds good. Thanks a lot.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Christian Bolu","Good morning, Harvey.","Harvey Schwartz","Hey, good morning. Thanks for dialing in.","Christian Bolu","Thank you. Just on the Outlook for 2015, in your press release earlier this morning, Lloyd struck an optimistic tone speaking to seeing evidence of a pick up in a global economy that will improve the opportunity set for 2015? Could you be a bit more specific and speak to how you see that improved opportunity set a evolving on a business by business basis.","So I will give you my perspective on that. When you talk to the economists inside Goldman Sachs, the general view whether you\u2019re talking about the U.S which clearly have a more optimistic view in terms of growth. Europe, Asian, is generally positive and as I said its more of a continue grinding forward. And so, if we see continued stability in terms of market, normalization of interest rates and really fundamentally steady growing GDP. Those are the things that are historically over cycles. Have translated well for us, because it contributes to global confidence and global confidence contributes to activity. And so, it kind of gets back to the theme I started with earlier which is -- in over the last couple of years, we\u2019re ourselves have made adjustment in an environment which has been choppy as I said and also a bit on event and what we needed to do is, we needed replace significant revenues and so you see what we\u2019re doing to the extent which we hopefully will have fewer revenues replaced in the future. Hopefully this will translate into growth. But, again it\u2019s all going to be driven by the environment. That\u2019s the one thing we can\u2019t control. We can just respond it.","Christian Bolu","Okay. On the equities business, I apologize if I missed this in your prepared remarks. But just curious as to what drove the strength in the equity kind of execution line?","Harvey Schwartz","So for a couple of quarters, I know you were focused on, it looks a little lower. In this particular quarter, there were some very solid opportunities to provide capital declines and volumes but again when you look across the equity business, when we see uptick in client activity and when you see trending prices, the strength of a franchise really comes to the front whether its in prime brokerage client execution or commissions and fees.","Christian Bolu","Okay. Sounds like its a little more lumpy than you would normally expect for the quarter.","Harvey Schwartz","There is some seasonality in there, there is some rebalances that we participated in some other things, but again these are one time event. They\u2019re just annual event. They haven\u2019t drilled the course of the year. ","Christian Bolu","Okay. And then just lastly for me a quick clean up question. Under sale of Metro, you noted $325 million in revenues last year. What kind of costs came with those revenues?","Harvey Schwartz","It\u2019s a very small contributor to pre-tax.","Christian Bolu","Perfect.","Harvey Schwartz","You shouldn\u2019t think of it as meaningful at all in pretext terms.","Christian Bolu","Perfect. Thank you, Harvey.","Harvey Schwartz","Okay. Thank you.","Operator ","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with COSA. Please go ahead.","Michael Mayo","Hi.","Harvey Schwartz","Good morning, Mike.","Michael Mayo","Given the big movement, the Swiss franc there is some reports that banks lost some big money, specifically what happened this week. Can you comment and then more generally, how would this impact to your move towards electronic trading of FX?","Harvey Schwartz","So well, first of all, in terms of Goldman Sachs, immaterial from an economic perspective. So you\u2019re only worried about that, there is noting there. I will say what we all witnessed yesterday is pretty extraordinary. I haven't confirmed any stats , but just going to with some of the folks, the single largest move in a day of any developed country, I think it was something like a 20 plus standard deviation move. I think it was like after three plus years of 2% volatility. So you\u2019re right to call it extraordinary, but again no issues here. For us it really is an opportunity, really for very high-level engagement with clients who both need liquidity and then the longer term questions about working with local corporates who had an immediate shift in competitiveness and what does that mean? So there\u2019ll be obviously a long-term focus. In terms of each rating, there\u2019s only things you take away from these or I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll potentially be some lessons learned, but I don\u2019t necessarily have any major takeaways. It certainly doesn\u2019t change our investments largely in terms if you think about each rating.","Michael Mayo","And then one other question, you mentioned the 300 basis point pre tax margin improvement since 2012. I have to imagine it might get tougher if revenues don\u2019t grow more. What are some additional levers you have for pre tax margin? You\u2019ve got a lot on non-comp and you certainly have done a lot on comp. Is there any more to go?","Harvey Schwartz","So, well first of all Mike I appreciate acknowledging our effort on expansion because it has been really a multi-year effort in terms of being disciplined. Again it\u2019s going to be environment driven. Right now when we look at the global footprint, we feel really, really well positioned in terms of our geographic footprint and our product footprint. But we\u2019re committed to staying very focused on expenses. You\u2019re not going to see us take the foot off here, and so, we\u2019ll see. The big thing that we\u2019ve been trying to achieve in the last couple of years as we\u2019ve talked about a lot is putting an operating leverage. And while we\u2019ve replaced the two plus billion dollars in revenues over the last couple of years, it would be great we\u2019d all like to see the environment being one that provided another couple of billion dollars in revenues, and we think we have that operating leverage. So we feel well positioned.","Michael Mayo","All right. Thank you.","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks Mike.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O'Connor","Good morning.","Harvey Schwartz","Hi, Matt.","Matt O'Connor","If I can first follow up on the expense question, maybe just trying to get a little more detail in terms of the opportunity from here. I think you and a lot of other firms have a relocation strategy trying to bring down some of the especially back office and non-sales facing costs. Maybe if you could just kind of frame it the opportunity there; I think a lot of people also look at the state of raw and think those opportunities to become less top heavy and then obviously there\u2019s the new structural reduction in comp that does contribute it. So, maybe just pushing a little bit on where you can go from here on expenses?","Harvey Schwartz","So as part of the expense probably from the last couple of years, and it\u2019s a great question. As you know, we have been diversifying ourselves geographically in places like Salt Lake City, Bangalore and others and it represent about 25% of the firm\u2019s headcount at this stage give or take. I think there is continued opportunity. One thing I\u2019ll say which is, something at this stage which is hard to quantify, but we\u2019re looking to take a leadership role in which is, over the next several years as you really get all these rules in place around all the various training venues around the world. There certainly will be a need for scale consistency across the various market participants and the way things are processed, the way information is managed, the way transactions are confirmed and things are reported, and so the short note of that is, internally we\u2019re going to continue to lever technology anywhere we can and that\u2019s been a big part of what we\u2019ve done. But we\u2019re also going to try and do that as much as we can working with other folks in the industry and our clients to make sure all being is efficient as we possibly can as we all work in the same rule set. Now, you didn\u2019t specifically ask about it, but obviously we\u2019re going to stay relentlessly focused on the balance sheet and how we deploy our capital.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. Actually that kind of brings me to the next question. Earlier it was asked about looking at maybe businesses or areas to get out of a swap, but as we just think about your current business mix and the opportunity to adopt to the new capital rules, how much opportunity is there to refine the balance sheet and have those ratios increase more than you would think just based on say the net income less capital deployment?","Harvey Schwartz","Well, I think when you look at our ratios now, but we think they\u2019re in quite a good place. We\u2019ll see what happens with the, when the final rules are done. I guess, I would say, we start again with the client businesses and given the strength of all of our businesses at this stage, equities, fixed income, investment banking, asset management, our investing and lending business. We look at the strength of those business leads and our competitive position, it really feels at this stage it\u2019s very, very tactical and it\u2019s about fine point execution. Now of course that could all change and again we\u2019ll stay nimble, but that\u2019s where we would stand today.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. And I guess, just to push on that like, it was just a year and half ago that the supplemental leverage ratio was even proposed, so I would assume it\u2019s hard to be completely efficient in adopting that throughout the businesses.","Harvey Schwartz","Yes, sorry. I think you\u2019ll continue to see improvement in things like that. That\u2019s not what I was saying. What I was saying is, its going to be tactical and we\u2019ll continue to work at it because you\u2019re right, we\u2019re new and we\u2019re just living with it. But I don\u2019t see it at this stage given the adjustments the business we\u2019ve sold, the things we\u2019ve done, the balance sheet. I don\u2019t see us making bigger decision in terms around our business commitment and our commitment to our clients. That\u2019s what I meant. So you\u2019re not going to see the sales and other reinsurance business soon.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. But just the, adopting these -- on the day sale question is, how much optimizing is there out there further due maintaining your current strategy and the strengths that you have?","Harvey Schwartz","We can always do more and you\u2019ll see us do more. But I\u2019m not in a position to quantify for you today.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good morning.","Harvey Schwartz","Good morning, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","I just wanted to ask a couple of questions on VaR. I was intrigued by the straightforward which came down queue-on-queue and obviously we had the flash crash in October. So does this represent maybe a VaR that went up early in the quarter? And then as folks move to the sidelines that came back down or am I thinking about that wrong?","Harvey Schwartz","So, if you look at the in the VaR quarter-over-quarter it went from 66% down to 63% and you see the rate category move down current changes are but it sort of followed more the flows and levels of activity. In some businesses it was the result of position changes, but I don\u2019t think there is any major takeaways market volatility was a bigger driver and position changes was really a net reduction.","Betsy Graseck","[Indiscernible] volatility, you had essentially bad volatility in rates, so I suppose that\u2019s why it came down a bit, but should we expect that is, if you get some slightly higher volatility or I would expect it would move higher. Is that accurate or no?","Harvey Schwartz","Yes, so I think maybe the best way to answer this question is to think about it in terms of average volatility across the quarter, and so the way we look at it because as we\u2019ve discussed before from a risk perspective VaR is an important risk measure, but obviously it can be influenced by market volatilities. So, if you actually, if you look at the change in terms of how it moved the market volatility was an increase it was more or less offset by position reductions during the course of the quarter and that\u2019s what drove the change. In rate specifically volatility was up and our positions were down. And that probably gives you a really good roadmap in terms of how the risk moved during the quarter.","Betsy Graseck","Yes. Got it. Okay. And then separately just could you give us a sense as to how you\u2019re thinking about the asset management business and opportunities to expand that inorganically if there is any sense of \u2026?","Harvey Schwartz","So you\u2019ve seen us do small bolt-on acquisitions over time. We\u2019re constantly looking at things. Obviously asset management has been a very important driver of growth over the last several years and this is, we\u2019re really -- I think in the early stages of where you\u2019re seeing a strategic initiative to grow asset management, the team has done a great job and I highlighted the three and the five year returns. So, we\u2019re open to really looking at anything, and so it\u2019s really all -- we\u2019ll all be driven by whether or not we think we can improve our performance and deliver better results for our clients. So, I would say we\u2019re very open-minded. But again, these things have to be accretive and we look through them at a very careful lens.","Betsy Graseck","And distribution, is that something that you could potentially add to?","Harvey Schwartz","We feel quite good about the -- we really do feel like we have a significantly differentiated private wealth franchise and our institutional team is great and we get a lot of value out of our third party distributors and so, again Betsy, look we\u2019re the leading M&A firm in the world. So I think it was good idea walking the door and one of our bankers had it, we\u2019d be the first firm to talk about it. It will be a little inconsistent with our whole philosophy not to talk about it, but it\u2019s not a priority right now for us. It\u2019s really about performance and delivering for the clients.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. Thanks.","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jeff Harte with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Harvey Schwartz","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffery Harte","Good morning, Harvey. A couple of things. One, we\u2019ve seen the volatility kind of spike on and off for a number of months now. Do you have a sense for how this is impacting kind of client risk appetites and their willingness to transact? And I\u2019m kind of thinking corporate investment and investing clients in investment banking as I suppose it is while in trading.","Harvey Schwartz","So, look I think, when you think about investment banking clients and CEOs and Boards and CFOs in terms of how they\u2019re making long-term strategic decisions, that\u2019s really -- that will be influenced by day-to-day volatility and obviously every informational fact is digested. But those long-term strategic decisions are really based more on long-term competitive drive and global growth and that kind of stability. And so, it\u2019s a factor, but as I said when we went to the call we comment with our backlog at the highest point it\u2019s been since 2007 and that should give you some indications of what we think the momentum is in the advisory business. It could always change but that\u2019s where the momentum stands today. In terms of the investing clients and those involved in the capital markets more directly, it\u2019s an interesting question. In periods where there is less friction and ease of volatility -- ease of liquidity, liquidity begets activity, and maybe the language we should we be using is less about volatility and more about volatility and liquidity. Volatility when absence of liquidity is maybe that on friendly version that people are looking to try and find language to describe, and when you have volatility but you have liquidity you can then react and you can execute on the new information you receive. So I\u2019m not sure I got to your questions, but I tried.","Jeffery Harte","Okay. You talked kind of on the M&A, so I mean is it similar for some of the underwriting businesses that it means you\u2019re not seeing the volatility kind of cause corporate clients to maybe pull back on plans there?","Harvey Schwartz","So, I don\u2019t know if I necessarily say its pointing back on plans in terms of the -- its really more whether the market is more receptive or not. If you really just wanted to contrast underwriting activity in the fourth quarter of 2013 with the fourth quarter of 2014, you just saw capital markets that kind of thundered through the end of the year last year, and this year the capital market just had a lot more to digest. I would say that was more driven by the investing side, basically saying, hey look lets take a pause and lets reassess versus issuers desire to issue at low yield and obviously there was spread pressure on a high yield as people digested the low energy prices, but we\u2019ll see how the year goes. I mean I think at these rate levels and these equity market levels their activity levels could be robust during the course of the year, but again we\u2019ll have to see what the market delivers.","Jeffery Harte","Okay. And expenses have been here in a couple of times, but I think kind of maybe more directly my question would be, have we hit a point where we need to see revenue growth to see further profit margin expansion?","Harvey Schwartz","Well, it will depend on what happens in the environment. I mean, again we\u2019re going to stay very focused on both lines. And so again, I guess, I could add to that question, and the risk is sounding a little bit cute, and we would have actually grown it and revenues have been flat, and it haven\u2019t really been flat because we\u2019ve been growing other businesses. So, we\u2019ve displayed the ability to do it for the last couple of years. Look, we\u2019re going to be very, very thoughtful as we have been about the balance of investing in the businesses where we see long-term growth. But again that won't -- we\u2019re not going to stop our relentless focus on efficiency.","Jeffery Harte","Okay. And finally we\u2019re starting to hear again some talk of some competitors at least exiting some of the trading businesses and do you see that as a kind of competitive opportunity, I mean does it help you to maybe expand wallet share, improved pricing or is it just some of the businesses aren\u2019t as profitable and we hope eye is going to shrink. Are you seeing some of that?","Harvey Schwartz","So we\u2019re certainly seeing in various businesses we feel it at least. Again we don\u2019t have full transparency, but in our dialogue with our clients we felt that in commodities this year. We\u2019ve seen it in other parts of the business. I guess, what I would say is in an environment like this, in terms of the competitive dynamic, I think if you want to be in these businesses through the whole cycle, I think some of the takeaway\u2019s are you have to have scale. It\u2019s very hard just to be in cash equities or to be in a very small component of the foreign exchange market. And you have to be able to leverage that scale really across the full franchise. It\u2019s not really just about the equity business, the prime brokerage business or the commodity business. You need technology scale to really be effective through the whole cycle and then you need the diversity because as we\u2019ve seen some pistons will fire sometime and sometimes they won't at other points as we go through this. And so, I know that\u2019s why we feel good about our competitive position because we know our clients still want to trade bonds, and we know they still want to hedge FX and we know they still want to manage their commodity risk. As we work through this part of the cycle it\u2019s just about us being well positioned and having that scale, and we feel like we have it.","Jeffery Harte","Okay. Thank you.","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Harvey Schwartz","Hi, Guy.","Guy Moszkowski","Good morning. Just to follow-up on the VaR question but to ask it in terms of the change for the full year. Can you give us a sense just as you walk through the different asset classes of how much of the change over the course of the year was position reduction versus volatility change?","Harvey Schwartz","So you\u2019re saying last year versus this year?","Guy Moszkowski","Yes. So for example, if we look at rates, over the course of the year it fell from 62% to 41%. And I\u2019m just curious how much of that change was reduction in positions versus change in volatility sort of what are the components?","Harvey Schwartz","Hey, I apologize. Dane can get it to you. I don\u2019t have the line-by-line in my head in terms of that. But I can tell you on the year-over-year in aggregate, but I\u2019d say what I mean line-by-line I don\u2019t have the specific categories in my head. But year-over-year the -- basically position changes were a reduction that was about three times the increase in terms of the volatility levels. So its real risk reduction.","Guy Moszkowski","Got it. Okay. That\u2019s exactly what I was trying to get to and maybe I\u2019ll follow up on the others, but that\u2019s real helpful. On the -- just a housekeeping question, on the core Tier 1, the 12.2% is advanced approach is transitional right. Can you update us on the fully phased?","Harvey Schwartz","Sure. So, it\u2019s 11.1% under the fully phased. You want me to give you the standardized that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about.","Guy Moszkowski","Yes, exactly.","Harvey Schwartz","Okay, fine. Okay, so 11.3% as I said under the transitional for standardized and then 10.2% under fully phased. Now just a reminder on this, fully phased for us is really a conservative expectation, all other factors being equal in other words, we just stood here today with exactly the same balance sheet and nothing changed except for the retirement of funds as we comply with Volcker doing other things. You should probably add back to call it 40 basis points, 50 basis points to those fully funded number -- those fully phased numbers. Okay?","Guy Moszkowski","Okay. That\u2019s also really helpful. And the question has kind of been asked a couple of times, but maybe I\u2019ll take a slightly different crack at it. In terms of the volatility that we\u2019ve seen, since the first of the year not just in terms of what happened yesterday in the currency market but more broadly with rates, long rates. I know we\u2019re only couple of weeks into the year, but do you expect a significant rethink in terms of the amount of risk that you and peers will be putting on the desks between now and the end of the quarter, the middle of the year?","Harvey Schwartz","So, it\u2019s a great question because it allows me just to underscore a very important point. We scale our risk deployment to our client demand not the other way, and so it will really depend on what happens in terms of clients and their perceptions in the marketplace. And again I think it goes back to -- if you compare the third quarter to the fourth quarter. If we see more Septembers, than I think you will see increasing amount of client activity and opportunities for us to provide liquidity to our clients and deploy capital. I think if you see more Octobers and more Decembers, I think you might see less. Again, that\u2019s why we run these businesses for the long-term. I think importantly, one of the takeaways around these businesses is that there are times when things do change structurally. One of the structural changes its been on a decade plus shift to electronics rating and the need for technology. The people still wake up every morning and they want to trade bonds and they want to hedge foreign exchange. Nothing about that is changed. Its just where we\u2019re in the cycle.","Guy Moszkowski","Got it. One final question and this isn\u2019t something that you frequently disclose, but there was a disclosure a number of years ago, that sort of in the period between 2006 and 2009, about half of your FICC revenues had been in some derivatives and now that we\u2019ve been through a significant period of regulatory change in terms of derivatives and cost of carry and everything. I was wondering if you could comment for 2014 roughly what percentage of thick revenues would have come from derivative transactions.","Harvey Schwartz","Yes, I don\u2019t have that data handy, but we can dig into it. And if its meaningful we can certainly share it with folks.","Guy Moszkowski","I mean, I guess, the only follow up would be -- I get that, but is it meaningfully less than it used to be?","Harvey Schwartz","Well the one thing I would say that, and maybe these are good things, but host the crises, lots of things they build up in 2006 and 2007 like clients trading correlation and other things which during the crises proved to be less liquid than other things, that certainly looked like businesses that maybe gone forever. You always has been set up but it feels that way for now and maybe they should be. So, there\u2019s certainly elements in the derivative market that appears structurally changed since the crises. But we don\u2019t track that specifically from an auditor perspective, so I don\u2019t have that data.","Guy Moszkowski","Okay. Well, thanks for the color though. I appreciate it.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC. Please go ahead.","Harvey Schwartz","Hi, Fiona.","Fiona Swaffield","Hi.","Harvey Schwartz","Hi.","Fiona Swaffield","Sorry, can you hear me?","Harvey Schwartz","Yes, no worry.","Fiona Swaffield","Sorry, some problems with the phone. Can you talk a bit about, I think you said this in the fourth quarter the de-risking helped the RWAs. But I mean, historically you\u2019ve talked about mitigation going forward. So can you talk about your plans kind of Basel III RWAs, and also I know its early days but there\u2019s some new proposals after Basel before Christmas. Do you have any kind of thoughts on those or how they would, could affect you the U.S. bank?","Harvey Schwartz","So, on the new proposals obviously we\u2019ll do what we\u2019ve done in the past. We want to be an active and constructive participant in the dialogue with the regulators, but its pretty early days on lots of those discussions. But again, we\u2019ll just participate in that dialogue and you\u2019ll see our comments and things like that. In terms of, I think there\u2019s an important thing to highlight here; there were no businesses here that we\u2019re looking to shutdown in terms of driving improving capital ratios. We feel quite good with the significant progress our teams have made over the last couple of years. Now having said that again this is something that I just think that there is standard operating procedure for any regulated financial institution in terms of having technology, tool, education and a process towards making sure you deploy your capital in a way that\u2019s most impactful for your clients and provide your shareholders with the best return. And so, I think that\u2019s just standard operating procedure for us. So you\u2019ll continue to see us mitigate, but at this stage we made a huge amount of progress, I mean, there\u2019s a whole lots of things I can highlight. I think the balance sheet reduction exercise in the second quarter was a real demonstration of response to nimbleness.","Fiona Swaffield","Okay. Thank you.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Jim Mitchell","Hi, good morning.","Harvey Schwartz","Good morning, Jim.","Jim Mitchell","Just quickly maybe if you can talk about some of the other, the more liquidity ratios. Do you have any kind of update on where you guys stand on the LCR and NSFR, have you kind of done any kind of backed envelop stuff with respect to those?","Harvey Schwartz","So, in relationship to the LCR which is, we\u2019re in excess of the requirement.","Jim Mitchell","Okay.","Harvey Schwartz","In terms of the NSFR that\u2019s an interesting one because, obviously if you take a step back in NSFR, obviously any rule that\u2019s supportive of good proper industry wide asset liability management, we\u2019re supportive of, it will be very interesting to see how the rule evolves in discussions with the local regulators because as you know in the proposed rule they came out. There really are, there\u2019s some interesting things in there, one being obviously this notion of how transactions get linked. So we\u2019ll have to see what the final determination on that is when we get that from all the regulators, and also obviously the treatment of deposits where different geographies have different legal and regulatory regimes, and in the U.S. obviously we have a restrictive regime in terms of how deposits can be utilized. So, I\u2019d say on the NSFR it\u2019s a bit of a wait and see.","Jim Mitchell","Okay. I would imagine with you guys given your structure that the TLAC is probably not a problem. Is that a fair statement or?","Harvey Schwartz","Yes, again where we stand today, again at preliminary rule. Right, so I caveat that with all the facts that we\u2019ll have to see where it goes, but that would be our takeaway and our early read.","Jim Mitchell","Okay. And then maybe just broadly on the pipeline record levels, it sounds like one area advisory is clearly strong. Can you comment on the other areas where you\u2019re seeing, is it -- is debt still holding in there given the financing needs for the M&A environment or how is equities doing? How do we think about the pipeline in the different components?","Harvey Schwartz","So, as I said the advisory side of the line was really the biggest driver that\u2019s probably not a surprise for you given all the announced transaction to the marketplace. If you sort of look at it year-over-year, equity was down, debt was up a little bit. But it does feel like at least if the marketplace and asset prices can stay here, it feels like a reasonable environment to me for the coming year. But again these things can change on a dime.","Jim Mitchell","Right. Okay. That\u2019s all I got. Thanks.","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Chris Kotowski","Yes, good morning. Every quarter we go through this and looking at the capital markets business and rates and credit Zigs [ph] and currencies and equity Zags [ph] and you talked about the environment on October versus November and so on. But when I look at the -- kind of the industry revenue totals on an annual basis, they\u2019re incredibly stable and my peer group is probably the same as yours, but its been somewhere between $110 billion and $120 billion of revenues on an annual basis ever since 2011 and we\u2019re probably like 7% or 8% below 11% now. And it just seems to me like the explanation must be that the buy side is becoming increasingly concentrated, larger entities, more resource, and just like you\u2019re able to measure client profitability, they\u2019re able to measure what they pay all the brokers and isn\u2019t the issue more that there is kind of a fixed wallet that the buy side has on an annual basis and that there is not going to be an environment in the future where they pay a whole lot more than they are now?","Harvey Schwartz","Well, I guess the -- we should probably have a long philosophical conversation; it probably requires having a glass of wine or beer or something. But I think that the -- I think that you have to really look at these businesses over very, very long periods of time. And so for example when there was growth, lets just say from the period of like 2002 to 2007, I don\u2019t think clients were looking to pay more, I think they were always very, very obsessed around transaction costs. As a matter of fact, the vast reduction in transaction cost for example the equity business actually occurred during that period of growth. And so, we assume that our clients as fiduciaries are always going to focus on transaction cost. I think that less the issue, I think its much more environment driven. We\u2019ve been in a period of near zero global interest rates for an extended period of time, post the financial crises, and so I think our clients are in some respects as a result struggling for their own after production in some cases which translates again into reduced activity, but our clients have always been focused on minimizing transaction cost as they should be [indiscernible] philosophical conversation.","Chris Kotowski","Okay. Fair enough. I mean, if I was right, would you manage your business differently than you are?","Harvey Schwartz","Its hard for me to imagine any of our businesses and say, look they\u2019re going to stay exactly the same for the next 10 years. So slightly that will be a nice way to live, but our businesses are just more dynamic than that. We think its part of the competitive advantage of Goldman Sachs just responding to the changes. So, I think its going to be dynamic.","Chris Kotowski","All right. Fair enough.","Harvey Schwartz","It is very difficult sitting here today to predict, like it was a couple of years ago, no one would have predicted the way the M&A that we\u2019re experiencing. But not of course it feels very natural, and now people feel like it will extend. I do think this is a case of all of us, this is a natural inclination to extend the most recent set of data that we have. Now, it was going to stay like this for the next 10 years, can you promise me that? Yes, there maybe, we would even push harder of efficiencies. But again we\u2019re positioning for operating leverage and growth.","Chris Kotowski","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning, Harvey.","Harvey Schwartz","Hi, Brennan.","Brennan Hawken","So, first a quick one on Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo, lots of increase given what happened this quarter and your involvement in the initial deal. Did that have any impact on the results this quarter at all?","Harvey Schwartz","So, in terms of [indiscernible] my result this quarter its immaterial. For us, -- and I guess, I would add in terms of the -- on the fixed side of the business not the primary driver. But for us obviously as you have seen in our public commentary we\u2019re very surprised by the Bank of Portugal\u2019s unexpected and very surprising reversal of its prior written decision on this matter. And so, for us really this is really, it\u2019s the matter of our client, it is not about Goldman Sachs, and so we have clients that relied on those representations and so, we remain in active dialogue with the Bank of Portugal and obviously it\u2019s a very fluid situation.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. But is it fair to characterize it as maybe small but in your view immaterial impact?","Harvey Schwartz","I would say not a primary driver of FICC, but obviously in FICC.","Brennan Hawken","Okay.","Harvey Schwartz","It is obviously part of the revenue decline.","Brennan Hawken","Got it. And then thinking about your physical business on the commodity side, you guys are one of the few left. We\u2019re seeing given some of the dynamics there in that market but improving -- and improving bed for storage, how are you seeing that play out in your physical business as we move forward from here?","Harvey Schwartz","So, we always think of the -- that our focus in commodities is really and we used to think about is divide into two things, investments that we make in terms of things like metro which we sold during the course of the quarter. When we purchased metro, it was always purchased with the notion that we would add value to the enterprise and then ultimately sell metro. That was always part of the strategic design. In terms of our commodity franchise, which we\u2019re as you know very committed to. The focus there is on the hedging of commodity price exposures and working with all those clients globally whether they be corporates or investors. And so that\u2019s really how we think about the strategy. Obviously ownership of physical commodities is getting -- we think is actually a good review by the Federal Reserve. We are very focused on safety and soundness. We think its perfectly understandable that they\u2019re doing the same. But that\u2019s our strategy in commodities.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. And then last one also just on sort of oil. Thinking about the drop here in oil and your M&A franchise, energy has been a pretty meaningful part of the M&A market last few years. What sort of near-term and then maybe a bit longer term impact you anticipate the drop in oil would have to M&A activity from here?","Harvey Schwartz","Well I think big picture, the drop in oil which really started in June but obviously it started getting a lot of attention in the fourth quarter. I think at the highest level a lot has been written about the tradeoffs between near-term impact on markets, but obviously a big tailwind in terms of expense reduction and a benefit for the consumer. And so, we talk to our economist net-net, as you\u2019ve seen from us, we think the price decline if it stays here is a tailwind for global economic growth. As it relates specifically to the industry, if we go through a period of sustained declined prices around this level, then clearly its going to put certain parts of the industry under stress. There will be opportunities to help those clients, work through those stresses. There will be opportunities to deploy new hedging strategies, there will be potentially merger opportunities as the organization works through what is really a case of excess supply. So again, its very early days and these things tend to play out over months and years when you get these kind of price declines. But clearly clients will be looking for advice from Goldman Sachs.","Brennan Hawken","Okay, but no specific commentary as far as the M&A outlook is concerned and the impact there?","Harvey Schwartz","No, I think it\u2019s a bit early. And I think it will be very specific to certain situations in terms of how we work through the cycle.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. Thanks for the color, Harvey","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Steven Chubak","Hi, Harvey. Good morning.","Harvey Schwartz","Hi. How are you?","Steven Chubak","Doing well. Thanks. So, I just had one follow-up question on the capital discussion. Maybe looking at it from a different angle, the presentation you guys had given a couple of months ago is extraordinarily informative. Certainly help us think about all the different constraints that you\u2019re managing to. But from your perspective given that your business adjustments that you plan on making are merely going to be tactical at this juncture, and given our understanding of the constraints and the final rules and where they sit today, what do you believe your spot or required capital levels are at the moment to support your business?","Harvey Schwartz","So, I don\u2019t think we should underemphasize the word tactical. I think tactical really means; there are no big strategic challenges over here in terms of businesses that we need to dispose of at this stage. Really we\u2019re quite pleased with the strength of our franchise businesses, and so I wouldn\u2019t underestimate, I wouldn\u2019t mistake tactical for a lack of focus or a lack of opportunity. As I said I think its really a prerequisite to running the businesses now in terms of having a very focused tactical strategy and I appreciate your comments about the presentation we gave. In terms of how we think about long gone [ph] 15th (0:18) capital levels, obviously the capital levels aren\u2019t finalized. So maybe we should just talk about today's context. In today's context and we\u2019ll see what happens with the finalization of the G-SIB buffers. But in today's context we would be at a minimum of 8.5% and we had a stated buffer of 9.5%. We have been spending time looking at the buffer. I think the 1% buffer probably seems on the high end to us. We\u2019re not going to spend a lot of time on it until we see the final rules. Did that get to your question?","Steven Chubak","It does. But presumably given what we know today whether its about CCAR being binding or the Feds latest proposal recognizing that there could be additional changes going forward that 8.5% plus whatever buffer you didn\u2019t appropriate is probably not where your required capital or target is ultimately going to shake out. Presumably it will be higher than that, and not just for you but for industry peers as well.","Harvey Schwartz","Yes, I would agree with that. You didn\u2019t ask the question but again this is a very early read of the proposal that\u2019s out, and so subject to change. So caveat it accordingly. But our early read and interpretation of the documents out there that it would add 1% for us. And so what you said earlier I think is the more important thing which is in terms of a binding constraints, the binding constraint for us is CCAR. And so, we\u2019ll continue to focus very much on all aspects of the capital ratios. But for us the binding constraint has proven to be CCAR.","Steven Chubak","Okay. Maybe just one quick follow-up. Is it CCAR risk based or leverage based ratios. It felt as though in the last exam it was leveraged. I didn\u2019t know if you felt that, that would potentially evolve as CCAR changes over the next couple of years.","Harvey Schwartz","Yes, so -- look I think the Federal Reserve has said CCAR was going to be dynamic and so we\u2019ll see how they made changes and their test has proven to be dynamic. We can only tell you it was constraining last year as you saw publicly because of the leverage test and then you saw subsequently take certain actions and that obviously influenced our activity around the balance sheet and how we had to think about re-pricing that capital.","Steven Chubak","All right. Harvey that\u2019s really helpful. Thank you for taking my questions.","Harvey Schwartz","Good to hear from you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Matthew Burnell","Good morning, Harvey. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of quick administrative follow-ups. Just following up on the prior discussion, have you provided or given any thought just sort of the short-term wholesale funding buffer and how that might effect your future ratios and if there is any meaningful consideration being given within that calculation for the maturity even within the short-term bucket?","Harvey Schwartz","So, as I said before just so we\u2019re clear to everybody, so our preliminary expectation and again I caveat that because this rule is very fluid and its in formation only would add an incremental 100 basis points to our G-SIB buffer.","Matthew Burnell","Okay.","Harvey Schwartz","In terms of how we\u2019re going -- again I think its really most important for takeaway for everyone to understand the framework for how we think about managing the capital against multiple constraints. So, any time in a new regulatory regime any time we\u2019re deploying our balance sheets you have to be able to think through multiple lenses and view things through multiple lenses, that\u2019s why we created the framework that we discussed at the conference in November which basically ascribes a waiting system to that and that gives us a consistent lens to look at things like the use of balance sheet and the supplementary leverage ratio, stresses from CCAR, Basel III standardized, Basel III advanced. And you have to look at all those things individually at the same time. So, capital management, but the regulators have done an immense amount of work to increase capital levels and make the system safer and as a market participant we need to develop technologies and our philosophy and approach to basically work within that framework and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done.","Matthew Burnell","That\u2019s helpful. And then a question in terms of operating or operational RWA, a number of your peers mentioned that they had increased operating or operational RWA this quarter. Was that true for Goldman as well?","Harvey Schwartz","No, during the course of the quarter -- from the third quarter to the fourth quarter they were basically essentially flat down a little bit.","Matthew Burnell","Okay. Thank you very much.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.","Harvey Schwartz","Good morning.","Devin Ryan","Hi. Good morning, Harvey.","Devin Ryan","Just a couple of quick follow-ups from me as well here, so just on the investment banking backlog comments I\u2019m glad to hear that the backlog is where it is. But debt underwriting specifically can you speak to maybe some of the puts and takes of the high bar in recent years and corporate issuance that, that maybe tough to match versus the opportunity that you\u2019re speaking about with M&A related financings and how much of an offset that could represent?","Harvey Schwartz","So of all the things that I\u2019ve been I think really that I\u2019m predicting over the last couple of years, its been the annual question about what we think debt underwriting is going to do in the next year. I think you could easily take a position over the last two years that maybe debt underwriting will be lower than the previous year. But the markets have remained robust. M&A activity can be a significant driver of financing activity. I think if rates stay low and the markets are stable and spreads are tight, I think you could see a very reasonable environment. I think if you see the contrary then obviously it will have an impact on activity, and very difficult to predict from here. I mean rates are very low. So for many issuance its going to look quite attractive over the course of the year.","Devin Ryan","Okay. Thanks for the color. And then just on comp, some of your peers are talking about changing their methodology around different comp, and I know you don\u2019t specifically disclose level of differed comp, but in a roughly flat year for reported comp, is it reasonable to assume that differed comp is also roughly flat or is there any additional qualitative detail you can provide around how you guys are thinking about the mix there?","Harvey Schwartz","So, I think the better way to think about that is, we\u2019ve been consistent in our compensation philosophy for a number of years in terms of really ensuring that our employees and it goes up as you go up through the seniority of the firm through to the partners that you hold a significant amount of equity and there\u2019s been no change of philosophy over the last several years.","Devin Ryan","That\u2019s fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Douglas Sipkin with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Douglas Sipkin","Yes, thank you. Good morning. Two questions, first on fake and I\u2019m just curious for your guys perspective and opinion Harvey. I mean, given the sort of change in liquidity that\u2019s come to these markets in the last, lets call it five or six years since the credit crises. I mean, is your guys position that credit is maybe a little bit more vulnerable to smaller shocks given the lack of liquidity, i.e. I guess energy feels like it was the catalyst really for credit to weaken, but its still only, I mean, its bigger but its only like 14%, 15% of high yield. So, is it more pronounced now credit events given the lack of liquidities at your guy\u2019s perspective or it was just kind of a tough quarter?","Harvey Schwartz","It will be very difficult to anticipate whether or not this is kind of a new credit regime in terms of liquidity trading or it is -- these are sort of one off factors. Its always hard to assess that when you\u2019ve had multiple years of timing credit spreads, very low default rates. I will say when you look to the data I don\u2019t have it on top of my head particularly in Europe where liquidity was little challenged in the third quarter and then it got worse in the fourth quarter. I think because if market moves in terms of price movements they were pretty significant. More significant than you would have thought in terms of the underlying credit itself. And so clearly liquidity played a role in terms of the degree of price movement. But I wouldn\u2019t say at this stage you could draw any firm conclusions from that in terms of any long-term structural changes.","Douglas Sipkin","Okay, great. And then shifting to asset management, obviously a great year for you guys. I was little surprised to see sort of the fixed income bucket on the flow side a little flattish for the fourth quarter and I was wondering, did you guys close some strategies or did something change just given how strong you guys have done obviously with performance and some of your competitors struggling throughout the year, and it still looked like fourth quarter industry wide that phenomena still played out. So I was just curious as to why you guys didn\u2019t sort of have the same flow dynamic you had throughout the first three quarters?","Harvey Schwartz","Yes, I even had a chance to dig through sort of competitor results and maybe get more transparency over time than we do, but when we look at it over the course of the year which is really how we think about it. We took in $74 billion of long-term flows of which you highlighted $58 billion came in at fixed income. This could just be the timing of how various mandates that are rewarded arrive. We feel quite good about our performance and our ability to continue to gather assets on the back of that performance.","Douglas Sipkin","Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. Thanks. Yes, I just want to call out that you had mentioned that you had 754 million of litigation and regulatory expense in the period. Just want to make sure that, that\u2019s all related to investigations and not compliance costs in there.","Harvey Schwartz","So that\u2019s all -all-- those are litigation related reserves that we access every quarter and we take a quarterly based on information we have on individual and specific cases. That\u2019s not a compensation build or an expense related to additional compliance people or something. I\u2019m not sure, I understood the question. So I\u2019m just trying to clarify it.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Yes, that\u2019s the question. So I mean if those investigations go away is that kind of with the expense savings or be it was kind of more of a normalized level of litigation [ph]?","Harvey Schwartz","As we work through legacy costs, ultimately that is the case.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. And will you be able to put most of the major investigation behind you in 2015?","Harvey Schwartz","So in terms of litigation, you have seen us obviously make progress in the third quarter, we settled with the FHFA. I would encourage you to really dig through our disclosure where we give very vast disclosure around all facets of litigation and status.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay, thanks.","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Harvey Schwartz","Good morning. Please check your line to see if you\u2019re on mute.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks.","Harvey Schwartz","Hey, Eric.","Eric Wasserstrom","Hi, how are you? That\u2019s only like the fifth time I\u2019ve done that in this earning cycle. So you -- I just wanted to follow-up on the RWA discussion and see Harvey, if you could just help me kind of understand what the puts and takes of it might be over the course of this year?","Harvey Schwartz","Are you saying on a going forward basis?","Eric Wasserstrom","Correct.","Harvey Schwartz","Yes, on a going forward basis, again I would say there is two things that underscore. The first is we\u2019re going to continue to be very focused on further rule compliance and being efficient about the capital. But a lot of it will be driven by client activity. Obviously, we are well positioned from a capital perspective. And so, we really want to stay front footed at as we to the extent to which clients demand are capital. And so we feel well positioned. Hard for me to tell you what those demands are going to be as we sit here in January, but we feel very well positioned,","Eric Wasserstrom","And in terms of the very broad based reduction in assets that you undertook over the course of this year. Is that -- should we view that as being largely completed or is that something that is still under consideration for you over the course of this coming year.","Harvey Schwartz","So immediately\\ we have no media plans to reduce the balance sheet from here, but again that's going to be subject to review continuously. And so again, it will be dynamic. If we feel like we are not getting the proper returns, then we will look to reduce. Its really just about discipline, at the same time making sure that we invest strategically for the long run.","Eric Wasserstrom","Correct. And then, if I guess get a transition for a moment and in terms of the M&A pipeline, could you give us any sense of the complexion of it is that primarily in country as it more across board. Are we seeing any changes, I guess, the real question is are we singing any changes in terms of the complexion of M&A activity, relative to what we\u2019ve seen over the -- this past year?","Harvey Schwartz","I mean, look in terms of year-over-year as you would expect the growth specifically in terms of the backlog, it really came work from Americas and Europe and it was really down in terms of Asia. That\u2019s how I describe a geographic measure, which is probably doesn\u2019t surprising.","Eric Wasserstrom","And I mean what is the -- I guess I'm trying to understand is the strategic rational changing at all among corporate Boards and terms of growth orientation versus cost savings orientation or any kind of that kind of strategic level discussion.","Harvey Schwartz","I think that its, when we talked to our M&A team, what they will tell you is very industry specific. It can be geographic, but the moment level is quite high and so I guess when you look back at it, I said earlier there were a number of folks who would say look we never see M&A again a couple of years ago and that was just where we want in a cycle, but I think that in a world which generally increasingly stable, low growth, but stable CEO\u2019s and boards will look to grow revenues and a strategic opportunity. The one thing that we\u2019ve seen as part of this past cycle, driven by strategics is large transactions tend to spin-off lots of activity in particular sectors. So I don\u2019t know when you talked to our M&A team. I don\u2019t know they would say, look this is all cost driven or this is all top line driven. It\u2019s a mix of factors that will drive action. The momentum feels quite good.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks very much.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Richard Bove with Rafferty Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Harvey Schwartz","Good morning.","Richard Bove","Good morning. This is kind of a broad question. So I apologize, after a very long call, but over the past couple of days having getting questions on both sides of Goldman Sachs, if you will. While in terms of structure, one is given everything hat you\u2019ve mentioned about capital and constraints on the business placed by the regulators. Should in fact Goldman Sachs be broken up? And if not, why should it be kept together? The other side being asked, given the high level of cyclicality in the two main businesses of the company, should Goldman Sachs make a major acquisition either an asset management company, or a wealth management company, which we give the company a recurring stream of revenue to eliminate some of the [indiscernible] volatility and its revenues and earnings. I don\u2019t know is it the same question basically which is what should the structure, Goldman Sachs be over the next 4 to 5 years?","Harvey Schwartz","Yes, so it\u2019s a good question and obviously there has been a lot of focus on there. So, I guess, we first have to say -- so, if anything what\u2019s changed today because I think prior to the crisis there was a belief that obviously it benefits to scale and you can get scale and you can have synergies. I think the change that people are focused on now is obviously there is a cost, a capital cost that the regulators are putting on side and so its very natural that the question that you're asking. Now, for GS, I would highlight a couple of things. First of all, we\u2019re just significantly smaller than many of the other firms and our balance sheet at $850 plus billion. Many of our competitors are more than twice our size and we\u2019ve 34,000 employees and they may have hundreds of thousands of employees, and so we are smaller and we are less complex. And as a result, we're somewhat simpler. So what I would say is when we look at the collection of businesses that we have, the way we answer the synergy question is first and foremost through the eyes of the clients. Do we think we provide more value to our clients by having a collection of businesses together or not? It doesn't matter to us when in any given quarter the stock markets may be not valuing one of our businesses as perfectly as we would like it to be. It's really a question of over the long run can we drive shareholder value by having that benefit to our clients. So let's take fixed income and equity as one example. In an environment where its technology driven and the clients increasingly get larger, you need to scale across those businesses. We started running those businesses as a collective shortly after 2000 I think. And so the ability to deliver one technology platform across those businesses have one risk management system, all those things provide us with scale and we think we\u2019re able to execute better. It then feeds into our ability to adapt and develop technology tools around capital, and hopefully we are able to perform well in terms of deploying the firms\u2019 capital. When you think about investment banking, you bundle in. Think about the merger business today. And what we\u2019re able to do for our clients by having the ability to commit the capital and actually deliver to the capital markets and connect investors with issuers. Well, all of these things are very synergistic. Our private wealth business, with our banking business, with our asset management business, these are all things that we think we have synergies in. Now, in terms of smaller or bigger, I think it's going to be environment driven for us. You saw us, you have seen us shrink the balance sheet pretty dramatically thinking you have known us for long time, we used to run at 1.1, 1.2 trillion. We\u2019ve been around 900 and now well below that for quite a while and so you\u2019re going to see us be dynamic about this. If we thought, we could drive more value for our clients and get more scale then we would consider things. I will say now it\u2019s harder obviously because there is the explicit pricing end, if you want to call it tax of incremental capital. You have to be very confident that you can get those synergies in that scale. That answer okay, given the breadth of your question.","Richard Bove","Yes, I think it makes a great deal of sense. What about the other foot side of the question, which is where can you come up with a recurring revenue stream that would lower the volatility in your current business mix.","Harvey Schwartz","It\u2019s funny. I can\u2019t help myself big. I know you say there a lot of volatility in our current revenue mix, but we have actually produced $34 billion in revenues for three years running. And we\u2019ve grown the ROE and we shrunk the balance sheet and we\u2019ve increased the pre-tax and we replaced $2.5 billion of revenues that didn\u2019t disappear because of volatility, it disappeared because we sold them. So I\u2019m not telling you its going to always be this stable, but touch wood it feels pretty stable last couple of years.","Richard Bove","Okay. Thank you very much.","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Andrew Limb with Societe Generale. Please go ahead.","Andrew Limb","Hi. Good morning, Harvey.","Harvey Schwartz","Hi. Good morning.","Andrew Limb","I\u2019ve just got a -- good morning. I\u2019ve got a question on the trading book review that mostly the Basel committee is undertaking and whether you could give anymore color on what kind of impacts it might have on the industry on an absolute basis, and also how you stack up relative to your peers?","Harvey Schwartz","So on the trading book review we think it\u2019s very important obviously and we\u2019re in active dialogue. There\u2019s been the QIS and -- so again its very early on that. So I don\u2019t have any specific comments on the trading book review. I think what I would say is that, and again I think you have to give credit and kudos to the regulators. They have been incredibly productive over the last several years. If we paused a list out for all the regulatory changes, its incredible in terms of the impact on capital, liquidity, trading, top execution facilities and so, one of the things I think we all need to consider is market participants, and when I say that I mean clients, folks like ourselves and regulators is we need to maybe at least think about pausing a bit and digesting the impact of these rules. There\u2019s no doubt that these rules make the system stronger and safer as I said before. I do think there\u2019s a benefit to absorbing how they interact over the long periods of time, because you can't get all those benefits without some cost. We can't necessarily always identify those costs immediately. And so that would be my very high level comment on that. But I don\u2019t have any specific comments on any proposed revisions for the rules.","Andrew Limb","And is it something that you\u2019re running internally just to see what the impact is at the moment or is that too early to do that?","Harvey Schwartz","So, we\u2019re very consistent on our philosophy and yes in terms of proposed rules. It follows a very normal course protocol for us. We work as constructively as we can with the regulators in terms of trying to provide them with data and dialogue on the impact of overrule. So we\u2019re always active participants and we dedicate a lot of time and people and system and math to the QIS as they come out whether with any rule and we always try and be an active participant in terms of giving good balanced feedback to the regulators in terms of the benefits and cause of any proposed rule, which is very early in this potential rewrite. It\u2019s just too early to comment on it.","Andrew Limb","Okay. And then just carrying on to another regulation the NSFR. I know you said that was early as well, but any thoughts about how that might impinge on your prime brokerage business and in terms of like incumberment to your balance sheet assets?","Harvey Schwartz","Now again too early to tell. We\u2019ll see how it ultimately evolves when we get a local regulation. As I said, a big part of the discussion will be around the treatment of deposits. But look, I think what you\u2019re going to see the world do as they adjust is all firms, not just Goldman Sachs. All firms will look for what we\u2019ll call net stable funding ratio funding, whatever that ends up being defined as. And so, we\u2019ll see how the rule evolves. But look, we\u2019ll adapt. You\u2019ve seen us do it whether it\u2019s the Basel III ratio, the supplementary leverage ratio, all these things. We\u2019ll just -- we still need to see a rule.","Andrew Limb","Okay. And then just one final question. Is that target SLR that you\u2019re aiming for heading into the CCAR at all?","Harvey Schwartz","No. At this stage not. As you saw into the SLR right at this stage, as you saw we\u2019re at 5%. That\u2019s up about 80 basis points in the course of the year, so now we\u2019re complying with 2018. One of the things is we\u2019ll continue to review this. There are whole lots of factors that could improve that ratio from here, but again we\u2019ll be assessing all of our buffers as we get the final capital rules. Again we all interact, right? So, you really want to get to a point of stability of rule making and then you can really set the parameters and dial them in more tightly.","Andrew Limb","Great. Thanks a lot.","Harvey Schwartz","Thank you. I appreciate you dialing in.","Operator","At this time there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.","Harvey Schwartz","So, hey everyone. Since there are no more questions, I just want to take a moment to thank all you for joining the call. Hopefully myself and other members of senior management will see many of you in the coming months. If there is any additional questions arise, please don\u2019t hesitate to give Dane a call, otherwise enjoy the rest of your day and a long weekend and look forward to speaking with you our first quarter earnings call coming up in April.

I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, July 16, 2015. Thank you.","Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.","Dane E. Holmes - Head-Investor Relations","Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call.","Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain and outside of the firm's control. The firm's actual results and financial condition may differ possibly materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements.","For discussion of some of the risk and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2014.","I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets, and supplementary leverage ratio.","And you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that's posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com. This audiocast is copyrighted material to Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent.","Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, will now review the firm's results. Harvey?","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through the second quarter and year-to-date results then I'm happy to answer any questions.","Net revenues were $9.1 billion, net earnings $1 billion, earnings per diluted share $1.98, and our annualized return on common equity was 4.8%. For the year-to-date, net revenues were $19.7 billion, net earnings $3.9 billion, earnings per diluted share $7.93, and our annualized return on common equity was 9.7%.","In the second quarter, we recorded net provisions for mortgage related litigation and regulatory matters of $1.45 billion. Despite these charges, book value per common share was up 4% relative to year-end 2014. Excluding these litigation charges, net earnings were $2.3 billion, earnings per diluted share were $4.75, and our annualized return on common equity was 11.5%.","The second quarter of 2015 was another example of the benefits that come with having a diversified global client franchise. Certain businesses showed year-over-year strengths while others faced headwinds.","Investment Banking and Investment Management net revenues increased year-over-year by 13% and 14% respectively. The increase in net revenues within these primarily fee-based business s largely offset net revenue declines and are more capital-intensive businesses with a 6% year-over-year decline in Institutional Client Services and a 13% year-over-year decline in Investing and Lending.","The benefits of diversity were even demonstrated at a business level. For example, strength in advisory and equity underwriting more than offset the year-over-year decline in debt underwriting, which was lower versus a record last year. And for Institutional Client Services, revenue strength within equities helped offset a difficult operating environment for FICC. Ultimately, we continue to benefit from our diverse set of market leading businesses.","If you look at our first half results, excluding the $1.45 billion litigation charge in the second quarter of 2015, you can see the embedded operating leverage, with expenses flat relative to revenues that are up 7% compared to last year. You can also see the improvement in several underlying performance metrics.","These include a 440 basis point improvement in pre-tax margin, a 27% increase in net earnings, a 31% increase to diluted earnings per share, and finally, a 220 basis point improvement in ROE, to 13.1%.","Now I will discuss each of our businesses. Investment Banking produced second quarter revenues of $2 billion, 6% higher than a strong first quarter. We continue to see the benefit of our leading global franchise, with second quarter revenues at the highest level since 2007.","Our Investment Banking backlog was down slightly compared to the first quarter and remained higher year-over-year. Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the second quarter, advisory revenues were $821 million. The 15% decrease relative to the first quarter reflects a decrease in completed M&A.","Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&A. We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the second quarter, including BHP Billiton's $12.7 billion demerger of South32; Synageva Biopharma's $8.4 billion sale to Alexion Pharmaceuticals; and Imperial Tobacco Group's $7.1 billion acquisition of certain cigarette brands and other assets of Reynolds American and Lorillard.","We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the second quarter. These include BG Group's \u00a347 billion acquisition by Royal Dutch Shell; Altera Corporation's $16.7 billion sale to Intel Corporation; and Pall Corporation's $13.8 billion sale to Danaher Corporation.","Moving to underwriting, revenues were $1.2 billion in the second quarter, up 27% sequentially, primarily due to debt issuance. This was our second highest quarterly performance in underwriting. Year-to-date, we ranked first in global equity and equity-related and common stock offerings.","Equity underwriting revenues of $595 million rose 12% compared to the first quarter, due to an increase in IPOs. Debt underwriting revenues of $603 million improved 47% quarter-over-quarter, largely driven by an increase in leverage finance activity.","During the second quarter, we actively supported our client's financing needs. Leading Qualcomm's $10 billion debt IPO, Daiichi Sankyo's $3.2 billion sale of its stake in Sun Pharmaceutical, and AIG's $3.5 billion sale of its stake in AerCap.","Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and Equity businesses, net revenues were $3.6 billion in the second quarter, down 34% compared to the seasonally-stronger first quarter. FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.6 billion in the second quarter, and include $153 million of DBA gains.","Net revenues were down substantially from the first quarter, as client activity declined across our businesses and market-making conditions were more difficult. Within interest rates and currencies, a shifting macro backdrop negatively impacted client activity and results. While currency has experienced a significant decline, client activity and interest rates, though sequentially lower, remain solid.","Credit was significantly lower, as credit spreads generally widened during the second quarter and activity levels declined. Mortgages also declined versus the first quarter, as volatility and client activity remained generally low. Commodities decreased significantly, with reduced levels of volatility and client activity.","In Equities, which includes Equities Client Execution, commissions and fees, and security services, net revenues for the second quarter were $2 billion, down 14% quarter-over-quarter and included $32 million in DBA gains.","Equities Client Execution net revenues decreased 30% sequentially, to $787 million. Client activity levels remained high this quarter, though not as high as the first quarter. Commissions and fees were $767 million, down 5% relative to the first quarter. Security services generated net revenues of $443 million, up 13% sequentially, reflecting seasonally-stronger client activity and higher customer balances.","Turning to risk, average daily VaR in the second quarter was $77 million, down from $81 million in the first quarter, reflecting a decrease in commodities and interest rates.","Moving on to our Investing and Lending activities, collectively, these businesses produced net revenues of $1.8 billion in the second quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $1.3 billion, primarily reflecting strong corporate performance and company-specific events in private equity, as well as net gains in public equities. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $547 million, with roughly $225 million in net interest income, and the balance coming from net gains.","In Investment Management, we reported second quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion, up 4% from the first quarter. This represented the second highest quarterly performance for Investment Management. Management and other fees were up 4% sequentially, to a record $1.25 billion.","Revenues benefited from a higher average mix of long-term fee-based products relative to liquidity products. Assets under supervision increased $5 billion, to a record $1.182 trillion. Long-term net inflows of $14 billion, largely driven by fixed income products, were somewhat offset by net market depreciation of $3 billion and net outflows of $6 billion in liquidity products.","Moving to performance, across the global platform, 76% of our client mutual fund assets were in funds ranked in the top two quartiles on a three-year and a five-year basis.","Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior-year equity awards and other items such as benefits was again accrued at a compensation to net revenues ratio of 42%. Second quarter non-compensation expenses were 59% higher than the first quarter. Substantially all of the increase was related to litigation charges.","Now, I'd like to take you through a few key statistics for the second quarter. Total staff was approximately 34,900 up 1% from the first quarter. Our effective tax rate for the year-to-date was 31.2%. Our global core of liquid assets averaged $181 billion. Our common equity tier 1 ratio was 11.8% using standardized approach. It was 12.5% under the Basel III Advanced approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 5.7%.","And finally, we repurchased 1.2 million shares of common stock for $245 million in the second quarter. As discussed last quarter, related to our share repurchase capacity, any potential share repurchases over the next four quarters will be back-end weighted.","In closing, a few comments. The second quarter of 2015 provided its share of opportunities and challenges. On one hand, our results reflect a continuation of some positive macro trends. Our Investment Banking clients remain focused on their strategic alternatives. There is also a strong demand for financing solutions. We see solid client activity in equity products, particularly outside of the United States, and there was a growing need for active investment management options.","On the other hand, the operating environment for our FICC clients was more challenged in the second quarter. The combination of current concern surrounding Greece's widening credit spreads and the reversal of certain macro trends led to lower client activity and a more difficult operating environment. More recently, market participants have been focused on the Chinese economy. This follows the more than 30% decline in the Shanghai Index during the early part of July from peak levels in June.","Against this mixed backdrop, we remain focused on driving value for our shareholders. Year-to-date, excluding litigation charges, we have posted strong results in many of our key investor metrics, including earnings per share, ROE, and book value per share.","As we have mentioned many times before, our management team isn't overly focused on any one quarter or, for that matter, any six month period. Our focus is on the strength of our global client franchise, the quality of our people, and the long term trends driving our businesses.","Regarding trends, we see many opportunities ahead. For example, the competitive landscape is in significant flux. In addition to strengthening the banking system, one of the positive things the regulation has achieved is leveling the competitive playing field.","The world changed after 2008. We began to adapt to this new world immediately, and particularly to comply with new regulations. As part of this process we also scrutinized each of our businesses with the goal of both improving the client experience and our ability to generate appropriate shareholder returns.","We started early, we cut costs, we on-boarded new regulations, we sold businesses, and we developed a new capital framework. At the same time, we have been able to both expand and deepen our global client franchise.","As much as we are focused on the present, we are also focused on the future, and we enter it knowing we have a great set of businesses, we have tremendous client relationships, we have world-class people and execution capabilities, and last but not least, we have an improving competitive and operating landscape.","Thank you again for dialing in, and I'm happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we will now take a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Glenn P. Schorr - Evercore ISI","Hi. Thanks very much.","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Glenn.","Glenn P. Schorr - Evercore ISI","Good morning. So pretty darn good all around. I think FICC and I&L take a lot of everyone's focus, but in FICC specifically, I wonder if you could help us, how much of that was a late quarter phenomenon? You spelled out what fell off in credit and mortgage, things like that. How much was a late quarter? How much have you seen some stabilization or reversal so far? And then most importantly, I think last quarter you felt really good about market share in client facilitation side of the business, and I'm curious if you can give any comments on parsing that out, the facilitation versus the marks in the quarter? Thank you.","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So in terms of timing of the quarter, we came off a strong first quarter, as you mentioned, and then we came in basically you saw a number of factors. I think the most significant one, obviously, Greece in the headlines continuously. And that certainly weighed on spread sensitive parts of the business like credit and mortgages. Early in the quarter, obviously, there was a big reversal in the macro trend with respect to how people were thinking about currencies and interest rates. And that was really more an interest rate differential and what's the Fed going to do discussion. And so it's not surprising that we saw reduced client activity in the quarter and obviously more difficult market-making environment.","In terms of \u2013 it was really more pronounced as the quarter went along as Greece really dominated the headlines and liquidity was challenged in parts of the market. And so it was really \u2013 it was more of an end of quarter phenomenon. Too early to tell in terms of where we are in this quarter, Glenn, but obviously, the news around Greece has been obviously very positive in the last couple of days. And so hopefully some of these trends are behind us.","Glenn P. Schorr - Evercore ISI","And then I think you talked about the competitive landscape in flux and we all see what's going on at each and every one of the European banks. I think your franchise composition is different in general. You see it in results this quarter, and mostly good. Just a question on the European shrinking. Do you want what they're shrinking? In other words, theoretically, they're going to shrink the tougher parts, the lower ROA types of the business.","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So in terms of how we think about it, and obviously these competitive trends they take years to really formulate. But I think the big change and I talked about this a little bit in my script, but to be more specific about it, the capital-intensive parts of the business and really let's just start with the fixed income parts of the business, given the regulatory demands around that part of the business to deliver for your clients and drive appropriate returns for shareholders, that is actually where we think the competitive advantage is most significant.","So if you just look at last year's collective industry ROEs, which are in the mid to higher single digits. Our relative position both the strength and the franchise but aggregate position of the firm just positions us quite well over the next couple of years if firms follow through on what they saying and they actually restructure and they begin to redesign those businesses. And so, as people exit the business, obviously, the impact of the marginal pressure on risk when you're deploying capital should be beneficial and we're leaders in all those parts of the franchise, but I think this is going to be a multi-year phenomenon.","Glenn P. Schorr - Evercore ISI","Okay. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it sounds like there might be more volatility, but in the end, your shareholders are going to love the fact that you are bigger in some of those areas.","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, we feel very confident about the business. That's the way I would describe it.","Glenn P. Schorr - Evercore ISI","All right, thanks. I respect the one and one. Thank you.","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning, Harvey.","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey. Good morning, Christian.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. So my first question is on the CCAR and G-SIB \u2013 possible G-SIB's surcharges. So I'm sure you're aware that this chatter that that could be included in the CCAR process going forward. You know, you have been or Goldman has been pretty proactive in optimizing for CCAR, be it preferred issuance or reducing the gross balance sheet, but what are the levers can you pull if G-SIB buffers are included?","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So as you pointed out, we obviously have been pretty dynamic with respect \u2013 I think the greatest example was a year ago when we brought the balance sheet down by nearly $60 million in the quarter. And that was predominately driven by CCAR and that was a repricing exercise, which led us to do that. So the way we'll think about this is a couple ways. First of all, it's only preliminary and we'll have to see the final rule, but our expectation is that at this stage given the information that we have, again preliminary, that any incremental buffer will be roughly 1%. And so, relative to the peer group, obviously, that puts us in a good position.","Now in terms of how to think about the implications for the test, we have no visibility into how the Federal Reserve is going to change the test. And so to the extent to which it changes, we'll look at all the same levers again. There will be an evaluation of how we should think about the capital structure of the firm, how we should think about how we're deploying our capital, how we think about pricing the marginal balance sheet and other aspects of our business. But we won't do that in advance of any changes in any regulatory rules. And we just don't know what they're going to do yet.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. And then litigation costs, so how should we think about go-forward litigation costs? I guess over the last four quarters, you've averaged about $200 million per quarter, just given the big charge this quarter, all else equal, should we expect that run rate to slow down a bit?","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So obviously, we took a significant charge this quarter. The vast majority of that is related to the RMBS Working Group. But the process with respect to these kind of legacy cost issues is, every quarter, based on the best information available, we create our best estimate and it's very case-by-case dependent. And so it can be somewhat unpredictable quarter-to-quarter. That's how I'd frame it for you.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. So it doesn't sound like anything changes in terms of just kind of look forward here?","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'm sure you understand this, Christian, given that these are \u2013 this is active litigation, very difficult for me to comment beyond what I said.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","That's fair. Okay. Thank you for taking my questions.","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks so much, Christian.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, Harvey. Thanks a lot.","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Mike.","Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Just on the equity trading, so year-over-year, the strength was pretty significant. I think you mentioned a few drivers of that. But just wanted to get a sense, are you seeing any, either market share gains in that part of the business or is it more environment and clients' investors getting more active in the asset class? I know you pointed to Asia, but I just wanted to find out if there was anything else driving that?","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. I think, obviously, it has been a good solid couple of quarters. Environmentally, for the first half of the year, the environment has clearly been better, both from a activity level and also from a market-making perspective, and so you're seeing that. The franchise is very diverse, both geographically and product line. And so I think when market activity picks up, you're just seeing the value of the franchise pull through. And as I said earlier, as activity has picked up outside of the U.S., I can't tell necessarily whether or not it's share pickup from other firms, but obviously, you've seen actually in the first quarter even, those firms with strong equity franchises seem to be getting the lion's share of the activity.","Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Got it. And then just two kind of minor items, but on the legal cost, you mentioned this reserve, and it's always tough in terms of the outlook. But when you think about some of the major things that you guys have put behind you, and even the industry, when we think about the run rate going forward, are the majority of those items behind you? And then on the tax rate, just wanted to understand, if I exclude the item related to the legal reserve, it looks like the core tax rate still was relatively low versus expectations, in line with last quarter. So is the revenue mix away from the legal charge still beneficial? Meaning it's still coming in in lower jurisdictions? And so does that, for the full year, should we be thinking about that continuing?","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So with respect to tax, you're right. It's roughly consistent with the first quarter and we're running below last year's full year, so you're right about that. That's both earnings-mix driven, and an election. You'll see in the earnings release this quarter with respect to certain earnings that we'll leave overseas. With respect to litigation, again, the charge we took this quarter is \u2013 the vast majority of that is related to the RMBS Working Group. And I'd really encourage you to look through our disclosure, and while I wish I could give you more detail, obviously, that's one significant item, a legacy item, that we look forward to getting behind us. But I really can't comment in more detail on that, given it's a live discussion.","Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning.","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Mike \u2013 Matt, sorry.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Maybe a bigger picture question, on your traditional bank strategy, you had a key hire on the consumer side, or former consumer person. Maybe just talk about what you're thinking there on traditional bank strategy in general?","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, yeah, as everyone saw, we hired Harit and we're thrilled to have someone of his experience and caliber on board as a one of our partners. I would say at this stage, it's very early days and we've really done two things. We've identified a potential opportunity and we've identified a key hire, as I said, which we're very excited about. When we look at new opportunities what we look for in terms of making that evaluation is, what core competencies do we have and how can we bring them to any client base that we deal with. And so, we feel like there is a couple of strengths here that we have.","One, we have a long history and a core competency in risk management. Two, we have a very, very big commitment to technology. Three, historically, we've been pretty good builders of new businesses. And, obviously, as it relates to, let's just call it the space of digitally-led consumer finance, we have no legacy cost, we have no legacy infrastructure to deal with. And so to the extent to which we can work with Harit and develop a strategy, which we believe is accretive to the firm and valuable to clients, we'll pursue it. But at this stage, it's early days. Harit's just on board, and so we'll be back to you with more details as things develop.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And then maybe separately, you mentioned head count was up just 1% linked quarter. Year-over-year, it's up 8%. Obviously, it's not causing any expense pressure as the expense management's been good, but just remind us just where those people are being added? And I guess are they more kind of junior, lower salaried staff?","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, the 1% increase in the quarter and the longer term increase it's really happening in two places. Part of it is driven by our growth in the Investment Management business and people that we've been adding there as that business continues to grow and our ongoing investment there. And really the other large portion of it relates to resources that we needed to deploy as we come into the more significant part of regulatory compliance. And so, these are all the new rules that the industry is affected by over the next couple of years. And so it's a bit of a surge, if you will, in terms of having people on board. And for example in the second quarter, about three-quarters of those folks were in places like Salt Lake City, Bangalore, and other locations.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Sorry, three-quarters of the people in the reg-related staff or of the additions?","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Of the additions.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, Harvey.","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey. How are you?","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good. I just had a couple of quick questions. One was on the G-SIFI buffer that you talked about earlier on the call. I just wanted to see \u2013 did you give us an update on what you think your surcharge is? I thought you were \u2013 before the most recent commentary it was like 2.5%. Are you saying now it's 2%?","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, no. Same. No change. We don't have any incremental information. We think it's \u2013 obviously, we started with 1.5%. Under the proposal, we believe there's an incremental 100 (29:17), but again, I cautioned you that's the preliminary. We haven't seen the final rule, obviously.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Got it. All right. Just wanted to make sure of that. And then on European competitors fading some of these businesses over time, how much does that matter to you when you think about the fact that the SIFI surcharge is in part a relative charge? So they fade naturally, you're going to grow as a percentage of total business. How much room is there to take on new business given the way the SIFI surcharge is structured?","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, it's a great question, Betsy, and obviously, a difficult one to think about over the next couple of years. But obviously there may be some unevenness in the playing field depending on how the rules actually get rolled out. But in the end, it's more about I think how you deploy that capital and the returns you're able to generate. And I think one of the reasons why, as you point out, we're seeing potential big restructurings on the European side is that even without the SIFI charge potential that we have in the United States \u2013 and who knows what they'll do over time, maybe the playing field will be completely level \u2013 they're struggling in those businesses at current capital levels. (30:35).","Now, our commitment to Europe is very significant. And it's not just across the capital intensive businesses, but it's the entire integration of banking. And when you think about Europe over the next several years as they work through what is \u2013 our research folks have them at 1.5% growth, but as they work themselves more and more away from the crisis, this is a very good environment for a firm like Goldman Sachs where clients need sound advice across all of our businesses.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yup. No, I get that. All right. Hey, thanks.","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","Hey, Harvey.","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Mike. How are you?","Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","Good. You ended your prepared remarks saying the world changed in 2008, you cut costs, you implemented regulation and the implication is others are now catching up, implying a little more bit rational pricing, which you've said on prior calls. Can you just give us a description of the areas where you're seeing the biggest repricing or the areas that you're watching the most?","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So it's a great question, Mike. And I think it's very clear at this stage that the increased regulatory requirements, however you think about them, but let's just think mostly in terms of capital, while obviously very good for the system and significant improvement for all firms. For example, Goldman Sachs was carrying 85% more capital than we did prior to the crisis.","As we said, they have leveled the playing field a bit, but even without the leveling of the playing field, it makes balance sheet at one point, depending on the metric, and capital itself more expensive. And so, I don't know if it's an intended or unintended consequence in terms of the regulation, but the regulation does reprice things. And the vast majority of the industry is really a handful of us that are earning above the cost of capital, whatever you want to call it \u2013 8%, 9%, 10%.","And so we're starting to see repricing come through now. We saw it mostly in balance sheet. Came a little slower than we would've liked, but it's starting to come through in balance sheet. By balance sheet I mean things like those businesses that were maybe most mispriced relative to the new requirements. Things like the repo business, it's extended into the prime brokerage business. Again, that's a regulatory heavy business. We're world-class in that business, but it is regulatory heavy business. And you have seen it in parts of the derivative business particularly in things like those transactions requiring or not requiring collateral. So I'd say it's slow. These are not huge needle movers, but this feels like a trend that's in place for a number of years.","Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","So would you call this as an increase in your cost of goods sold that you're passing on to customers?","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think that's probably a reasonable way to say it. I mean our clients are very sophisticated. And when you sit down with them and you say, listen, everyone in the industry, Mike, that issues preferred they are issuing them slightly north of 5%. That's expensive shareholder capital to fund the leverage of your balance sheet. And so, it's pretty easy to explain to people how actually the returns that you have to require on business. And so what we think will happen over time is potentially repricing, but also the competitive dynamic looks like one where those firms that can't deliver or can't respond or don't have the same quality franchise, they get removed. But anyway, this is going to be a \u2013 this will be a long process. We went through a pretty substantial repricing as you know (34:17) last year.","Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","And last follow up on this. Can you give a sense of magnitude? Are we talking basis point or tens of basis points or what?","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Too soon to quantify. As I said, this is not big needle moving. It's more, I would describe it more as a trend for the balance sheet and capital intensive parts of the business. And you'd expect it given the regulatory constraints, so.","Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","All right. Thank you.","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous. Please go ahead.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research US LP","Yeah, good morning. I don't want to beat a dead horse, but on the litigation question, the litigation charge, presumably to add that much based on the Working Group issues that you referred to, there must have been an event, a point in your discussions with them that began to give you a sense for a figure. And I was just wondering if that's a correct assumption?","And also does your view of kind of the your \u2013 where your litigation reserve stands now relative to what you will ultimately need, is that affected in anyway by the New York Court of Appeals judgment on statute of limitations which came down during the quarter?","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So again, and I'd like to share more with you but obviously this is active discussion. With respect to this quarter, again, every quarter we incorporate all the information we have, Guy. And obviously we received information that resulted in us taking this charge. I know you've looked and you've read all of our financial disclosures in the past. And so I would encourage you to go back to that. But as you know, based on that we have not historically taken reserves for the RMBS Working Group. And so obviously we got information during the course of the quarter that led to this realization.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research US LP","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then on, just to follow up on an answer that you gave earlier. That 1% that you gave in terms of the G-SIB buffer, which I think what you were saying was that is your working assumption as to how much would go into the CCAR, sort of the increase, the stress minimum in CCAR. Is that right? So you're thinking that 1% out of your 2.5% G-SIB buffer is how much you think is likely to get added to the stress minimum in CCAR?","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, again, the 1% was based on the preliminary. We'll have to see the final rule, so I really want to emphasize that. In terms of CCAR, we just don't know how they're going to include it, what they will do, whether it will be offset. We have no visibility and we'll all hear when the Federal Reserve announces any changes that they plan to make.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research US LP","Okay. Fair enough. And then just one more if I might just on the SLR. You made a lot of progress on your SLR in the quarter relative to where your core equity tier 1 ratios moved. So you are now 70 basis points ahead of the minimum. You increased 40 basis points in the quarter. Can you give a sense of some of the things that you did presumably to the denominator to continue to tighten up there?","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, so on the SLR, the 70 basis points, if you break that down, roughly 20 basis points really comes from capital and the issuance of preferred and then the balance are all things that drive the ratio, things like notional (38:10), collateral back and forth and things like derivative. And so, there's a lot of give and gets in there but accretive for the quarter.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research US LP","Okay. Great. Thanks very much.","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, Harvey.","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning, Jim.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Maybe just circling back to equities in China, we've had a \u2013 obviously as you pointed out, a big selloff and most of you and your peers have talking about equities being driven by strength in Asia. Have you seen any change in the environment and activity levels given the big selloff, or has that just helped \u2013 the volatility helped? Just trying to think through how that should be thought of going forward in terms of the equity franchise.","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So again, whenever you see these kind of market reactions, obviously, it has some impact in terms of how clients think through their portfolios. It's more isolated, obviously, to the onshore market. And I think that \u2013 at this stage, I would describe it as being pretty fluid and dynamic with respect to the near term.","I think longer term, what we're really focused on is the extent to which the recent events, do they really have a significant negative impact from an economic perspective or in terms of the liberalization policies, because obviously we have a very big focus on China, a big commitment there.","And our early read of all this is that it's not going to have a big \u2013 when we talk to our research folks, it's not going to have a big impact on the local economy, and we don't expect a major change in sort of the focus on liberalization. And given everything China's done, maybe we should expect as they go through this, there were (39:51) going to be growing pains from year to year, but the long term trend feels okay to us. From a...","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Yeah, that's \u2013 okay. That's helpful. And maybe just circling back to the \u2013 I know it's early days on the lending side, but historically, you guys have shied away from retail risk, right, with regulatory and higher legal risk. This seems to be a bit of a departure from that historical viewpoint. So could you maybe just walk us through your \u2013 clearly there's an opportunity to make money, but the question is how you view the potentially higher risk in a retail lending format?","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So we've always been very cautious, and you're right to point that out. Now we do have millions of clients that touch us in our investment management business through our mutual funds every day. And so they're actually a big part of what we do. And when we think about it, obviously, we're going to move very cautiously in the space and make sure we get things right, because you're right to point out that, like any new business, there are risks and we want to make sure that we work with the consumers and the regulators in absolutely a first-class and best-class way. And so \u2013 but again, too early for us to identify any specific parts of the market. But we'll be back to you with more details again down the road.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.","Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, Harvey.","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey. Good morning, Brennan.","Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","So first question, you made some reference to it earlier when you talked a little bit about pricing, but it looks like we're seeing some momentum in your Prime Brokerage business. Clearly, the current quarter was a bit seasonal. But could you give some color to that? Is some of it down to pricing? Is it down to other factors? Maybe, could you help us out a little around there?","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I really think there's two drivers. The biggest driver is just the quality of the franchise. And so, we've been a beneficiary of getting balances just because of the \u2013 really the longstanding history and our involvement in this business, and it's global for us. But pricing is an important input, but it's not the primary driver of the performance.","Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for that. And on I&L, pretty solid, especially given some of the action we saw in markets this quarter. Can you \u2013 was a lot of it harvesting? Were there any particular regions that contributed? For example, was Asia a contributor in the quarter on the I&L line?","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, in terms of I&L, and why don't I just run through it, I can run through it from the debt line through the equity line. So in the debt line we had $547 million, roughly $550 million in revenues in the quarter. And remember, I underscore for you there that roughly $225 million of that is interest income, okay, and the rest is gains in sales.","In the equity line, of the $1.25 billion, roughly a third of that actually comes from public market shares that we own, in entities we've already taken public. And so there you're just seeing the idiosyncratic performance of the portfolio. And another third \u2013 and I'll just break it down for you in thirds \u2013 a third is the public portfolio performance. A third is things that we refer to as event-driven, like actually taking a company public or making a sale, and the other third is performance-driven. And so the idiosyncratic nature of the portfolio, the team is just doing a very good job here.","Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Terrific. Thanks for that color, Harvey.","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.","Brian M. Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great. Thank you. Hey, Harvey, earlier you mentioned that you saw that liquidity was challenged in parts of the market when you were talking about the FICC business. Can you give a little bit further color as to maybe what regions and which products that we saw the liquidity dry up?","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, it was most challenging in Europe. The credit market in particular, and let's just say the spread sensitive product, the markets aren't as deep there, obviously, as they are in the United States. And then, with all the issues with Greece, liquidity was quite challenging for all of our clients, and quite challenging for market makers.","Brian M. Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. And then also in Europe, are you impacted by the UK bank tax and the higher \u2013 it looked like \u2013 if you look at the Goldman Sachs International?","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, so it's an important part of our business, obviously, given our presence in Europe. Too early for me to quantify anything for you, but obviously the tax rate's going up over there.","Brian M. Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","But is that $2 billion that you had in profit on ordinary activity before taxes in Goldman Sachs International the right number to look at when you're thinking about the potential impact on tax rates?","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I have to come back to you on that in terms of exactly the number you look at. I believe the answer to that is yes, but why don't I have Dane follow up with you, and we'll make sure we reconcile that for you.","Brian M. Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Harvey, a couple of follow-ups, please. On your non-comp, core non-comp expenses, it looks like they came in under the consensus estimate by about $120 million this quarter. Should we consider all of that improvement to be core, or did some of it perhaps relate to slowing volume or activity over the course of the period?","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, not driven by slowing activity. Any changes in non-comp that you're seeing away, obviously, from the legacy charge, that would have to do with impairments that we might take from time-to-time, is the real driver there.","Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. And in terms of the incentive fees in the Investment Management segment, I'm sorry if I missed this earlier, but did you explain why they were so strong in this quarter, because that's not typically seasonally the case?","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So there's always two drivers to incentive fees. There's going to be the normal or what we'll call year-end incentive fees that you're used to seeing. And then there are fund specific events where we've above a certain performance metric and then we'll begin to recognize those fees. And so this is very fund specific in terms of this quarter.","Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. And just lastly, one of the metrics that we, and I imagine others use to gain some insight into the M&A outlook is the index of CEO Confidence which has been generally moving in a straight line up until recently where it took a dip down. I'm guessing may be because of Greece and other macro events, but I'm wondering does that index accurately reflect the tenor of conversations that you've been having with \u2013 in corporate board rooms over the past few weeks?","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So when we talk to our M&A bankers, the momentum in the advisor side of the business feels very strong. The CEOs and boards are obviously going to incorporate all the relevant news and so not surprising to me that when you see Greece dominating the headlines and lots of volatility in the markets that you might see some dip in confidence. But in terms of the degree of conversations we're having in the activity levels, it feels quite good. And you see that halfway through the year, in announced transactions, the Investment Banking team is actually we have announced $112 billion plus of transactions, actually more than the next competitor. And so the dialogue for us with our clients is pretty robust right now.","Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Richard Bove with Rafferty Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets, LLC","Good morning.","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Dick.","Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets, LLC","Hi. This is more of an accounting question. Basically, your Investment Banking was up quarter-over-quarter, commissions and fees were up, your principal transactions were up, and obviously there was a big jump in your debt underwriting. And yet there was almost a $200 million drop in your net interest income. And I'm just wondering why that would be? what are the accounting recognition that would allow that to happen?","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So you're looking at the GAAP income statement, Dick, obviously. And that has a lot to do with under the GAAP rules, how we have to treat certain hedges versus the portfolios. We have to break out certain hedges and move them into the market making business. So it ends up being a net offset.","Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets, LLC","I see. So this is interest income loss on hedging?","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","(48:48) The hedges are hedging parts of the portfolio, so you might get a decrease in the underlying, for example, the income being driven by the portfolio, but then you pick it up in the hedges offsetting that portfolio in the market making business.","Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets, LLC","Okay. But the market making in the FICC side of the business was down 49% so...","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Correct. That may be completely unrelated to the interest component. That's why in the script, Dick, I break out for you in the investing and lending segment, that net interest income was $225 million in the lending businesses to try and clarify it. I'm happy to have Dane walk you through it but it's an accounting aspect.","Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets, LLC","Okay. And then the second question would be, basically, I understand trading is not totally related to underwriting, but when you have such an incredibly strong increase in underwriting of a certain segment like that, and at the same point in time the FICC income goes down fairly substantially, it would suggest that what you're underwriting is something that isn't traded?","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, I wouldn't draw that conclusion. Usually the secondary activity flows for a long period of time, Dick. I think it's hard to draw those kind of conclusions in an individual quarter. I think if you look at our that debt underwriting activity in the first quarter, it wasn't as strong as the second quarter, but yet the FICC results were stronger. And so, if you look at FICC, for example, on a year-to-date basis, it's down. But the second quarter was definitely tougher for us, Dick.","Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets, LLC","Okay. All right. Thank you very much.","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning, Steve.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","So, Harvey, given the challenging market making backdrop that you experienced in 2Q, I was wondering how that informed your thinking around the issue of trading liquidity more broadly. And I might be interested in hearing some of your thoughts regarding the recent feedback that we've heard from regulators as well as some of the results based on their recently-conducted studies.","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, obviously, there has been a whole host of discussion around liquidity in the markets. And I think in the end, I think it leaves us quite frankly all with more questions more than answers. I think you can point to some very specific parts of the market where you can say regulation has impacted liquidity.","I think, the best example of that is the government bond repo market. I think it's hard after that to point to a specific regulation and say, oh, this regulation has impacted liquidity in this market. That doesn't mean it's not happening. I think it's just hard to quantify. I think the repo market you can easily quantify it. You can see the reduction in repo commitment from various banks, including ourselves, and you can see over quarter-end how repo spreads react.","By the way, to me that looks like that's an intended desire by the regulators. They wanted people to either reprice or shrink that business. And so I think away from that the reason why this is difficult is because it's a question of really what is the multi-year accumulation of regulation?","Things being pushed more electronically, inability to hold as much balance sheet, increasing RWAs, all these things so vocal. But I think these things reveal themselves over many years. But obviously, you can't have as much regulation as we've had and not have some unintended consequences. I think it's just the cost of regulation. Doesn't mean the regulation is not good.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Understood. And maybe just switching gears for a moment. Just wanted to dig into some your comments that you made on the debt underwriting side. You cited strong DCM really driven by higher leverage finance activity, which is certainly a nice surprise just given some of the regulatory pressures in that area. I wanted to get a better sense of how you're thinking about the outlook for the business more broadly. And one of the questions we hear most often is whether the recent pickup in activity is more tactical driven versus a reflection of what could be sustained strength in that business.","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, you're right to ask that question and the question's been coming up for the last couple years, obviously, as we've gone through this part of the cycle with tighter credit spreads and lower rates. And we talked about this. If the M&A cycle remains strong, then obviously that will be a positive tailwind to the underwriting business. And it was for us. When I said leverage finance activity, I could have said leverage finance activity facilitated in part by our advisory business. So if the M&A backdrop continues the way it feels today \u2013 but I think M&A will help.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","All right. That's it for me. Thanks for taking my questions.","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Steven. Take care.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.","Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks. Good morning.","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning, Devin.","Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC","Most have been asked and answered, but just a question on the market volatility. We hear the term healthy volatility versus unhealthy volatility in the market. So can you help us think about what you think could drive that healthy volatility that seem to be missing? It seems like every time we have one of these macro flare-ups, like Greece as an example, we just see more extreme market moves which I think would be put in the unhealthy bucket. So any perspective there would be appreciated.","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think in an effort to overly simplify this, I think healthy volatility is volatility in which client activity picks up and liquidity exists, clients feel confident. Unhealthy volatility is the reverse of that where clients get more conservative and they derisk. And so as we go through these periods, the general trend, obviously, feels like volatility is picking up in a healthy way, but that doesn't mean from time to time we're not going to hit these kind of pockets.","Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. And then just secondly, on debt underwriting again, not to beat a dead horse, but just given the strength there, and speaking to the leverage finance market, do you feel like you're gaining market share there doing transactions that maybe others are moving away from, or does it just feel like you're benefiting with the rising tide as M&A is picking up?","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, no, there's nothing we're doing. We're being pretty conservative in terms of our thought process in terms of the business. And our risk-taking is being very prudent. It really is all about M&A activity.","Again, as I mentioned to you, I talked about at the announce (55:42), but when you look at the completed lead tables (55:44), obviously, our team is really in the center of all the M&A dialogs.","Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC","Yup. Got it. Thanks, Harvey.","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","At this time there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.","Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. Since there are no more questions, I just want to take a moment to thank all of you for joining the call. Hopefully I and other members of senior management will see many of you in the coming months.

I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs' Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Also, this call is being recorded today, Wednesday, January 18, 2012. Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.","Dane Holmes","Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Director of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. ","Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm's belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain and outside of the firm's control. The firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly, materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended December 2010. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets and global core excess. And you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that is posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com.","This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent.","Our Chief Financial Officer, David Viniar, will now review the firm's results. David?","David A. Viniar","Thanks, Dane. I'd like to thank all of you for listening today. I'll give an overview of our fourth quarter and full year results and then take your questions.","Full year net revenues for 2011 were $28.8 billion. Net earnings were $4.4 billion. Earnings per diluted share were $4.51, and our return on common equity was 3.7%. Excluding the impact of a $1.6 billion preferred dividend associated with our repayment of the Berkshire Hathaway preferred stock, earnings per diluted share were $7.46 and our return on common equity is 5.9%. Fourth quarter net revenues were $6 billion. Net earnings were $1 billion, and earnings per diluted share were $1.84. ","Over the course of 2011, the macroeconomic picture was clouded by several growing concerns. While the broader marketplace first began to evaluate the economic challenges facing the Euro zone in 2010, the market's focus and concern accelerated meaningfully during 2011 and persists into 2012. The discussion evolved from largely a regional consideration into a significant global issue, as market participants became increasingly worried about the secondary implications of a potential sovereign default. These underlying macroeconomic concerns have been exacerbated by growing skepticism regarding the willingness of the global political infrastructure to address the economic risk confronting the system, which was highlighted by the political debate within the United States on raising the debt ceiling.","In response to these dynamics, market volatility increased significantly over the course of the year. While the S&P 500 ended 2011 essentially flat, prices were volatile, with the index's valuation ranging from up 8% in the spring to down nearly 13% in the fall. Not surprisingly, the broader environment led our clients across a variety of businesses to be materially more risk averse. The firm's perspective on managing its risk exposures mirrored the sentiment of the broader market, and consequently, our risk exposures remained low in 2011. Ultimately, macroeconomic concerns, heightened market volatility, lower corporate activity and decreased risk appetite among our institutional clients translated into fundamentally lower level of revenue opportunities over the course of the year, hampering our returns. While we're disappointed in our results this year, we remain firmly committed to supporting our client franchise, helping clients navigate the challenges ahead and managing our firm with a long-term orientation.","I'll now review each of our businesses. Investment Banking produced fourth quarter net revenues of $857 million, up 10% from the third quarter, primarily due to an increase in underwriting revenues following a weak third quarter. For the full year, Investment Banking net revenues were $4.4 billion, down 9% from 2010, due to the more challenging macro backdrop. Within Investment Banking, fourth quarter Advisory revenues were $470 million, down 10% from the third quarter. ","Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced M&A globally for 2011. We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the fourth quarter, including Foster's $12.3 billion sale to SABMiller, Global Crossing's $3.2 billion sale to Level 3 Communications and AGL Resources' $3.2 billion merger with Nicor. We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the fourth quarter, including Entergy's $5.6 billion spinoff and subsequent merger of its electric transmission business with ITC Holdings, Statoil's $4.7 billion acquisition of Brigham Exploration Co. and Health Spring's $3.8 billion sale to Cigna.","Fourth quarter underwriting net revenues were $387 million, up 50% sequentially, as new issuance activity improved relative to a more challenging third quarter environment. Equity underwriting revenues of $191 million more than doubled from the third quarter, reflecting higher volumes and improved market share. Goldman Sachs was ranked first in global equity and equity-related common stock offerings and IPOs for 2011. Net underwriting revenues increased 17% to $196 million, reflecting an improvement in high-yield issuance compared to a particularly difficult third quarter. ","During the fourth quarter, we participated in noteworthy underwriting transactions, including Chow Tai Fook's $2 billion initial public offering, Michael Kors' $1.1 billion initial public offering and UPC's $1.25 billion combination high-yield notes and term loan offering. Our Investment Banking backlog decreased compared with the end of the third quarter but was higher than year-end 2010.","Let me now turn to Institutional Client Services, which is comprised of FICC and Equities Client Execution, Commissions and Fees and Securities services. Net revenues were $3.1 billion in the fourth quarter, down 25% from the third quarter. Net revenue generation within FICC and Equities Client Execution declined as client activity was seasonally slower and macro concerns continue to weigh on sentiment. Full year net revenues of $17.3 billion for Institutional Client Services were down 21% relative to 2010, as a result of client risk aversion and difficult market-making conditions. ","FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter, down 21% sequentially. Commodities and foreign exchange revenues increased relative to the third quarter, although client activity levels within both businesses remained relatively muted. Our rates business decreased sequentially as macro trends remain in focus and client flows decreased into year end. Credit and mortgages remain challenging as activity levels declined across most products and a divergence between cash and derivative pricing impacted hedging and inventory management. For the full year, FICC Client Execution net revenues of $9 billion were down 34% from 2010, as the challenging European backdrop led to reduced client risk taking.","In Equities, which includes Equities Client Execution, Commissions and Fees and Security Services, net revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.7 billion, down 27% sequentially. Equities Client Execution revenues were down 42% to $526 million due to decreased client activity, particularly in derivative products. Commissions and Fees were $782 million, down 23% from the third quarter on lower market volumes. Security services' net revenues of $385 million were down 6% sequentially given seasonally lower activity levels. For the full year, Equities produced net revenues of $8.3 billion, up 2% from 2010.","Turning to Risk. Average daily value at Risk in the fourth quarter was $135 million, higher than the third quarter, due to significantly greater volatility in the interest rate category.","Now I'll review Investing & Lending, which produced revenues of $872 million in the fourth quarter. The firm's Investing & Lending activities across various asset classes, primarily including debt securities and loans and equities -- and equity securities are included in this segment. These activities include both direct investing and investing through funds as well as lending activities. Our investment in ICBC produced a $388 million gain in the quarter. Other equity investment generated a $384 million gain, largely reflecting gains on public equity investments. Losses from debt securities and loans were $221 million, driven by losses on relationship loans, including the effect of hedges. Other revenues of $321 million consist primarily of operating revenues from our consolidated investment entities. For the full year, Investing & Lending generated net revenues of $2.1 billion, driven by $1.1 billion in gains from other equity investments and $1.4 billion of revenues from other investments, which was partially offset by $517 million in losses from ICBC investment.","In Investment Management, we reported fourth quarter net revenues of $1.3 billion, up 3% from the third quarter, as a result of $141 million in incentive fees generated from the firm's alternative asset products. Management and other fees were 3% lower sequentially at $1 billion. For the full year, Investment Management net revenues were $5 billion, relatively flat from 2010 levels. During the fourth quarter, assets under management increased $7 billion to $828 billion, largely due to market appreciation equities. On a full year basis, assets under management declined by 1%.","Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which include salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits, declined 21% to $12.2 billion for 2011 and translated into a compensation in net revenue ratio of approximately 42%. Within compensation and benefits expense, current year discretionary compensation declined significantly more than revenues. ","Fourth quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.6 billion, 5% lower than the third quarter. Brokerage clearing and exchange fees declined on lower equity client volumes. In addition, we recognized the U.K. bank levy for the first 3 quarters of 2011 during the third quarter. These reductions were offset by approximately $170 million of impairments on consolidated investments within depreciation and amortization. We also made a $78 million donation to Goldman Sachs Gives, our donor-advised charitable fund. Compensation was reduced to fund this contribution. This amount is in addition to prior year contributions made to Goldman Sachs Gives. For the full year, non-compensation expenses were essentially flat.","Total staff at year-end was approximately 33,300, down 7% from year-end 2010. Our effective tax rate was 28% for 2011, down from 30.3% for the first 9 months. The decrease in tax rate was primarily due to an increase in permanent benefits as a percentage of earnings and the mix of earnings. During the quarter, we repurchased 9.2 million shares of common stock for a total cost of $908 million. For the full year, we repurchased 47 million shares for a total cost of approximately $6 billion.","The uncertain operating environment creates both challenges and opportunities for the firm. In the current environment, the strength of our financial and competitive positioning provides protection against potential tail events, as well as the flexibility to be proactive if opportunities arise. The challenges stemming from reduced market demand for risk capital requires a focused approach to our capital allocation process, and we continue to monitor the sizing of each of our businesses to ensure we're appropriately managing our resources. ","The more muted operating environment has also intensified our focus on expenses. While it is not possible to cut expenses as a means to prosperity, we understand the benefits of a proactive and disciplined approach, particularly if the operating environment remains challenging. In the second quarter of 2011, we launched an internal initiative to identify areas where we can operate more efficiently and originally targeted $1.2 billion in savings. We're currently targeting $1.4 billion in savings, and we'll closely monitor our expense run rate and make further adjustments as necessary. ","The uncertainty facing the macroeconomic environment and reduced opportunity set for the financial services industry has increased the importance placed on franchise strength from the perspective of the depth and diversity of our firm's businesses as well as its relative competitive positioning. We believe our franchise is incredibly strong and growing, particularly in its global scope. Our people remain a critical component in creating, maintaining and expanding our franchise and in our ability to create long-term shareholder value. The combination of our strong client franchise and our talented and dedicated global team favorably positions the firm to effectively navigate the current challenges.","Despite the difficult operating environment, we believe that significant opportunities exist through the continued expansion of our global footprint and responding to shifting competitive dynamics stemming from reduced risk capacity in Europe. In the near term, we remain committed to managing our capital expenses as efficiently as possible while maintaining our world-class franchise and our investment-critical initiatives. Over the longer term, we remain committed to driving shareholder value by providing our institutional client base with unparalleled advice and execution, coupled with the platform and the people to offer global, full-service solutions in an increasingly interconnected and complex world. ","With that, I'd like to thank you again for listening today, and I'm now happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with the Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So just to follow up on the comments that you made right at the end, and I'm totally respectful of the need to maintain a very strong platform, but clearly fit for you and for a lot of others is seeing a pretty sustained run of considerably lower revenue generation than when you put a lot of the infrastructure in place. And given some of the regulatory outlook, lot of it, granted, is still uncertain, but with Volcker and Basel III and everything coming in, I'm just wondering how you're thinking about balancing the infrastructure you have and where you might consider resizing.","David A. Viniar","Guy, that's the -- that's one of the most critical questions and very difficult one to answer. We've all been doing this for a long time and we've seen downturns before. Every time you're in one, it feels like it's never going end and that the world is different now. I wouldn't say, for example, that the environment feels worse than it felt in the fall of 2008 or necessarily after the tech bubble burst, or necessarily after the fall of 1998. So is it cyclical? Is it secular? That's a very difficult question to answer. As you saw, we try to be very disciplined on expenses. We cut headcount last year. We will continue to review the environment as we go forward. We'll continue to see where regulation openly comes out and what it will mean for the opportunities. And we'll try and balance exactly the things you said, the strength of the franchise and the global opportunity set with the current environment, and make sure we're sized appropriately. There's no scientific answer to it, though.","Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess the follow-up to that, given some of the opportunities that might be bubbling up from the obvious weakness of competitors across the pond is what do you see happening there? And can you give us a little bit of color on whether you're seeing opportunities already, and what type of opportunities you're seeing?","David A. Viniar","Well, again, it's a little early to tell, largely because the opportunity set just isn't that great because of the macro uncertainties. Most of our clients are still very much in a wait-and-see mode, but we're starting to see some glimmers of opportunities. We're starting to see some assets being sold from troubled institutions. We're also starting to see a little bit less competition in the few transactions that are out there. So from a competitive position, it actually feels pretty good.","Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And maybe that segues us into just any commentary you can give us, granted that it's very early going here in the first quarter, but how it's feeling in January to date, both relative to what we saw last quarter, but also comparable period last year?","David A. Viniar","Well, I mean, if you take as a given, like an hour of caveats, of it only being the first 2 weeks, of it being early, if things can change, I can go on and on and on, it's not a high bar. But first 2 weeks of January certainly feel a lot better than the December and November period.","Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And versus the first couple of weeks of last year?","David A. Viniar","Probably kind of about the same as the beginning of last year.","Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that helps. Just one final question. Can you give us an estimate of your Basel III-basis Tier 1 common?","David A. Viniar","Yes. Again, with a lot of caveats, rules not done, lots of estimates, all of that, if we did it at the end of the fourth quarter, it would be a little bit under 8%. And if we roll forward taking just the consensus estimates, which you guys do, and just passive roll-off of some of the correlation and other structure credit, you get to, by the end of 2013, a little bit below 11%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So you won the buying back $6 billion of stock in the year, but net earnings pre the preferred dividend was $4.4 billion. How does that work -- and that doesn't include the Berkshire preferred buybacks. So just curious how that factors into CCAR and understanding the huge volatility that can happen in earnings for you guys.","David A. Viniar","I'm not sure I understood the question, Glenn. Sorry.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I thought -- I apologize. I thought that there was a limitation on a payout of a combined basis on dividends and buybacks based on your forward earnings projections as part of CCAR. Do I understand that wrong?","David A. Viniar","We put in what we want to do for CCAR and if that tells us yes or no. I don't think you should expect that it will be a long-term sustainable way we do things of buying back more than earnings. I don't think you should expect that to happen a lot going forward.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. Then other small thing. Book was down a drop in the quarter, function of higher share count, even though you bought back. Is that a stock issuance thing, I would think?","David A. Viniar","It was divesting of previously issued shares.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And you had mentioned the current year comp was down significantly more than the revenues, even though total comp wasn't. Is there any...","David A. Viniar","Total comp and benefits were.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Correct.","David A. Viniar","Right.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Is the prior period deferred becoming a larger piece of the GAAP number? And is there any point where that becomes a bigger issue? In other words, you're constantly buying back to dig out of the previous hole. It's something that I've seen at some other.","David A. Viniar","It's actually been about flat for the last couple of years.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So no big change this year in the deferred vesting or percentages.","David A. Viniar","No. It was roughly flat year-over-year.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay, cool. And then maybe one last one, David. Funding cost right now, I mean, you guys have been able to get off some reasonable deals all-in, especially some of the 50-year paper. But funding cost all-in for the industry are just a lot higher. How do you balance knowing what to issue now versus hanging out, and what happens if funding cost stay here as that rolls to the balance sheet? Is that a big impact?","David A. Viniar","Obviously, we'd rather have lower funding cost than higher funding cost. But as you also know, we've talked about it, we don't do a lot of characterizing. I mean, that's not where we make money. So while certainly, we're not happy with higher funding costs, it really has a more marginal impact on our returns because of the way we think about doing transactions. And I think we are -- we would -- we're, as you know, very conservative, and we'd probably continue funding at higher rates for quite a while if rates stay there.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. Last, last one. It's a quickie. E.U.-related concerns versus 3 months ago, better, worse, post-LTRO?","David A. Viniar","Boy. I'd say a tiny bit better, largely because of exactly what you mentioned. The LTRO showed a willingness to certainly, at least, make sure the banks are on solid footing. And a lot of work still to be done with the sovereign, so I'd say a tiny bit better.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Roger Freeman with Barclays Capital.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just back on headcount expense reduction. Do you have severance costs for the fourth quarter? It looks like there were 900 or so people came out, which was generally more than we were expecting. And I'm just curious to -- was there a mix weighting between the senior partners versus other employees?","David A. Viniar","So severance costs were -- for the full year, they were around $250 million, and for the fourth quarter, only around $50 million. So it wasn't that big -- it's why we didn't talk about it separately. It's just part of our comp expense. And as far as headcount reductions, it's really across-the-board, pretty much across the pyramid of the firm.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And just to clarify on the $1.4 billion in targeted savings. Is that still -- did you achieve all that through the efforts in 2011, or is there still some to go?","David A. Viniar","We achieved most of it. There's a small amount left to go in 2012, but most of it was done by the end of 2011.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, all right. Then on Basel III, just following up there. One, do you think that active mitigation ultimately could bring that 11% number meaningfully higher? And second, how are you charging the debts for capital at this point? Is it on a Basel I basis or Basel III or some combination?","David A. Viniar","On your first question, I think active mitigation can bring the 11% higher. I'm not sure I can answer the question yet how meaningfully. We're still doing work on that. As far as how we're charging the debt, that's a little bit of a complicated question. And we're working through that now, and it -- there's no one-size-fits-all yet. And we have to be careful. As you know, Basel III does not kick in for quite a while. And quite a bit of what we do is very short dated. And so we don't want to charge debts on a Basel III basis, have them turn down profitable opportunities that would be long gone from our balance sheet, long before Basel III ever kicks in. So we're really taking into consideration the tenure of what we do and trying to figure out what capital regime we're going to be under. And it's still, I would say, we're going through a transition process here.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, just bigger picture. Do you think about expanding ROE longer term? How would you rank order the buckets that can get you there, top line, profitability and the balance sheet, stock buybacks, and maybe how big do you think each of them are relative to each other?","David A. Viniar","I think, in some ways, that's an easy question. I rank the top line growth as numbers 1 through 10, and then we can talk about everything else afterwards. And so, yes, we're going to be prudent in managing our capital. Yes, we're going to be prudent in managing our expenses, but our ROE growth is going to largely be driven by growing our revenues, expanding our footprint, expanding our client base and growing the firm. But we're not -- as I said in my remarks, we're not going to cut away the prosperity, but we will try and size the firm appropriately for the environment.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","On relationship lending, there's been a debate about the mark-to-market versus held-to-maturity treatment. You've always been a champion of a good mark-to-market discipline. But I was just hoping to get your sense of, one, where we are in that debate; and two, how does that potential capital treatment impact your CCAR results for 2012.","David A. Viniar","Okay. So it's still something that we're considering. We're looking at the accounting treatment for just, what I would call, a portion of the relationship long commitments. As you mentioned, it won't affect the current submission of CCAR at all, but it is -- the consideration is being driven by the more owners capital treatment for the fact that the same assets held on mark-to-market versus a held-for-investment basis are different. I mean, it's much more onerous for mark-to-market. So that's what driving even our consideration. You should know, and I will use this word, we are still fanatical believers in mark-to-market. Substantially, all of our assets today are mark-to-market. Our risk is managed on a mark-to-market basis. And whatever we conclude on, what I'll call, a very small portion of assets, just relationship lending, those statements will still be true. Substantially, all of our assets will be mark-to-market, and we will manage all of our risk on a mark-to-market basis. So nothing will change there.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then separately on the Volcker Rule. As we come up on the end of this extended comment period, just hoping to get your view. What specifically would you like to see changed? And what would you deem to be a positive outcome as we come on to July and later in this year?","David A. Viniar","Look, Howard, that's, again, a very hard question to answer. As you know, the rule is written with 1,000 questions. So there's a lot that has to change before the rule is done. We want to make sure that the market-making rules are not written in such a way that they make it so onerous to -- for us, and not just us, but for all the firms, to continue our market-making function and that liquidity in the markets dries up and it hurts the growth in the capital markets. It hurts overall growth. It hurts our clients. It hurts liquidity. It cost more to do business that the compliance regime is so onerous, and those costs have to be passed on. We just -- we want to make sure that nothing prevents free flow of capital and the growth of the U.S. capital markets.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then final one for me. Over the past few years, you've been actively investing in the emerging markets franchise of the firm, getting a first-mover advantage. I mean, how much have you rein that back or thinking about reining that back as we head into just an uncertain 2012?","David A. Viniar","I guess, what I would say is just given the environment, we've moderated our pace of investment, but we're still investing. We continue to think that the growth markets are going to be a great place of growth for Goldman Sachs. As I said before, it's growth which is going to drive our ROE. While, clearly, it's not going to be a straight line up. We continue to -- we've talked before about that most important thing for us is growth in GDP, and we think the GDP growth in the growth markets is going to be stronger than the developed markets. That's not to say we're not investing in places like the United States. We are. But we're going to invest faster in the growth markets. But in this environment, a more moderated pace.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","David, maybe one follow-up on expenses. When we think about that $1.4 billion, obviously, it's tough when we think about year-over-year. But when we assume that revenues are flat in 2012, all else equal, should we be expecting the full expense base to be down that $1.4 billion? I guess, another way of saying it is just how much investment would be going on to offset that?","David A. Viniar","Well, again, it's going to be a hard number to track. That assumed no change in compensation. Obviously, it was a big change in compensation in 2011 as well. So obviously, expenses are down even more than that when you add in compensation, so that's going to be a big driver as well. But from a comp flat basis, that $1.4 billion is going to be there. What goes from there, we'll just have to wait and see.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just getting back to the top line. I think when you look across the businesses, whether it's cyclical or structural, it just feels like everything's fairly negative. Two things or 2 questions on that part. When you look at some of the firms pulling back in certain businesses, are you starting to see some market share opportunity or any changes in pricing? And then when you look across the capital market businesses, particularly in FICC, are there trends that you're seeing that are more structural growth versus what the current environment feels like, in one that comes up would be maybe in Europe into the shift from bank loans to maybe bonds in terms of funding or financing corporations? But any areas where you're still seeing some structural growth despite all the pressures.","David A. Viniar","Right. So on the first part, on the competitive situation, yes, we are seeing the effects of some of our competitors pulling away. But it's still very muted because there just aren't that many opportunities yet. And so have we seen change in pricing? I would say, even towards the end of last year, we saw a couple of blocked trades where I would tell you the pricing was a lot more reasonable than what you usually see in December when people are buying market share. But it was not enough examples for me to tell you pricing has changed. It was a couple of examples, but that's all that was out there. So the data points -- it was all the data points there were, but there weren't enough of them for me to reach a conclusion that pricing has changed. So that's kind of where that is. As far as trends and structural growth, again, things are so muted, have been so muted over the last half of last year that it's very hard to pick those out. I think when the world gets better, I think we'll probably see some of the things you're talking about. But it's hard to tell right now.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then last one, just any update on European exposures. And then on the tax rate, just for the quarter, obviously low, and I think you mentioned mix. But just going forward, any changes there besides mix?","David A. Viniar","Our European exposure continues to be quite low. For the -- our total credit exposure for the 5 periphery countries on, what we'll call, a gross-funded basis with gross funded being total exposure less only U.S. Treasury and cash collateral that we hold. So that's the only offset. It's about -- total, about $3.9 billion as of year end. And net basis, which includes offsets for CDS hedges, only where the CDS is collateralized and only where the CDS is not from a bank in the same country it's hedging, then you get down to about $2.3 billion. So our exposure there continues to be extremely modest.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And anything on the tax rate?","David A. Viniar","Oh, I'm sorry, the tax rate. No. There's nothing particular there. Obviously, earnings were lower. The mix led to lower tax rate. I would not expect a 28% tax rate next year. I expect to see more in the -- more on the low 30s as it's been.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan.","Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","David, first question is regarding management changes. If you could just address the topic in terms of why these changes were introduced.","David A. Viniar","Sure. Look, I would tell you, and this is something that I've spoken with many of you about over the last year or so, I would call this normal progression at Goldman Sachs. As you know, fewer than normal partners have retired over the last 4 years. That was especially true at the senior ranks. I mean, people at Goldman Sachs are -- have been very loyal. And through both, what I call, a financial crisis and reputational issues, the senior people of Goldman Sachs did not leave. The normal tenure, average tenure of a partner in Goldman Sachs, as a partner, is about 8 years. You tend to find 15% to 20% of the partnership turning over every 2 years. It's been like that almost through our history, and you saw far less than that turning over, over the last 4 years. And I think what you're seeing now, as I said, normal progression. David Heller and Ed Eisler, the 2 co-heads of Securities Division, who both announced their retirement, are 2 fantastic people. They are as good as any 2 people in the industry, but we have equally good people behind them. You saw we announced that Isabelle Ealet will become a division head, and she's fantastic. And it's the natural progression of people retiring and a very, very strong bench moving up.","Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, very clear. And the second question is relating to your earlier comment, and please correct me if I understood it wrongly, but you mentioned that first quarter year-to-date seems to have started similar to last year. And if I look at issuance volumes, it looks significantly lower globally. What would you say is driving the quarter? And then also volumes in some areas look lower as well.","David A. Viniar","Look, again, very -- and please, don't read anything into what I say about 2 weeks. I mean, we're literally 2 weeks in. Yes, I think issuance volume is low, but you've seen some clients come back and being a little more willing to take risks. You've also seen a reasonable rally in the equity markets, and so I think those things have been helpful.","Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And if I look at 2011, you could argue it was 2 different worlds, the first half versus the second half, especially in fixed income. And looking into 2012, how would you think about fixed income, more rolled off of the second half or more that kind of environment or more the first half?","David A. Viniar","Well, first of all, in 2011, I would actually -- I agree with you. It's 2 different worlds. But I would say it was almost the first quarter and the last 3 quarters as opposed to the first half and the last half. And as far as 2012, I wish I had a crystal ball. As you know, I'm very hesitant to predict and never claimed to be good at predicting. We just don't know. There's still a lot of macro headwinds out there, with the biggest one being Europe. And ultimately, what ends up happening in Europe and whether that some of those sovereign issues get resolved, I think is going to drive a lot. On the flip side, as you know, since -- probably since the summer, virtually all of the U.S. macro data has been -- economic data has been a little bit better than expected. So you kind of have some outstanding factors there, and how it plays out, we're just going to have to wait and see.","Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And it seems to me that one of the issues which also came up in your conference calls regularly is the issue of credit, which was much more difficult to trade over the last 3 quarters. Do you think there's a change in the environment in the credit world, or do you think it's similar? And what's the structural change, would you say, in credit?","David A. Viniar","I don't think there was -- has necessarily been a structural change. I think it's too early to tell if there's been a change in the environment from just 2 weeks. One of the big issue in credit was big divergence in the basis between cash and derivatives, very unusual divergence with -- made it very, very hard to manage. I expect that, that will normalize at some point. But when that point is going to be, I just don't know.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Fiona Swaffield with Royal Bank of Canada.","Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just 2 issues I had. One is that rollover, some maturity for 2012. I wondered whether you could talk through what you've raised already this year in terms of senior and how you're going to manage the rollover. I thought it was $26 billion. And the secondary is just on the cost side, the $1.4 billion. Historically, you've accrued the stock compensation to revenue ratio kind of on an even basis at 3 quarters. I'm just wondering should we kind of expect some step change given there should be some of these cost benefits coming through, or is that something we don't really know until the end of the year with the true-up?","David A. Viniar","Sure. As far as the rollover of our debt, we have -- I think it's roughly $25 billion that matures this year. And we've been in a blackout period so far this year, so we haven't raised any until today. So we'll see going forward. As far as accruals, what we will do is what we've always done, which is we accrue with the comp ratio is our best estimate of where we think our comps are going to be. And then we adjust as we get to year-end when we know what it actually is. And exactly what that's going to be, I don't know yet, but that's how we'll accrue.","Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","But just to check on that last thing. So if you did think that you knew that x of the $1.4 billion is coming through lower, say, fixed cost, then we could see that in a lower comp ratio accrual.","David A. Viniar","If we thought it was going to be lower, it would be lower accrual. But I wouldn't expect that that's necessarily going to happen.","Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And can I just clarify? I think I may have misunderstood. But I think that you said that the comp -- the variable compensation under your control is down more than the revenues, so down more than 26, yet I think you said deferred was flat. I'm trying to work out the moving parts, but I -- maybe I misunderstood.","David A. Viniar","No, I did say it was down significantly more than revenues. That's correct.","Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So what would the other -- if deferred is flat, so i.e. fixed salaries are up a lot, so maybe it's something to do with severance? Is that the moving...","David A. Viniar","Well, no, no, that's -- if deferred comp is flat, and then obviously, the -- and the whole amount was down 21% and part of it was not down at all, then the rest of it has to be down a lot more than 21%.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jeff Harte with Sandler O'Neill.","Jeffrey Harte - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","You mentioned that the backlog was down sequentially but up year-over-year. It seems, for a while now, we've had a very strong supply side kind of the backlog, but a lack of demand or ability to get deals done. Are you seeing the supply side of things still hang on as far as companies are eager to do things? It's just a matter of demand picking up or even -- is even the supply side waning a little bit?","David A. Viniar","I think it's both. I think, for example, and I may have this a little wrong, but I'm not far off, I think filed IPOs are the highest they've ever been, or close to if not the highest they've ever been. And it's just a question of the markets being receptive to the deals, so a lot of that. As far as the M&A backlog, I'd say there's more a lot of dialogue and companies circling each other and talking and wanting to do things. But even on getting things announced until people pull -- are a little bit more confident, I don't think they're going to pull the trigger. So it's a combination of those 2 things.","Jeffrey Harte - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And could you talk a little bit, geographically, about the competitive environment? I'm thinking -- I mean, headcount reductions in the industry certainly seem to be more U.S.-centric. How are some of the emerging markets? I know there are still higher growth areas trending as far as competition for talent and competitors in general.","David A. Viniar","I think there is always high competition for the best talent. Is there the same -- obviously, given the industry slowdown, is there the same level of competition for everyone? The answer is probably no. But for the best people, for the really good talent, there is a high level of competition within -- from our traditional competitors. There's a high level of competition from what you call the shadow banking industry, from other places. And there are -- it's true outside the U.S. and in the U.S.","Jeffrey Harte - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","And have you seen a -- I mean, the competition is always there, but have you seen any kind of a trend change over the last, say, 6 to 8 months where things have been difficult?","David A. Viniar","No.","Jeffrey Harte - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then finally, the relationship lending in the quarter. This is the first time I remember you disclosing how big that loss or the impact was. Is that a function of it not having been material enough before? Is it something new for the way you're accounting? And I'm just wondering why, this quarter, we're hearing about it.","David A. Viniar","It's the former. It was so material within the context of the whole number that we decided that should be disclosed. And before, it wasn't.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of questions. One, kind of housekeeping issue, but it's on the Investing & Lending segment. So the debt marks had the impact of a hedge. And I guess I just wanted to understand how much the hedge impacted the debt section of the I&L both this quarter and last quarter.","David A. Viniar","The hedge on the relationship lending?","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes.","David A. Viniar","In the quarter, although there was a lot of volatility because of the basis between the hedges, as well as versus the cash positions, over the course of the quarter, the hedges had very little -- the hedges versus the marks had very little effect. It was really almost all just the day one marks.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And versus last quarter?","David A. Viniar","I don't have last quarter in front of me. We'll get back to you on that one.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just on capital return. I know you mentioned that you submitted your request. One of the things that I've said looks at is sustainability, predictability of earnings. So I guess, I\u2019m just wondering how you present that to -- how you present your capital request to the fed, given the volatility that we're seeing in the industry right now. Do you just kind of shoot for the low end of the range, or you're just very conservative in your outlook for earnings? I'm just trying to understand how you think through that.","David A. Viniar","We make our best estimate given the economic environment that is prescribed. So the thing that really causes the most volatility in earnings is the economic environment. If you give us an economic environment, if that economic environment actually happens, we can get relatively close on where we're going to come out. Obviously, there's going to be variability. It's not going to be exact. The thing that causes the variability, really, is the change in economic environment. So for a given economic environment, we make our best prediction.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then you mentioned that you've got expectations for common Tier 1 under Basel III going to just under 11% by the end of 2013, which is based, in part, on estimates, right, consensus estimates.","David A. Viniar","Yes.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So to the degree economic environment is still why the consensus estimates comes down and we should expect that you're going to be hitting a lower number than that sub-11% by the end of 2013.","David A. Viniar","Yes. If earnings were lower on that calculation, our ratio would be lower. And if earnings were higher on that calculation, our ratio would be higher.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So just a couple of quick questions. One, a follow-up on one of Glenn's questions here. For the recently submitted CCAR, can you help us understand how you came up with your projection for 2012 pre-provision net revenue, and maybe whether or not the fed has given you any guidance on the numbers that they look at when they come up with their own set of projections for a firm like Goldman?","David A. Viniar","As I mentioned, we -- both the fed gives us certain economic environments, both in a base and a stress case. We also have our own based on conversations with our economists. We come up with our own economic scenario. We then do a very detailed analysis going business by business and what we think our results will be given those economic scenarios, and that's what we submit.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And has the fed given you any color on how they think about it?","David A. Viniar","Well, they gave -- they have economic scenarios as well. So there's ours and their economic scenario. And based on those, we put in submissions on both.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then on a different sort of issue. Given some of the drying up of liquidity in certain fixed income markets with dealers holding less inventory and that oligopolistic nature of institutional fixed income asset management business, do you think that there's an increase in risk that you could end up seeing some disintermediation from the buy side and just using dealers less often and just interacting between each other?","David A. Viniar","Okay. I think that the market-making function that we and others perform is a very, very valuable function for our mutual fund, hedge fund, corporate, et cetera, clients to be able to access markets as quickly as they want to, to be able to get prices on things they want to buy and sell very, very quickly when they want to do it. I think that the ability to do that directly is going to be hard. I think people would have to be set up in a way that they're not set up now to execute at a speed that they're not set up to execute and to have a liquidity that they don't have right now. So I think that the function that we and others perform in providing that liquidity market is going to remain a very valuable function.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a question on your international revenue trends in the fourth quarter. I'm just curious as to -- were they substantially different enough to change the relationship of the international revenues relative to the U.S. revenues in the quarter? And I guess, looking forward, how are you thinking about that relationship over the next year or 2?","David A. Viniar","So look, it's a little hard because of certain factors. So for example, our Asia revenues, as a percentage, were much higher in the fourth quarter than the third quarter, but that's partially because ICBC was up nearly $400 million in the third quarter and down $1 billion -- no, I'm sorry, in the fourth quarter and down $1 billion in the third quarter. So that really accounted for most of the change. As far as kind of a trend, I would expect that -- we've been running for the last few years between 50% and 60% in the U.S. and between 40% and 50% outside U.S. with variability around that, largely because of things that I just talked about, I would expect that to trend more towards 50% in the U.S. or maybe even less and the rest outside U.S.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Right. So that's not very different from what you've been seeing for a while. I guess I'm just curious in the Trading and in Investment Banking businesses, maybe excluding Investing & Lending.","David A. Viniar","I think we'll trend towards a little less than 50% in the U.S. and a little more than 50% outside the U.S.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just a administrative question. In terms of the DVA, CVA effects the quarter, you noted on the release that they were effectively minimal. What benefit did you get this quarter from some of the hedging that you said you did in the third quarter from -- on that exposure?","David A. Viniar","It largely didn't matter. Our spreads were pretty flat quarter-over-quarter. So with or without hedging, it was pretty much -- the whole amount was about $20 million. So it didn't really matter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","So you've had the best loan syndications in the industry, I guess, in about a couple of decades. Is some of that activity reflecting a slot from the capital market to loans, or why are you seeing that?","David A. Viniar","Mike, I missed the beginning of what you said. We've had the best --  I didn't hear what you say is the best something in a few decades. I didn't hear what you said.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","The best loan syndications in the industry in 2 decades. So my question is, are you seeing that in less fixed income or bond issuances or some of those bonds going to loans? Or do you have any color on that?","David A. Viniar","I'm sorry. I'm still confused. The best loan syndications in a couple of decades?","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Yes, the loan syndication activity for the industry in 2011 was some of the highest you've seen in about 20 or 21 years.","David A. Viniar","Okay.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And my question is, are you seeing activity move from capital markets back to loans?","David A. Viniar","Well, yes. I actually think that was largely structural. There was just a lot of cash available for loans. And so I think people took advantage of that. I don't necessarily think that's going to be a trend.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. So you would expect -- no, that's fine. Let me go to the capital question. Where are you leaning right now? Are you leaning toward having higher capital levels for a perception of greater stability of Goldman Sachs, or are you leaning toward, hey, let's buy back a lot more stocks because we're trading below book value?","David A. Viniar","You and I have talked a little bit about this before, Mike. It's a very hard question, and it's not a science. We sit here with our stock price where it is. And as I said to you, I am relatively certain that at some point in the future, we're going to wish we bought back a lot more stock at this price. Yet the flip side is it's a very tough environment, and in a tough environment, we tend to be very conservative and want to hoard cash and hoard capital. And so we make the -- those 2 things you mentioned are offsetting thoughts that we have, and we just try and make the best decision we can in the environment.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Well, if you feel a teeny bit better about Europe, would that mean you'd lean a little bit more toward buybacks?","David A. Viniar","I should emphasize teeny in how much better I feel.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And then lastly, your revenue weakness recently. Are you saying none of that is due to secular factors? It's all cyclical. There's no structural changes that's hurting your revenues.","David A. Viniar","I never make -- I shouldn't use never. I don't like to use the word never. I don't make statements that bold, and I couldn't say that. I think that we are clearly in a cyclical downturn. There is less activity. That is cyclical. That will come back. I have no idea when, but it will come back. Over time, there have always been secular changes in our business, and I think we'll go through some secular changes now in how we deliver our services. I think the services that our clients want that -- you've heard us talk about this. The advice, the capital, the liquidity, the risk management, the asset management, I think those services are still going to be the same services. I think there will be a cyclically higher demand for those services than there is now, and there might be some secular change in how those services have to be provided. And our job is to make sure that we're able to provide them in the way that we'll be able to and will be required going forward.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Let me try one last time. Your ROE target of 20%, I know you don't have an ROE target now. Do you think you'll have one in the future, once you know what the capital rules are?","David A. Viniar","Yes, I think we will.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And would the sole adjustment to that ROE target be based on the capital? So if you have to hold 1\/4 more capital then your ROE would go from 20% down to 15%.","David A. Viniar","No, it would be a combination of changes in capital requirements and changes in what we view as the opportunity set going forward. So that's why I can't give you the number now.","Operator","Your next question is a follow-up from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, just a follow-up. You mentioned the sub-11% on 2013 for common Tier 1. What's your estimate for the 2012 year end?","David A. Viniar","I -- Betsy, I don't have that now. We'll get back to you on that as well.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Because I think in the past, you had said sub-10%. And just wondering if you're still there or not.","David A. Viniar","I'll come back to you. I don't think it's going to be far from that, but I'll come back to you.","Operator","Your next question is a follow-up question from the line of Roger Freeman with Barclays Capital.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones. The repurchases, do you have any remaining authorization from last year that you can do in the first quarter?","David A. Viniar","Yes. We have a small amount remaining that we can do in the first quarter, but it's pretty small.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And on the SIFI buffer. And I know it's not finalized yet, but do you have any reason -- is there any reason why you shouldn't expect 200 basis points for you?","David A. Viniar","Well, we read in the paper that it was going to be 150 basis points. We don't know any more that than what we read in the paper.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Oh, and just lastly, on VaR. The interest rate VaR, you've noted that, that was up because volatility was up a lot. Did you actually -- did you reduce risk and interest rates, or did you increase for VaR just in the quarter?","David A. Viniar","So if you remember, at the end of third quarter, I told everybody that you should expect our VaR to be higher in the fourth quarter because volatility was already up and our ending VaR was higher than it was in the third quarter. So we knew that this was going to happen because volatility was so much higher.","Operator","And at this time, there are no further questions.

","Our Deputy Chief Financial Officer, Marty Chavez, will now review the firm\u2019s results. Marty?","Martin Chavez","Thanks Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I\u2019ll walk you through the first quarter results, then I\u2019ll turn it over to Harvey for some brief comments at the end, then obviously we\u2019ll be happy to answer any questions.","Net revenues were $8 billion, net earnings $2.3 billion, earnings per diluted share $5.15, and our annualized return on common equity 11.4%. Net earnings included a $475 million tax benefit related to a new accounting standard for share-based compensation. This benefit increased annualized return on common equity by 250 basis points. ","The first quarter of 2017 can be characterized as a period of recalibration. In the fourth quarter, strong economic data, the prospect of higher rates and the potential for more pro growth policies in the United States drove improved sentiment and greater investor conviction. Equity markets responded accordingly, reaching new highs. However, during the first quarter, the market began to reconsider both the pace and strength of economic growth, particularly in light of uncertainty regarding upcoming European elections and legislative challenges in the United States. This confluence of events resulted in tempered expectations, a modest retreat in equity prices from intra-quarter highs, and a more benign market environment.","The operating environment in the first quarter was mixed with lower activity in several institutional market making businesses offset in part by generally higher activity in investment banking. For our investing clients, the opportunity set was negatively affected by lower volatility. For example within FICC, D10 foreign exchange volatility approached its lowest level in two years for the dollar-euro pair. This was a headwind for client volumes. Reduced volatility also negatively affected client activity within another macro FICC market, commodities. In the quarter, crude oil volatility averaged its lowest level in more than two years. ","A similar dynamic was underway in the equity markets. For example, realized volatility for the S&P 500 reached its lowest level for first quarter in 50 years. Not surprisingly, U.S. cash equity volumes were generally down both sequentially and year-over-year; however, other client segments were more active in this environment. For example, the first quarter of 2017 was a relatively attractive financing environment for corporate clients. Higher equity prices provided a conducive environment for initial public offering and equity issuance more broadly, and debt issuance remained strong as credit spreads tightened and all-in funding costs remained relatively low versus historical levels.","With that as a backdrop, let\u2019s now discuss individual business performance in greater detail.","Investment banking produced first quarter net revenues of $1.7 billion, 15% higher than the fourth quarter as we saw increases in both M&A and underwriting. Our investment banking backlog decreased since the end of the year. Breaking down the components of investment banking in the first quarter, advisory revenues were $756 million, up 7% relative to the fourth quarter. ","Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced M&A. We advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the first quarter, including Reynolds American\u2019s $60.6 billion sale to British American Tobacco; Mead Johnson\u2019s $18 billion sale to Reckitt Benckiser, and ConocoPhillips\u2019 CAD $17.7 billion sale of selected assets to Cenovus Energy. We also advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the first quarter, including Technip\u2019s $13 billion merger with FMC Technologies; Formula One\u2019s $8 billion sale to Liberty Media Corporation, and Clarcor\u2019s $4.3 billion sale to Parker Hannifin. ","Moving to underwriting, net revenues were $947 million in the first quarter, up 22% sequentially reflecting a pick-up in both equity and debt underwriting. Equity underwriting revenues were $311 million. This was up significantly compared to lower levels of activity in the fourth quarter as a result of an increase in secondary offerings. We ranked first in global equity and equity-related and common stock offerings for the quarter. Debt underwriting revenues were up 13% to $636 million and benefited from strong industry-wide leveraged finance and investment grade activity.","During the first quarter, we actively supported our clients\u2019 financing needs, participating in Change Healthcare\u2019s $6.1 billion financing to support its joint venture with McKesson Technology Solutions; Great Plains Energy\u2019s $4.3 billion investment-grade offering to supports its purchase of Westar Energy, and Snap\u2019s $3.9 billion IPO. ","Turning to institutional client services, which comprises both our FICC and equities businesses, net revenues were $3.4 billion in the first quarter, down 7% compared to the fourth quarter. FICC client execution net revenues were $1.7 billion in the first quarter, down 16% sequentially as client activity was low following a relatively active fourth quarter. As I mentioned, despite a benign market backdrop, low volatility across many FICC-related products constrained the opportunity set for our clients and reduced activity levels. Most of our businesses produced lower net revenues quarter over quarter. Commodities and currencies were significantly lower. Client activity was relatively light amid low volatility. Credit declined despite healthy issuance and tighter credit spreads as clients were less active as a result of low spread volatility.","Interest rates were roughly flat sequentially. Mortgages improved significantly in an environment that included generally tighter spreads. In equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees, and security services, net revenues for the first quarter were $1.7 billion, up 5% sequentially. Equities client execution net revenues of $552 million were up 20% compared to a weaker fourth quarter, but roughly consistent with the quarterly average for 2016. The business operated in an environment with global equity market strength but lower volatility. Commissions and fees were $738 million, flat with the fourth quarter as activity levels remained generally low. Securities services generated net revenues of $384 million, down 4% quarter over quarter. Turning to risk, average daily VAR in the first quarter was $64 million, up from $61 million in the fourth quarter. ","Moving onto our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $1.5 billion in the first quarter. Equities securities generated net revenues of $798 million, reflecting sales, corporate performance and gains in public equity investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $666 million and included approximately $350 million of net interest income. On the Volcker Rule, we applied for and received a five-year extension for substantially all of our remaining covered funds, which totaled approximately $6 billion at the end of the quarter. ","In investment management, we reported first quarter net revenues of $1.5 billion. This was down 7% from the fourth quarter primarily as a result of lower incentive fees. During the quarter, management and other fees were roughly flat at $1.2 billion. Assets under supervision decreased $6 billion sequentially to $1.37 trillion, primarily reflecting $35 billion of seasonal liquidity product net outflows. We had $5 billion of long-term net inflows, including $5 billion of outflows from the sale of our local Australian business. ","Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits, was accrued at a compensation to net revenues ratio of 41%. This is the lowest first quarter accrual in our public history and 100 basis points lower than the accrual in the first quarter of 2016. The reduction in the accrual rate reflects the completion of the nearly $900 million expense initiative that we announced last year. ","First quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.2 billion, 6% lower than the fourth quarter and 5% higher than the first quarter of 2016. The fourth quarter included higher charitable contributions and the first quarter of last year included lower net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings.","Now I\u2019d like to take you through a few key statistics for the first quarter. Total staff was approximately 34,100, essentially unchanged from year-end 2016. If you exclude the tax benefit related to the settlement of equity awards, our effective tax rate for the first quarter would have been nearly 30%. Our global core liquid assets ended the first quarter at $222 billion, and our balance sheet and Level 3 assets were $894 billion and $23 billion respectively. ","Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.9% under the Basel III advanced approach. It was 14.2% using the standardized approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 6.4%. Finally, we repurchased 6.2 million shares of common stock for $1.5 billion in the quarter. We also raised our quarterly dividend to $0.75 per common share from $0.65. We have now more than doubled our quarterly common stock dividend per share since 2011.","Now for some brief summary comments. The first quarter of 2017 had its share of puts and takes and served as a reminder of the benefits of having a diversified global client franchise. The diversity of our client franchise is an important input to the revenue stability that we have seen over the trailing 12 months. We have consistently generated roughly $8 billion of revenues in each of the past four quarters despite a variety of different environments. This reflects the relative balance across investment banking, FICC, equities, investing in lending, as well as investment management. ","As we look forward, we remain focused on several operational objectives: first, providing world-class advice and execution services to our global clients and delivering the whole firm to them. Second, operating efficiently, which means striking the right balance between addressing challenges and investing in future opportunities. It also means positioning the firm for operating leverage. Third, being a prudent capital allocator, being disciplined around risk-adjusted returns, and looking to return capital to shareholders when we can\u2019t find attractive opportunities to deploy it. Fourth, recruiting, retaining and developing the most talented teams possible at every level, in every business and for every region. Finally, leveraging technology across all of these areas to inform our decision-making and, most importantly, to drive better outcomes. We believe meeting these operational objectives is essential to serving our clients, our shareholders, and the broader marketplace.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Harvey for some closing remarks.","Harvey Schwartz","Thanks Marty. In short, I just want to say thank you to everyone. Over the past four and a half years, I have thoroughly enjoyed engaging with all of you as the firm\u2019s CFO. I\u2019ve also truly appreciated both your support and your challenge during our many discussions. There\u2019s no doubt it\u2019s made us a better firm and it definitely made me a better professional. I really look forward to continuing our relationship in my new role.","As we have talked about in the past, Marty and I have worked together closely for more than a decade. Many of you have gotten to know him better during the transition. During my nearly 20 years at the firm, he\u2019s one of the most talented people that I\u2019ve had the privilege of referring to as my partner. This being my last earnings call, I just want to say again, thank you everyone.","Now back to Marty.","Martin Chavez","Thanks for the kind words, Harvey, and all your support. Well, why don\u2019t we just move onto the Q&A portion of the conference call? We are obviously happy to answer all your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","The first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Glenn Schorr","Good morning, thanks very much. I can\u2019t avoid the FICC question. So I heard all your comments. I\u2019m curious to see how you\u2019d describe what exactly happened in the quarter. When we think about it versus a peer group that was reasonably consistent and stable this quarter, how much do you attribute to maybe the client mix, which I heard a little bit in your remarks, versus maybe just being caught a little bit facilitating client flow during the quarter?","Martin Chavez","So Glenn, unfortunately we don\u2019t have a lot of transparency into others\u2019 results, so here\u2019s how we\u2019re seeing it from the perspective of our results. As we mentioned, there were very low levels of volatility in the first quarter and subsequently low client activity. Dollar-euro vol, lowest in two years; crude oil vol, similar figure, and given the strength of our commodities business, this is unique to our firm.","To the extent that the market environment improves, economic growth accelerates, client confidence continues to grow, client activity is likely to increase, and that ultimately drives our opportunity set. We feel great about the competitive position and have a tremendous amount of capacity to serve the clients as activity levels improve, and we believe our clients recognize that. ","Glenn Schorr","Okay. Fair enough. Then I personally hate this question but I\u2019m going to ask it anyway, because it doesn\u2019t make sense to me, but plenty of talk in the market about some version of Glass-Steagall or some greater separation than we\u2019ve already seen with the capital requirements and the regulatory environment. Just curious to get your thoughts on this call.","Martin Chavez","Sure. We, like you, don\u2019t have any information on what the specifics of a proposal might be, and we wouldn\u2019t find it productive to speculate or make assumptions. Our focus is entirely in delivering to our clients under the current regulatory construct of our bank holding company.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. One last simple one, or maybe not. MiFID II, just curious on how you\u2019re preparing for what\u2019s coming and what your gut reaction is to the outcome. Can Goldman be a net beneficiary?","Martin Chavez","So as we all know, there are many components to MiFID II. As for the execution, we\u2019re working with our peers and with our clients on protocols and platforms, and making sure that we have the services and products that our clients require for their execution needs. As for research, we would generally expect the MiFID II changes to bring greater transparency, and as that happens it seems likely that scale and high value-added content will be important components, and we have both of those as a core part of our offering.","Glenn Schorr","Okay, thanks. Appreciate all the answers. Thanks.","Martin Chavez","Thank you, Glenn.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Christian Bolu","Good morning, Marty. Good morning, Harvey.","Martin Chavez","Hello Christian.","Christian Bolu","So just back on FICC again here, could you help us size in just dollar terms the issues around commodities and currencies? It would just be very helpful for us as we think about the forward outlook. Also, I believe you mentioned $8 billion of annual revenues in FICC, if I heard you right. Is that a good way to think about potential revenue generation of that business?","Martin Chavez","Actually Christian, the $8 billion figure I was referring to was $8 billion roughly in quarterly revenues for the firm over the last 12 months. As for the size, I won\u2019t break out commodities or FX. What I will say is that it was one quarter. We don\u2019t extrapolate from a quarter. We didn\u2019t extrapolate from the fourth quarter last year where we outperformed, and we wouldn\u2019t extrapolate from this quarter.","Having said that, we did underperform, and the underperformance was driven by commodities and currencies. Ultimately, we didn\u2019t navigate the market well, but no quarter defines the franchise. There is always things that we can do better, and it\u2019s important to note we\u2019re constantly analyzing our results with an eye towards continually improving them.","Christian Bolu","Okay, got it. Thank you. So I know your predecessors never have commented on the current quarter, but just given the circumstance here and obviously some investor nervousness around the strength of the trading business, curious if you can make any comment at all as to how the second quarter has gone.","Martin Chavez","Well, it\u2019s only two weeks and there really isn\u2019t any information or content there. ","Christian Bolu","Okay, all right.","Harvey Schwartz","Yeah, the predecessor is still sitting here!","Christian Bolu","I was hoping that he\u2019d ignore you!","Harvey Schwartz","Come on, it\u2019s four and a half years. It\u2019s my nature [indiscernible].","Christian Bolu","Okay. Just a last clean-up one here. RWA ticked up in the quarter, both standardized and advanced. Curious if you\u2019re seeing anything at all in terms of the ability to deploy incremental capital or seeing demand for some of your capital by your clients.","Martin Chavez","Sure. Let me just quickly take you through the RWAs. These are on the transitional basis. I\u2019ll start with advanced. Total RWAs in the quarter ended at $558 billion. That breaks down in $361 billion of credit, $83 billion of market RWAs, $114 billion of operational; and on the standardized approach $507 billion of RWAs, breaking down into $424 billion of credit, $83 billion of market. The ratios have ticked down 20 or 30 basis points since the end of last year, depending on which ratio you\u2019re talking about, and really it\u2019s on increased credit RWAs, which is primarily driven by lending for the advanced approach, and lending and funding transactions for standardized.","Christian Bolu","Okay, thank you very much for the answers.","Martin Chavez","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Michael Carrier","All right, thanks guys. Maybe a broader question and not just on FICC, but I\u2019d say FICC and equity trading. It seems like maybe over the past two years, the business has been maybe on a relative basis a bit more challenged, and we can point to a lot of things in terms of the client mix, whether it\u2019s hedge funds or investment managers, they\u2019re facing some pressures. But just wanted to get a sense - when you guys look at the business and the mix, are you positioned where you want to be, and then when we think about that in terms of the outlook, is there more that can be done on the expense or capital base or do you think that you\u2019re still--you\u2019re looking for a positive kind of revenue backdrop with the current mix that you have? I know that\u2019s a lot in there, but just trying to get a sense because it seems like it wasn\u2019t just one quarter.","Martin Chavez","Yes, so I think it\u2019s important to note that we\u2019re not focusing on revenue share, and while top line revenue and revenue share are among the many factors that we look at, the focus is on serving the clients, our impact and engagement with them, and on returns, so returns, not revenues, and generating strong ROEs over the cycle. As for expenses, it never feels perfect. They\u2019re just always really just part of the constant discipline here to look at expenses, and as you know, we have significantly changed that business over the last few years since beginning of 2012 to now headcount, compensation, benefits, risk-weighted assets, balance sheet all down.","Michael Carrier","Okay, and then maybe as a follow-up, if you can give us the--I don\u2019t think you guys gave us the fully phased in unit ratios, and I think in the last quarter, maybe a quarter before that, Harvey, you mentioned just in terms of where you think the G-SIB buffer would pan out. Any update there? I know everything is kind of potentially in flux when we look at the outlook, but just how you\u2019re thinking about that.","Martin Chavez","Sure. So under the advanced approach, the fully phased ratio at the end of the quarter was 12.5%, and under the standardized approach the fully phased ratio ended the quarter at 13.7%. As for the G-SIB buffer, it\u2019s too early to tell. We have lots of capital and a history of adapting.","Michael Carrier","Okay, thanks a lot.","Martin Chavez","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Good morning. I was hoping you could elaborate on the comment about pipelines being down within the investment bank unit. I guess I\u2019m not surprised on the M&A advisory side, but I would have thought the ECM pipelines, given where market levels are, would have been net pretty solid.","Martin Chavez","Sure. So the pipeline is good and we\u2019re cautiously optimistic. Many of the factors that one would look for remain in place, so CEO confidence, attractive financing levels, relatively supportive equity market backdrop. So I\u2019ll say cautiously optimistic.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay, and then just separately on the comp rate, bringing it down a little bit this quarter. Should we think of that as more of an effort to smooth out the year so that there\u2019s not as meaningful of a decline in the back half of the year versus the first half of the year, or is this signaling a downward structural move overall? I realize it\u2019s only 1%, but wanted to ask what you\u2019re trying to signal there, if anything.","Martin Chavez","It\u2019s our best estimate of the comp ratio, and it reflects the $900 million initiative that we announced last year. Because of severance and other effects, $500 million of it last year, $400 million more of additional flexibility in this year, and it just reflects that.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay, but no comment on do we get as meaningful of an adjustment in the back half of the year as maybe we have had in the past?","Martin Chavez","It\u2019s just our best estimate. ","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay. All right, thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good morning. ","Martin Chavez","Good morning.","Betsy Graseck","A couple questions. One thing we\u2019ve talked about in the past is during periods of rising rates, at least in the past you\u2019ve historically seen some improving VAR productivity during those periods. So I\u2019ve got a couple questions this morning just on 1Q tends to be the highest quarter in FICC, and my thought is, well look, if vol is down so much right now today, as you mentioned that\u2019s the biggest driver, do you--as vol increases, do you expect that the VAR productivity could go higher, like it had in prior periods of rising rates?","Martin Chavez","So we would generally expect to see VAR efficiency picking up with greater activity and turnover.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. Second question is on security servicing. You mentioned and you spoke briefly to the year-on-year decline. I just--could you give us a little bit more color there, because in the context of higher values in the markets on the equity side at least, I would have thought that there would have been an uplift in that line item, so I must be missing something. I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s margins or if it\u2019s just activity levels. Maybe you could speak to what\u2019s going on there.","Martin Chavez","Sure, I\u2019d be happy to. In security services, low volatility affected the opportunity set for many of our clients of that business, and it was evidenced in the weaker security services results which included a lower margin mix of client balances, including a move to easier to borrow securities, which has an effect.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, got it. Then just lastly on the Volcker Rule, Marty, you mentioned that you asked and received the five-year extension here on the $6 billion. That will roll off over the next five years, I assume? I don\u2019t know what the duration is on that $6 billion. Is there anything more than that? You might be laughing, like who\u2019s asking about five years out, but I\u2019ll just ask the obvious question there, but then also how you\u2019re thinking about redeploying the capital that frees up as these assets roll off.","Martin Chavez","There\u2019s nothing particularly to note. That extension that was granted applies to essentially all of the Volcker-covered funds, and as for redeploying, it\u2019s always opportunity driven on behalf of the clients and just when we see attractive returns.","Betsy Graseck","And then it\u2019s just a ratable decline over the next five years, or it\u2019s back-end loaded? I\u2019m just thinking through how to model out the freed up capital.","Martin Chavez","Yeah, I would just say it\u2019s going to be all opportunity set and return driven [indiscernible].","Betsy Graseck","Right, I get that. But the pace of the roll-off of the $6 billion if ratable over five years, or is it back-end loaded? ","Martin Chavez","Not really going to further break that out.","Betsy Graseck","Okay.","Martin Chavez","It\u2019s all going to be situational.","Betsy Graseck","Got it, okay. Appreciate the comments and color, thank you. And thanks, Harvey, nice working with you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.","Martin Chavez","Hello Brennan.","Brennan Hawken","Hey, good morning, Marty. Sorry to give you a hard time here on your first call, but the FICC question, I\u2019m still confused and I think I have some company. Your year-over-year comps were kind of easy. Last year, it was a tough one for you in FICC. I believe, as I recall, there was some market making conditions that were tricky, which certainly we can understand, but we didn\u2019t have that this quarter. Everybody else, or a lot of your [indiscernible] peers here have reported pretty solid, both quarter over quarter and year over year. I get it that commodities is a laggard, but is there anything further? Does it have to do with corporate client base being relatively smaller? Does it have to do with retaining some--holding back on some capital because you want to have dry powder for an improving environment? Is there anything further that you can add for us, please?","Martin Chavez","Sure. Well, as I said, we underperformed this quarter, and the underperformance was driven by commodities and currencies. We\u2019d note that some of our competitors had bigger financing businesses and more significant corporate footprints as a result of larger lending books, but again it\u2019s one quarter and business mix differences might reflect performance, relative performance quarter to quarter, but we believe our model has lots of leverage improving client activity.","Harvey, would you like to add anything?","Harvey Schwartz","Well, I think Marty\u2019s covered it in pretty good detail. I mean, Brennan, I think your question is completely fair, obviously. It\u2019s nice of you to say you don\u2019t want to give Marty a hard time for the call, but I think this is--in some respects, we\u2019ve had this conversation on and off over the past four and a half years, and I think last year in the third and fourth quarter, where you might have said we outperformed, that wasn\u2019t a moment of celebration for us, and as Marty said, this isn\u2019t a moment of bigger concern for us. Quarter to quarter, things are going to vary. There may be differences in franchises, as Marty has already pointed out. ","Having said that, we\u2019re pretty focused individuals over here, so to the extent of which there\u2019s any energy to harness, I can promise you we\u2019re all going to harness it. But I think Marty, I think you covered it.","Brennan Hawken","Okay, that\u2019s fair. Thanks for that and the patience with whatever FICC question on it. Following up, though, on a component there, a couple years ago you guys had made the effort to try to grow out the corporate client base. Is that still an effort that you guys are focused on? Could you give maybe a high level update on where you stand there, how you\u2019re feeling about it, and maybe any updated targets or color you can give on those efforts?","Martin Chavez","I\u2019ll just say that the effort to further develop that client base continues as with the client base we already have in our banking business, clearly, and the effort to be more impactful with those clients and engage them more deeply across all of our businesses continues over the long haul. I wouldn\u2019t--we don\u2019t have any particular targets.","Brennan Hawken","Okay, that\u2019s fair. Last one for me, so Governor Tarullo made some comments as he packed up his desk that the Volcker Rule was too complex, and while I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect that you guys would have any insights on what the regulators would come up with, if you all were sitting down or asked to provide input on what adjustments to make to the Volcker Rule, what would you propose? How would the rule look when you retain some of the benefits but then lop off some of the negative impacts to liquidity and such?","Martin Chavez","So I think it makes sense to step back a bit and look at all the rule making that\u2019s occurred over the last decade or so, a little less than a decade. If you look at that, it\u2019s an impressive body of work and reduces systemic risk and contributes to safety and soundness. At the same time, looking at the approach to the rule making, the rule making proceeded in parallel along many fronts, and you mentioned one of them - the Volcker Rule, and this is happening really before the election. Regulators, for instance the Basel committee, were beginning to step back and look at the totality of the rules, look at all of them holistically and see how they interacted, and began looking at the second and third order effects, so that was happening anyway.","As for the Volcker Rule itself, there could be opportunities to recalibrate, revisit parts of it. Governor Tarullo had some specific thoughts on the Volcker Rule and on other aspects of the regulatory set-up, including for instance CCAR, and it\u2019s really too early to comment. We\u2019d have to see what form that would take, but potentially there is an opportunity to reduce some of the reporting burdens around the Volcker Rule.","Brennan Hawken","Okay, thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Martin Chavez","Morning, Guy.","Guy Moszkowski","Good morning. Okay, so umpteenth question on the FICC thing, and I\u2019m just going to follow up on a comment that you made, which is we heard several times that obviously clients were less active and that has lots to do with mix, and that makes sense. But I think I also heard you say that you didn\u2019t feel like you had navigated some of the currents as effectively as you might have, and I was wondering if you could break down between the areas that you called out as having been headwinds, which were commodities, FX and, I think to a lesser extent, credit, where in particular maybe there were issues with inventory management or positioning, as opposed to just the customer flow.","Martin Chavez","There\u2019s really nothing further I would add there, nothing material in inventory in the context of the firm. It\u2019s just we could have done a better job navigating the markets. It\u2019s a cyclic market and that\u2019s really all I would say.","Guy Moszkowski","Okay, but I mean, it does sound like you\u2019re thinking that there were some positioning issues as opposed to it just being customer flow.","Martin Chavez","No positioning issues. It\u2019s just in some market environments, one navigates a better outcome than others. That\u2019s really all I\u2019d say.","Guy Moszkowski","Okay. Then just changing to follow up to one of the other questions that has arisen a couple times on the comp accrual. Just trying to do a little math around it - if I take that one percentage point and I apply it to the $8 billion of revenue run rate that, as you point out, has kind of been a stable number for the last four quarters, I get a little over $300 million. Is it fake math or good math to kind of compare that $300 million, $320 million to the $900 million of cost saves and think that the message you\u2019re sending is that maybe a third or so of that $900 million is on the comp line?","Martin Chavez","Well, math is math. There is lots and lots of inputs to it, and some of the expense initiative was in last year and some of it was in this year. There\u2019s lots of inputs to it. There\u2019s really no message other than it\u2019s our best estimate.","Guy Moszkowski","Okay, fair enough. Then just on that same point, last year you came in at 38.1% comp ratio for the full year.","Martin Chavez","Yes.","Guy Moszkowski","And all else equal, should we think about modeling that ratio down close to 100 basis points based on the signal that you\u2019ve sent with the reduction for 1Q, and just the thought that usually you apply that same ratio in the second quarter, or is that over-thinking it?","Martin Chavez","I think there\u2019s just lots of inputs, and you\u2019ll definitely model them. It\u2019s our best estimate, and really also, as we always say, it\u2019s fundamentally at the end of the year, the comp ratio is an output. It\u2019s going to be a bottoms-up process and it will be what it is.","Guy Moszkowski","Okay, fair enough. Thanks very much. Harvey, it\u2019s been a pleasure working with you and we\u2019ll miss you, but we hope you\u2019ll talk to us every once in a while.","Harvey Schwartz","All the time, Guy. Thanks so much, I appreciate that.","Guy Moszkowski","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Jim Mitchell","Hey, good morning guys. Just maybe a follow-up on the expense side. As you mentioned, there\u2019s a lot of discussion with Tarullo talking about maybe phasing out the qualitative aspect of CCAR, simplification of Volcker. How do we think about the impact on expenses? Is that a material kind of annual thing, that if we see those things go away, that could be quite helpful, or is it something you can at least put a breadbox around for us?","Martin Chavez","First of all, it was certainly his thoughts as he was ending his term and a lot of ideas, but we\u2019d have to wait to see the specifics. I wouldn\u2019t call out or break out for you any particular effect on expenses other than to say that we\u2019re strong proponents of the stress testing. It\u2019s good for the system, it\u2019s good for the firms, it\u2019s important.","Jim Mitchell","So is there any particular item where you have spent the most incremental money, just so we can think about what is possible?","Martin Chavez","We have since the beginning taken a holistic approach to adapting to all the rules, and we don\u2019t break it out. We just don\u2019t break it out.","Jim Mitchell","Okay, fair enough. Maybe something--maybe a comment on Brexit. It seems like that\u2019s heading for more of a hard exit. How do we think about that impact for you guys? Is it very manageable, or how do you think about it?","Martin Chavez","Sure. So I think not crystal clear what all the different terms around Brexit mean, including hard Brexit. Obviously it continues to evolve. We\u2019ve all seen Prime Minister May calling a snap election this morning, as we all know. The U.K. triggered Article 50 a couple weeks ago. We have our Brexit contingency plan in place, and as far as that plan is concerned, we\u2019ve taken no material actions yet along that plan, and we have a plan.","Jim Mitchell","Okay, but--I guess it would just take a certain amount of moving people into--on the continent in the worst case. Is that the right way to think about it, that you already have existing offices there and the incremental expense is manageable, or no?","Martin Chavez","So we have existing offices around Europe. We have existing legal entities around Europe. As you know, we conduct most of our business with EU clients who are outside of the U.K. under the passporting regime, and so much depends on what that looks like during and after the implementation period.","Jim Mitchell","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.","Steven Chubak","Hi, good morning.","Martin Chavez","Good morning, Steven.","Steven Chubak","So two questions, Marty, none on fixed income. I\u2019m just going to kick things off with one on asset management. We\u2019re somewhat surprised to see the management fees tick down quarter on quarter, despite what looked to be some favorable remixing in terms of the AUM, as well as just higher average assets. Was hoping you could maybe speak to some of the factors that are pressuring that managing fee yield, and also wondering whether some of the lower fee ETF offerings that you guys have, which have shown very strong growth, whether that\u2019s cannibalized fees at all.","Martin Chavez","Well as you know, we\u2019re not immune to what\u2019s happening generally across the industry - fee compression of various kinds, shift in mix of strategies, and so as you also know from our results over the last year, we\u2019ve had strong inflows of long-term fee-based assets, and that has offset the modest decline in the effective fee mix.","Steven Chubak","Got it, okay. Just one strategy question. One of your bulge bracket competitors had recently alluded to an new initiative to expand into the self-direct retail brokerage space, and Marty, hearing your remarks about the benefits of revenue diversification, I\u2019m just wondering given your strong track record in leveraging technology expertise and your recent expansion into the retail lending space with Marcus, whether that might be an area that you could look to expand as well.","Martin Chavez","So there are a lot of areas that we\u2019re always looking at as options for expansion. I wouldn\u2019t call out that one in particular, but we look at many things, and since we do have, as you mentioned, a strong tradition of building tools and applying those tools to deliver results for our clients, that\u2019s something we intend to continue. But there\u2019s nothing specific that I would call out right now.","Steven Chubak","Okay, that\u2019s it for me. Thanks for taking my questions.","Martin Chavez","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.","Eric Wasserstrom ","Thanks very much. Marty, I was hoping you could give us a little bit of an update on what\u2019s going on with the Marcus consumer lending initiative ,so maybe you can give us a sense of where originations are now and how they\u2019re tracking relative to your firm\u2019s initial expectations of a few quarters ago.","Martin Chavez","Yes, so you all know the background on Marcus. We saw an opportunity to enter into a rapidly evolving world of consumer digital finance, starting with a clean sheet of paper and focusing--engaging on thousands of consumers to see what they would be looking for in an offering, and it was clear that they wanted simplicity, transparency, flexibility, and we had no legacy either in branches or in systems, and so we saw the opportunity. Since inception, the entire concept from Marcus is a slow, deliberate, organic build-out - crawl, walk, maybe someday run. What I would say to you right now is it\u2019s executing according to the plan. Early days.","Eric Wasserstrom","Okay. Executing according to the plan, but has the plan evolved in any way over the past few quarters based on the competitive environment, or credit or rate expectations?","Martin Chavez","No, the plan, we put a lot into creating that plan, and while we\u2019re constantly looking at everything that\u2019s happening in the environment, it\u2019s the same plan and we\u2019re on plan. No material changes.","Eric Wasserstrom","All right, thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.","Devin Ryan","Hey, thanks. Good morning, Marty, Harvey. How are you?","Martin Chavez","Morning. How are you?","Devin Ryan","Good. A question on equities trading. I know you guys have improved your electronic capabilities and increasing market share there has been a big focus. I\u2019m just curious how you feel like the investments that you\u2019ve been making are going, kind of where you are relative to where you want to be, and just how much more room you still see.","Martin Chavez","So in equities, what I would say is that there is in the current results, I\u2019d point to corporate activity being strong. If you want to look at the client execution line quarter on quarter, it\u2019s really about cash and derivatives performance, and then if you\u2019re looking year-on-year, it\u2019s really about derivatives. As for our offering, as you know, it\u2019s a scale business and our clients value the diversity of services that we offer across that business - high touch, low touch, execution, as well as prime brokerage. We have over the last period seen an opportunity to have a deeper engagement with our quant fund clients, and so certainly that\u2019s a major emphasis for us and we\u2019re starting to see the results in share.","Devin Ryan","Okay, terrific. Just one quick follow-up here on the regulatory outlook. Appreciate that you don\u2019t want to speculate on how regulation might evolve, but clearly I think one of the most difficult things kind of post-financial crisis regulation has just been the fact that it\u2019s been constantly changing and constantly evolving. So I\u2019m just curious how the current moratorium on new regulation is impacting sentiment at all internally. Essentially, is it freeing up management to focus on other business opportunities or maybe increase risk appetite to do something new? Just trying to get a sense of effectively does this moratorium actually change things, or is it all about where existing regulation goes?","Martin Chavez","I would say we\u2019ve never been distracted by regulation. It\u2019s just part of the operating environment, and working with our clients, regulators, peers through the process of the rule making and the implementation is just something that we\u2019ve been doing for a long time and it\u2019s just part of how the business operates. I wouldn\u2019t call out any specific effects ongoing, and we\u2019ll see how it plays out.","Devin Ryan","Okay. Thanks very much.","Martin Chavez","Sure.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Al Alevizakos with HSBC. Please go ahead.","Al Alevizakos","Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my single question. It\u2019s regarding fixed income and equities, however, focusing more outside the U.S. where we haven\u2019t really discussed at all. So I\u2019m just questioning what\u2019s been the performance outside the U.S., particularly in Europe but also in Asia, if you are slightly disappointed about certain product lines, and also regarding the pressure in European equities being from MiFID II. Have you actually started seeing any of that in 2017? Thank you.","Martin Chavez","No, there\u2019s no particular pressure that we would attribute or notice relating to MiFID II. In terms of our business, actually the business mix across regions has remained fairly stable over time. Give or take a point, it\u2019s 60-25-15 mix across Americas, EMEA and Asia. ","Al Alevizakos","Thank you, and if I can have a follow-up, please, you spoke a lot about volatility being particularly low, which we witnessed as well. I\u2019m wondering whether you see any specific events in Q2 that could actually increase volatility from your point of view. I mean, obviously we see here in Europe via U.K. elections and the French elections as being significant events. Do you believe that these could actually bring the required volatility to see improved numbers in the second quarter?","Martin Chavez","So certainly we\u2019re all looking at the same thing as we head into the French election next week - volatility, for instance dollar-euro has picked up significantly since intra-quarter, and we\u2019d also generally see that clarity on outcome increases the probability of action. Other than that, just I\u2019ll note, which we\u2019ve already discussed, there\u2019s often a connection between reasonable levels of volatility around market trends driving risk managers to transact.","Al Alevizakos","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Yes, good morning. A quick question. I know you\u2019ve spent or invested for the Marcus build-out as well as the bank build-out. Are both of those businesses profitable, or are they--and if they are, are the ROEs in these businesses above what you\u2019re getting from company overall?","Martin Chavez","So on Marcus, it\u2019s in build mode and we\u2019re not breaking it out, other than to say that it\u2019s operating entirely according to plan. ","Brian Kleinhanzl","And the bank?","Martin Chavez","And the bank, I would say the bank is part of our structure under our bank holding company, and the bank is performing well.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. Then I know you just got done with the most recent cost save program, but do you feel like right now from a headcount perspective, you\u2019re right sized for the volumes of activity that you saw in the first quarter, if that activity level were to persist?","Martin Chavez","So on that topic of expenses, we had the initiative which we shared with you and mentioned again recently, the $900 million expense initiative. On the other hand, expenses are never perfect, and keeping a close eye on our expenses is just part of the ongoing discipline of running our businesses for the clients and our shareholders. ","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay, thanks.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.","Martin Chavez ","Since there are no more questions, I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank all of you for joining this call. Hopefully we and other members of senior management will see many of you in the coming months. If any additional questions arise, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to Dane; otherwise, enjoy the rest of your day and look forward to speaking with you on our second quarter earnings call in July.

This call is being recorded today, April 15, 2019. Thank you.","Ms. Miner, you may begin your conference.","Heather Kennedy Miner","Good morning. This is Heather Kennedy Miner, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. On this call, we will reference our earnings presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our Web site at www.gs.com. No information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures appear in the earnings release and presentation. This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent.","Today on the call, I'm joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon and our Chief Financial Officer, Stephen Scherr. You will find today's agenda on Page 1 of the earning presentation. David will start with a high level review of our financial performance, the current operating environment and provide an update on our strategy. Stephen will then share initial observation from ongoing front to back business reviews and cover first quarter results in each of our businesses. They will then be happy to take your questions.","I'll now pass the call over to David. David?","David Solomon","Thanks, Heather. And thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. I'm happy to be here with all of you.","Let me begin on Page 2. We reported first quarter 2019 revenues of $8.8 billion, down 13% versus last year, reflecting a slower start to the year relative to the robust market backdrop of a year ago. Net earnings were $2.3 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $5.71. We posted return on common equity of 11.1% and a return on tangible equity of 11.7%. While we aspire to deliver stronger results, the overall franchise performed well in the context of more muted market activity in the first half of the quarter. Through Friday, we ranked number one in global completed M&A, number one in announced M&A and number one in global equity underwriting. We posted record net interest income and debt investing and lending and record assets under supervision and investment management.","Turning to Page 3, our results were generated in a mixed macroeconomic backdrop, particularly early in the quarter as a number of variables weighed on market sentiment. First coming up the challenging market performance in the fourth quarter, we saw central banks pivot to an accommodative policy on rate. In the U.S., the Fed shifted from its prior path of incremental tightening to a more neutral stance. In Europe, the ECB signaled move back monetary stimulus. Central banks in Asia also shifted to more dovish rhetoric amid a backdrop of low inflation and somewhat disappointing growth. The net result was a lower volatility environment as government bonds rallied and yield curves flattened in the U.S. and Europe. With the VIX and other measures of volatility at near record lows trading activity remained low.","Second, we saw a significant slowdown in IPO activity as a direct result of the government shutdown, which weighed on sentiment and kept issuers and investors on the sidelines. Despite the rebound in equity and credit markets, we saw lower client conviction. Third, ongoing geopolitical risks, including the U.S. China trade and Brexit negotiations added uncertainty. Notwithstanding the mixed backdrop, resilient macro fundamentals and rising asset prices spurred client engagement later in the quarter.","Our institutional investing clients appeared less cautious in March. And as we engaged with corporate clients around the world, we continue to hear a strong desire to execute strategic transactions and access the capital markets while the economy is growing, market prices are favorable and financing markets are open. Our backlog for IPO activity is robust. In that vein, we are optimistic on the forward as underlying indicators remain encouraging, and we're still very early in the second quarter.","On Page 4, let me give you an update on our strategic planning. Stephen will provide further context in a moment when he shares some initial takeaways from our front to back reviews. To drive long-term shareholder value, our strategy sets up three primary objectives; first, we aim to strengthen our existing businesses; second, we aim to diversify our business mix with new services to expand our opportunity set and increase the durability of our revenues; and third, we aim to operate more efficiently and effectively across all aspects, including expenses, financing and capital.","To achieve these objectives, we will endeavor to deliver one-Goldman Sachs to our clients; we will focus on growth where there is an adjacency to our existing businesses; we will expand our addressable market to deliver more products to existing and new clients; and we will pursue this expansion, via investments in talent, technology and platforms, all the while our emphasis will be on transparency with our stakeholders. As we seek to achieve our overarching goal of delivering superior products and services to our clients, we also look to leverage our spirit of innovation, our strength in engineering and our deep culture of risk management. Our ability to approach problems creatively and our willingness to adapt have served us well over our 150 year history.","Turning to Page 5. Last month, we announced an important partnership with Apple, a leader in innovation and consumer technology with whom we are taking an important new step, our first credit card. Quite a lot has been said and written about this announcement and we will be able to talk more about Apple card once the product has launched. We're excited about the opportunity and expect it will prove to be differentiated in the marketplace and create incremental value for the firm over time.","But importantly, I want to turn your attention to the key elements of this project as they represent the same drivers and underscore a range of major strategic growth initiatives underway at the firm. These elements include re-imagined products that address pain-points for corporations, institutions and consumers; new technology unburdened by legacy systems that often slowdown innovation; digital delivery mechanisms that produce scale and efficiency and access to large customer population. These elements are critical to our key growth platforms, including Marcus and mass affluent wealth where we will pursue partnerships to access large numbers of consumers; Marquee, our digital institutional platform where the ability to innovate can help us engage at scale with our institutional client base; and corporate cash management, where we can serve existing clients to the firm and offer differentiated products on a digital platform.","With the incredible focus and energy of the people at Goldman Sachs, our strategy is beginning to take hold. We are on an evolutionary path. Our new investments will generate results over time, and will be complementary to our long-standing core business, which we will continue to strengthen. Ultimately, we believe the strategy will allow us to serve more clients with differentiated products and services, increase the durability and predictability of our earnings profile, deliver improved profitability, optimize our capital and deliver higher long-term returns to shareholders.","With that, I will turn the call over to Stephen to give you some additional details and walk through the results in each of our businesses.","Stephen Scherr","Thanks David. Let me begin on Page 6, and frame our front to back reviews in the context of the strategy David just outlined. Last fall, as you know, we began a process of re-underwriting each of our businesses, including the development of three year plans for the firm. We're conducting broad and deep reviews. Our cadence and approach remain deliberate; no business, no revenue source, no capital or resources out of scope. And this requires us to take a thorough and extensive approach. FIC is of particular focus. And to that end, we are advancing a plan to enable FIC to improve its returns. The same is true across all businesses as we prioritize our investments to maximize shareholder returns.","On the revenue side of the analysis, we are assessing opportunities to grow our addressable market, enhance client experience and grow wallet share. In terms of resources, we are diversifying our funding mix and optimizing our financial resources, including capital and liquidity. Let me be clear. Our efforts are not designed as a cost-cutting exercise, which we could accomplish quickly. Instead, this is an effort to invest in talent, technology, platforms and straight through processing to drive new sources of revenue, improve efficiency and drive higher margins. Embedded in this effort is a clear goal to improve the client experience with Goldman Sachs, from the sales interaction through execution, processing and ongoing service. Enhancing the client journey will drive higher engagement and increase opportunities across the entire organization. These improvements will take some time to realize, but should ultimately create significant operating leverage for the firm and long-term value for shareholders.","Turning to Page 7. Let me be more specific in terms of the initiatives in both our existing and growth businesses. In Investment Banking, an important outcome of our review is our decision to further expand our client coverage universe. We first launched this effort in 2017 and we have since hired over 40 bankers, adding coverage for over 1,000 new clients, thereby increasing our footprint by about 10%. Given our early success, we have decided to expand the strategy. We are creating a specialized team within Investment Banking to serve new clients with enterprise values of less than $2 billion. We are looking to dedicate roughly 100 coverage bankers to this over time, increasing our capacity to cover thousands more clients. This effort will allow us to provide unparalleled strategic advice to more clients, while helping us maintain close attention to our existing clients.","In that regard, our new corporate cash management platform build is advancing. We are excited for this opportunity as it opens us up to a very large revenue pool, including an estimated $5 trillion of corporate deposits in the U.S. alone. We will provide innovative technology to differentiate our offering to clients. For our franchise, there is significant value in serving these clients, including lower deposit funding costs and additional foreign exchange revenues. Once operational later this year, our firm will be the first to use this service, which will save us nearly $100 million per year and reduce operational risk. We are on target to launch the product with clients in 2020. Lastly, these efforts will help us to better serve corporate clients across the firm, including in adjacent areas like ICS and investment management.","Next, in our institutional client services business, we identified a number of opportunities to better serve our existing client franchise and broaden our business mix. Across FIC and Equities, we are working to deepen our penetration with institutional and corporate clients, rural financing and increase our business with systematic investors. We are investing in platforms like Marquee to serve clients in new and more efficient ways. Marquee is our digital store front where our institutional and corporate clients consume GS content, risk analytics, pricing data and ultimately engage with us to trade. Every month, our platform logs over 14,000 unique users and fuels over 100 million API calls, including 10 million calls from clients from GS developer site.","As we go forward, we expect significant increases in client utilization, which carries the potential to generate revenue across a more engaged client base. As I mentioned, we are spending a significant amount of time on FIC, with a focus on growing revenues across each of our core businesses. While we may adjust our focus and footprint in some of these areas, we remain committed to serving our clients at scale. On this point, let me share some further insight. We have been closely reviewing our footprint in commodities, and we remain committed to business. We are excited about the opportunity to further integrate our FIC and Investment Banking franchises to support corporate clients who need expertise and financing solutions. However, our reviews have identified opportunities to cut expenses and capital from certain underperforming parts of the commodities business and increase investments in others. We have already taken many of these actions and expect to continue to make refinements overtime.","In credit where synergies with Investment Banking facilitate our high rankings in both trading and underwriting, we are building models and tools to facilitate faster inventory turnover and reduce drawdown risk as we execute client flows. Finally, through our one-Goldman Sachs initiative, we aim to shift focus away from per trade returns, taking a more holistic approach to client relationships. We anticipate FIC's flow activity will be a beneficiary of this approach.","Next, turning to our investment and lending segment. We're keen to leverage our best-in-class alternative investment platform, track record and the unique sourcing capability of the firm. We will seek to manage larger pools of client assets to drive more recurring fee based revenues. Given the strength of our investing teams, we believe this effort can bear fruit with limited incremental spend. This will be a transition. We will be prudent and patience as reduce our on balance sheet investing activities and bring on more client money. Overtime, this will be early accretion and drive lower earnings volatility for the firm. Separately, we intend to continue supporting our clients through prudent franchise adjacent lending that helps increase recurring net interest income and deepen client relationships.","To facilitate this, we will continue to tap into the large addressable market of consumer deposits. We estimate there are over $4 trillion of consumer deposited in the U.S. that are potential customers for online savings account like those offered by Marcus. Today, across both the U.S. and UK, we have $46 billion of online retail deposits, leaving a tremendous opportunity for growth and we will design our deposit platforms to capture our share.","Pivoting to investment management, we continue to grow assets under supervision in key strategic areas, including advisory, outsource CIO and ETFs, as well as in our world-class ultrahigh network business where we have modest share in a very fragmented market. As I mentioned, alternatives is a key focus where client demand remains very strong with over $1.5 trillion of capital raised industry wide in the past five years. We currently have over $170 billion in alternative assets under supervision, and plan to significantly increase fundraising in the months and years ahead.","As we have said before, we are building Marcus as a fully integrated digital business. As a broad multiproduct platform, wealth management will be a key component. This is a very large market with $9 trillion in mass affluent customer assets across more than 20 million U.S. households. We are planning a multitier digital wealth platform, currently in early development. Our offerings will further leverage our existing Ayco executive counseling business where we serve 60 of the Fortune 100, but only about 220 of the top 1,000. Ayco has the potential to carry us deeper into these organizations to facilitate the growth of a meaningful mass affluent wealth business.","Now, let's focus on resource optimization on Page 8. We are evaluating our activities across a range of balance sheet dimensions, including capital and funding. We've grown deposits at a compounded rate of 16% over the past three years, diversifying our liability mix and lowering funding costs. Going forward, we expect to grow our aggregate U.S. and UK retail online deposits on average by more than $10 billion a year. For every $10 billion of wholesale funding replaced with deposits, we estimate savings of roughly $100 million in interest expense annually. To utilize these deposits, we will continue to migrate businesses, such as foreign exchange into our bank entities.","On the capital side, we have identified two key areas where we can further optimize, in FIC and in our private equity investments. In FIC, we've made material progress, reducing standardized RWAs by approximately 40% over the past five years. We endeavor to do more from here, while identifying attractive opportunities for redeployment. Next, our private equity investments, which have generated strong returns, also require significant stress capital. Overtime, as I mentioned earlier, we will seek to reduce the capital intensity of this business by managing more client assets in fund form and reducing our balance sheet investments.","On platforms, we are actively pursuing a number of work streams to digitize manual activities, expand straight through processing and reduce cost per trade. Our front-to-back efforts include uplifts to client on-boarding, asset servicing, collateral management, margin valuation and settlement processes. Investments in these initiatives will better position us with systematic clients who demand lower latency and higher efficiency platforms. Finally, we are streamlining expenses and organizational structure. We are vertically integrating 7,500 operations and engineering professionals directly into the business to enhance the client experience and provide greater expense accountability to our business leaders. We're also making a number of changes to reduce cost and drive long-term operating leverage by increasing use of shared platforms across our business, and migrating more of our efforts to locations like Bengaluru, Warsaw, Dallas and Salt Lake City.","One thing we will not do, however, is compromise our risk, compliance and control functions, which remain independent and fully resourced. After a period of investment in 2019 and 2020, we expect these efforts to drive our efficiency ratio lower overtime. Based on last year's results for every 100 basis points in efficiency ratio reduction we achieve, it equates to approximately $300 million of net income and a 40 basis point increase in ROE all else equal.","Before moving to discuss the quarter, let me turn to Page 9, where we layout a roadmap for what to expect in the coming quarters in terms of performance targets, financial disclosure and a broader discussing of the strategic way forward for Goldman Sachs. Today, we discussed initial takeaways from our front to back reviews, which will continue. Next, over the coming quarters and on the basis of our work, we expected to find publicly a performance target to which we will hold ourselves accountable. As we move toward the back half of the year, we will pursue opportunities for improved disclosure to align with any changes in our business or organizational structure. Lastly, we expect to provide a more comprehensive and strategic update through the lens of any enhanced disclosure by the first quarter of next year.","Now, let me switch gears to our financial performance, beginning on Page 10. As David mentioned, the environment in the first quarter turned out to be mixed with back end of the quarter proving stronger than the front. Against this backdrop, we concentrated on serving our clients and investing to drive our business forward. Let's run through the numbers.","Turning to page 11. Investment Banking produced net revenues of $1.8 billion down 11% versus the solid fourth quarter and flat versus a year ago as very strong advisory performance offset a sharp decline in underwriting. Financial advisory revenues were $887 million, up 51% versus last year, driven by our leading market share. During the quarter, we participated in announced transactions of approximately $390 billion and closed on nearly $370 billion of deal of volume, ranking number one in global completed M&A. Client dialogs remained healthy and we are seeing increased activity in sectors, including financials, TMT, natural resources and healthcare. This is noteworthy as M&A activity in financials has been relatively slow over the past several years.","Moving to underwriting, net revenues were $923 million in the first quarter, down 24% from a year ago and up 9% versus the fourth quarter. Equity underwriting net revenues of $271 million declined sharply versus last year, driven by a lack of IPO activity. In the first quarter, we ranked first globally in equity underwriting with $16 billion of deal volume across nearly 75 transactions. Debt underwriting net revenues were $652 million, down 18% from a year ago. The first quarter of last year was our second highest quarter ever, causing a very strong comparable as it was aided by significant contributions from acquisition related and leverage finance activity.","Our Investment Banking backlog decreased versus the fourth quarter as revenues were realized. Of note, our equity underwriting backlog increased in the quarter in part due to delayed activity, as well as an overall pick up in IPO interest. We are optimistic that a number of significant technology companies are expected to come to market later this year.","Moving to institutional client services on Page 12. Net revenues were $3.6 billion in the first quarter, up nearly 50% compared to the fourth quarter and down 18% versus the first quarter of last year. FIC client execution net revenues were $1.8 billion in the first quarter, more than doubling fourth quarter levels, reflecting a better operating environment. We saw higher sequential performance across all five of our global fixed-income businesses as markets reverse the sharp December risk off moves. FIC revenues, however, declined 11% versus the first quarter of 2018 amid lower client activity. We saw lower revenues in rates, currencies and credit, while commodities and mortgages improved.","Turning to equities on Page 13. Net revenues for the first quarter were $1.8 billion, up 10% sequentially but down 24% versus a strong quarter a year ago. Equities client execution net revenues of $682 million fell significantly relative to a robust first quarter of 2018, which was our highest quarter performance in the past four years. Results were impacted by significantly lower performance in derivatives, given lower market volatility versus the first quarter of 2018 when volatility was elevated and client activity was robust. Commissions and fees net revenues were $714 million, driven by lower client volumes versus both last quarter and versus a year ago. Securities services net revenues of $370 million fell by 14% year-over-year amid lower average client balances as hedge funds deleveraged, though balances have been recovering.","Moving to investing in lending on Page 14. Collectively, these activities produced net revenues of $1.8 billion in the first quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $847 million, reflecting net gains from private and public equities, company specific events and corporate performance. Approximately 40% of our net revenues was from real estate. The first quarter demonstrated more muted results in equity INL relative to the performance of public equity markets. As I have commented on the last earnings call, this seeming inconsistency is because our portfolio skews more to private securities than public holdings as shown on the slide, and there were less event driven valuation remarks of our private equity holdings. Our global equity portfolio was $22 billion at quarter end and remains well diversified with roughly 1,000 different investments. It is also diversified by investment vintage and geography as shown on the slide.","Net revenues from debt securities and loans on Page 15 were $990 million and included $835 million of net interest income. Results included small mark to market gains, driven by underlying credit fundamentals. Our total lending portfolio was $96 billion, up $2 billion, driven by corporate loan growth. Approximately 85% of our total loan portfolio remained secured. Our credit provision was $224 million, roughly flat versus last quarter. Our firm-wide net charge-off ratio remained low at 50 basis points.","On Page 16, turning to investment management, we produced $1.6 billion of revenues in the first quarter, driven by our diversified global asset management business and leading PWM franchise. Net revenues included management and other fees of $1.3 billion, which were largely inline versus the fourth quarter. Overall, revenues declined versus a year ago due to significantly lower incentive fees and lower transaction revenues from PWM client trading activity. Assets under supervision finished the quarter at a record $1.6 trillion, up $57 billion versus the fourth quarter, driven by $20 billion of long-term net inflows in fixed income strategies and $59 billion of market appreciation, that being partially offset by $22 billion of liquidity product outflows.","Now, let me turn to expenses on Page 17. Our total operating expenses decreased by 11% versus the first quarter of last year, reflecting lower compensation and benefits expense and lower activity related brokerage clearing exchange fees. For the quarter, our efficiency ratio was approximately 67%, up 100 basis point versus year ago largely driven by lower revenues. Next on taxes, our reported tax rate for the quarter was 17.2%. This rate reflects our earnings mix and discrete tax benefits. We continue to expect our full year 2019 tax rate to be consistent with our medium-term estimate of 22% to 23%.","Turning to capital on Page 18. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 13.7% using the standardized approach and 13.4% under the advanced. The ratios improved by 40 and 30 basis points respectively versus year end, driven by higher retained earnings. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 6.4%, up 20 basis points sequentially. In the quarter, we returned a total of $1.6 billion to shareholders, including common stock re-purchases of $1.25 billion and approximately $300 million in common stock dividends. Our basic share count ended the quarter at a record low of 378 million shares. Our book value per share was $209. The limited growth this quarter was driven by credit spread tightening and its impact on DBA. Lastly, our Board approved a 6% increase in our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.85 per share in the second quarter.","Turning to Page 19 for balance sheet and liquidity. Our balance sheet was $925 billion, down 1% versus last quarter. On the liability side, our deposit base totaled over $164 billion this quarter, up $6 billion versus year end. Our global core liquid assets averaged $234 billion during the quarter, which may decline as we have opportunities to support client demand.","Before taking questions, a few brief closing thoughts. Our first quarter performance reflected the mixed operating environment, but we are cautiously optimistic that momentum late in the quarter can continue. We are making significant investments in our future to deepen and expand our client franchise and drive growth in each of our businesses. Combined with our investment in platforms and scale this positions us to create significant value for the clients we serve and solid long-term return to our shareholders. Importantly, we look forward to a continued dialogue with you on our strategic plans of the course of 2019 and beyond.","With that, thank you again for dialing in. And we will now open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.","Glenn Schorr","Just a quickie on numbers on the comp ratio being lower, it\u2019s in line with what past years would be. Is that a pull forward? Meaning is that your best estimate for the year, or are we looking at a lower comp ratio environment to help support returns?","Stephen Scherr","So as you know in each quarter, we make our best assessment of what comp would be and fix the ratio on that basis. There is no fundamental change in policy that's implied in this. And as I said on the last call and we will continue to say forward our view is that we will encourage people to look at overall expenses both comp and non-comp, particularly as we roll out and build platforms that will yield higher marginal margin and that ultimately are less consumptive of comp intensive expense so much as OpEx intensive expense. But no policy shift implied in this.","Glenn Schorr","And on litigation front, only $37 million in the quarter \u2013 I will ask in different way. Do you feel like you have the handle on 1MDB and that's why there's a low litigation number? Or is it just not estimable probable at this point so you can't really reserve for it?","Stephen Scherr","I think based on reserves that we have taken over the past several quarters, we feel confident that those reserves are proper and adequate. Obviously, each quarter we reach out both to internal, legal and accounting experts, as well as those outside the firm so as to reassess circumstances, not just on 1MDB but any and all litigation. And so the number in this quarter is just a reflection of that.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Michael Carrier","First question just on activity levels, I think one of the challenges is during the quarter, obviously, week first half and then that's improved but I think some of the things that you guys mentioned in terms of M&A, the pipeline weaker just given what completed but ECM better. I think you mentioned prime brokerage balance is picking up. So just wanted to get a sense on what areas of the business you think can reverse relatively quickly versus what areas you may take a bit longer for that confidence to come back to where we were, say in September of last year?","David Solomon","Michael, I will comment just broadly. There is no question that the sentiment in the early part of the quarter was quite muted. As I said before, corporations tend to be more thoughtful and take a longer time to shift those sentiments. While there is no question from issuing activity that will come out of corporations certainly slowed. I'd say that gets back to moving at a normal pace relatively quickly. The strategic M&A stuff is much more long cycle. And I don't think it's really been that significantly disrupted and the activity levels would certainly show that. In terms of market activity and client engagement, we saw significant pickup in the second half of the quarter. And given the environment that we're in that pick up can certainly continue. Now I prefaced it's only two weeks into the quarter, so it's hard to take any forward judgment on that. But I think that that activity level certainly improved meaningfully in the second half of the quarter.","Stephen Scherr","Michael, the only thing I would add to David's comment is that I think in equities, we're seeing and saw over the quarter month-by-month increases in prime balances, which speaks to an increasing level of activity. And I think if you look at the equity I&L line, though it doesn't necessarily skew to where the public equity markets fit, I think there is obviously the opportunity to take advantage of a positive environment just in terms of event driven valuation and the like as we play forward.","Michael Carrier","And then maybe just one the non-comp expenses, and some of the focus on efficiency. Stephen, you mentioned on the optimization efforts some of the things that you guys are focused on. Just wanted to get a sense, based on the investments that you have made over the past few years. Is that starting to slow and are some of these optimization efforts, will we start to see that come through in 2019? Is it more 2020 and beyond?","Stephen Scherr","First, I think when you look at the efficiency ratio obviously it was up on the quarter, which was more reflection of revenues being down than it is expenses, because expenses obviously came down. We've all said in the past that '19 is going to be the deeper part of the curve. I think when you look at investments that are being made over the course of '19 and '20, we have a view as we're now developing three year models as to when we'll see or begin to see efficiency play through. You'll see that in the context of cost per trade, you'll see that in the context of platforms that take lift, which carry with them higher marginal margin and less intensity in terms of expenses being put to it beyond the investment horizon. And so I would say that over the next several years, you will start to see that efficiency play through with the investment as I say being more profound now.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Steven Chubak","I wanted to start-off with a question on the I&L strategy. So you outlined efforts to increase fee-based recurring revenues and reduced the volatility in that principle investment line. One of the interesting comments that was made is that you noted this would be ROE accretive overtime, which is something that many investors have questioned just given the significant gains generated within equity I&L. I am just wondering how we should think about the driver of ROE accretion as some of those more volatile, but still elevated revenue streams go away. And is there any way for us as outsiders at this point in time maybe size the amount of stress capital that's allocated for that business today?","David Solomon","I think that it's important to understand this transition as just that, which is a transition away from the balance sheet intensive investing to one which is predicated largely on managing third-party money and generating fee revenue, which itself will dampen P&L volatility and be less consumptive of balance sheet is going to take time. That time is really management on our part to ensure that as we graduate down the slope of the curve of the balance sheet investing, we're mindful of the curve of taking up third party assets and the revenue generated from it. But that will be much less balance sheet consumptive and therefore, less consumptive of stress capital, which is this I&L is an area that as you know is consumptive of that. And so, this shift is really a reflection of that and I think it will bear out over a transitionary period.","Steven Chubak","And one more question for me is just on funding optimization. So in the deck and in your remarks, you noted that $10 billion plus deposit growth target for year with that 100 basis point spread benefit by replacing higher cost wholesale funds with lower cost deposits. Just looking at the momentum that you have in growing deposits. Is it fair to say that the $10 billion number is a conservative target? And how should we think about capacity or the upper bound on how much wholesale funding can be replaced with those lower cost deposits over time?","David Solomon","So I think your characterization of it being conservative is correct, it is. It's a conservative estimate. If you look back over the last several quarters, we've seen pretty demonstrable growth and take-up, both in the U.S. and in particular in the UK platform. I would also say as it relates to deposits that over time you will start to see us build greater functionality around the deposit platform such that we are ultimately less reliable or less reliant, if you will, on price as the key element. Right now, the firm is a better incremental buyer of retail deposits and the numbers that we're suggesting as rules of thumb about how [inside] [ph] the funding cost of wholesale, these deposits come are largely predicated on where we currently are in terms of price. But we will be able to lower beta as and to the extent we put on greater functionality, greater stickiness, greater privity with those depositors. But this is a conservative estimate in the context of I think what we're capable of growing and for that matter, whether there won't be other jurisdictions that we eventually look at.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O'Connor","I was just wondering if you could comment on why the review has taken so long. It's not necessarily a bad thing, I appreciate you're being thorough, comprehensive and you're obviously not standing still while the processes is underway. But it does seem like a long time to wait until the first quarter of next year. I was just wondering if you could comment on that.","David Solomon","And I will start by saying that as we're moving forward on our reviews we're doing it in a way where certainly there is a lot of urgency to make progress. We're also trying to make sure as we move forward and we have things that we can say that bring more transparency and what we're doing to you that we're doing at, and hopefully you feel that today's presentation is another example of this. But we also recognize that as we do this, we want to get it right, we want to be clear, we want to make sure that people in our organization can put it forward with respect to their businesses where the kinds of investments we're making over multiple years, or things that we can really stand behind as we work toward targets, which is something that we haven't done before, we want to make sure that we're getting them right. And so this is something that we feel we can execute on in the highest caliber way and be comfortable that we're moving forward. And from our perspective is a management team, we're looking to build value over the next three to five years, not over the next couple of quarters. And so we're trying to balance the fact that you all want more quicker and we understand that, but we're going to make sure we do it in the highest quality way we can. And we think this is the right time period and right approach for us to execute flawlessly.","Matt O'Connor","And then I know there have been some speculation recently in media that you might be doing an Investor Day this year, I assume that would not happen this year and might be on the table first quarter next year?","Stephen Scherr","I think that the form and substance of what we will do, we'll decide as we get closer. I would point just to key off of David's comments. There is no intention here for us to go dark between now and then. In fact, as David said, we're going to engage in a very regular cadence and you're seeing it already obviously in the context of the presentation that we're putting in front of you. And in the interim period, performance targets will be on the offing and we will review whether financial disclosure needs to change in the context of the change in shape and profile of our business and our organizational structure. And so I think all of that will put us in a place where we have a cleaner and more forward looking lens through which we and you look at our business. And whether that takes the form of Investor Day or some other form for a comprehensive update, we'll engage in that.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.","Brennan Hawken","So understanding that the review is ongoing. But Stephen I think you spoke in your prepared remarks about focus on the FIC business. You highlighted a small example within the commodities business. So what I thought might be interesting is to hear, or may be you provide a little bit more incremental color to help us frame what kind of an impact on the expense and capital in commodities you all discover and help us to think about how that might inform, considering the full impact or a broader impact to FIC at least from an early indication.","Stephen Scherr","Sure. I would say the following. As a general matter, we are looking to make changes in the way in which we're engaging in FIC, all with an eye toward generating considering more revenue for the division and at the same time, optimizing to the deployment of capital and reducing down expense. On the revenue side, particularly in commodities but through elsewhere around the division, we want to meet our clients where they want to execute. And in commodities, equally in credit, equally across FX, we are seeing the opportunity to engage more substantially in low-touch client engagement around systematic market makers. It means we need to develop those platforms in order to do it. Those will inevitably be lower costs in the context of per-trade cost and engagement. All the while, we are looking at areas where we can reduce down the capital intensity.","There are obviously some trades that have been put on historically that have long-lived capital consumption. We look at areas where we can reduce those. But honestly in the context of making those assessments, shareholders value is front and center, which is I'm not going to look to release capital out of those trades to the extent that exercise is dilutive to shareholders value. We'll do it where it's accretive. I would also say that if you look across all of the businesses within FIC, each of them has their own orientation and the work we're doing both to generate capital, consume less capital and equally be more efficient in terms of expense. So for example, the Europe business has been in the bank, it benefits from lower cost funding that sits in the bank and we're looking at ways in which we can be more efficient in the deployment of capital. In FX, we're looking to put more of that business in the bank so as to avail it-self of diversified funding.","We're redoubling our efforts in commodities around businesses, which exhibit the low touch client platforms where clients want to engage. We're looking at capital consumption in mortgages. We're looking at electronic platforms with shorten our risk within credit. All of these are examples where we're driving to lower cost, lower capital consumption. And as we get through this review, we'll be in a position to give you a sense of how to quantify that.","Brennan Hawken","And then a more broad question on the consumer efforts. I know that you can't really get into the details on the Apple card at this point, because it's not public. But when you guys initially talked about, or I guess I should say when Goldman initially talked about the consumer efforts, the idea was as a disrupter to establish players. And then I guess when we saw the card announcement, understanding that there is innovation embedded, card generally is viewed as lot more of a need to lending product. So can you, at a high level, frame how we should think about the consumer business and whether or not disrupter is still the right way to think about it, or growing a little bit more in line with establish players? And then in card specifically, tends to be a scale business. How should we think about this at Goldman over the coming years? How many partnerships do you want to ultimately have? Is this going to be a co-brand approach where competition is higher but stickiness better? Maybe some high level comments to help us think about that, going forward. Thanks.","Stephen Scherr","So I think judgments as to how disruptive the card will be, I think will be in the aisle of the holder once we launch it publically. And I think what you will find is a level of innovation that Apple is known for and that Goldman Sachs, as an innovator with some technology edge. And as David had said, the absence of legacy technology and importantly the absence of a legacy business will enable us to be and has enabled us to be innovative along with Apple as a partner. So I think you will see those and make your judgment at the time. But I think ingredient to us being disruptive is, as David laid out early in his prepared remarks, which is no incumbent business, no legacy technology, all of which lens to being more disruptive in a broad sense.","I think just wide now beyond the card to the broader consumer business that has been our intent all along, which is we're looking to build one coherent business, that is Marcus. There are verity of products, we started with a verity of projects. In each of them, we have looked at and looked for markets that are big where we don't need to capture commanding market share to be relevant. We've also looked at markets and at products where there were pain-points felt by the consumer. We've done that I think successfully but early in loans and now we're aiming to do that in the card space. And I think those are the mileposts that you should look for in the context of where we can be disruptive.","Finally, on your question of scale, I would say that scale as an objective is now playing out across the whole of the firm. We build scale in Marcus in our underwriting algorithms and platforms and in our delivery, not just to scale cards and deposits but now equally with respect to credit cards. And I think that orientation is a benefit to us in terms of how we build. I'd also say that the technology is useful in the context of other things that we're doing like corporate cash management. And so that's the general direction of traffic for the consumer business. But I think it reflects more broadly on the overall firm as David laid out in the presentation.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Michael Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Michael Mayo","Just in terms of delivering one firm, I think its pretty clear on the wholesale side but less so on the consumer side. And I know your intention is to change single-product relationships to multi-product relationships overtime. How long would that take? Is it one year, three years, five years, 10 year, because right now, it seems like single-product offerings, whether the upcoming credit card or deposits or loans. Thanks.","Stephen Scherr","You know from the beginning, our ambition here was to grow out a business, a common platform with multiple products, some we own, some we don't. And that's a process. We began obviously with two products, that being deposits and loans. But you need to begin somewhere and that's where we began. But we're now beginning to pull all of this together in the context of a common business and platform. And so I will give you an example of the delivery of the whole firm. In a very narrow context within consumer, we're already seeing the benefits of Clarity Money, which is bring integrated into the whole of the consumer effort. And so the take up of deposit account openings off of those who use Clarity Money is higher than what we had expected and what you might see in the industry, equally in the contest and the category of delivering the firm in consumer.","Make no mistake that bring together Marcus with our investment management division had a strategic component to it, which was we were a business that for many, many years obviously managed funds and managed asset for high net worth individuals. Bringing that DNA to bear as to how we will roll out a mass affluent platform is very real and has synergistic effect in terms of bringing those businesses together. And I'd also add that in the build of the mass affluent wealth business, the notion of having GSAM as the factory floor for products that we could offer is yet another example bringing all of Goldman Sachs to bear in the consumer space where there might be some doubt as to whether or not that had potential.","Michael Mayo","And then one I guess unrelated follow up. 1MDB, it seems like there is a very big bid-ask spead. Malaysia talking about $7 billion and I guess you've reserved less than $1 billion. And I know the investigation is onging, I know you can't interfere with the DoJ process. Having said that, what is there that you can do to facilitate the process? It seems like from what I can tell, Malaysia would like to have some resolution, you would like to have some resolution. Its a matter of coming up with some settlement. What are the obstetrical? What's under your control? Thanks.","David Solomon","So, first I would just say that nobody wants to get to resolution on this faster than we do. And we are absolutely committed to doing everything that we can to move the process along as quickly as possible. I think all I can say at this point is that the firm using its resources and what is available to us is working diligently and with urgency to reach a resolution. There are processes that exit in the process here and the process in Malaysia, they take more time than we necessarily as business people just doing a deal would like to see even through. But we're working at it and we'll reach resolution as quickly as possible. And unfortunately I'm just not in a position to give you more clarity on what I think that timing look like.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.","Devin Ryan","So first question here just on the mass affluent opportunity within Marcus, Ayco and other firm had corporate relationships, seem to provide a very strong customer acquisition channel. But I would think that you would also want to make sure that the platform is developed enough to get traction with those relationships. So I'm just trying to get little bit sense of the role out plan or timing of really going deeper into all those strong relationships. And whether this is already occurring or if you need more pieces to the puzzle of the platform and to trying to get a sense of timing here is as it's all coming together in real time?","Stephen Scherr","So on the development as the mass affluent business, I would say we are in the midpoint of the development plans in developing a blueprint as to how to go about this. I think what we've seen based on other efforts in this space is that this likely will be some mixed approach in the context of both technology and human engagement. I think that what's very clear to us is that place of work as a point of wealth aggregation is an interesting entry point in terms of gaining share and gaining position with perspective customers of this. Our view on the Ayco business is that we have in-house, as you suggest, a very real inconsequential business that for a long while had focused on the C-suite of very large corporations and has done an exceptionally good job in engaging there.","But I think that looking beyond the C-suite to several thousand employees that exist within a place of the employee and the ability to develop the business introduction that Ayco has carries enormous potential. And we're already seeing, for example, ways in which Ayco has been involved with a variety of companies in managing their wealth in the corporate sense, including discussions we've had and have been public about with respect to Google. So the take up in the place of work I think is an opportune place to engage. I'd also say that going back to the question that was raised earlier, looking at the range of different businesses, whether its savings or the loans business, or Clarity Money, are all entr\u00e9es and ingredients to generate momentum into a business. But Ayco is going to be a very significant entry point, because when you look at these consumer businesses, obviously, customer acquisition is a sticky cell in the model and solving for that is important. And I think we've got the early makings of where our entry point into that business can be.","Devin Ryan","And just a follow up here just around the plan to move 7,500 people from operations and engineering and specific businesses, I'm curious the individuals are already focusing on those businesses or was this just more of a geographic change just to better allocate expenses and their contribution? Or people actually going to become more focused in terms of what they do? And then I'm just trying to think about what the implications are from either earnings, returns or anything else for you can remind there.","Stephen Scherr","So I think this is largely about moving people who have an existing focus on that particular business. And the idea here is that we want to bring them closer to the front end of the business, such that where there are platforms or where there are processing issues that otherwise were call out to a separate division. This is now being done within the control of the business in house. Now whether or not that leads into greater cost efficiency and the like remains to be seen, but that's the objective. The objective is to put more control into the hands of the business to do it. I should also point out that there are certain aspects of engineering and of operations that are not going to move to the businesses, and that's in the control space. So people who are involved, for example in the movement of funds in or out of the firm, that's not going to move to a division. It's going to move -- it's going to stay square within my remit in the control sense.","I'd also point out that the overarching objective of moving these people into the businesses is really to improve the client experience that our clients and customers have with those businesses. If you look at the securities business, in particular and you look at the engagement that customers have had with us, it used to be entirely front end human intensive the sales person mattered and perhaps that was the person all that mattered. And this is changing. The way in which we look at overall trade flow from the beginning through to the middle and in the context of collateral management through to settlement, the place of operations in that chain now matters more than it's ever mattered in the past in the context of our engagement and the question of customer satisfaction and client satisfaction with the business. And in the early days of repositioning these people into, in this case, the securities division I think has paid considerable reward in terms of the satisfaction and the greater take on business that our business is capable of harvesting.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","David, you mentioned in the strategic review that you are looking to build value over the next three to five years. When we compare your business, specifically markets in Investment Banking as a percentage of revenue, it's obviously quite a bit higher than some of your peers like JP Morgan, Citigroup and Bank of America. Should investors expect that as a result of the review that those two businesses as a percentage of total revenue should flow closer to those competitors or will those still remain elevated?","Stephen Scherr","I think that you have to expect if you just look at the size and the scale of their more traditional banking operations and their consumer banking operation, it's going be more elevated than their businesses. But we're committed, as we had products and services and diversified in what we're doing to continue to expand and shift the make-up to a degree where we think it will continue to fall. But I don't think we can have any expectation that when you look at our footprint and the footprint of those big, for lack of a better term universal bank competitors that we're heading anywhere close to that direction quickly.","Operator","Your next question is from line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.","Marty Mosby","Two questions, one on NII. It now represents about 45% of your investing and lending revenues. And if you look at the growth rate of it, it's going to continue to push higher and it's much more sustainable in some of gains that you get in and out any the quarter in the other part of the business. Any thought about separating that out and calling at something else as you're building out the banking part of the business?","Stephen Scherr","Well, as I said at the start. Over the course of the next several months, we're going to take a long hard look at ways in which we can enhance disclosure, so as to meet the changing profile of our business and organization. And so we'll do our best. And as I said on the prior call, investing and lending is a bit of a challenge in the context of the forward view and where all of you have insight. And so we'll do we can to improve. What I will say in the context of the NII is that we paced last year at about $2.7 billion this year based on the quarter, we're looking at something closer to $3.3 billion. I will say that the economic consequence of that lending to the firm is greater than what that number indicates.","This is all franchise adjacent lending. It matters and is accretive to our PWM business. It matters and is accretive to our Investment Banking business. And so this lending is with clients and customers that we know well and has a tie into a series of linkages and adjacencies all-in throughout the firm. I would also point out that from a risk point of view, we continue to watch this obviously, in the context of the cycle and where we are. And to that end, we remain close to 85% secured in the context of this overall book. And so we're pleased with the direction of traffic here and we'll do our best to make sure that we put reporting around it that meets everybody's needs.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Al Alevizakos with HSBC. Please go ahead. ","Al Alevizakos","So you've mentioned plenty of times that you're consider yourself a technology firm. And clearly, you have embarked in a plethora of exciting new ventures. So in my view likely we can already see some of the amount of money that you put and the P&L impact for increased technology and amortization. However, at the same time, you remain one of the few U.S. players not to give out an explicit IT budget figure, or at least provide us with a split between the run the bank and change the bank IT spending. Would you be able to provide either number this time around? Thank you.","Stephen Scherr","So we will over time look to give you greater insight into the overall spend and the cost of spend in the disclosure that we will give you. I would say that we are investing, as you rightly point out, a considerable amount of money both in the run the bank and the change of bank. The run the bank is in the context of the introduction of platforms and the development of, for example, an institutional digital platform like Marquee. Whereas I said in my comments, this has the potential to create considerable stickiness and the use by customers and clients on an API basis of that platform where they consume content and data and ultimately look to trade with us. And so we're spending money in a platform like this. I'd also say that in Marcus we have given out some numbers around that. So at the end of '18, we had spent roughly about $1 billion in that. We're now at about $1.1 billion that as it relates to all of the consumer initiatives that are at play. But we aim to be more disclosive going forward in terms of the overall context of disclosure around our investment spend in these various technologies.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.","Brian Kleinhanzl","I just have one question that was on the IB backlog. If you could just walk through some of what was the driver and the drop quarter-on-quarter? And now that you're into more certain about macro environment without the government shutdown and all that, would you expect it to increase from here? Thanks.","Stephen Scherr","So the decrease in the overall backlog was largely a reflection of the bookings in the quarter in connection with M&A activity that was close and ultimately fees booked. And obviously that moves just mechanically out of backlog and into the P&L. We continue to see, as David had suggested earlier, a fairly consistent and robust level of dialogue on future M&A activity, which is buoyed both by where asset prices are, the continued attractiveness of financing. And so our expectation is that we would see that backlog rebuild in the context of it. I would point out that within the backlog we saw an uptick in the backlog in equities, so this is IPO related activity.","And I spoke probably about our expectation in the quarter for a number of big tech IPOs to come. And so that backlog tends to fluctuate depending upon bookings, but we feel pretty good in terms of direction of traffic of the business itself. The one other thing I would say just on backlog is that, on an historical basis, it still remains very, very high for the business overall. And so I think that while we often look at quarter-to-quarter movement in the backlog, it's equally important to pull the lens out a bit and just at it historically.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Andrew Lim with Societe Generale. Please go ahead.","Andrew Lim","Thanks for taking my questions, and I appreciate very much the extra disclosure that you've given. But I'm still struggling to understand some trends, especially in I&L, so on the equity side for four quarter now, we have had declining I&L net revenues. I was wondering if you could give some color on the main drivers behind that. And I'm trying to square that with the carrying value of the portfolio versus the market value with respect to private equity. And then I'll just give you my follow on question in I&L as well on the debt security side. You've had this really big 30% increase in net interest income over the course of the year. I was wondering if you could give some color as to how that improvement that's come about through and expansion in asset yields versus an expansion and liability yields that you saw at your wholesale funding for customer deposits. And how we might expect that to improve going forward as you continue to raise customer deposits, let's assume that asset yield stay flat going forward just for the sake of argument, if you continue to raise customer deposits. How can we expect that $8 million to $35 million to increase over coming quarters?","Stephen Scherr","So let me take your two questions if you don't mind in the inverse. I will start with the second one, which is on the debt I&L, and the growth in net interest income. Consistent with my response to the question earlier, you should consider seeing that continue to grow. As I mentioned earlier, client adjacent lending that serves a number of different businesses around the firm. And I think that the margin that we will see on that lending will only improve to the extent that we further diversify as we have laid-out as a strategic priority the overall funding mix of the firm. And so as and to the extent that we engage in this lending through the bank, we can avail ourselves of lower cost funding provided by retail deposits, which were obviously growing as I've had mentioned now several times in the call.","So I think you'll see NII increase. It will increase both in terms of volume by virtue of the adjacencies that it poses to the firm and equally the margin will increase to the extent that we avail ourselves of lower cost funding. On the first part of your question about the equity I&L, again it's important to understand that as you see on the chart, this is a portfolio that skews demonstrably toward private equity and not public. And as that trend line has happened, you see less price action by virtue of the public equity markets than you otherwise would. Where we hold public equity is obviously those are marked and priced relative to where the observable public price is on that particular equity. In private equity positions, this doesn't always run and skew and hone relative to public market prices. So this is very event driven. You may see up or down movement in the private equity portfolio occasioned by some event where we might sell a possible. It might be that there is another round of equity investing at a different valuation level that causes us to remark that. There may be performance that proves positive in a given company that causes us to remark that position. So it's very event driven. It doesn't necessarily hone to what you see in terms of public equity prices. And as a consequence, it can be high or low in any given quarter and not necessarily correlating to public price movement.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.","Stephen Scherr","Okay. Since there are no further questions, I would like to take a moment to thank everyone for joining the call. On behalf of our senior management team, we hope to see many of you in the coming months. If any additional questions arise in the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out to Heather otherwise, enjoy the rest of your day. And we look forward to speaking with you on our second quarter call in July.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call.

My name is Dennis, and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, July 16, 2019. Thank you.","Ms. Miner, you may begin your conference.","Heather Miner","Good morning. This is Heather Kennedy Miner, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. On this call, we will reference our earnings presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our Web site at www.gs.com. No information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures appear in the earnings release and presentation. This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent.","Today on the call, I'm joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon; and our Chief Financial Officer, Stephen Scherr. David will start with a high level review of our financial performance, the current operating environment, give an update on several recent strategy decisions and discuss our stress test results. Stephen will then cover second quarter results across each of our businesses. They will be happy to take your questions after that.","I'll now pass the call over to David. David?","David Solomon","Thanks Heather. And thanks everyone for joining us this morning. I am very happy to be here with you. Let me begin on Page 1. We reported second quarter 2019 revenues of $9.5 billion, down slightly versus last year, but nonetheless reflecting solid franchise performance amid a mixed operating environment. ","Net earnings were $2.4 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $5.81. All in, we posted return on equity of 11.1% and a return on tangible equity of 11.7%. Our business performed well and remained solidly positioned for future growth. In Investment Banking, we ranked number one in global announced and completed M&A and number one in global equity underwriting year-to-date.","Our equity market making business delivered its second highest quarter in four years, and our franchise continues to generate broad based market share gains across regions. We produced the quarterly I&L revenues in eight years, aided by significant gains from our private equity investment - investing activities reflecting our ability to source opportunities for the firm and our clients, and record net interest income in debt I&L which annualizes the $3.5 billion.","Lastly, our assets under supervision increased by over $60 billion to another record of $1.7 trillion.","Turning to Page 2, our second quarter results were generated on an operating backdrop that presented both opportunities and challenges. This quarter perhaps more than others reflected changing market sentiment in each of the three component months. Against this shifting sentiment, we continued to witness relatively solid underlying economic fundamentals. This year, we expect real GDP growth of approximately 2.5% in the US and 3.4% globally. European growth remains a bit more subdued at about 1.5%. As recently reported, China is running in the low 6% range, slower than it has been in many years, but still supportive of global growth.","All in while slowing, the global macro backdrop remains broadly constructive. The strong fundamentals that prevailed across markets were nonetheless overshadowed for most of the second quarter by geopolitical uncertainty. Client activity in April turned quiet amid low volatility particularly in fixed income markets. Conditions in May deteriorated as geopolitical events caused significant shift in risk appetite. Fears of expanding trade wars drove concerns that new tariffs in China and Mexico would erode the prospects for continued growth.","In response, equity volatility then increased; global markets turned risk off, the US yield curve inverted, and client activity slowed across a variety of products as our corporate and investment clients stayed on the sidelines. The trade issues also catalyzed concern among global central banks prompting dovishness with the Bank of Japan and the ECB emphasizing potential further stimulus and the US market is now anticipating multiple Fed rate cuts this year. The articulated dovish sentiment spurred a relief rally and increased client optimism and activity albeit late in the quarter. This set up June to be a stronger backdrop to close out the quarter.","The market sentiment in June has continued through today. We've seen a pause in the US-China trade war, accommodative views from central banks, and continued march upward in global equity markets. Credit financing markets remain open and strategic transactions are getting announced. As we look ahead, we remain cautious on the geopolitical front, but optimistic given the resiliency of global markets. Importantly, our clients' long-term needs for advice, financing, and access to markets endure across cycles.","Switching gears, I'd like to provide some insights on two important strategic decisions we made in the second quarter and our alternatives in wealth management businesses. First, on alternatives, which is our core strengths for Goldman Sachs for the past 30 years, we recently completed an internal reorganization of our investing activities across the firm. More specifically, we have realigned our special situations group, real estate, merchant banking, and several other investing platforms under common merchant banking business.","We have a world-class investing franchise with a strong track record, unique sourcing and execution capabilities, and long-standing relationships with the largest institutional investors. Going forward, these teams will operate across four asset classes; private equity, growth equity, private credit, and real estate. By bringing together our investment professionals, we will accelerate our ability to raise significant third party capital. We expect this change will enable us to generate more durable recurring fee based revenues over time. This will be a transition. We are mindful of protecting the revenue potential of these businesses as we grow third party assets.","Second, we announced plans to acquire United Capital, registered investment advisor with approximately $25 billion in assets under supervision, 220 advisers and 90 offices around the country. United Capital represents a key step forward toward our long-term strategic goal of providing comprehensive wealth management services to individuals across the wealth spectrum. Upon closing the transaction today, United Capital will become a powerful complement to our Ayco business, our leading financial executive counseling and investment advisory business, which serves many of the largest corporations in the United States.","We are excited about the incremental scale that United Capital brings, allowing us to serve a broader set of wealth management clients. On a combined basis, Ayco and United Capital will serve clients with over $80 billion of assets under supervision, representing a strong base from which to grow our mass affluent wealth franchise. It remains ambitious -- it remains our ambition to continue to serve ultra-high net-worth individuals through our longstanding PWM business. Individuals with $1 million to $5 million of investable assets through Ayco and the broader mass affluent segment through a hybrid of digital and human engagement as an extension of markets over time.","Before turning the call over to Stephen, I would like to spend a moment on the recent Federal Reserve stress test result released in late June, which showed bank\u2019s ability to withstand over $400 billion stress losses. Overall, the industry fared well in this year's examination. From where I sit, the results of the stress test clearly demonstrate the overall safety and soundness of the US financial system. We also appreciate the ongoing efforts to increase the transparency of the test and very much agree with the Fed's overall assessment that the US banking system is sufficiently well capitalized to support the economy even after a severe shock.","Turning specifically to our performance on the 2019 CCAR examination. As you are now therefore aware, we disclosed the Federal Reserve did not object to our plan of up to $8.8 billion of capital return including a 0.47% increase on our quarterly common stock dividend. This change reflects the board and management view that dividend growth is a critical component to delivering strong shareholder returns, and reflects our progress over recent years increasing more durable fee-based revenues to support the higher dividend.","Lastly, I would like to briefly touch on our strategic communication plan over the coming quarters. Importantly, we continue to work toward providing a strategic update this coming January and we'll share a specific date once confirmed. This update will include the financial targets for the firm to which we will hold ourselves accountable and a broader review of our business strategy.","With that I will turn it over to Stephen to walk through the results in each of our businesses.","Stephen Scherr","Thanks David. Let's run through the numbers. Let me begin on Page 3 of the presentation. As David mentioned, the environment in the second quarter turned out to be mixed. Against this backdrop, we continue to serve our clients and focus on executing on our strategic priorities.","Let's run through the numbers in detail. Moving on to Page 4, Investment Banking produce net revenues of $1.9 billion, 3% versus the first quarter and down 9% versus a robust year ago quarter. Financial Advisory revenues of $776 million were down 3% versus last year. During the quarter, we participated in announced transactions of approximately $465 billion and closed on $235 billion of deal volume, contributing to our number one M&A league table rankings year-to-date. ","Client dialogues remain healthy and we are seeing momentum across sectors including TMT, healthcare and notably financials, which had been rather dormant for a number of years. Moving to underwriting, equity underwriting net revenues of $482 million improves significantly versus the first quarter which experienced the government shutdown and held roughly flat versus a strong quarter last year. Year-to-date, we ranked number one globally in equity underwriting supported by $16 billion of deal volume across over 100 transactions this quarter.","We held leadership roles and bringing many notable companies to the public markets during the quarter including Uber, Avantor, Pinterest and Slack.","Turning to Debt Underwriting, net revenues were $605 million, down 20% from a year ago. The second quarter last year included a number of significant contributions from investment grade and leveraged finance activity, which did not repeat to the same extent this quarter. Our deal flows in this quarter were consistent with trends across the industry, which reflected materially lower volumes in the loan market and lower activity in acquisition related financings, particularly with financial sponsors. Nonetheless, our franchise remains well-positioned with our high-yield league table rank rising to the number two spot year-to-date further reflecting our competitive strengths.","Our investment banking backlog decreased slightly versus the end of the first quarter as we monetized a portion of our pipeline through the completion of several large equity underwritings. Nonetheless, our backlog increased sequentially in both advisory and debt underwriting. And while markets can change quickly, we are optimistic that our clients will remain active in executing strategic transactions in the coming quarters given healthy levels of client dialogue and continued need to access financing markets.","Moving to Institutional Client Services on Page 5, net revenues were solid at $3.5 billion in the second quarter down 3% versus last year, as our diversified business experienced low client activity in FICC, offset by strength in equities. FICC client execution net revenues were $1.5 billion in the second quarter, down 13% year-over-year reflecting both the mix operating environment and generally lower client activity despite notable strength in Europe.","Overall, the opportunity set presented in the second quarter proved more challenging versus a year ago. Specifically, we saw lower volumes in our macro businesses amid low volatility and shifting client sentiment sentiment. Relative to last year, client activity and rates and currencies including emerging markets was more subdued as trade and tariff concerns more than economic data drove sentiment and constrained client engagement. Uncertainty during the quarter around the timing and magnitude of anticipated rate cuts by the Fed was also a contributing factor. As tariff threats lessened and the direction of rates became more apparent, we saw improved client activity, particularly late in the quarter. In currencies, both implied and realized volatility in major FX pairs stood at historic lows throughout the quarter, resulting in very low activity levels among our clients.","Commodities performance by contrast was a positive. Results increased year-over-year on solid contributions from our industrial products, oil, and gas and power businesses. In our micro businesses, we saw lower activity and credit but better results in mortgages. In credit, issuance activity and our inventory levels were down relative to a year ago, as investors remain more cautious following the spread widening experienced at the end of 2018 and grew more discerning in credit exposure selection. We saw lower structured finance client activity versus a year ago, while closing credit came alongside a more muted origination backdrop particularly in investment grade debt and leveraged loans as I had mentioned earlier.","Separately, mortgage revenues increase amidst better performance. The environment notwithstanding and as I have said previously, we are investing heavily to automate our workflows, serve our clients electronically, monitor our cost base and deliver structured solutions in capital efficient formats.","Turning to equities on Page 6. Net revenues for the second quarter were $2 billion, up 14% sequentially and up 6% versus a year ago. We believe our success reflects our continuing consolidation of global market share and a dedication to serving clients across a full suite of cash, derivatives and prime services in both hi touch and low touch channels. Equities client execution net revenues of $772 million increased 13% relative to the first quarter and were up 12% versus a year ago. Results were aided by stronger performance in both cash and derivatives versus the second quarter of 2018.","Net revenues from commissions and fees were $777 million, up 9% sequentially aided by strength in EMEA. We also continue to grow market share in low touch execution. Security services net revenues of $458 million rose 24% sequentially and 5% year-over-year. Sequential improvement was driven by seasonal trends and a rebound in average client balances as sentiment improved.","Moving to Investing and Lending on Page 7. Collectively our activities in I&L produced net revenues of $2.5 billion in the second quarter. Equity securities generated robust net revenues of $1.5 billion, driven by company specific events like IPOs and the performance of corporates in the portfolio contributing revaluations. Second quarter results were up 20% versus a year ago, primarily reflecting higher net gains from public equities. As you can see on the slide, approximately 25% of our net revenues were from real estate and 75% were from our corporate investments. Within the corporate portfolio, nearly half of the performance came from investments that went public during the quarter.","These results included a gain of approximately $375 million from the IPO of Tradeweb. Our investment in Tradeweb which we've owned since 2008 was accounted for under the equity method given our significant influence at the time of the investment. As a consequence, we did not recognize revaluation P&L on Tradeweb over the time of our investment. In addition to trade web, we would draw your attention to several other notable investments that IPO this quarter, including Avantor, Uber, and HeadHunter, which grew the notional size of our public holdings. Taken together, these four investments represent approximately 55% of our $2.6 billion public investment portfolio.","Turning to Page 8, net revenues from Debt Securities and Loans were $989 million, included $872 million of net interest income and modest mark-to-market gains. Our total loan portfolio was $98 billion, up $2 billion sequentially, driven by corporate loan growth and we note 82% of our total loan portfolio is secured. Our credit provision was $214 million, down 4%versus last quarter. Our firm wide net charged-off ratio remains low at approximately 60 basis points.","On Page 9 turning to Investment Management, we produced $1.6 billion of revenues in the second quarter, driven by our diversified global asset management business and leading Private Wealth franchise. Net revenues included management and other fees of $1.4 billion which were up 5% versus the first quarter and up 4% versus last year, reflecting continued growth in assets under supervision. By contrast, we generated significantly lower incentive fees relative to the outsize $316 million last year. Incentive fees in the second quarter of last year were driven by the timing of realizations and performance across a variety of our alternative investment funds.","We also saw lower transaction revenues from PWM client trading activity. Assets under supervision finished the quarter at a record $1.7 trillion, up $61 billion versus the first quarter, driven by $17 billion of long-term net inflows, $12 billion of liquidity inflows and $32 billion of market appreciation.","Now let me turn to expenses on Page 10. Our total operating expenses of $6.1 billion were flat versus the second quarter of last year, reflecting lower litigation and lower compensation and benefits expense, offset by increased expense for technology and consolidated investments. For the year-to-date, total expenses were $12 billion, down 6% year-over-year. Our year-to-date efficiency ratio was 65.6%, up 100 basis points versus a year ago, driven by lower revenues and ongoing investments, partially offset by lower compensation expense.","On the topic of investment spend, as we've spoken in the past, cumulatively we are making very substantial organic investments to build new businesses and digital platforms. The depth of that investment cycle will be in 2019 and 2020. Investment spending will continue into 2020 when we will also see more meaningful impact of the reserve build supporting our initial growth in the Apple Card following our expected launch later this summer.","Year-to-date, the total pretax cost from Markus, Apple Card and our new transaction banking platform is approximately $275 million resulting in a drag of roughly 60 basis points on our ROE. A cumulative pretax loss for these businesses from the inception of each through the second quarter was approximately $1.3 billion which has been embedded in the performance of the firm. As these businesses scale over the coming years, this drag should not only reverse, but become an accretive contributor to the firm's ROE.","Next on taxes. Our reported tax rate was 23% for the quarter and 20% for the year-to-date including discrete tax benefits in the first quarter. We continue to expect our full year 2019 tax rate to be consistent with our medium-term estimate of approximately 22% to 23%. On the compensation ratio, our philosophy remains steadfast to our principles obtain for performance. Reduction in the year-to-date ratio to 36% is a reflection as always of our best estimate of the compensation accrual for the firm, which for the full year 2018 was just below 34%. Also as we have noted in the past, as we grow more scale and platform driven businesses, it is our expectation that compensation will decline as a proportion of total operating expenses and the efficiency ratio will become a more relevant measure for the firm.","These platform businesses should carry higher and marginal margins at scale and be less reliant on compensation as a cost contributor.","Turning to capital on Page 11. Our common equity tier 1 ratio was 13.8% using the standardized approach and 13.5% under the advanced approach. The ratio is each increased by 10 basis points versus the first quarter driven by higher retained earnings. Our SLR was 6.4 % flat sequentially. In the quarter, we returned a total of $1.6 billion to shareholders including stock repurchases of $1.25 billion and $319 million in common stock dividends. Our basic share count ended the quarter at another record low of 372 million shares. Our book value per share was $214, up 10% versus a year ago.","As David mentioned, we are pleased that the Federal Reserve did not object to our 2019 capital plan of up to $8.8 billion of total capital return, including share repurchases of up to $7 billion, 40% higher than last CCAR cycle. While we continue to assess capital return in the context of the market environment and opportunities for accretive investment in our business consistent with our long-held strategy, we are encouraged by the increased flexibility afforded by our strong capital position. We enjoy the option of returning a significant portion of our earnings to shareholders over the coming year.","Following our successful completion of the Federal Reserve's annual stress test, let's spend a moment reviewing our philosophy on capital. First our long-term view on capital allocation remains unchanged. We first look for opportunities to invest in our business at attractive returns to the extent we have access after these investments, we will endeavor to return it to shareholders. Second with respect to dividends versus buybacks, we aspire to having a higher dividend long term. As it's an important component of total shareholder return and it's further reflective of the firm's confidence in our ability to generate more recurring and predictable sources of revenue.","That said we continue to value the flexibility of share repurchases as they allow us to be more dynamic with capital allocations based on the environment and business opportunities. Third regarding the stress capital buffer, based on our calculations and the proposed rule which may differ materially in its final form, we estimate an SCB of approximately 5.5% based on the 2019 stress test results. This would imply a total CET1 requirement excluding management buffers in the neighborhood of 12.5% to 13%, which compares favorably to our second quarter 2019 standardized ratio of 13.8%. While we view the CCAR authorization as a ceiling and not a floor on the amount of capital we will return, we are pleased to note that the $8.8 billion capacity should position the firm well to manage capital at appropriate levels.","Turning to Page 12 for balance sheet and liquidity. Our balance sheet was $945 billion, up $20 billion versus last quarter. On the liability side deposits increased to $166 billion including consumer deposits of over $50 billion, which we have more than doubled since last year. During the quarter, we saw further progress migrating businesses into our bank entities to take advantage of their more diversified and lower-cost funding. Our global core liquid assets averaged $225 billion during the quarter, which we continue to note may decline as we have opportunities to support client demand.","Before taking questions, a few brief closing thoughts. While our second quarter performance was solid despite the mixed operating environment, we believe as David said, the overall economic growth backdrop should remain supportive of our business. As we go forward, we are executing diligently on three core objectives. One, serving our clients with excellence and growing our existing business. Two, diversifying our business into adjacent and new businesses and three, operating more efficiently in all that we do. If we do these things well, we are confident we can deliver strong, long-term returns for our shareholders.","With that, thank you again for dialing in. I will now open up the line for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","And your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","GlennSchorr","Thanks very much. Maybe to start with a real quickie, you mentioned providing a strategic update this coming January. I'm curious what form you're thinking about meaning Investor Day, update slides on the call things like that?","DavidSolomon","So thanks, Glenn and good morning. I appreciate the question. We're committed to giving a strategic update and in particular providing targets in January. As we're working towards this fall when we know the exact format and also the specific date, we'll communicate it.","GlennSchorr","Okay, well as long as the numbers are good I'm cool. In I&L, I'm curious I know you're going through the process of consolidating the businesses and I'm sure there's some challenges there, but my question is on you've always been good at this but I feel like managing conflicts between advisor, balance sheet investment, and third party funds will just even be that much harder as you bring this all together and grow third party. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about that. And how you will allocate investments across on balance sheet versus third party, things like that?","DavidSolomon","Sure, and I appreciate the question. It's obviously something we spend a lot of time thinking about. We have spent a lot of time thinking about it because when you look at these businesses which in the past had been organized over multiple parts of the firm. We're now internally reorganizing them and bringing them together but we've been doing this for 30 years. We are one of the largest alternative asset managers in the world. We manage a very, very significant amount of third party and client capital. And I can say that there are issues from time to time to come out of this business model, but we're focused on striking the right balance and have proven over the long period of time that I think we can do this consistently.","I think one of the things that you get by streamlining the organization and facing our clients as an integrated operation is it actually should make this process, the decision-making process easier and more clear. And so, we recognize it's something that we will have to continue to do well over a long period of time. We are -- I was talking to our clients and listening to our clients and they feel bringing the businesses together and organizing them, et cetera , will help us do that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Bolu with Autonomous. Please go ahead.","ChrisBolu","Good morning David and Stephen. Just on the targets, we look forward to getting your targets in January but how should we think about the timeframe for achieving targets? Are you setting targets you can meet over the next one to two years? Or should we be looking for more long-term aspirational targets that could take more like five years to get to?","Stephen Scherr","Thanks Christian. I would say that the targets that we will focus on will be both returns and equally efficiency and in the course of putting those out our timeframe will be over the medium to longer term. We're in the midst as I said in the prepared remarks of making some meaningful investments in the business. The depth of that is going to be over the course of this year and into 2020 and the returns on that will play out over the medium term. And so the targets will be that. Along the way, we'll continue to point out as we did on this call with greater clarity as to the precision of what it is we're spending and what we're spending for, and the direction of travel and the type of returns we expect to get.","But in that we're investing in particular businesses like the Apple Card, like Marcus, like transaction banking. Those will have return profiles. Equally, we're investing in platforms that will bring greater efficiency to existing businesses. Those two should have return profiles to them perhaps even inside some of the projects we have. But we will give you the medium-term targets, but take you along in terms of what plays out between now and then.","ChrisBolu","Great. Thank you very much. And then on the alternatives business, so we\u2019re excited to see what this looks like when you bring it all together. I don't know if you could help us just preview maybe the size when you put all the strands together kind of what the size and maybe the growth profile of that business looks like today. And then as you look to maybe compete more against alternative asset managers, so that we were tricking one here, but how do you balance the sort of the delicate issue of doing what's right for Goldman versus competing against like a key clientele?","DavidSolomon","Sure. So first, with respect to the business broadly, we plan to operate across four broad asset classes that we operate in today currently. And that includes private equity. That includes growth equity, private credit, and also real estate. And so over time, we will provide more transparency to you on the assets that currently exist in all four of these channels, which are significant and to our aspirations over time to increase the amount of third-party capital that we manage in these different asset classes.","With respect to the balance and operating this, as I said to the previous question, we've been doing this for 30 years. These businesses are very significant in size right now. We have said publicly that when you look at the businesses that we operate here collectively, they make us one of the top five alternative asset managers in the world today. And so we will continue to navigate and execute that the same way we have over the last 30 years in a very, very significant business. And the fact that we're internally reorganizing it, so that we can better serve our clients does not change the process that we've executed on for a very, very long period of time.","Stephen Scherr","The one other -- one other point I'll add to respond to your question is that David rightly points out this will be a transition. During that transition we do not anticipate a revenue shortfall by this movement. Meaning, we'll maintain balance sheet with the flexibility of reallocating balance sheet into different of these sleeves. As David pointed out and it's also worth noting that different sleeves whether it's credit, real estate with respect to for example equity carry different capital density and the opportunity to realize higher returns on the balance sheet deployed will be there.","So we're very well aware of maintaining the revenue flow that's here and as David pointed out this will be a transition over time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","MichaelCarrier","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. First one just on capital, so you receive the approval for more buybacks plus the dividend capital ratios have improved a lot. You're doing some on the M&A front, still investing in the business. So I guess just looking for some color on if this is sustainable, meaning being able to do everything given the repositioning of the balance sheet. Probably importantly where you are on that front particularly within like the FICC business and the alternative business.","Stephen Scherr","Sure. So I think it's fair to say as a general matter this year CCAR clearly demonstrates the direction of travel that we want to go in terms of overall capital return. And the scope of what we asked and what otherwise was approved reflects on our commitment to put capital back to shareholders. It's important to note those and as I said in the commentary, our posture has not changed. Meaning as stewards of capital we are looking at and for opportunities where we can invest in an accretive way to generate long-term shareholder return.","We're going to continue to do that and you see that in the investments that we're making. Away from that and in excess of it, will continue to return capital back to shareholders. And I think what played out in the context of CCAR is a reflection of what we are comfortable with in terms of what we're going to look to put out given where the market and circumstances are. On the question you raised about FICC, the focus for FICC not borne of this quarter in particular, but since we came on and started to look and re-underwrite the business has been around capital efficiency and equally cost in the context of delivering into our clients. And so that continues to be a focus of ours in terms of the franchise.","When you look at FICC in particular, I would say that the business is focused on clients in the context of expanding out the corporates, transaction banking and the like. It's focused on the development of platforms, the investment in those platforms such as Marquee, on-pricing engine and investment grade credit equally the e-commodities business and equally having the talent to be good calibrators of risk intermediating which is at the core. When we do this and we do this right and it is a core historical competency for the firm. We're going to continue to look at ways of accomplishing that and greater capital and cost efficiency.","MichaelCarrier","Okay, thanks and then just a follow-up question, just on this strategic review. I think there's a lot of focus on just sort of the revenue opportunities and where you guys are focused. Just given some of the investments and in the longer term to focus on the efficiency ratio, just wanted to get an update or run through some of the initiatives that are in place, and the progress you guys are making to lower the cost base and over time and improve the efficiency ratio.","Stephen Scherr","Sure. So I would -- I'll answer that in kind of two components. One is that the new business is being built whether that's the consumer business, credit card business is a part of it or transaction banking. Those businesses are intended to be built as scale businesses, meaning the compensation component attached to that is lower. You have cost and investment made such that the marginal margin in those businesses is operating at full scale continues to grow. And so you achieve greater efficiency on a higher revenue number that comes in. That's the way I would describe the newer initiatives.","The second component is what we're doing in and around the introduction of platforms and technology to our standing incumbent businesses. I just mentioned a few examples of what we're doing in FICC and in the securities business more broadly. These two are lowering the throughput of trades, it's lowering the ability or I should say the price point to engage with clients where they want to meet us, which is it's less human capital, it's more platform driven; it carries higher efficiency to it and that's the direction of travel.","I'd also say equally true about the incumbent businesses part of what we're doing in the Federation to support the businesses, including in places like compliance is the deployment of technology in order to render us more efficient such that we can support the businesses in a much more cost-efficient way than where we've been historically.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","StevenChubak","Hey, good morning. So appreciate the color on the stress capital buffer, certainly the 5.5% reinforces the strength of your capital position. Given your current ratio are 70 to 120 basis points above that you're likely to create additional capital over the next four quarters. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about sizing the appropriate management buffer? And maybe just philosophically what are some of the factors that will impact that calculus?","Stephen Scherr","Well, I think part of the calculus is the direction of travel right of where these regulations are. What the final SCB ruling looks like; equally there are inevitably variability that comes in fluctuation in CCAR results and the way in which stress is imposed. So we will maintain a buffer that's sort of mindful of those very abilities in the overall calculus itself. In terms of the general direction of capital sort of philosophically, it is -- it really is what I had laid out earlier and that is I think you should take the results in this CCAR in particular what we petitioned and what was left un-objected to by the Fed.","As the direction we'd like to go. We've got a lot on our plate in terms of investments that are being made, but we're quite confident under the circumstances of being able to put a reasonable amount of capital back. And I'd also point out that the dividend increase for this third quarter now approved by our board is a 47% jump in the dividend, which is also a reflection of the confidence in the increasing durability and profile of the revenues of the firm.","StevenChubak","Thank for that Stephen. And just one more for me on efficiency. You size the $1.3 billion investment in some of the newer initiatives, given you noted that investment spend will likely peaked in 2019 maybe the early part of 2020, I was hoping you could speak to whether we should expect to see some efficiency progress as early as 2020. And what's a reasonable expectation in terms of the marginal margin? I know the newer initiatives are tougher to assess, but maybe on some of the legacy businesses given some of the changes you plan to implement on the platforms there.","Stephen Scherr","Yes. So, look, obviously the efficiency ratio is in one part of function of revenue. So we'll see where the fortunes of the front take us. On the expense base, I think in the near term there is sort of quick to be realized certain cost efficiencies in our trading costs, meaning what's happening on platforms that are introduced that underpin incumbent businesses that are not looking for, if you will, new flows to command, but we're transacting with clients in a different manner and form than what we've done in the past, just one really small example. If you look at our investment grade business and you look at the bond pricing engine, we can then play both sides of a risk trade in a way that would have taken thousands of man-hours right in order to compute.","You would have had inefficiency in terms of its time value. Now we're able to provide a platform where the client can engage and look to conform and develop a portfolio on a much more efficient basis cost sufficient basis than what has happened in the past. So I think there's sooner efficiency or I should say efficiency to be realized sooner in the context of platforms underpinning incumbent businesses. There'll be a longer timeframe as you note in the context of realizing efficiency and some of the newer initiatives that we're building.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of wives of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","BetsyGraseck","Hi, good morning. A question on how you're thinking about consumer or credit? And I asked the question for two parts. One is the upcoming Applecart and then the markets portfolio. And on the Applecart, I know you can't go through details, we put some estimates together in a note recently where again based on a lot of assumptions, I end up with an expectation that you're running it about that you would expect to run somewhere around a 1% ROA. Now that's again a lot of assumptions but it's based on the information that's out there on lower rates for the credit quality versus peers, what peers are charging and no fee. And I --the nut of my question is how are you thinking about consumer lending?","Is it a business that you think is inherently more risky than your current business which is running at about a 1% ROA? Or do you -- do I have it wrong? What am I missing? And should this be a business that generates higher than a 1% ROA, that's basically another question.","Stephen Scherr","Sure, thank you. So let me start by saying there's no denying that the consumer business whether card or Marcus is a risk business, meaning no matter that it's delivered digitally or that the credit card will take a different digital sort of profile than traditional credit cards, this is a risk business and that's where our focus is. I would say the risk is not just on credit risk and financial risk, but equally operational risk in the context of what we're building. And so we're quite conscious on all of those elements. What's important for us is that we look at this on a risk-adjusted return basis not simply on a return on asset construct.","And that's what's critical and that's the way we're looking at it. It would be Betsy for me premature to sort of speculate what the pace of growth looks like on this. I would simply say that risk calibration risk decisions in and around the part belong entirely to Goldman Sachs as the bank. And we're set up to make those. I'd also say that if you look at the level and rate of growth in the Markus loan business, while it continues to grow and perform well, we have slowed the increasing growth in that in contemplation of taking on increasing consumer credit through the card business. So we look at it both in its totality, so each is marginally different in a way in which credit is dispersed. But this is a risk business and we'll continue to look at it as we grow it out on a risk-adjusted return basis.","BetsyGraseck","So on really that follow-up has to do with the expected at scale efficiency be that you think you're going to be running these businesses at when they're at scale, given the fact that you did a new build, should I be thinking about the efficiency and of these businesses in line with FinTechs which run at intermediate expense ratio that's 30% of other legacy competitors? Or should I look to bank competitors as a more reasonable expense ratio or somewhere in between?","Stephen Scherr","I would say that while we've been in beta now for a couple of months and have grown the portfolio on that basis, it's nowhere near yet the scale of what our expectations would be as we grow it out. And so it would be premature for me to kind of speculate as to the efficiency. We'll start to reflect more on that once we launch and once we start to build this portfolio out. So it's a little early. What I can tell you is that what we have built jointly with Apple both on the front end and on the back end is intended to be operationally resilient, but equally is intended to be efficient both in terms of the delivery the app, I should say the application all through the delivery and on the backend and so my expectation is that the efficiency will be reflected in that, but again premature to sort of put numbers around it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","MichaelMayo","Hi, to continue on the investment spend, as it relates to expansion of markets outside the US, where do you stand with the additional countries and what else might you consider?","Stephen Scherr","So I think on that Mike, the press has been sort of ahead of our plans in the context of speculating sort of the next country in which Marcus would expand. Obviously, our first place outside the United States was in the UK where the deposit platform has really exceeded our expectations in terms of what it's been capable of generating. There will be opportunities for us to expand in that market. There's been quite a bit of speculation about Germany. It's not surprising that the speculation goes there both in the context of a growing business that we have in continental Europe and the depth of the deposit market in Germany.","But it's too early to forecast as and if and when we would expand there though I understand the speculation on that. So for the moment we've got a lot on our plate in terms of the execution around the platform in the United States and in the UK and we'll continue to pursue that.","MichaelMayo","All right and then one follow-up unrelated question. 1MBD did you take any additional reserves for that? What's the status? There's a new statement by the head of the SEC on July 3rd saying that it might be a little bit easier to resolve these sorts of matters? What's your take on all this?","Stephen Scherr","So just on the reserves, we took incremental legal reserves this quarter of $66 million. We don't give detail on what the elements of that reserve are. I would say that we are adjusting our RPL to $2.5 billion from $2 billion where it was. I should point out that in providing that number to you it's important to recognize that number is our best estimate as of this date. It will be published in the Q events that may play out between now and the Q could alter that RPL. And again there are different accounting regimes and thresholds that apply; one probable, one possible, possible relating to the RPL.","And so that's what I can offer you by way of what's happened financially. In terms of statements otherwise being made, I think it would be inappropriate for me to sort of speculate on what others intend by statements they make. I think as we've said in the past, we're in a cooperative engagement with the authorities. We intend to stay that way and as and when there are further developments, we'll be in a position to talk about that a bit more.","Operator","Your next questions from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","KianAbouhossein","Hi. I have two questions. The first one is related to your equity revenues which were clearly very strong. Also gain some PS reporting so far. And I just want to understand where that's coming from? Because clearly the drivers are more muted such as volatility is down on the equity derivative world. Transactions a volume are okayish, but nothing in terms of the numbers that you have shown in terms of year-over-year and quarter-on-quarter rates. Can you just give a bit more color of where the drivers are? And do you see market share movements in this area?","And secondly just coming back to your FICC business. We've now heard from you over the last 12 to 18 months in expansion and more liquid products and traditional client base. And can you bit more detail on the FX and rates expansion both on clients and products? And when should we see actually some of those investments having an impact on your revenue base? Because I don't see you yet outperforming appears in this area, but clearly would be great to get an understanding if you are -- if you feel differently and why and what investments you're doing in order to close the gaps in those two sec?","DavidSolomon","So I'll start with equities. I make a broad comment on FICC and Steven will give you a little bit more detail. I--we were very pleased with the performance of equity franchise broadly. The performance really was across the franchise. It was throughout derivatives in cash, I would say given the market dynamics broadly, there's some sense of consolidating share and I think we've been benefit of that and as we've been stating on this call and over the handful of the last quarters, we continue to make the investments in our low touch activity or our low touch capabilities, and we're starting to see some benefits from those investments in our low touch capabilities.","With respect to FICC, broadly I do want to highlight as was highlighted I think on page 5 of the presentation, our business is 90% market intermediation, a much higher component of market intermediation than the people that we compete or we benchmark against. So if you have a 60\/40 mix and market intermediation is softer, which it clearly was given the environment we had this quarter, your NIM portion or your non market intermediation portion has less volatility, but we continue to make investments as you highlight in some of these products and particularly in broadening out the client base, I'd ask Stephen to provide just a little bit more detail on how we think some of that's point through.","Stephen Scherr","Thanks David. So just a pivot to FICC and to be direct to your question. If you look at FX and rates and part of the progress that we were making is on broadening out the client franchise to more corporates than to the institutional clients to which we typically, if not exclusively have engaged. And we're starting to see some early progress in that. I would say in this quarter in particular within Europe. I'd also say that as part of an effort to expand out and penetrate further the corporate base around FX and rates, we're seeing some benefit come to us by way of the joint venture between banking and FICC, where banking obviously owns an entry point into the corporates and the ability to carry through those products into the corporate franchise, where we have a demonstrably strong set of relationships, I think will bear dividend.","What's more I would say that if you look at a variety of different initiatives and builds including transaction banking or corporate cash management, this once built and will carry the potential to bring forward a more captive FX business that didn't exist inside the firm. I think that too could prove to be a benefit and just on that particular project Goldman Sachs is already a customer, if you will, of our own platform and we aim to bring customers and clients on in across 2020. And so we're seeing early signs of progress on this, but there's no running from the observation you make which is we have yet to sort of perform at the potential we're confident this business can show.","We're very confident in unlocking that potential. Some of these new initiatives will no doubt take a little bit of time before they bear out, but the direction we're moving is a positive one.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.","BrennanHawken","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. NII as a portion of the I&L debt portfolio, could you maybe help us think about rate sensitivity there? Depending on how you calculate NIM, if it's a 360 or 365 day count NIMs down either a few or upper single digits bps quarter-over-quarter. What are the benchmark rates, gents, predominantly in that portfolio we should watch? How much of the strong NII growth that you guys have seen over the past few years has been balanced versus rate? And then how should we think about how the softening rate environment might impact NII growth going forward? Thanks.","Stephen Scherr","Sure. Thanks for the question. I think the best way to answer that question is to just point out where we differ, if you will, from some of the bigger commercial banks. In the context of both, we have a different liability mix and equally a different composition to our assets. On the liability side, there's a portion of our funding that's fixed to portion that's floating. And so it's not as dynamically correlated, if you will, to the way in which rates otherwise move. ","And I think our NII growth generally speaking will benefit from a liability mix that's starting to skew towards deposits. And so that's the perspective I would offer on the liability side. On the asset side, much of the assets that we have are floating rate based and equally and importantly is a higher velocity term to the assets that underlie this. And that too has a more or leads to a more muted impact to what otherwise might see in some of the bigger commercial banks as a function of the direction in which rates are moving.","BrennanHawken","Okay and then the part on how much we've seen as far as rate or NIM improvement versus balances last year's? Is it possible to break that down or is that some might have to follow up?","Stephen Scherr","I think I would encourage you to follow up sort of with for an answer that's more precise than one I can give you now. I would say that some of this has to do with balances in terms of the size and scope recognizing that the lending that we're doing which is generating this net interest income is quite strategic in the context of the clients that are served by the lending itself. And I'd also point out as I did in the remarks that about 82% of this is secured financing. And so I offer that to you but Heather and the team can provide you with greater insight onto the particulars.","Operator","Your next questions from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","JimMitchell","Hey, good morning. Maybe just a quick follow up on the fixed-income discussion. Just want to make sure I understand how you get your assumed internal ROE targets in that business. Is it you see it entirely coming from efficiency improvements and expanding the footprint into more flow business or is there some component of capital that comes out whether it's derivatives or something else? Do you need to see the level of capital decline as well or can it come from those other ways?","Stephen Scherr","Sure. So the way we've been looking at it as we've been scrutinizing and re underwriting that business is we're focused on both the numerator and the denominator of the ROE calculation, meaning it's important that nobody lose focus that we need to mind how much revenue is coming in, i.e. how do we want to define the tangible market that we face. What's the revenue capture that we can take in? What's the expense as an offset to that revenue to establish the numerator in the calculus? And none of that is to ignore capital efficiency in the context of what the denominator contains.","So this is really as we've talked about it a wholesale re-underwriting of the business, but be assured both of these are in scope in the context of the way in which we're looking at the business. Both revenue net of expense and looking at capital and the revenue being driven largely by an ambition to have a more expansive addressable market to include corporates in addition to that which we otherwise have focused on historically.","JimMitchell","And as you pull that capital out it, did you worry at all there's any kind of revenue risk in that pivot to a lower capital or denominator or do you feel that's not really the case?","Stephen Scherr","No. I mean, listen, this never is kind of a linear calculus, okay. So the business is for us in FICC are not themselves four-walled, meaning anything we do with respect to a business and FICC has knock-on implications for businesses that sit outside the securities business. Take for example whatever it is we decide to do around credit or commodities, it has knock-on implications. So the thread on the adjacency of all of our businesses gets pulled. So we're mindful of that and need to take stock of what we do around capital. The one other thing I would point out, which I've talked about publicly before is in addition to thinking about both the numerator and the denominator.","Embedded in the numerator is equally an effort to sort of optimize our own funding, meaning how do we bring our cost of funds down, retail deposits has been an example of that, but our treasury team is working hard both in terms of the amount of liquidity we run with? How that liquidity is managed in addition to identifying more efficient, lower-cost funding sources in order to render these businesses more competitive.","Operator","Your next question comes from a line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.","DevinRyan","Great. Good morning, David and Stephen. First question just on the United Capital with the deal closing, just look to maybe get a little more perspective on how you're thinking about the business opportunity. I guess broadly and as it connects with Ayco is there a bigger appetite to expand into the mass affluent segments whether it be adding financial advisors or more M&A? Or does United Capital really give you just a big enough footprint to achieve what you're looking to do in the business especially with Ayco?","DavidSolomon","Sure. I appreciate the question. We're excited actually, today, I believe we're closing the United Capital acquisition on this very day. And obviously it brings with us our 220 RIAs and 90 offices around the United States. And what it's really doing is we think we have a very, very interesting channel to continue to build the mass affluent segments through Ayco. But this particular transaction accelerates our ability to do that between Ayco and United Capital of $80 billion of assets under management that's a good base from which you grow from.","We think we can continue to make progress in what we'll call the $1 million to $5 million of investable assets mass affluent wealth management category through this channel. And that we can have good growth with the extended platform we now have. But if another opportunity came up that we sought to further accelerate it because this is still a very fragmented business, and we have a very, very big infrastructure, so we can continue. The fee in terms of all the wealth, in terms of all the asset management and wealth management products, we have in our asset management business, we'll consider it.","This was not something, this acquisition was not something that was targeted for a year that we were really running after it, it came up for sale, we looked at it, we thought it was a really good fit to accelerate our business. And so we decided to act on it.","DevinRyan","Got it, very helpful, thanks. And then just a follow up just to think about the third party alternative capital fundraising. Any expectations on whether it could be trajectory or cadence of how we should be thinking about that just as we're sort of think about modeling it?","DavidSolomon","Yes. I appreciate the question, Devin. I know that you're all anxious to model it. Over time, we will provide a lot more transparency on how we see that plan went out. As you would expect, we have a lot of businesses across the firm we put them together. And the first thing you do when you put those people together is you task them to develop plans on a go-forward basis. And we are in the process of that and as those plans come forward we will be more communicative and transparent as to what expectation we think you can have with that business over time.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.","GerardCassidy","Thank you. Good morning. In your comments on the debt underwriting you mentioned deal flows in the quarter were consistent with the trends across the industry, which reflected material lower volumes in the loan market and M&A activity area. And you specifically cited it was with the financial sponsors. Can you share with us what are the financial sponsors seeing today? What do you think will stop them from doing more deal activity in the quarter? And any outlook for the second half of the year from those financial sponsors?","DavidSolomon","Well, look, at a high-end there's now -- at a high level, there is no question that activity has been more muted. I guess when you think about the cycle and you think about the continued run at equity markets and the accommodative monetary policy we have which is certainly inflated for assets, it's steady, it's been tougher more competitive, you have to pay more in order to succeed. I also think the financing environment in particular the SNIP regulatory overlay, it has some impact over this cycle and muting how far the private equity activity they have moved in this cycle has a regulatory environment been difference.","That said the private equity investors still have an enormous arsenal of unspent capital big reserve. And I think this business continues that secular growth and so as the environment evolves, I think there will be periods of time where we will see increased activity versus what we've seen in the first half of the year. I don't think we have a great explanation of this specifically has done it. I mean if you think about what the first and a half of the year has brought in terms of the macro overlay, it's not surprising probably that it's not a little bit more muted.","GerardCassidy","Very good and then as a follow-up on slide 12 you give us your balance sheet of course the allocation. And you mentioned that in the quarter there was a $20 billion quarter-to-quarter increase reflecting client demand to use your balance sheet. Can you share with us the total loans or total assets what percentage of it is clients using your balance sheet? And then second and when you look at the revenues those customers bring to you as a percentage of those assets where those stand and how is that compared to about a year ago?","DavidSolomon","So as always the fluctuation in the balance sheet is a reflection of our ability to respond to opportunities and the interest of our clients. And so balance sheets fluctuation is all a function of client service. It's hard to decompose the balance sheet to say what's client -what not, what is not client. Truth, we know all of it, right, is in some manner or form related to client activity and across all of our businesses in the firm. And so that's really the way I would view to the balance sheet both in terms of growth size and its composition.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. ","BrianKleinhanzl","Yes, thanks. Just one quick question. On the market we saw that the rate pay came down towards the end of the quarter, kind of can you just walk through what your -- how you came up with that decision to lower the rate size just looking at the Fed Funds futures. Should we expect more rate cuts there and kind of what's been depositor behavior -- ","Stephen Scherr","Sure. So we made a decision and it was the first since we began our retail deposit business. We made an adjustment downward. We did it in the context of rendering ourselves competitive in light of what others had done. It's also worth noting at or around the time we reduced the rate we saw others in the competitive set reduce the rate as well. We saw no material adverse reaction to our movement, no to the pronounced outflows nothing to really call attention to.","I think you should assume that we will be fluid and flexible and agile in rate movement up or down relative to where the competitive set is. And will sort of comport ourselves that way both in our US platform and in the UK.","End of Q&A","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.","Stephen Scherr","Okay. Since there are no more questions, I would like to take a moment to thank everyone for joining the call on behalf of our senior management team. We hope to see many of you in the coming months. If any additional questions arise in the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out to Heather. Otherwise enjoy the rest of your day. And we look forward to speaking with you in October.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call.
