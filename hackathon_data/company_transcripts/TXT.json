And welcome to the Textron First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Eric Salander. Please go ahead Sir.","Eric Salander","Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone.","Before we begin, I would like to mention, we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release.","On the call today, we have Scott C. Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.","Textron revenues in the quarter were $3.1 billion, down $187 million from last years first quarter largely driven by the impact of Tools and Test disposition in the prior year.","Net income was $0.76 per share up from $0.72 per share in last year's first quarter. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions reflected a use of cash of $291 million compared to the use of cash of $158 million in last year's first quarter.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Donnelly","Thanks Eric and good morning everybody. Q1 was a strong quarter for Textron. Segment margins were up 100 basis points in the quarter driven by strong execution in Aviation, and Bell as well as improved performance in Specialized Vehicles.","At Bell revenues were slightly lower due to commercial volume in the quarter where we delivered 30 helicopters down from 46 last year. We saw solid order activity in the quarter with multi aircraft orders across all our commercial models and we expect to ramp commercial deliveries throughout the balance of the year.","In the quarter we achieved certification of the 407GXi from the Civil Aviation Administration of China, which allowed us to deliver the first unit to Shaanxi as part of their effort to establish an air medical services and public safety network in China.","On the military side, the Bell-Boeing program office was awarded at $143 million contract for additional performance based logistics and engineering support on the V-22 with options for four additional years. With more than 375 V-22 aircraft accumulating in excess of 450,000 flight hours a day we expect to see continued opportunities to strengthen our military aftermarket business from the V-22 fleet.","The V-22 recently celebrated the 30th anniversary of its first flight demonstrating the reliability of tiltrotor technology and the variety of missions capabilities for the most in demand aircraft in the U.S. military. And we're continuing our tiltrotor innovation with the V-280, which recently achieved a cruising speed of 300 knots as part of its continued successful flight test program.","We believe the success of the V-280 to-date has helped accelerate interest in the future long-range assault aircraft program leading to the army's requests for information, which will initiate a competitive acquisition phase.","Also with an FVL Bell responded to the future attack reconnaissance aircraft request for proposal and is awaiting the customer's initial downselect announcement. We were pleased to see the army's continued strong commitment to future vertical lift in FY20 budget with funding for both the long-range assault aircraft and the attack reconnaissance aircraft programs.","At Systems revenues were down on lower TAPV deliveries at Textron Marine & Land Systems and lower volume at Unmanned Systems. In the quarter Textron Systems was one of two companies selected to receive an award to provide unmanned systems as part of the U.S. Army\u2019s Future Tactical UAS program.","Under this award the U.S. army will purchase our Aerosonde HQ systems allowing army users to evaluate the system as well as envision to find the capabilities and operational requirements for future combat missions.","Textron systems also continues to qualify Block 3 enhancements to the Shadow tactical UAS, which will enable to support the U.S. army for years to come. Also in the quarter, Textron Systems delivered the initial next generation Squad Weapon-Technology prototype demonstrated to the U.S. army. The automatic rifle prototype based on the Company's proven Cased Telescoped Weapons & Ammunition technology is the first of five weapon demonstrators that Textron Systems plan to deliver for the program.","Moving to industrial revenues were lower for the quarter, primarily reflecting the impact of the disposition of the Tools and Test product line. At Specialized Vehicles, we saw a favorable performance resulting from our cost reduction and manufacture realignment actions that we initiated in the fourth quarter of last year.","Also in the quarter, we started onboarding Bass Pro and Cabela's stores as well as independent track of marine dealers with product information and training events and we began loading vehicles into these retail outlets.","At Textron GSE, our ground support business received an order for six Safeaero 220 deicers from Belgium\u2019s Brussels airport further expanding our international customer base.","Moving to Textron Aviation revenues were $1.1 billion up 12%. In the quarter, we delivered 44 jets up from 36 last year and 44 commercial turboprops up from 29 in last year's first quarter.","The overall market remains positive with new aircraft order levels 12% higher than a year ago. In the quarter figures released by GAMA showed that the Citation aircraft for the most delivered business jets in 2018 headlined by the Latitude, which earned the title as the most delivered business jet in the mid-sized category for the third consecutive year.","Success of the Latitude over the past three years demonstrates the importance of introducing new products to the market, particularly the competitive midsize segment and we're looking forward to success with the Citation Longitude as we work towards final certification which is certainly taking longer than we expected.","We\u2019re continuing to coordinate closely with the FAA as our engineering group works to complete the underlying documentation that's required under the FAA's design assurance process and we expect to complete this work in the second quarter. Given the effort involved in the review and approval process that supports final type certification of the aircraft, we expect Longitude deliveries to begin in Q3 of this year.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank.","Frank Connor","Thank you Scott and good morning, everyone. Segment profit in the quarter was $294 million up $15 million from the first quarter of 2018 with segment profit margin of 9.5% up 100 basis points from a year ago.","Let's review how each of the segments contributed starting with Textron Aviation.","At Textron Aviation revenues of $1.1 billion we're up 12% from this period last year due to higher volume and mix across the jet and commercial turboprop product lines.","Segment profit was $106 million up from $72 million, a year ago due to the higher volume and favorable performance. Operating margin at the segment was 9.3% up 220 basis points from last year. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $2 billion up $204 million from the end of the fourth quarter.","Moving to Bell, revenues were $739 million down from $752 million last year, primarily on lower commercial volume. Segment profit of $104 million was up $17 million primarily due to favorable performance. Operating margin at the segment was 14.1% up 250 basis points from last year.","Backlog in this segment was $6.3 billion at the end of the quarter, up $459 million from the end of the fourth quarter. At Textron systems revenues were $307 million down from $387 million a year ago reflecting lower TAPV deliveries at Textron Marine & Land Systems and lower Unmanned Systems volume.","Segment profit of $28 million was down $22 million from last year's first quarter, primarily reflecting lower volume and lower net favorable program adjustments. Operating margin at the segment was 9.1% in the quarter. Backlog in the segment was $1.4 billion down $62 million from the end of the fourth quarter.","Industrial revenues were $912 million down 19% largely related to the impact from the disposition of our tools and test product line at lower volumes. Segment profit was $50 million down $14 million from the first quarter of last year, largely due to the impact from the product line disposition and lower volume partially offset by favorable performance related to this specialized vehicles product line.","Operating margin at the segment was 5.5%. Finance segment revenues were up $1 million and profit was flat with last year's first quarter. Moving below segment profit corporate expenses were $47 million and interest expense was $35 million. We also repurchased approximately 4 million shares at an overall cost of about $202 million.","To wrap up with guidance, we are reiterating our expected full your EPS from continuing operations of $3.55 to $3.75 per share. We also continue to expect cash flow from continuing operations of the manufacturing group before pension contributions of $700 million to $800 million. That concludes our prepared remarks. So Brad, we can open the line for questions","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Of course and we have a question from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Seth Seifman","Thanks very much and good morning. Scott. So you mentioned what was in the [indiscernible] and in the budget for a future vertical lift. I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about what you saw in there, for FLRAA and how that met your expectations with regard to you continuing to test and to do work on the V-280 given some of the past comments that you've made. Was there enough there in terms of funding?","Scott Donnelly","I would say that we're pleased with what's in there. Obviously the bulk of the money that's laid out for FY20 was on FARA. The money for FLRAA was really to initiate and get the program going. You have to remember though that when they put all those budgets together, that was really before the V-280 was very far into his flight test program. So I'd say that that has influenced things pretty significantly.","They would like to add additional funding and they have asked for more funding to keep that program moving both in terms of flight test activity as well as to initiate the former procurement. And the army just talked about this, that's why we've seen the RFI come out. Those responses actually were due and went in last Friday. They'll use that to inform their next step, which is to put an RFP out to begin the competitive phase of the program.","So I think we'll \u2013 we see a fair bit of money through the five-year plan and we expect that based again on the fact that JMR has been as successful as it has been, has really demonstrated that this program is ready to move on. And the Army has talked about that and is working both the funding that they did get in there as well as additional request for funding to help accelerate this going forward. So I think in that respect, it's all positive.","Seth Seifman","Great. And then just one follow-up, maybe if you could talk a little bit about the level of profitability at Bell, 14% margin, obviously, very strong and strong relative to what you guys had guided to the year. And maybe a little bit more color on what drove that. And also, we've seen consistently high margins at Bell for a while now. And kind of how you think about that 10% to 12% range you've talked about over time. And if there's room to kind of be over time towards the higher end of that range.","Scott Donnelly","Well, Seth, I mean, we have been performing really well. I think the team down there had done a great job driving productivity. Obviously, we're in the quarter wrapping up a lot of sort of the end of Multiyear II program on V-22 and we see great productivity and that's driving part of it. We had a good mix on the commercial side. So in terms of the overall deliveries in the commercial side, we saw better margins there as well.","So that contributed to a very strong Q1. I think the business will perform very well throughout the year. But remember as we go further into the year, we'll see this transition to Multiyear III revenue on the V-22 front. And as we've always seen there is \u2013 when you negotiate new pricing on one of those contracts, it's at a lower level and then we've got to work hard to drive productivity over a period of time to get those margins back up.","So I think that our guide is still accurate on Bell. We're just going to see a stronger start here, again given mostly the ramp-up of Multiyear III versus kind of close out on all the Multiyear II activities. But again, the business does a great job. They're delivering strong productivity on both the military and the commercial front.","Seth Seifman","Great, thanks very much.","Scott Donnelly","Sure.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Hey, good morning, guys. And thank you for the time. On the Longitude, everybody likes the fashionably lead entrance. But I guess, what are the lessons learned here. How to improve the process, if any? And then if you could just update us on the Denali and the SkyCourier and EIS there?","Scott Donnelly","Sure. So I think Sheila, there's a lot to learn on how to go through this new process. I think if we were able to start over and do it again, there's a lot of up-streamlining in terms of how you would create all these documents and how you would put all the tools in place. Particularly, one of the things that we never imagined the challenges of how interconnected all these different documents are, so not only is it staggering in terms of the sheer volume and quantity per document, but the linkages. So if a commentary is made and a small change is made somewhere, how that connects to all the other documents, whereas these things used to live sort of independently as you look system to system.","So we have been trying to put together tools and ways to make that an easier process. I think frankly, the FAA reviewers as they look through this have recognized that there is, I mean, there is a lot that's being done here that's valuable, but there's a lot of things that could be optimized to make it more productive. I think we feel good about the fact that we've had some FAA folks in and now using some of these tools we develop to help do the reviews and look at the documents.","So for sure, there are lessons to be learned here on future certifications. And frankly, when you start this process, there are ways that you can create these documents and treaties much, much earlier that we just weren't familiar with at the time we started this program. So we kind of injected this process halfway through. So at any rate, it has proven to be a massive challenge.","Again, this is for us, this is a timing issue and I don't think this will affect our performance in the year. The production line is humming along the \u2013 it's a great product. It continues to fly really, really well, and we'll get there. The only disappointment frankly for us is we have customers that want the aircraft. And we've been trying to do everything we can to support training and readiness for deliveries and all those kinds of things. But it's \u2013 people would like to get their hands on the aircraft. It's a great plane. So anyway, well, there's a lot to learn here and I think it'll help us on future certifications.","With respect to the Denali and SkyCourier, we are still planning on first flights of each of those aircraft this year. I think they're coming along well from a performance cost. They're tracking and we obviously are a little bit behind a couple where we'd like to be based on a lot of the resource still being tied up on the Longitude certification, but the critical things that need to happen on that program continue to happen. And I think both programs are on track to be great aircraft.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Thank you for that color. And then just on Systems. How do we think about the business returning to growth and stabilizing here? You mentioned a couple of new programs\u2026","Scott Donnelly","So I think if you look at the performance for the quarter, look, I'm very happy with how these guys are doing. Most of the businesses are performing really, really well. That win on the next-generation of UAS, where we invested in that hybrid quadcopter version of Aerosonde. Obviously, to be selected as one of the two guys to go demonstrate that capability and get fielded with the Army is a big deal for us. The rest of the UAS business fee-for-service is continuing to do very well.","As I said, most \u2013 all of those businesses are performing really well. Obviously, the reason we guided the margin rate that we guided is we still have a very large piece of the business on ship to shore in particular that as the fixed price development that we're booking at zero. And now we are starting to see revenue. We'll see that continue to grow over the course of the year on the production program.","Again, revenue that we're going to book is zero. Clearly, we don't expect that to be a zero margin. We expect that to be a normal, healthy margin business. But here in the initial phases, we're booking that at zero. The first three craft are in the production phase, there's a lot of long-lead material that's out there. And so we're starting the negotiation with the government to try to finitize that contract for fiscal year 2017, 2018, 2019.","So I think clearly that program is to going to drive a significant amount of growth going forward. As I said, we already have a long-lead out there. We're already initiating the production of the craft. So that will have I think a real positive impact for us in 2020. But it's all business that's being booked at zero margin that weighs down the whole segment, obviously, when you've got a big piece of business at zero. But clearly that will swing to a very positive program for us going forward.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Thank you very much.","Scott Donnelly","Sure.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.","David Strauss","Thanks. Good morning. Following up on that, Scott, the changes that we saw on the budget in and around ship to shore look like, some volumes were taken out. Can you just comment on that? And how that potentially could affect the cadence of the program?","Scott Donnelly","Well, the FY2020 zero was I think from the Navy's perspective a logical thing to do because the monies have been appropriated in 2017, 2018, 2019 not under a contract yet. So I think that was the rationale for doing this. Clearly, we have a pretty significant volume of craft that are sort of in the backlog, if you will. We would certainly like to see them put something back in for 2020 just so that we don't have a break in terms of how we negotiate and work with our suppliers on anticipated volume.","So that's certainly something that we see as an opportunity to step that up as we go finalize the FY2020 budget and also for the fit up as we look out. But I don't think there is nothing sinister here, it's just the Navy's perspective was you guys have a whole bunch of craft that are already appropriated in 2017, 2018, 2019. We've got to get those under contract and get going here before we add on additional appropriated volumes.","David Strauss","Okay. Within industrial, the down 7%, can you help us a little bit in terms of how Kautex and vehicles did within that down 7%? And then how do you feel you\u2019re set up for the dirt season because I think that's where we've seen problems in the past. Thanks.","Scott Donnelly","Sure. Look, the majority of the volume down here is associated with the fact that we had the Tools & Test business a year ago, so we'll see that headwind here in the first two quarters. And then we should get to more normalized comparative on a year-over-year basis. I think the Kautex business, as you would expect, we were down on the revenue based upon the OEM volumes, what with being down. I think from everything we're hearing from our customers when we look at deliveries for the balance of the year, this is probably the lowest quarter for that just on a year-over-year comparative basis. We expect it to be somewhat better in the second quarter. And again improving because we get to again more normal comps in the third and fourth quarter in terms of where the OEM volume is around the world. But the business is executing fine. Obviously, there\u2019s some challenge there on FX as well, which is almost half the decline that we saw in the automotive side of things. But it's performing and sort of to our expectations based on what people were thinking the global auto volumes would be. So I don't think there's any issue there that we\u2019re particularly concerned about.","On the vehicle side, we saw a pretty significant improvement on a year-over-year basis, in terms of the performance of the business. So the actions that we said that we would take around cost and realigning production and some of the main changes that we made in product portfolio have gone very well, I think that team is executing extremely well and we clearly expect to see the benefits that continue to accrete over the balance of the year.","And then, of course, the unknown which will drive any potential upside to this is, how successful we are on the partnership with TRACKER.We feel great about it right now. But again, we\u2019re early here, we\u2019re doing a lot of work together on training and getting everybody ready to receive and retail this new product line in both the stores and the independent dealers. I'd say that process, it's a huge undertaking, it's just a \u2013 it\u2019s a lot of stores, it's a lot of retailers, so it's a lot of training. And \u2013 that I think that's going very well so far. We're obviously building out vehicles and have started to stock a lot of the initial stores and dealers, and that program continues on track. But we need to give it a couple of quarters here to see what the retail sell through looks like to know what that's going to do to the business.","But, all that aside, I think we are absolutely on track with the execution that we expected and forecast for the year, so we're in pretty good position.","David Strauss","All right. Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland","Hi. Good morning, gentlemen.","Scott Donnelly","Good morning.","Carter Copeland","Scott. Just a question on certification. I appreciate the longitude comments earlier. But just a bit more broadly, I mean, there's clearly right now a bit more public debate around the suitability of ODA in the cert process. And I just wondered, if you look forward when you think about the remaining certifications that you have and the ones in the future, do you think there is a risk that this becomes more elongated? And this is a process you got to plan for longer lead times? Or just any color you can give us on how you're thinking about that, given what's been going on lately?","Scott Donnelly","Well, Carter that\u2019s all very hard to predict. Look, I think that the FAA recognizes the value and the importance of ODA in the certification process. This is a process which has worked extraordinarily well. I mean our industry, whether it's civil aircraft or business jets or GA aircraft, has an unbelievable safety record. And I think the FAA knows that, the process which we all gripe about here and there. The bottom line is it works, it has delivered incredible safety records.","So I hope that no one has a knee-jerk reaction to some of the issues or the \u2013 the only issue frankly, that's going on right now in the industry and doesn't \u2013 we go back and say what are the things that should be done differently? Although I think we're always open and should always be open to that, if it's something that will improve safety of the delivered product. I think the FAA will be balanced and these guys are very close to this, they understand the technical details and how the process really works with respect to the overall certification process, as well as ODA.","I just hope we don't get something that is jammed from a legislative standpoint that mandate something that would be, as I say, a knee-jerk reaction. We have a process that does work and it has an unbelievably terrific track record in terms of safety of the aircraft. So one isolated incident shouldn't cause people to change a very complicated and very effective process that\u2019s worked for a very long time.","Carter Copeland","Great. Thanks for that. And just as a follow-up, I wondered if you might just give us some very general color. I know you don\u2019t go by model, but just characterize the aviation book-to-bill sort of longitude versus everything else. Did you see \u2013 what did you see across the product line? Or did you see any particular strength in longitude worth noting?","Scott Donnelly","I think it's been strong across virtually every model. I mean certainly there were some longitudes in there on both retail as well as ongoing \u2013 the process we go through sort of year out on NetJets on the fractional side. But we saw good retail activity. And that's true both at longitude and really across the rest of the product line.","Carter Copeland","Great. Thank you very much.","Scott Donnelly","Sure.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Ronald Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Caitlin Dullanty","Good morning, guys. This is Caitlin Dullanty on for Ron Epstein. When we think about the future vertical lift programs with FARA and FLRAA, the initial operating capability is still a way\u2019s away with 2028 for FARA and 2034 for FLRAA. Until these programs gain traction, how do you think about bridging your programs at Bell as the V-22 comes down?","Scott Donnelly","Well, there is a couple of things going on there. So one is, first of all the Army has been pretty open about trying to \u2013 as their baseline bringing the future long range assault back from that 2034, 2035 to 2030, as part of the RFI process, they asked for ways that it could be further accelerated. As you can imagine, we've submitted our input to that. So I mean clearly there are ways for this to go faster. And I think the Army, well, the Army has been very open about the fact that they would like to see this go even faster.","So I think the \u2013 these discussions out into the 2030s are really no longer relevant. The Army is absolutely intent on bringing that back and getting aircraft onto the ramp much sooner than that and clearly we can support doing that. So they're not as far out as you would think, but they're still pretty far out. So you will see a lot more engineering development and initial activity between here and say the early-to-mid 2020s. One other things that will help to bridge us on our current programs in both the 22 and H-1 is these install bases are growing obviously very rapidly. There's a lot more aftermarket work that\u2019s coming in.","The government is working very hard around readiness and sustainability, so you\u2019ll see more PBL and more work that we're performing to help them make sure that these aircraft are supported. And they\u2019re \u2013 again, the installed bases is much larger and they're flying these things a lot of hours. So aftermarket will certainly step in and fill part of that void.","And the other is FMS, so as you know, on the H-1 front, we\u2019ve got Boeing. There\u2019s is a number of other opportunities out there. There is interest and activity, which again is public around, Israelis let\u2019s say on V-22, so I think the real answer here is there\u2019ll be a lot more aftermarket activity to help fill that gap. There will be some upgrades and refurbishments, like CCRAM for instance, on the V-22 program. And there will be some FMS opportunities to help, also to fill that gap.","And I think you'll see more, as I said at the beginning, sort of a pull to the left here to try to accelerate things like long-range assault.","Caitlin Dullanty","Okay. That's very helpful. And the another question on the V-280. Right now, the Army does not currently operate any tiltrotors. What hurdles do the Army need to overcome to commit to a tiltrotor like the V-280?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I think that the Army is, as they've seen the JMR program play out and they've seen the V-280 performance in terms of not just the things which sort of everybody knew about tiltrotor in terms of their benefits in speed and range, which is inherent in having a \u2013 in effect what's a high performance turboprop when you're in route. But there was always a question around the low level agility and the need to be able to be very agile down at \u2013 in a landing zone. Again this is a big change from where we were even a year ago with the 280 flying, the Army has been able to observe and frankly fly this aircraft in those modes and it's superior to the helicopters that are out there today, in terms of its low level agility.","So I'd say, if there was a concern around tiltrotor with the Army, it was, how do you do with this low level agility and the V-280 has been able to demonstrate that this is actually a superior technology for that application. So I think that's \u2013 having seen that, is what's giving them the confidence to try to move out on this program.","Caitlin Dullanty","Okay. Thank you. And lastly, can you walk us through what drove the working capital headwind in the quarter?","Scott Donnelly","Well, inventories obviously, we didn't sell longitudes, so those guys are there and we always have a cyclicality anyway. I mean, if you look at the longitude is obviously a significant chunk of that. In general we tend to have more build on both the commercial aviation side, as well as and Bell on their commercial side. Again, even though deliveries were not the same as they were a year ago, we still feel very good about the overall commercial volumes for the year and those aircraft are in production and are in finishing and that\u2019s what drives the bulk of it.","And we have a little bit of additional inventory, again, we're doing all the build for the stocking on the vehicle side. So it's mostly driven by some of those sort of normal annual inventory builds.","Caitlin Dullanty","Great. Thank you very much. That's it for me.","Scott Donnelly","Sure.","Operator","And we do have a question for the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.","George Shapiro","Yes, good morning.","Scott Donnelly","Good morning.","George Shapiro","In the aviation, what was R&D year-over-year because my recollection was you had like $15 million of Scorpion expense in the quarter last year, so I just wondering how much it might have been down year-over-year?","Scott Donnelly","The numbers George, our overall R&D number is about on track to where we guide for the year. It's not a major impact one way or the other. Obviously, we spent a little more longitudinal but net it's pretty flat.","George Shapiro","Okay. And then what was the aftermarket increase in the quarter since this year? It was more apples to apples. You didn't have the 606 messing it up.","Scott Donnelly","In the aftermarket it was actually down slightly, George. January, February, and again, whether its weather or why we don't really know, but the shop visits were below what we usually see. The good news is we saw most of that come back in March and our position for bookings in April here as we go into the quarter are back to more normal level, but it was a little lighter than we usually see in January, February, but again that activity has picked back up. So I think for the year we would be fine.","George Shapiro","Okay. And then if I switched to industrial, was the special vehicles business sequentially better profitability than the fourth quarter?","Scott Donnelly","Sure, yeah.","George Shapiro","Okay. So that would imply that the bulk of the organic revenue decline was at Kautex and also maybe the margin was a little bit weaker at Kautex. Is that a correct statement?","Scott Donnelly","Well, we're not going to go through the exactly segment by segment, but Kautex was fine, the vehicle business was up and obviously the Tools and Test top wasn't in there.","George Shapiro","Okay. And then one for Frank, corporate expense was $47 million in the quarter that's somewhat higher than implied run rate of the $140 million that you kind of gave at guidance on January. Is there any change to that? Or what caused it?","Frank Connor","No, we're on track for that $140 million, George. It\u2019s just the timing issue related to the recognition of certain expenses, particularly, kind of how compensation does and things like that. So it's we're on track for the $140 million.","George Shapiro","Okay and one last quick one. Tax rate was low in the quarter. Is this a new tax rate? Or are you still sticking with the 20% for the year?","Frank Connor","Now, 20% is still good. We had a discrete item in the quarter that helped that, but 20% is still good for the year.","George Shapiro","Okay. Thanks very much.","Frank Connor","Sure.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Robert Stallard","Thanks so much. Good morning.","Scott Donnelly","Good morning.","Robert Stallard","First question, in terms of capital deployment, are you still sticking to your guns in terms of prioritizing a share buyback going forward versus M&A?","Scott Donnelly","Yes.","Frank Connor","Yeah.","Scott Donnelly","Yes, we did that in the quarter, Robert. So I think that the level of buyback activity has been strong and we wouldn't expect to see it stay there.","Robert Stallard","Okay, that's great. And then secondly, we'll commercial helicopter, you mentioned it was a bit soft in the quarter, I don't know, three months is a short period of time. But have you seen anything changed there in the end market?","Scott Donnelly","Sure, Robert. I don't want to interpret it to be soft. I mean it's just the normal \u2013 I mean our sole position is quite strong. Order activity is very strong, so there is no change to our outlook on the commercial side. It just happens to be and we always have some lumpiness here in delivery of certain customers and certain model types. So the commercial side is continuing to be strong. Order activity is very good. Sole position is very good. Mix was actually positive from a standpoint of few more fort walls here in the quarter, but there's no change to our outlook of the end market or the forecast for the year.","Robert Stallard","Right. And then just finally for me, I was wondering if you could comment on business jet pricing. You obviously saw some strength through last year and I was earning if that had continued.","Scott Donnelly","It did I mean at a lower level. I think we made a lot of moves in the last year plus in terms of trying to get price back to a more normalized place. And I think we've done that. We'll continue to keep pushing to keep up with just \u2013 I mean market inflation is what it is. So I think we did see some pricing in the quarter, but I wouldn't expect it to be at the same level of increase that we've seen over the last year or so.","Robert Stallard","It sounds great. Thank you very much.","Scott Donnelly","Thank you.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, good morning, gentlemen. This is Jonathan on for Rajeev. So moving back to industrial, you mentioned the Bass Pro Shop relationship is progressing and you're loading vehicles in stores. Have you completed the footprint rationalization and what's left to do here and what\u2019s the expected timeline?","Scott Donnelly","So the footprint rationalization and the product lines, that work has been done. That's, I would say, pretty well completed at this point in time. So our focus right now is obviously around the core of our business in golf, in GSE, which are doing well and continuing on the turf product particularly in the golf. I think we feel we\u2019re in a very good place there. The rationalization of product line and addressing a lot of the issues around inventory and whatnot on the dirt and snow side is in a good position. We had a fabulous year in terms of snow and getting that to a position that we're happy with in terms of inventory levels and so most of our work now on that is really around the Tracker partnership and driving that to be a successful program.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. And then just another follow-up on share repurchase. Are you still comfortable with the original guide? And any excess going \u2013 any excess free cash flow in the share repo?","Frank Connor","Yeah. As we said, when we guided, we expect that the bulk of our free cash flow will go to share repurchase this year and that continues to be the intent and the first quarter rate was reflective of that.","Scott Donnelly","$200 million in the first quarter is consistent with the guide that we gave you.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, very solid. Okay, thank you guys.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Noah Poponak","Hey, good morning everyone.","Scott Donnelly","Good morning.","Frank Connor","Good morning.","Noah Poponak","Scott, the assessment jet unit is up 22% year-over-year in the quarter without longitude and with a normal latitude compare at this point. How should we expect the remainder of the year's growth rate in the ex-longitude, the legacy \u2013 the legacy business? How should we expect that growth rate rest of the year to compare to the 22% in the first quarter?","Scott Donnelly","Well, look \u2013 I mean if you look at the total year, it's going to be consistent with the guide. And also certainly we would have expected a few longitudes here in the first quarter, so you'll see certainly a shifting here, particularly as we go into Q3 and Q4 where more growth will be driven by the longitude program.","Noah Poponak","I think my question is more. The guide is for volume up ex-longitude. And we've sort of \u2013 in the past you've talked about the ability to tweak the number of units on some of the legacy programs versus I guess the different process of a full on production increase. And so with that up 22%, which I think is a surprising number to most folks trying to figure out are you tweaking units in the legacy business ex-longitude? Or have you actually raised the production system 20% such that you would have 20% growth the rest of the year in the legacy business ex-longitude?","Scott Donnelly","No, we think it will be consistent with where we guided, Noah. So the production planning process, which again we \u2013 it's a real time process, right. And looking at that's high up and demand in the marketplace would not cause us to think that it's up 20%.","Noah Poponak","Okay.","Frank Connor","Our revenue guide was up 11% for the year. We were up 12% in the first quarter without longitude. So you can kind of do the math around that, but consistent with what Scott said, we had planned legacy up somewhat and we're maintaining that perspective.","Scott Donnelly","But the good news is the demand is there, right, and it's consistent with what we guided and we're seeing demand that supports our guide. So I think it's we continue to feel great about the end market, but we\u2019re clearly going to need \u2013 see the delivers of the longitude kick in to drive the overall guidance number and we feel good about that.","Noah Poponak","Got it. So for several years in a row prior to this one, you had the first quarter unit number right around 35 and then a pretty steep ramp through the year. So is this year just more level loaded, ex-longitude?","Scott Donnelly","Look I think its more level loaded. If you go back in and look at last year, we've had more normal demand in the marketplace and we have the ability to move aircraft not just for instance in selling in Q3 and Q4 in particular, which is always very high demand, but enough demand in the marketplace that we needed people to move into the next year, which is a good thing, right. So you saw a little more level loaded because you had customers that are taking few more deliveries. And the good news is our level of order activity is also up around that same 12% kind of range or just order activity in Q1 versus Q1 a year ago. Which again I think supports our perspective that that's about the right increased level that we'll see for the year.","Noah Poponak","Got it. Any quantification you can provide on how much your average lead time in the legacy jets has extended versus six to nine months ago? ","Scott Donnelly","No I don\u2019t think there has been any change.","Noah Poponak","No major change on that? Okay. And then similarly on the margins in the segment, if you maybe could just dig into those a little more, I mean, especially without the Longitude, it's a pretty strong margin at the 9.3, and you've got the guide for 10 for the year. And similarly, it usually ramps through the year. Will that just also be more level loaded? Or perhaps you could just peel back the onion a little bit on the margin strength in the quarter?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I don't think we're going to get into Aviation margins on a quarter by quarter basis. It means you're certainly right. Generally, the Aviation business, again in large part driven by volumes, which kind of changes as we go through the year, typically sees stronger margins. I think we will see more level loaded \u2013 again, the volume is a little more consistent, the revenues are little more consistent so I expect the margins to be a little more consistent. But Q4 will still be a bigger quarter than most quarters, as it always is. And therefore, I would expect to see a little bit better margins in Q4.","But I think we'll see strong margin through the course of the year. And again, it should all be consistent with our guide. The first Longitude, when we make those deliveries, will have some dilutive effect. But as you play through that volume, our cost and pricing is in line with what we're expecting it to be, and it will be a great part of the portfolio from a profitability perspective once you get through those first units. So we will have to bear the burden of some dilution of that first four, five aircraft.","Noah Poponak","Got it. Thanks so much.","Scott Donnelly","Okay.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Jon Raviv with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jon Raviv","Hey good morning everyone. Scott, you kind of went through a couple of these \u2013 you went through all of the segments. But just any sort of tweaks versus the guidance you offered three months ago? It seems like Aviation and margin was tracking ahead, whereas maybe there are some moving pieces elsewhere. So any kind of tweaks you want to offer in terms of who's running ahead, who\u2019s running behind thus far?","Scott Donnelly","No, I think, it's early in the game here. We delivered a great quarter. The businesses position where we expected them to be. And at this point, nothing that would cause us to change anything in the guide.","Jon Raviv","Thanks. And then in auto, in the outlook that you've given for the industrial segment, sales outlook and the margin outlook, what is the auto assumption built in there? And to what extent is it derisked, just because it seems like that you mentioned customers has their plans but maybe those plans can change sometimes.","Scott Donnelly","I think so far, it's tracking as we would expect. And the outlook that we're getting both at sort of the industry role of IHS kind of data, as well as we're what hearing from individual customers in terms of their model mix and expected quantities, it's consistent with our plan. So I think we're in a fine shape in terms of how that business is positioned with respect to our guide.","Jon Raviv","Great, thanks. That\u2019s helpful too.","Scott Donnelly","Sure.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. ","Cai von Rumohr","Yes thanks so much. So not to beat dead horse, but could you give us what the net price impact was at Aviation? It was $14 million in the last two quarters. And secondly, the impact of pre-owned transactions in the quarter?","Scott Donnelly","The impact of pre-owned was trivial, Cai, so not a big mover one way or the other. You're going to see pricing impact of around $6 million. That's price.","Frank Connor","That's price.","Scott Donnelly","And then inflation is going to be a little more than that. So one of the things we look the business is terrific performance. But we're a little behind the power curve on price inflation. So you'll see that as a slight drag and, obviously, something we're working on. But the overall performance of the business in terms of driving productivity in total is what drove strong margins, and I would expect that to continue through the year.","Cai von Rumohr","Got it. As we look out to next year, what are your thoughts in terms of when you hope to certify the Denali and the SkyCourier and start to deliver them?","Scott Donnelly","No, Cai, I'm pretty focused on Longitude right now. So we have said that we want to get both aircraft into the flight test program with first flight here by the end of the year. We don't want to go out there yet with expected certification dates. Obviously, that process has been a lot more painful than we expected. So we'll probably take a little time to make sure we understand how that process is going to play out on those aircraft before we commit dates out there.","Cai von Rumohr","Got it. That\u2019s it from me. Thank you.","Scott Donnelly","Okay.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Please go ahead.","Pete Skibitski","Good morning guys. A couple of Bell questions. Scott, I don't know if you mentioned the 525, is that \u2013 I guess another certification question. Is that still on track for late this year, sir?","Scott Donnelly","It's still flying. The program is going really, really well in terms of flight test. In terms of an exact date, look, with the FAA our process right now, we're just not going to \u2013 we really can't commit a date. We don't really control that process as much as we like to think we do. So we're focused on the flight test, the aircraft is flying spectacularly. So we feel great about where it is. But in terms of getting through this process, we'll have to see.","Pete Skibitski","Okay. And then anything you can share on the air taxi market? Is Bell spending a lot of IR&D on that effort? That might be impacting margins although the performance has been great. I'm just kind of wondering, are they focused more so on the air taxi type of stuff versus kind of more traditional, next-generation commercial helicopters?","Scott Donnelly","Well, so I would say that the vast majority of the R&D that we're spending on any new program starts at this point is more oriented around, obviously, the future vertical lift programs. There is a relatively small amount of R&D that we're spending around some of these new, be they electric or hybrid-type technologies, which probably is the future of a lot of commercial helicopter. There's a lot of work that's gone into these things we call EPTs, which are the really more of a lite cargo. There is clearly a lot of interest in the military for that kind of technology. There's already some RFIs.","And we expect RFPs that are coming out. So that work will support the early adopters which, frankly, I think will be more military than commercial. These are not necessarily expensive technologies, but they have a very high value in the combat environment in terms of delivering cargo around the battlefield. And so that technology, I think, will be adopted there first. ","On the air taxi, again part of this technology investment is along those lines. But it's a relatively small number because we need to see how does that market really play out, I think, there's a lot of uncertainty. I think if it's going to happen, clearly our team at Bell is some who can design and build aircraft that would fit into that marketplace. But right now, it's something that's a relatively low level of funding compared to where we allocate the things that are more important here in the nearer term, which is primarily around FEL.","Pete Skibitski","Got it. I appreciate the color. ","Scott Donnelly","Sure.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Spingarn","Hey good morning. Just a couple of clarifications on some things, Scott. First of all, on the regional, if we look at biz jet demand regionally, is North America still driving the market? Is that where the strength is coming from?","Scott Donnelly","North America still drives the market, but we saw some pretty good order activity in the international markets in the quarter as well. ","Robert Spingarn","Any particular [indiscernible]?","Scott Donnelly","Well we've had some pretty good order activity going into the Chinese market. We've seen a little bit better in some of the European market. But it's still more of a North American story than an international story around jets. ","Robert Spingarn","Based upon reports from different manufacturers, I don't think everybody else is seeing the strength that you're seeing. So would there\u2026","Scott Donnelly","I\u2019m sorry your line is really breaking out, we can\u2019t really get the question. ","Robert Spingarn","I was asking if [indiscernible]?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I\u2019m sorry your line is not readable.","Robert Spingarn","Okay. ","Frank Connor","Well why don\u2019t we go to the next question?","Operator","My apologies. We do have a follow-up question from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead. ","George Shapiro","Yes. Scott, I mean, you've seen strong used pricing in your market availability down. I mean, you\u2019ve had strong orders for quite a while now. What does it take to start to increase the legacy production rates? And could that have a positive impact on your guide for this year?","Scott Donnelly","Well, George, we did plan, as we talked about, having an increase in legacy deliveries in the year. And we saw that here in Q1. So I think we will continue to see that. The end market is good. Our order activity again in the quarter on a year-over-year basis was very positive. So I think we have set our expectations around having an increase across all those product lines. And I think we\u2019ll see that for the year for sure.","George Shapiro","Okay. And then just, Scott, on the commercial helicopter business, you said things will be stronger the rest of the year. Can you highlight any of the models that you expect to be stronger?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I think it\u2019s going to be \u2013 deliveries are going to be up in virtually every model type, George. And again, the deliveries are never linear, right? So I mean, this is not something that we weren\u2019t expecting. This is a question of when people are taking deliveries of the aircraft and getting into finishings. So the order activity has been there to support what we have guided for 2019. It\u2019s just not a linear delivery schedule.","George Shapiro","I actually had switched and maybe to in Bell \u2013 Bell\u2019s commercial delivery is still what we\u2019re\u2026","Scott Donnelly","No, I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about, George. So Bell, the order rate through all of last year on the commercial side has been good. It continues to be good. So the orders are there to support our forecast in terms of deliveries in 2019, and it\u2019s just a matter of when customer delivery dates are. And that\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s an issue, there\u2019s no softness, there\u2019s no concern. It\u2019s just this is what the delivery plan was in terms of customer dates.","George Shapiro","Okay. Very good. Thanks very much.","Scott Donnelly","Sure.","Operator","And we will try Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse again. Here we go.","Robert Spingarn","Hopefully, this is a better connection. Can you hear me?","Scott Donnelly","Yes, sir. We can hear you now.","Robert Spingarn","Okay. All right. What I was getting at with the regional strength is, are you perhaps taking share? We\u2019ve seen some of your competitors have much weaker demand situations, missing deliveries, et cetera. And I wanted to understand if this is somewhat, driven by share. And then secondarily, how are the tailwinds that we got in the United States from tax reform, et cetera, how are those holding up now?","Scott Donnelly","Well, look, the gamma numbers will show whatever the share is. I mean, I think that as again, guys, we\u2019ve been talking for a long time about the investments we made in new products and our belief that, a, they partly stimulate the market, and if you\u2019ve got a better product, it helps in terms of being out there and selling in the marketplace. So I like where our product lineup is. I think the guys have done a very nice job on that, and I think we\u2019re being rewarded for that in the marketplace. But we look, the gamma numbers show what they show.","In terms of tax, because as we talked about before, this \u2013 I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve been in a particularly a tax situation, that\u2019s very different than it\u2019s been for quite some time. You already had those appreciation. Now you have 100% versus a 50-50 kind of deductibility in the U.S. I think this has been much more driven by our customers having more confidence in what\u2019s going on in the economy and their willingness to commit, in most cases, to upgrade their aircraft.","And certainly with the used market, that has had a lot lower levels of inventory, a lot more liquidity in terms of time to sell aircraft. All those dynamics are what is creating a more robust end market than what we had seen for many years. So I \u2013 but I personally think it\u2019s a lot more about confidence in what\u2019s going on in their businesses than it is a pure tax [point].","Robert Spingarn","Okay. And then just lastly, on the Longitude. Is there a point in time that you need to have certification in order to deliver to your internal plan the quantities for this year?","Scott Donnelly","No, our internal plan would\u2019ve had deliveries starting, frankly, here in Q1. We adjusted those internal plans, again just based on just our expectations for the timeline to get through all the document reviews to plan on Q3.","Robert Spingarn","Yes, that\u2019s what I\u2019m asking.","Scott Donnelly","No, from a financial standpoint to us, the guide will be a little lighter in Q1 and Q2 than we had expected, but we would expect that will be fully made up in Q3, Q4, the aircraft are being produced, they\u2019re ready to go. So it\u2019s not an inability for us to respond once that certification\u2019s issued.","Robert Spingarn","Okay. Thanks very much.","Scott Donnelly","Sure.","Operator","And we do have a follow-up question from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Noah Poponak","Hey. Just wanted to try to better understand the Bell margin and specifically the V-22 transition impact to it. I thought you had said in the past that the transition to the next multiyear from a volume impact perspective was \u2013 had a larger impact in 2020 than 2019. And so if that\u2019s true, with a positive cumulative catch ups associated with the late stages of the current multiyear, should we be expecting that to kind of last through much of the rest of 2019 and then see the margin drift lower next year? Or does that change occur sooner?","Scott Donnelly","Well, it has some impact this year, right? I mean, a lot of the accum cash on Multiyear IIs are recognized this year. And remember, Noah, now under the revenue recognition system here, we are starting to recognize a lot more revenue on Multiyear III as we go through this year. So it\u2019s not just \u2013 it doesn\u2019t just impact actual delivery quarter but as you start to drive revenue associated with those craft, which we are, those are recognized under the margin rates of Multiyear III as opposed to Multiyear II.","Frank Connor","So we\u2019re going from in the first part of the year, more Multiyear II revenue at Bell than Multiyear III. And that transitions in the second part of the year to more Multiyear III than Multiyear II. And then, obviously, next year, 2020, it\u2019s Multiyear III. So this is the transition year. And as Scott said, you get the program impacts as you \u2013 Multiyear II as you go through winding up that program.","Noah Poponak","That\u2019s really helpful on that first half versus second half mix, Frank. So thank you, thanks a lot.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Seth Seifman","Thanks a lot. One follow-up question on future vertical lift. You mentioned, Scott that that you guys will have an offering for FARA. And it\u2019s not something you really talked about a lot. That\u2019s obviously that one that Sikorsky has been pushing as what they would like to see happen first. And they\u2019ve kind of taken a view of the radar that\u2019s somewhat like you guys have talked about on V-280 and we\u2019ve got it flying and we\u2019re racking up hours and stuff. And so how do you see that competition playing out? What can you tell us about the offering that you guys have? And whether you view that as kind of realistic avenue for Bell to go down?","Scott Donnelly","Of course, I think we have a very competitive offering for FARA. We haven\u2019t talked a lot about it publicly, but I mean look it\u2019s not going to be a secret for long. We had basically taken the technology that we\u2019ve invested in pretty significantly over the past number of years on 525. Remember, 525, we\u2019ve seen this craft flying over 200 knots. And that\u2019s a function of the technology that we invested in terms of the rotor technology, the fly-by-wire systems, control systems that has enabled us to field a more conventional helicopter that has very high speed, very efficient, very smooth operating capability. And so what we did basically is taking that technology that we validated in the 525 program and scaling that down to a size and weight that\u2019s consistent with the FARA requirement.","So if you look at what\u2019s required from a speed and performance standpoint to execute the FARA mission, we think we have some technology that\u2019s been validated, that can meet that requirement with a much more cost-effective, much more reliable conventional technology. I say conventional, I mean this is obviously a big step in terms of a more conventional rotorcraft, but we\u2019ve \u2013 I think we have a proposal on the table that meets the requirements that can do it in a very cost-effective, very highly reliable and sustainable way.","Seth Seifman","Great.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later on we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to your host Doug Wilburne, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Doug Wilburne","Thanks Rosanne and good morning everyone. Before we begin I would like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today\u2019s press release.","On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.","Textron's revenues in the quarter were $3.5 billion, up $670 million from last year\u2019s second quarter. The Beechcraft acquisition, completed at the end of the first quarter contributed $425 million to the increase. Income from continuing operations was $0.51 per share compared to $0.40 in the second quarter of 2013.","Last year\u2019s second quarter EPS was reduced by $0.07 per share and severance cost recorded at Cessna, while this year's results reflected a full quarter\u2019s impact of the Beechcraft acquisition. The Beechcraft impact included an $0.08 EPS reduction from fair value step up adjustments of acquired inventories sold during the quarter and $0.05 in restructuring charges, which were recorded on a separate line for acquisition and restructuring cost.","Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $271 million compared to a $362 million use of cash in last year\u2019s second quarter. Pension contributions during the second quarter were $27 million. And with that I'll turn it over to Scott.","Scott Donnelly","Thanks Doug and good morning everybody. Revenues were up 23.5%, reflecting solid organic growth and contributions from acquisitions. At Bell we delivered 10 V-22s and 8 H-1s compared to 9 V-22s and 6 H-1s in last year's second quarter. On the commercial side, we delivered 46 aircraft up from 44 a year ago. On the development front during the quarter, we received certification for the wheeled landing gear version of the 429 model in Taiwan and Argentina following first quarter approvals in Canada and Brazil which expands the appeal of the platform to a broader customer base. We also delivered our first 412EPI model at the end of June to the New South Wales Police Department in Australia.","Our 505 Jet Ranger X development program remains on track for first flight this year as total (inaudible) demonstrated maximum continuous power during the first engine test. We also continue to make good progress on the 525 Relentless as we completed the first all-composite main rotor blade, received our first GE engine and began gear box testing. Overall assembly of the first aircraft is also progressing and with the next month we will be ready to join the three main [capital] sections with initial flight targeted for late this year.","On the military side, we signed the [another] contract for 24 additional H-1 aircraft worth about $450 million with expected deliveries beginning late next year. We also continue to make progress to our potential foreign military sales for the V-22; negotiations are ongoing for the six initial units for Israel and we're working with a number of foreign governments which should result in additional [FMS] orders.","Moving next to Textron Systems, revenues were down as we expected but program performance and a favorable mix of contract revenues resulted in the segment margin of 12.1%. We continue to make progress on the Shadow TCDL upgrade development program successfully completing the final operational testing valuation during the quarter.","We also saw continued performance stability in our Aerosonde fee-for-service platform and we recently received a new task order to continue operating under the Navy ISR program. During the quarter we also won a $190 million contract for approximately 360 sensor fuse weapons to be delivered to Korea beginning in the third quarter of next year.","Most recently, we completed an acquisition for our new TRU Simulation Training business with the purchase of ProFlight an innovative provider of pilot training, specializing in Cessna CJ series and Cessna [Caravan plus] turboprops located in Carlsbad, California.","This acquisition of FAA part one 42 approved training operation was an important next step as we build our business aviation pilot training capabilities. In addition we were just selected by Boeing to develop and supply the full flight simulator training suite for the new 737 MAX program. This is a significant strategic win for TRU as we expand the air transport portion of this business.","Shifting to industrial, we saw a good growth across all our businesses reflecting our continued emphasis on innovation, new product introductions and bolt-on acquisitions. For example in May we announced the acquisition of TUG Technologies, a leading manufacturer of the ground support equipment in the aviation industry significantly augmenting our line of specialized vehicles.","In addition to the obvious sourcing and manufacturing synergies with our existing E-Z-GO Cushman and Bad Boy operations we will be able to leverage sales of TUG products around the world based on our global distribution channels.","Moving to Textron Aviation. In the quarter we delivered 36 business jets and 34 King Airs. In last year\u2019s second quarter we delivered 20 jets and Beechcraft delivered 24 King Airs. Trends of jet demand factor such as aircraft cycles, corporate profitability and availability of used aircraft all continue to move in the right direction. Despite the fact that we remain an in-spot market new products are supporting demand in this segment of the industry.","On the new product front FAA certification of the Citation Ten+ was obtained late in the quarter which allowed us to deliver the first three units. We also completed the EASA certification of the new Caravan EX, the M2 and the Sovereign+ in the quarter.","Our Latitude Program continues to progress towards an expected 2015 entry into service, we now have two Latitude aircraft in test flight reaching over 100 test flights and expect a third to be available for certification activities later this month.","Moving to the defense side Textron Aviation. We had two new orders for our T6 military turboprop [tankers] during the quarter; one for the Mexican Air Force for 12 units and one from the U.S. Navy for 29 units which represent the last lot under the existing JPADS program.","Overall the T6 and the weaponized AT6 are generating significant international interest and we are pursuing a number of promising opportunities.","Our Scorpion program also continues to progress as it recently completed a 4,700 mile trip from Woodstock, Kansas to United Kingdom to participate in the Royal International Air Tattoo and the Farnborough air shows. Interesting, the Scorpion at both shows has been very encouraging and we are in discussions with a number of customers with potential initial orders. Scorpion is also scheduled to participate in a U.S. Government emergency preparedness exercise later this year sponsored by the Pentagon's Northern command, where we'll demonstrate its surveillance capabilities.","To wrap up, we believe we had a very solid second quarter with strong revenue growth and improved overall margins and cash flow performance demonstrating that our strategy is investing in new products and distribution is paying off and we are seeing significant contributions for our M&A investments.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank.","Frank Connor","Thank you Scott and good morning everyone. Segment profit in the quarter was $304 million up $91 million from the second quarter of 2013 on a $670 million increase in revenues.","Let\u2019s look at how each of the segments contributed starting with Textron Aviation. At Textron Aviation, revenues were up $623 million from this period last year reflecting $425 million of acquired Beechcraft revenue and higher new jet volumes. The segment had a profit of $28 million compared to a loss of $50 million at the Cessna segment a year ago. This reflected a $28 million charge taking into segment last year for severance costs higher new jet volume and the impact of the Beechcraft acquisition including a $33 million acquisition inventory step up impact. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1.4 billion down $100 million from the end of the first quarter.","Moving to Bell, revenues were up $94 million reflecting higher commercial and military aircraft deliveries as well as a $41 million revenue benefit related to settlement with the U.S. DoD related to the Systems Development and Demonstration phase of the company\u2019s former Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter Program, which was terminated in October of 2008. Segment profit increased $6 million from the second quarter of 2013 reflecting a $16 million profit impact from the ARH settlement.","At Textron Systems revenues were down $140 million reflecting lower overall volumes. Segment profit was flat despite lower volumes reflecting favorable performance across all product lines and favorable mix of contract revenues during the quarter. Industrial revenues increased $93 million reflecting higher overall volumes and the impact of acquisitions. Segment profit increased $15 million due to the higher volumes and improved performance.","Finance segment revenues decreased $4 million primarily due to gains on finance receivable dispositions during the second quarter of 2013. Segment profit decreased $8 million primarily due to prior year impacts of loan loss reversals and gains associated with the finance receivable dispositions partially offset by lower administrative expenses.","Non-accrual accounts ended the quarter at $88 million, down $10 million from the end of the first quarter while 60 day delinquencies were $96 million, down 29 million in the quarter.","Moving below the segment profit line, corporate expenses were $38 million, interest expenses $36 million up from $30 million a year ago, reflecting debt cost related to the Beechcraft acquisition financing partially offset by the requirement of our convertible debt in May of last year. We recorded $20 million of restructuring costs in the quarter on the acquisition and restructuring line and we still expect full year costs of about $45 million. Our tax rate was 31% and we're still estimating a full year tax rate of 31.5%.","That concludes our prepared remarks. So Rosanne, we can open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Alright. Your first question comes from the line of John Godyn from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. The Bell margins at least versus our estimate came in quite strong this quarter. The last that I remember, management had suggested that Bell margins might come in a bit next year. Is that still the right framework or are we seeing some -- any kind of core operating improvements that might actually improve the margin outlook as we look out?","Scott Donnelly","Well John, obviously we're not at a appoint where we're going to give any kind of explicit guidance on 2015 margins. Obviously there was some benefit in the quarter of settlement on ARH, it was about $16 million which we would not expect to recur. On the other hand, we are working our way through as you know some of the higher cost as a result of last year\u2019s issue. So I think the margin rate in the quarter is about where we would have expected it to be in terms of operational performance. We all know, we'll see lower volumes on V-22s and lower margin rates on V-22s will be going to 2015. So we still have some work ahead of us but we continue to put a lot of focus on cost control and tighten cost base to try to help us get there in 2015.","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","Got it. And as we think about the long-term outlook for biz jet, of course you have seen great contribution from some of the new product lines. When we think about some of the legacy product lines though, do we feel like we're seeing enough here that it's fair to say that these jet trends have sort of stabilized and on their way to a rebound as we look out longer term? If you could just kind of update us on your thought process there that would be helpful.","Scott Donnelly","Well, I think John stable is probably the word we would use right now. I mean I think the market is okay for legacy products, we're doing alright. Obviously most of our growth this year which we forecasted and are realizing is a result of new products. So when you look at full year, Sovereign buses and M2s and now starting to get Citation TEN plus sales, most of what we're seeing -- all of what we're seeing frankly in terms of upside in the market and revenue versus what we saw last year is really driven by new product programs. Of course, we expect to have a contribution in 2015 as a result of the fact that we'll have latitude as well.","So, the underlying market, stable is probably the right word and we certainly hope to see it recover as time goes on. As I said earlier, we're seeing fewer aircraft available for sale in the used market; all indicators are fairly positive, but it's been stubborn in terms of the rate of recovery. So, we're still largely banking on new products coming into the market to drive most of the growth.","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","That's helpful. And then just last question on the outlook for capital returns. Operations have been quite good, it seems like biz jet is stable, integration on Beechcraft is going well. Of course you have some debt here to pay down over time but I'm just curious what management's thought process on capital returns to investors going forward?","Scott Donnelly","So, I think on the capital returns, as I said, we took some debt on obviously associated with the Beech acquisition and that\u2019s kind of the top of our priority list in terms of getting that paid down to get back to where we think the balance sheet should be. We will continue to do stock buyback to avoid the dilution of our employee plans and as we\u2019ve said before we would, on a sort of as appropriate basis continue to do some stock buyback beyond that if it makes sense. So in addition to that of course we\u2019ve had a number of small acquisitions. And I will expect we will continue to see some number of small bolt-on deals. So it\u2019s not a lot of capital but I would say that\u2019s in total how we view our use of cash flow balance sheet.","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","Very helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Chris Sands - JPMorgan","Hi good morning guys. It\u2019s actually Chris Sands on for Joe. Scott, wanted to ask you about the outlook for the 412. The first half run rate suggested that rate could be down quite a bit year-over-year which is in contrast to your expectation for growth overall in commercial. Could you just give us any insight into the demand trends there?","Scott Donnelly","So, Chris, we were certainly very light on 412s in the first quarter. The second quarter 412s were comparable versus 2013 and about where we expected them to be. So we still do have sort of a heavier back half in terms of 412 deliveries. And we don\u2019t usually go down to guide on unit-by-unit basis, but there\u2019ll be relatively comparative numbers versus 2013 is how I would think about the 412 deliveries.","Chris Sands - JPMorgan","For the overall year or just in the second half?","Scott Donnelly","For the overall year. I mean we are a little bit wider because of the first quarter was lighter, the second quarter was comparable. And I would expect as a result the backhalf will be a little heavier on 412s in last year, so the total year would be pretty similar.","Chris Sands - JPMorgan","Great. And then in Systems you\u2019ve commented on the strong program performance kind of across the portfolio, but can you quantify the overall level of [EACs] that added the margin in the quarter?","Scott Donnelly","Well we'll give you the guidance, the total EAC number for the company so I wouldn't break it down into the division-by-division, but we did have EACs in the quarter and I think we've seen pretty strong performance our procession ammunitions business is doing a nice job on productivity, we're seeing it pretty much everywhere across the different businesses. The only thing that I think we would refer to is we did have very good mix i.e. in this quarter, we were very strong on our procession ammunition business which tend to be a positive mix for us.","We didn't see a lot, we did get through the final test evaluation on TCDL but have not started shipping-in in those units yet. And obviously we're sort of in the transition on the vehicle side where we are very wide in the quarter, because we are transitioning from the old April ramps and we'll now start to ramp deliveries for the Canadian program. So those will all be a lot more third, fourth quarter loaded.","Chris Sands - JPMorgan","Right. And then overall your expectation for revenue and margin in the segments for the year hasn\u2019t changed?","Scott Donnelly","That's right, it has not, which means you're going to see more revenue and a lower margin rate as we go into the back half of the year.","Chris Sands - JPMorgan","Right. Alright, thanks guys.","Scott Donnelly","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sheila from Jefferies. Go ahead. Please state your last name.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies","Thanks Scott. It is Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Thank you for taking my question. I guess could you elaborate a little bit more in the conversion opportunities that you're seeing with hawker customers. Has the sales force approached their owners? Any quantitative commentary would be great in terms of I think offering [March after] trade-in option, is it the service offering, how are you lowering them in?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I would say it is kind of couple of step deal. So the first step is as we talk about building that relationship so certainly reaching out to the hawker customers on the service front, folks are already operating these aircraft. There has been a lot of work going on to just make sure we have spare parts flowing and getting that channel filled again and making sure that we are taking care of the customers that already own the aircraft. Clearly we have started discussions with a number of those customers around what they are going to do in the future and making sure that when they want to flip over to new aircraft or upgrade it\u2019s going to be under our line.","So we have frankly a dedicated group of people that are working that pretty hard and interacting with those customers, keep in mind it\u2019s only been a few months that we have been doing this. And so anyone that\u2019s going to entertain a new aircraft or upgrading an aircraft there is usually a process that takes a little while.","So I don\u2019t think I would say at this point here is x examples of hawker customers that have decided to move their next aircraft into the Citation jet but we fully expect that will happen overtime. So but again the job one and the first thing we put a lot of emphasis on is making sure that the level of service and support is back to where they expect it. And I think we are making some progress there.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies","Okay. And then in terms of Cessna pricing of course or Textron Aviation pricing in Q2 could you comment on that? Did you sustain the momentum in Q1? And then also for overall Textron Aviation EBIT, how should we think about cost for the remainder of the year and how that progresses?","Scott Donnelly","","So I think on the pricing front things have been pretty stable probably up just a little bit on most of the models in terms of our cost position I mean the run rate I think we are about where we need to be and we have the teams work pretty aggressively even before the integration period making sure we are ready to take the appropriate cost actions and for the most part those have been taken and we are I think more or less where we need to be at this stage of the game in terms of our cost run rate.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies","Got it, thanks a lot.","Scott Donnelly","","Sure.","Operator","","Your next question comes from line of Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Go ahead.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Hi, thanks. I just wanted to ask about the mix effect I guess within Textron Aviation. You talked about the mix effect in Systems as we look at the second half. On the Q1 call you talked about Tens and Sovereigns coming in should push up the Cessna mix on margins as we go through the year. Do you still expect improvements in the second half versus Q2 or you think Q2 was a pretty representative quarter in terms of mix in Cessna?","Scott Donnelly","I think Q2 is pretty representative. I mean for sure Julian if you compare it on a year over year basis, we do have more sales obviously of the Ten+, the Sovereign+ in the mix. So, I think we're -- should be fairly stable in terms of the mix of the relative sizes of aircraft through the balance of the year.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Thanks. And then on R&D, I think that was down about $14 million year-on-year in Q1 for Textron overall. Is that a similar progression in Q2?","Scott Donnelly","That's a good question Julian I have not gone through the number, it was reported\u2026","Frank Connor","I don't think that (inaudible) the case because we're consolidating Beech now and that would be added in so it becomes a\u2026.","Scott Donnelly","It\u2019s just a timing issue. Yes.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Got it. And then just on now I guess your sort of first half clean margin is sort of 11%, 11.5% if you strip out the ARH\u2019s gain that's implying as for the fully you have a decent margins step up in the back half sequentially even things like V-22 deliveries are flat. Is that just kind of timing on cost savings about coming through in the back half or is it sort of the mix from\u2026.","Scott Donnelly","There is a bit of cost and there is a bit of positive mix in terms of the mix of commercial helicopters as well. So, now we would expect to see more 412 activity in the second half of the year.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Mr. Sprague, do you have your mute button on?","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Thank you, good morning everyone.","Scott Donnelly","Hi Jeff. How are you?","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Hey, just a couple clean up items if I could. First, just on Bell, has kind of the capitalized costs that are in inventory from the labor disruptions and everything kind of worked their way through, is there any residual impact to that left in the back half?","Scott Donnelly","Yes, there is Jeff. I think we've expected throughout the full year to see about a 100 basis points drag as a result of that working its way through. So that will be the same in the second half to the first half.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Okay. So there is no kind of tail off even from a run rate basis?","Scott Donnelly","Really starts with the tail as we go into the beginning of 2015.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","And then I was wondering just on turning the Beech inventory and getting kind of the PPA step-up behind us, where are we at on that perhaps Frank and how do we think about that in the back half for the year?","Frank Connor","Yes. So, we've gotten through 45 roughly of the 65 that we have talked about. So there is about 20 to go and that will obviously hit the back half, add that product and so, it's probably a little bit heavier in the third quarter than the fourth quarter but it depends on delivery.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","And then also just wasn't clear on Beech. Are you implying that kind of Beech net of the step-up and restructuring and everything is kind of OP breakeven or can you give us a little color on just kind of the underlying OP performance at Beech?","Scott Donnelly","Well, it's hard for us, Jeff because we\u2019ve consolidated all these things together. So you're really, we're not tracking given all the SG&A, all the engineering, manufacturing; everything is sort of put together. So we can still get some visibility on the revenue front, the operations are totally integrated. So we really don't have the ability to sort of tease out the differences between those. I guess the only guidance I can give you is gross margin on products is pretty equivalent. So I don\u2019t think -- you can\u2019t forget the accounting of the step up that the margin rates of the various product lines and their contribution are pretty comparable.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Right. And I guess finally just directionally on Bell R&D, is that still have an upper or does that have an upward bias here with 505 and 525 also as you are looking at maybe kind of the overall Bell top-line coming down, obviously with V-22 next year, are you able to kind of compensate the R&D investment?","Scott Donnelly","","Well there is some pressure on that Jeff and like 505 and 525 which will both go in the flight test programs late in the year or so, obviously through 2015 there will be a very active program and flight test for both of those and of course we have the V-280 program which is also ramping up. So there is certainly pressure in terms of R&D, new product programs associated with Bell given that level of activity.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Okay, great. Thank you guys, appreciate it.","Scott Donnelly","","Sure.","Operator","","Alright. Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi. Please go ahead.","Jon Raviv - Citi","Hi, good morning. It\u2019s actually Jon Raviv on for Jason. I had a question about your M&A activity recently specially with the simulation business. I was just wondering if you could talk about what the growth rate out gives you that business and how large you think it can get at this point? I know you talked about some numbers before but if you could update us there that would be helpful.","Scott Donnelly","","Jon, I don\u2019t know we give any specific numbers in the growth rate. I mean I think obviously the reason that we went into the space was because we think at a macro level it\u2019s an industry that\u2019s going to be growing probably at least mid to high single-digits. There are different segments of the market obviously. Our intent is to participate on the air transport side as a simulator provider. And I think you have seen that we\u2019ve had sales that business has largely been in sort of the Boeing and Airbus commercial transport market. This win with Boeing to be the provider for 737 MAX is obviously very big deal for us. And so obviously as the 73 MAX comes into production and they start shipping those around the world, we think we'll get some significant growth associated with that program.","On the training side, it's obviously oriented towards our platforms i.e. by Cessnas and Citations, King Airs and Bell. So, we would expect that business to grow as we introduce new products and start to do more and more training with our new customers that come on line for those platforms.","So, I don't think we're going to give a specific number. I mean it's certainly reasonable to expect that it should be in the high single-digit kind of growth based on what's going on in the marketplace. And clearly we would like to think that we can gain some share and that would help us always that to be a double digit kind of growth business for us.","Jon Raviv - Citi","Great, thanks. And I was wondering if you could update us on the cadence of business jet deliveries. It seems like things are going to be a bit smoother. I was just wondering what your strategy has been in making that happen versus especially how it's been the past couple of years?","Scott Donnelly","We would love for it to be level loaded. Anytime you\u2019re running a manufacturing operation and having a more consistent level load and that's how we like to manufacture and so having a working capital tie out. So revenue was great and this year has certainly been much better than last year and that was there. And part of that is the market and gain a lot of it is driven by the fact that these are new products and so the demand has been steadier for those in the marketplace. We\u2019re not competing with our used aircraft so things tend not to get all the way and trying to do deals at the end of the quarter. So, I think the order flow while it\u2019s not as strong as we\u2019d like to see it ultimately. The order flow has been certainly a lot more level loaded through each quarter in the year.","Jon Raviv - Citi","Great. Thanks very much.","Scott Donnelly","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen","Yes. Thanks a lot and good quarter. Can you give us a split on the backlog between Beech and Cessna?","Scott Donnelly","No, I don\u2019t think we are going to break that out Cai. Obviously you\u2019ve got Cessna, you\u2019ve got Beechcraft, King Airs, you\u2019ve got the military business, it\u2019s all going to be in that one backlog number.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen","Okay. And then the margin given the size of the inventory step up look considerably better than I would have guessed for the level of volume you achieved, is that kind of -- is that sustainable or is there anything abnormal where there the used aircraft was a plus looked pretty good for the level of volume you achieved?","Scott Donnelly","No, I think we\u2019re pretty happy with it Cai. I think that the restructuring activity associated with the synergies and combining the two businesses is on track with where we expect it to be and frankly we\u2019re also seeing some good productivity as we\u2019re bringing the teams together. So it\u2019s not just the synergies the reductions of headcounts, but I think the operational efficiencies throughout the factories were also good in the quarter and that contributed to help give us a pretty strong margin rate.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen","Where are you in terms of your expectation of synergies for the year, are they bigger, the same?","Scott Donnelly","I think the synergies are pretty well on track and again I think to the extent there is upside Cai, it\u2019s the fact that we're just seeing better productivity and operation on top of the synergies.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen","Got it. And maybe Frank you could give us an update on pension? With the expectation of a transition next year to new mortality tables, discount rate is down. Can you provide any color in terms of what we should expect from pension next year?","Frank Connor","Cai we're still looking at it and we won't have those numbers until we kind of formulate them at the end of the year and move into next year. We have had pretty significant change in our workforce that we're running through as well and certainly interest rates where they are would put some pressure on things and the mortality rate, will put some pressure on things. So I don't expect it to be a headwind it's just a question of kind of what type of tailwind might it be and it's probably going to be lower than what we might have thought it\u2019s what we said here the year ago, but we're still working through those and can't give you explosive guidance on that until we actually run the numbers and get the guidance.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen","Terrific. The last one TCDL are we likely to have any shipments there in the third quarter?","Scott Donnelly","Cai I hope so the biggest milestone that we needed to achieve is getting through the final operational test evaluation and we did that. In the quarter, there are still a few things just in terms of final configurations and working through to do the official [submittle] of the ECP into the customer and so those conversations are -- and that review process is ongoing. So I would certainly hope that we will see some initial sales in the third quarter and then the balance of our plan in the fourth quarter, but I would say worse case even if it's delayed somewhat I would still feel pretty confident that we'll get what we expect for the total year in the back half of the year.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","","Good morning, good numbers.","Scott Donnelly","Thanks George.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","I want to try Cai\u2019s question a little differently. Could you just sit there and provide of the $100 million decline in backlog how much of it roughly might have been due for Cessna and how much to Beech without breaking out the military part of Beech that\u2019s applied to each?","Scott Donnelly","Yes, George I obviously don\u2019t -- I do not even know the answer to it because I haven\u2019t, we haven\u2019t been splitting the number up that way, so I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to provide that in terms of guidance or status because it will just be the segment backlog number as we would normally report. And I don\u2019t think there is anything that I even know to say that there have been a material difference between how much of the backlog burn off came out of the Citation jet business versus the King Air business.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","Okay. And then one other on Beech. In the first quarter you\u2019ve said dilution for the year would be about $0.08 a share. Is that number still the same or are you just not going to even provide it given that you\u2019ve combined everything?","Frank Connor","I mean, at this point, it\u2019s a combined operation. We have reiterated our guidance that we gave the last time around. So, we\u2019re really not tracking that separately now. It\u2019s a combined business and we\u2019re moving forward on that basis.","Scott Donnelly","Yes. I mean George, we honestly don\u2019t look at it that way, the engineering teams, the manufacturing teams, the sales, marketing all these teams are now fully integrated. So for us to even try to do that would be sort of arbitrary allocations of those functions to a product lines to try to come up with such a number. So, again it\u2019s not how we operate the business and as a result we really can\u2019t report it that way.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","Okay. And then just one in general Scott, I mean we\u2019ve obviously seen business jet cycles improve and as you mentioned everything is going in the right direction. Can you just kind of size up the lower end of the market versus kind of the middle end of the market as you see it today?","Scott Donnelly","So, I think the lower end of the market has been sort of stable. We\u2019ve seen good demand and deliveries on our M2 which is a new product. I think things have been pretty steady for things like our CJ3s and XLSs. We\u2019re seeing a little more strength at the higher end of the market with the Sovereign pluses and the Tens but again I think that\u2019s more driven by the fact that these are new products are getting out in the market as opposed to necessarily any real difference in generically speaking market demand between say light versus a mid or super mid size aircraft.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","Okay. And then just one quick one for Frank. What was the growth in the aftermarket business at Aviation?","Frank Connor","Yes, well and again it\u2019s tough to look at the comparabilities because of we now have the Beech in the mix but we continue to believe and it\u2019s trending at a mid kind of single digit higher single-digit type growth rate on aftermarket. So, business continues to perform well there.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.","Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton","Good morning guys, nice quarter.","Scott Donnelly","Thank you.","Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton","Hey just on the strong Aviation margin this quarter the underlying rate of like 5.2%, I mean, will you guys attempt to kind of raise margin guidance for the full year from that 2.5% to 3.5% or do you have any performance concerns in the back half of the year just strictly the spot market nature of the business right now?","Scott Donnelly","It\u2019s very much the latter Pete. I think that we\u2019re pleased with how the integration has gone, the synergies are coming along as we expected, we feel good about plant performance, the operational side of things. And while we like that it\u2019s been a more stable market and we\u2019re balanced, there is still a lot of work to do in terms of sales activity in the second half of the year result.","Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton","Okay, got it. And then just a couple of quick\u2026","Doug Wilburne","For Iraq, I just have to say I think that's our first temptation question in my experience doing IR.","Thanks for that.","","Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton","Not a problem. I wanted to ask something -- a couple of program questions. It looked like you guys were negotiating with Iraq on a sale of AT6s, it looked like it could be a nice deal for you. Is that -- what do you think about the timing on that given what's going on over there?","Scott Donnelly","Well, it's a very good question. So there has been discussions of an [AT 6T] over the Iraq. Frankly there are several things across our various businesses that have been in discussion with Iraq. And of course we sold things in Iraq before. So, I\u2019d say, it's very hard to predict where those programs are going right now. There is clearly a desire for the products, the Iraqis continue to express desire to acquire them, but government is awfully busy with a lot of other things right now. So it's -- the level of instability, makes any transaction difficult.","Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton","Understood, understood, okay. And last one on Scorpion. It wasn\u2019t very long ago, the Scorpion seemed like it was going to be very kind of far out. But it seems like a lot of momentum is building and I'm just wondering what your view is. I mean should we start thinking about factoring in some Scorpion revenue at this point for 2015, are we that far along at this point?","Scott Donnelly","I wouldn't get too far ahead of yourself just yet. So what we are encouraged, there has been an awful lot of customer interest having the aircraft to kind of make its debut publicly over here and to be seen by an awful lot of foreign militaries which is sort of our principal customer target at this stage of the game, has been encouraging. But as you know when a military looks at acquiring an aircraft, there are budgetary cycles, there is a lot of work to do to translate something where somebody says, hey that\u2019s very interesting, that would fit well and taking it from that discussion to an order and then a ramp up of production is going to take some time.","So I feel pretty good about where we are. I think the product is performing flawlessly. I mean the guys have done just a super job. It\u2019s flying very well, everybody is thrilled with it, customers are very impressed with it but it\u2019s going to take time. We really just started to market the product. So it\u2019s going to take a budgetary cycle or two to take interest and to turn it to doors.","Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton","Thanks guys.","Scott Donnelly","","Sure.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Miles Walton from Deutsche Bank.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks, good morning and good quarter. I think in response to question on a trajectory of Bell R&D, you talked about some of the upward pressures from the new programs and the dollar; I am curious can you do the same kind of commentary around Cessna, and particularly with the latitude probably winding down a bit on spend and a lot of it is just to do spend in particular how that cadence should look?","Scott Donnelly","","So as we went into this year, we expected R&D to be down slightly at Cessna in terms of the jet business, I mean just comparing the old Cessna to the sort of piece within the current business. Just because we had so much (inaudible) activity last year that really drove certification activities that drove quite a bit of the R&D cost. At this stage of the game, our principal aircraft that really is in the certification is latitude. So you have one instead of three and that does save us somewhat on the certification cost. So, I think that's the expectation I would have this year and I expect that to be the same next year. I think it will probably hold reasonably flat on a consolidated basis. Right? So, if I look at what's going on, on the jet business, there was money obviously being spent at Beechcraft associated with upgrades and keeping the King Air line and T6 and AT6 lines active and I think we'll see that. So, I guess my view going from \u201814 to \u201815 would be that it's probably neutral in terms of R&D as a percent of sales if you will.","","Unidentified Analyst","","And is your view on the longitude and expansionary nature of Cessna jet portfolio is still the same in terms of timing for that kind of entry into service and expansion of the offering?","","Scott Donnelly","Well, we're always looking at the line but I think that the trend towards investing in some of the larger aircraft will absolutely continue. So our guys continue to work in the longitude program. There's number of things we're doing. I think you'll see we continue to be committed to growing the sort of a larger end of our fleet of jets.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, got it. Thanks.","Scott Donnelly","Sure.","Operator","(Operator Instructions). And your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada","Thanks so much. Good morning.","","Scott Donnelly","Good morning, Rob.","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada","On the first question, I was wondering if you could comment on used aircraft activity in Textron Aviation and what sort of trend you saw there in the second quarter.","","Scott Donnelly","Used activity continues to be good. We moved a number of aircraft in the quarter. I'd say the used market in general has been pretty solid. In terms of valuations, I wouldn't say we\u2019ve seen a significant pick up although we\u2019ve seen some of the reports, have seen a little bit of strengthening in some of the pricing, some of the lighter end. And I think in general that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing. So it's stable and most importantly the market is active, our aircraft do turnover, which is good.","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada","Okay. Second aviation question, this might be tough. But you mentioned stability a couple of times in the business jet market and like. But is it reasonable to start expecting some stability in the backlog as well?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I mean obviously the two are going to be correlated rather, they're still selling that goes on in the quarter for the quarter and so you can see increased levels like we've seen in this quarter of selling that doesn't have a positive impact to the backlog. But that's the result of still having a bit of spot market. There is still more selling than we\u2019d like to see obviously for a quarter in a quarter, we have some models out that's we've said before and pushed out where availability is out there the next quarter but there are still aircraft that are available for sale in the third quarter. So I think as long as we have an environment that we'll kind of make it hard to see a lot of growth in backlog and we've been fighting our way through that now for five years.","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada","And just a final one, industrial margin was a very solid in the quarter. How do you expect this to trend for the rest of the year?","Scott Donnelly","The second quarter is always our strongest just because of the cyclical nature of the different businesses and how they contribute. But I think what we\u2019ve seen in the recent past and we expect to continue to see is that if you look on a year-over-year basis, we're going to continue to see some expansion in those margins and part of that's driven by volume, part of that's driven by new products and some better pricing. So I think across the board, we feel pretty good about where those businesses are. So second quarter is usually a peak margin rate for the year, but I certainly expect on a year-over-year basis we\u2019ll continue to see margin expansion each quarter.","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada","Great. Thanks so much.","Scott Donnelly","Scott Donnelly","","Sure.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Rice from Nomura. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey Scott just one quick follow up on sales activity in the second half. So I think on the Sovereigns in particular I think you said that the 1Q the Sovereigns has booked about one quarter out. Is that still the case there and how confident are you filling any empty slots for that particular aircraft (inaudible) particularly you got close to the Latitude launch date?","Scott Donnelly","","Well we still see there are still some slots on Sovereign pluses that are available in the year. We have got I would say a pretty robust set of customer leads and through this year we have been in that mode and those deals have been closing. So the Sovereigns plus has been performing really well, it has had great receptivity from customers and I would say again it\u2019s in this market environment which has been sort of stable the demand for the Sovereign plus has been pretty good.","So lots of customer interest, lots of demo flights and lots of deals that have been closing. So I think we feel pretty good about it. The Sovereign plus versus Latitude, I mean certainly the Latitude has a larger cross section to the cabin, but it is a 6 seat aircraft as opposed to the Sovereigns which is the double club and the Sovereigns also gives you that coast to coast range. So we still have customers that need that range capability and need that pay load capability and so I think the Sovereign plus remains a very strong platform even with Latitude into the market place.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. And then just to confirm one thing I think I heard APG you were talking about some data point suggesting that the used market pricing had taken another turn down but it sounds like from your comments today that the actual pricing in the used market is relatively stable, is that right?","Scott Donnelly","","Yes it really does won around by model. So I think the last set of books for the first time people are talking about some positive price on some of the CJ3s for instance and things like that. But you are always -- we still continue to see some price degradations on some of the aircraft and quick part of that is just, the aircraft get old right. So you are always going to see a certain amount of price decline. But I would say net of overall what we're seeing in terms of our transactions and sort of a book reflected in the industry is that it's been pretty stable and are in good progress.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Thanks.","Scott Donnelly","Sure.","Operator","And you have follow up questions from Cai von Rumohr from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen","Yes, just one question. I mean it looks like in the quarter you kind of beat expectations from a profit line in all of your businesses. It sounds like tone of business is pretty good and you didn't raise your guidance. Is that just being conservative or is there something we should be more worried about in the second half?","Scott Donnelly","Cai, I think that we are feeling good about our operations and how things are going. As I said earlier I think when I look at the Aviation business as well as Bell on the commercial side, there is still a lot of sales activity to go in both of those businesses, that's kind of where we've been for some time with Cessna and I think with King Airs and we feeling good about the prospects and the customer activity and order closure rates and things like that. But there is still a lot of work to be done.","Similarly on the Bell side, I think operating performance, actions the team has been taking have been good, but even at Bell on the order side, we still have aircraft to sell. And well that market has been pretty strong, we are seeing a little bit slower closure activity, there is a lot of bid activity, but there is not -- just from where we would like to be right now on the year the number of deals that have closed to ensure those third and fourth quarter sales has been slower coming than we would have expected. So the year is always a bit back ended, great loaded and it\u2019s going to be the same this year. But I think operationally we feel very good about where things are. I would be a little conservative on upside just given the nature of how much selling activity still has to happen in the Aviation and Bell segments to close up the year where we\u2019d like to be.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is a follow-up from Jason Gursky from Citi. Please go ahead.","Jon Raviv - Citi","Hi guys, it\u2019s Jon Raviv again. Thanks for taking the follow-up. Scott, just on that point in terms of Bell closing activity being a bit slower than expected, just wondering if you guys at all have any color to that why you think that might be the case?","Scott Donnelly","We don\u2019t know. I think it\u2019s kind of a sense that we\u2019re getting across the whole industry. If you look at the reported numbers or what not, there is again still a fair bit of activity. I think part of it is some uncertainties and in some parts of the world. I guess we have some opportunities pending in places like Russia where there has been a lot of change in their economic outlook over the last six months. And I think some of those kind of orders are kind of pending until people understand where that\u2019s going. There is still a fair bit of uncertainty in Latin America, there is, it\u2019s just -- I think there is clearly demand out there but I think a lot of people are going through their processes and getting the bid packages, they see their needs, but they\u2019re a little slow pulling the trigger right now.","Jon Raviv - Citi","Are you seeing any impact in terms of closure activity due to heightened competition with there being more players in particular segments in [aftermarket]?","Scott Donnelly","I think this is an industry wide, I mean everything that we\u2019re kind of hearing is there is nothing unique going on at Bell, I think it\u2019s just the industry as we serve and just kind of what\u2019s going on in those sectors. But again deals are -- these are all competitive deals, and so the guys are putting up bid packages. It\u2019d be a different story if we were losing deals. It's -- I don't see any trend or significant difference in terms of a share issue there, competitive deals and bids are submitted and people are sort of just delaying making the awards.","Jon Raviv - Citi","Great, thanks so much.","Scott Donnelly","Sure.","Operator","And your next question is a follow-up from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","Yes, Scott. I was wondering if you might comment on what percentage of deliveries at Cessna you still need to sell for the second half of the year and how that compares to where you were at this point last year?","Scott Donnelly","Sorry George, I don't know. I mean obviously we don't publish that number. I don't think there is a huge dynamic. I mean as I said, the back end of this year compared to the back end of last year has a lot more new product in it, particularly the third quarter. So we're -- I went back to the numbers I would say we're probably in somewhat better position just because we have a lot more new product here in the third quarter. And as you\u2019ll recall, we didn't have Sovereigns and the M2s until the fourth quarter last year. So at least for the third quarter we're certainly in a better position than we were a year ago.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","Could you comment on how many TEN deliveries you might expect or the ballpark for the year?","Scott Donnelly","No we wouldn't, we did three -- so I mean in the second quarter as we just finished the certification but we've kind of talked in general terms in the past George I think the TEN is probably sort of 6 to 10 aircraft a year kind of market the way we see it.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","Okay. Thanks again.","Scott Donnelly","Sure.","Doug Wilburne","Alright. I believe that completes calls in queue. So thank you ladies and gentlemen for joining us.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded.","Now, I will turn the conference over to your host, Eric Salander, VP, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Eric Salander","Thanks, Sean and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and in today\u2019s press release. On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron\u2019s Chairman and CEO and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.","Textron\u2019s revenues in the quarter were 4 billion, up 192 million from last year. During this year's fourth quarter, we had a couple of notable items that impacted our performance as we disclosed earlier this month in our 8-K filing. First, as a result of the recently passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the company recorded provisional tax charge in the fourth quarter of 266 million or $1 per share related to the re-measurement of net deferred tax assets and the repatriation tax on our non-US undistributed earnings. ","Second, we recorded 55 million in pretax restructuring charges or $0.14 per share after tax. Adjusted income from continuing operations was $0.74 per share, down $0.06 from last year's fourth quarter. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was 474 million compared to 727 million last year\u2019s fourth quarter. For the year, revenues were 14.2 billion, up 3% from a year ago. Adjusted income from continuing operations was $2.45 per share compared to $2.62 last year. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was 889 million, up from 573 million last year.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Donnelly","Thanks, Eric and good morning, everybody. Revenues were up in the quarter with increases at industrial and Bell, partially offset by lower revenues at aviation and systems. At Bell, revenues were up on higher military volumes for the quarter. We delivered 7 V-22s, up from 4 last year; 13 H-1s, up from 8 last year and 45 commercial helicopters compared to 35 in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. ","On the commercial side, we continue to see a pickup in order demand across a broad base of customers. We've seen several recently signed 412 orders for customers in Southeast Asia. We received an order from Reignwood International for 50 505s as a follow on to the 60 aircraft that were ordered earlier this year. We also received an order from Mercy Flight for three 429s to upgrade the remainder of the existing air medical fleet. ","On the new product front, we achieved first flight of our Bell V-280 Valor tiltrotor, representing a major milestone on this important development program. The systems revenues were down on lower volumes, primarily at Weapons and Sensors related to the discontinuance of the SFW production program. In the quarter, we received an FMS order for the Afghan National Army for 55 mobile strike force vehicles with a potential for up to 200 additional units. At TRU Simulation and Training, we signed an agreement with Copa airlines to provide a Boeing 737 MAX Full Flight SIM to fulfill the Latin American Airlines growing pilot training requirements.","Moving to Industrial, revenues were up 20% for the quarter, primarily reflecting the impact of Arctic Cat. We saw improved demand in the snow retail channel, allowing dealers to clear older inventory and drive 2018 model sales, including our new introductions in the youth and mountain categories. We also saw higher sales in our E-Z-GO product line, led by our new lithium powered ELiTE golf car. At Textron GSC, our ground transport business received an order from Airpro in Finland for seven [indiscernible] Typhoon de-icers. ","Moving to Textron Aviation, revenues were 1.4 billion, down 3%. In the quarter, we delivered 58 jets, flat with last year, 31 King Airs, up from 28 in last year\u2019s fourth quarter and two Beechcraft T-6 trainers, down from 8 last year. For the full year, we delivered 180 jets, up from last year\u2019s 178, including 54 Latitude deliveries. Since the introduction in 2015, we\u2019ve now delivered 112 Latitudes, demonstrating the importance of new product development in this industry. We saw strong order intake in the quarter for both turboprops and jets, including 8 caravans for charter cargo and logistics operators in Botswana, 3 King Air 250s to a North American customer configured for air ambulance services and three Latitudes for a fractional operator in Mexico.","Moving to the aftermarket, increased aircraft utilization continue to drive higher aftermarket revenues, which were up over 11% in the quarter. ","To summarize the year, we continued to execute our plan for growth through strategic acquisitions and new product innovation to create long term shareholder value. At Industrial, the integration of Arctic Cat continues and reflects our strategy of acquisitions that complement our core businesses and product lines. Equally important is the need to continue to innovate through new product introductions, which was evident throughout Textron\u2019s specialized vehicles. ","Earlier this year, we unveiled the revolutionary E-Z-GO ELiTE lithium powered golf car, which has now seen over 21,000 units delivered. On the snow side, we introduced a class leading Arctic Cat ZR 200 new snowmobile as we continue to develop our [slate of] [ph] product line up. In December, we introduced the Textron offroad Havoc X, the best-in-class high performance side by side featuring 100 horsepower and a class leading four wheel double A-arm suspension package. At Textron systems, we advanced our ship to shore program towards first flight, introduced the night warden tactical unmanned aircraft system and received a follow-on FMS mobile strike force vehicle order. At Textron airborne solutions, we\u2019re making the necessary investments to position the business to capitalize on the growing era of the [indiscernible] services market.","Moving to Bell, we saw the V-22 fleet surpass 400,000 flight hours, demonstrating the reliability of order technology, which we further evolved to another significant milestone, which was the first flight of the V-280. On the commercial side, strong order activity for the new 505 Jet Ranger X and the resumption of the 525 relentless flight test program demonstrates Bell\u2019s position as an innovative leader in the commercial helicopter market.","At Textron Aviation, we saw improved order intake in the back half of the year as well as the strengthening of the international market. On the new product front, the Longitude is nearing the end of its flight test program and we anticipate certification in the first quarter. This new entry in the super mid-sized business aircraft market offers class leading range, payload and cruise speed along with a quietest interior in the industry. In November, we announced the Cessna SkyCourier, the new twin engine large utility turboprop. The FedEx is our launch customer with an initial fleet order of 50 aircraft.","In summary, we came in to 2017 knowing it would be a challenging year with uncertainties surrounding many of our end markets, several key product development programs nearing key milestones and restructuring and integration activities in many of our businesses. That said, we have entered now on 505 into service, 525 is resuming its flight test program. We achieved first flight on the V-280. We had successful demonstration on both the Scorpion and the AT-6 in the US Air Force OA-X program. The Longitude is nearing its certification and entering to service. Denali is progressing towards first flight and we've successfully integrated the integration of Arctic Cat.","With these accomplishments behind us in improving end markets, we're well positioned coming into 2018. As we look at our financial guidance, we're projecting revenues of about 14.6 billion as we expect growth at aviation and industrial, with lower revenues at Bell and Systems. We expect margin improvements across aviation, industrial and systems, with Bell about flat. EPS from continuing operations will be in the range of $2.95 to $3.15. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions will be in the range of 700 million to 800 million and consistent with 2017, we expect a substantial portion of the cash to be returned to shareholders through share repurchase programs again in 2018.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Frank.","Frank Connor","Thank you, Scott and good morning everyone. Segment profit in the quarter was 360 million, down 31 million from the fourth quarter of 2016 on 192 million increase in revenues. Let's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation. At Textron Aviation, revenues of 1.4 billion were down 3% from this period last year, primarily due to lower military volume. Segment profit was 120 million, down from 135 million a year ago, primarily due to higher research and development expense, largely driven by the Longitude flight test program. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at 1.2 billion, up 15 million from the end of the third quarter.","Moving to Bell, revenues were 983 million, up 11% on higher military volumes, partially offset by lower commercial volumes. Segment profit of 114 million was down 12 million despite the increase in revenues, primarily related to a change in commercial mix. Backlog in the segment was 4.6 billion at the end of the quarter, down 407 million from the end of the third quarter. At Textron systems, revenues were 489 million, down from 532 million a year ago on lower volume at weapons and sensors. Segment profit of 37 million was down 16 million, primarily reflecting the lower volume at weapons and sensors. Backlog in the segment was 1.4 billion, down 67 million from the end of the third quarter.","Industrial revenues were 1.1 billion, up 20% largely related to Arctic Cat. Segment profit was up 10 million from the fourth quarter of last year due to favorable performance. Finance segment revenues decreased 3 million and profit increased 2 million.","Moving below segment profit, corporate expenses were 44 million compared to 56 million last year. This reflected the transition of the Scorpion program into the aviation segment. Interest expense was 38 million, an increase of 5 million compared to last year. With respect to our restructuring plan, we recorded pre-tax charges of 55 million on the special charges line in the quarter. This represents the final charge under our restructuring programs. We ended the year with gross manufacturing debt of 3.1 billion. For the full year, we repurchased approximately 12 million shares at an overall cost of about $582 million.","Turning out to 2018, our guidance includes the impact of adopting the new revenue recognition accounting standard. This adoption principally impacts Bell and Textron Systems as we will transition government contracts from recognizing revenue at delivery to a cost incurred method. The impact of the new method will be immaterial to our overall segment profit with revenue slightly higher at Textron Systems and relatively unchanged at Bell. Also related to this adoption, we will record an increase to retained earnings of approximately $90 million in the first quarter of 2018 with no restatement of prior periods. Additionally, we are adopting a new pension accounting standard that will change how we present pension and OPEB costs on our income statement, but will not change our segment reporting. The effective adopting of this accounting standard will not have a material impact to our financial results. Finally to align with new revenue recognition standards, our R&D guidance is now presented on a gross basis whereas we previously netted US government shared R&D costs.","Turning now to our presentation, I\u2019ll begin with our segments on slide 9. At Textron aviation, we're expecting higher revenues of about $5 billion, reflecting higher volumes across all our product lines. Segment margin is expected to be approximately 8%, reflecting the higher volume and improved performance. Looking to Bell, we're expecting overall revenues will be slightly down at about 3.2 billion, reflecting lower military volumes. We're forecasting a margin of about 12%. At systems, we're estimating lower 2018 revenues of about 1.6 billion, reflecting lower volumes in unmanned systems and weapons and sensors. Segment margin is expected to be 8%. At industrial, we're expecting growth in each of our businesses resulting in projected segment revenue of about 4.7 billion and a margin of about 8%. At finance, we're forecasting segment profit of about 20 million turning.","Turning to slide 10, based on a US plan discount rate of 3.75%, we're estimating 2018 pension cost to be $40 million, down from last year.","Turning to slide 11, gross R&D is expected to be about 620 million, down from 634 million in 2017. We're estimating CapEx will be about 525 million, up from last year. ","Moving below the segment line and looking at slide 12, we're projecting about 130 million for corporate expense, 140 million for interest expense, a full year effective tax rate of about 22.5%. Our estimated tax rate for 2018 is lower than \u201917 due to the enactment of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017. Our guidance assumes a share count of about 263 million shares, reflecting the continuation of our share repurchase activity in 2018.","That concludes our prepared remarks. So Sean, we can open the line for questions.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question will come from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","I guess first one on aviation margins, you\u2019re assuming up 150 basis points to 8% for aviation. How do we think about the R&D impact, mix and pricing factored into those assumptions?","Scott Donnelly","Sheila, I think it\u2019s largely favorable on all fronts. I mean, obviously as on the R&D front, as we finished last year's work around the Scorpion program, obviously we had a lot of work around the Longitude, we're complete with the Scorpion activity, the Longitude here will wrap up in the first quarter. Obviously, we have Denali coming along. We've got the SkyCourier, I mean, there's certainly plenty of work, but on a year-over-year basis, it's certainly a tailwind for them. ","As we\u2019ve talked about, we will certainly have a better volume on our T-6 line, which has been a good business for us as we increase that. We certainly expect to see some margin improvement driven by that and we'll have a better year-over-year on the aftermarket side. We have seen a strong back half of the year, given the aircraft utilization rates are higher. So I think, particularly on a year-over-year basis, we\u2019ll benefit from that as we go into the first half.","On the jet side, I don't think there will be a huge difference. We will have the initial Longitude deliveries, which is going to be most of the increase in the jet side of things. Obviously, the first few units will be at a lower margin rate, but that will correct as we get towards the back half of the year.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","And so in terms of pricing, there isn\u2019t a major pricing assumption there?","Scott Donnelly","Well, we do have price factored in. And as you will see, we had fairly strong year-over-year pricing increases here in the fourth quarter and we'll continue to do that. Part of what we're looking at in terms of volume anticipation in our plan is that, there's no question that we, I think, everyone feels much better about where we are in the end market here in terms of demand. So I think we're certainly -- compared to 2017 entering into a much better market. We are going to continue to drive price to make sure that it's healthy volume and I think that we will -- we were successful in doing that this year and I think we\u2019ll be successful doing it next year as well. So there will be obviously a positive contribution on the pricing side.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","And then as it regards to Scorpion R&D, I believe you might have ended up at 100 million for 2017, how do we think about that into 2018? Is there any way to quantify this?","Scott Donnelly","It was not that high, Sheila. We don\u2019t give R&D program by program, but certainly it's going to de minimis in 2018. There is still some customer activity going on, some demo flights, integration with a couple of different sensors that customers have asked us about, but it will be an immaterial number in 2018.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Carter Copeland from Melius Research.","Carter Copeland","Look, I wondered if you could give us just a little bit more color around the gross R&D disclosure. I think you don\u2019t disclose the R&D by program, but just kind of give us a sense of some of the moving pieces there year-over-year. Clearly, you've got Longitude and Scorpion are down and 525 is up, but now you've got that government portion that you called out in there, just any chance you can give us some color on the moving pieces there, just in general terms?","Scott Donnelly","I think when you look at our numbers, Carter, we\u2019ve recast last year so that this issue of what's netted versus gross is kind of a non-issue, we were showing you the numbers on an apples-to-apples basis. So the actual reduction that we're showing, again, your dynamics that you're kind of looking at are correct, right. We have significantly lower spend on Scorpion, we will see [indiscernible] some of the more intense spending around Longitude as we get that through certification. Principally that\u2019s offset by the fact that we have the 525 back in flight test and we have the V-280 in flight test. So that aircraft did get its first flight last year, but the guys are flying it a lot here in January and we expect to see that sustained all the way through the year. So it's largely a trade between a couple of those fixed wing programs and a couple -- some increased spending in the rotor and tiltrotor area.","Carter Copeland","And then an additional one for Frank on the pension front, any consideration around prefunding associated with the change in tax?","Frank Connor","Well, we did that last year. We did that in the third quarter. We did an offering kind of in the third quarter for $300 million and contributed that to the pension plan. So we feel like we're in very good shape. We did have a discount rate reduction, but frankly that was offset by our performance from a return standpoint in 2017 that was well above our expected rate and so we feel like we're in good shape on the pension front and do not anticipate any contributions as we said other than the 55 million of cash related to kind of unfunded plans.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Robert Stallard from Vertical Research.","Robert Stallard","Scott, your counterpart over at General Dynamics had some pretty positive things to say about the bizjet market in the fourth quarter. Would you agree with her general prognosis that we've seen a distinct turn in demand environment over the last three months?","Scott Donnelly","I would never disagree with Phebe. Look, I think what they're seeing in the larger aircraft is probably quite similar with what we're seeing in the light to mid-size where most of our work is. I think, the number of inquiries, the amount of activity through the fourth quarter, as you know, for us to sustain a one-to-one or greater book to bill in a fourth quarter, considering that's our seasonably very heavy sales side is a pretty significant accomplishment I think for our team to hold that book to bill. So, the amount of activity, the interest that I think is reflective of the fact that we have a stronger growth economy. ","Business confidence is up and these are our buyers. So I think there's no question that the level of activity out there is stronger than we've seen in some time. Again, we're being a little bit cautious and making sure that we see all the stuff really convert and continue to convert into orders at a fair price and if that continues to happen, I think we feel the same about our business that it's in a very good position. We\u2019ve got some great new products. I think we're well positioned that if this market is in fact strengthening and it does deliver, that we\u2019ll be in good shape to benefit from that.","Robert Stallard","And then a follow-up on your investment plans, in terms of company funded R&D and CapEx going forward, where do you see this heading in 2019 and 2020?","Scott Donnelly","We\u2019re just kind of recovering from our 2018 activity. I don't know if I go into \u201919 and \u201920 just yet, but look, I think if you look at the work that we have underway, the amount of investment that we think we need to make to make sure that we have the right products in place in our key businesses to ensure that we can capitalize on strong markets, I don't think there's going to be a huge change in the R&D. Obviously, we expect it to continue to generate a tailwind in terms of percent of sales, but we have a lot of great stuff in the pipeline in aviation. We have a lot of great stuff in the pipeline at Bell. We have a lot of great stuff going on in the vehicle business and these are things where you need to make these investments, if you're going to continue to grow the business. So again, I don't think we'll see radical changes in terms of the R&D spend, but obviously our expectation is that it will reduce as a percent of sales.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Peter Arment from Baird.","Peter Arment","Scott, I guess finally to get pretty excited about the Longitude getting across the goal line here with certification. What's been some of the feedback now as you get close to kind of certification from some of the customers in terms of you've introduced before the aircraft too?","Scott Donnelly","It\u2019s been great, Peter. We have had a demo aircraft that's completely fitted out with full customer Interior that's been flying around, doing a lot of customer demos here for the last few months and I think the feedback has been great. It's a great cabin, I mean from a space standpoint, we get a lot of the same feedback that we got in the Latitude, which has been obviously a very, very well received product. ","Obviously, this is a bigger aircraft. It's a longer aircraft, it's a very quiet aircraft. It is the quietest aircraft in the industry and we get that feedback very strong, customers getting back of this thing and do a demo flight and are amazed at how quiet and as a result comfortable it is in the back of that aircraft. So again, the feedback is great. We need to get this thing across the goal line on the certification and we feel good about where the aircraft is. It's flown beautifully. I mean, it\u2019s -- there's no issues there. It\u2019s a matter of getting through the paperwork and certification process, which we will do.","Peter Arment","And then just a quick one, maybe Frank or just on the CapEx step up, what's really driving that this year.","Scott Donnelly ","Well, the big step up is, as we've kind of been public with Peter is we're acquiring quite a few assets to be able to support these adversary air programs and so that's really the change in year-over-year is our acquisition of aircraft. The Navy program is in proposal phase right now. The Air Force is already having their industry days. So, there is a huge opportunity out there in terms of the number of hours that the US government and I believe, ultimately international customers as well are going to look to private contractors to provide adversary air and the reality is, if you don\u2019t have the assets, you can\u2019t do it. So, the only tough part of this for us is you got to get out in front of it and spend the capital to have the assets and get everything prepared in terms of maintenance facilities and demos, so there's a little bit of a drag frankly in there to support that, but it's a huge growth opportunity and one that seems to be materializing.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Cai Rumohr from Cowen & Company.","Cai Rumohr","So last year, you projected R&D and this is on a net basis for 2017 of 495 and the gross number was 634, so what was the number apples to apples, \u201917 versus -- achieved versus \u201917 projected.","Scott Donnelly","Hold on a second. We\u2019re on apple-to-apple and so that we can get to your other apple-to-apple out.","Cai Rumohr","If you tell me what the military is, I think we can back into it. Hello.","Scott Donnelly","We're just trying to go back to the guidance number.","Cai Rumohr","It was 495 net.","Scott Donnelly","It was about 520.","Cai Rumohr","So basically you overran your guide by 25 million and I assume a lot of that was with Scorpion and to a lesser extent the Longitude?","Scott Donnelly","It was primarily driven by the support we put into the Air Force experimental program. So between mission system development on Scorpion as well as the cost to get the AT-6 up and running and configured and ready for that test, that's most of what drove the spend. So when we started the year, we didn't know anything about the Air Force experimentation program and obviously putting two aircraft in to that program was not in our plan.","Cai Rumohr","All right. And maybe you said that the outlook is good to sell them. Who's going to buy it and when?","Scott Donnelly","Are you talking about Scorpion?","Cai Rumohr","Yeah. Scorpion or AT-6, either ones.","Scott Donnelly","So, look, I think that the Air Force has been very open about the fact that they're working on determining their next steps. We have a reason to believe that they're doing that in terms of what their next step is going to be. The CR complicates that process for them, because obviously these are new programs and therefore they don't really have any budget authority under CR to do that, but we know they're working to determine what those next steps will be. I think the next steps again will be different for different platforms, but it would be presumptuous to talk much about that since they haven't been able to publicly say what they want to go do until they understand their budget situation.","In terms of non-US not related things, as I said, we still have customers that are in discussions with us. There are ongoing activities. I think the level of activity in terms of what we have to spend to support those at this point is pretty de minimis, but we have customers coming in, asking questions, looking at integration of different systems and we continue to support that.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Pete Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton.","Pete Skibitski","Scott, I was wondering if you can talk more about what you're hearing in terms of the impact of tax reform to your light bizjet customer base. They've got the corporate rate reduction, which I imagine, if you're a small business owner, that's got to be helpful. You've got, I think the media expensing up to 2022, but you've also got just kind of issue the repeal, light kind exchanges. So just wondering how you're hearing that\u2019s all going to net out for your bizjet customer base?","Scott Donnelly","Look, I think it nets out all to the positive really. Right. So, there's certainly a benefit to them, sort of what I would say mechanically around tax. That is the 100% expensing is beneficial. The overall tax rate reduction for all these businesses is obviously very helpful. And I think probably even more importantly, I think everybody's expectation is that and I think we're seeing this is that the impact of the tax cuts beyond the mechanics here is to help drive economic growth and get GDP at a higher level and I think we're seeing that and that reflects when a guy is sitting there, looking at his business and what their anticipation, what their expectations are for the growth of their own business, I think this is what's driving business confidence to a very high level. ","So I think the combination of the direct tax benefit around expensing, the low rate that they\u2019re experiencing in their business and probably most importantly, the level of confidence they have that they're going to see growth in their business as a result of higher economic growth, higher GDP primarily around the US is all very positive. So I think that is a huge help in terms of the US market and I think we're also seeing stimulation around the international markets. And again the US helps to drive that. ","If we have higher economic growth, that's good for generally speaking economies around the world, a little bit of weakening on the dollar obviously for a company like ourselves, the US manufacturer with a lot of export is beneficial. So I think that not only the direct impact around tax in the US, but the knock on benefits in some of the international markets is clearly we're seeing a different tone in those markets as well. So sort of a combination of all of the above.","Pete Skibitski","One quick headwind, at systems in 2018, could you guys quantify the year-over-year headwind from the Sensor Fuzed weapon closure and then, so UAVs will be down in \u201818. Are they going to bounce back, return to growth or will that be kind of a flattish outlook going forward for UAVs?","Scott Donnelly","Well, certainly, it\u2019s going to be down this year, Peter. The question is going to be, there are a couple of new upgrade programs and things that are in the works, but again if this is one of our challenges in again that business, which has a large US centric customer base is where do the budgets go, when do we get budgets, I mean, there's a lot of noise around that. There's certainly opportunities around that class of aircraft to look at next generations of upgrades and enhancements and improvements, which we would benefit if that goes forward, but without having budgets, it's hard to figure out exactly where that is. ","So it's in terms of the future, it\u2019s hard for me to comment directly on that. I can't give you the direct number, I don't think of SFW, but last year, we went basically, if you think about what our SFW was, we had about 50% of what we usually have last year and we have a 0% this year. So we\u2019re sort of taking a two-step from what that business historically was to basically being out of that business right now. Now, there are a number of new weapons, munitions programs that we're bidding on, that we're actively pursuing. Again, the budget situation makes it difficult to know exactly where these are going, but that's certainly a business where we've gone through a steep decline as a result of the exit of SFW, but obviously we have a lot of work going on to try to get that piece of the business back in a growth trajectory.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.","Sam Pearlstein","Can you just tell us what your underlying assumptions are in terms of aviation delivery this year? We know the Longitude is coming in, but just kind of jets versus King Airs T-6s broadly, how are you thinking about it year-over-year?","Scott Donnelly","I'd say probably, Sam, the jets, we're assuming at this point largely flattish with the exception of an increase driven by the Longitude introduction. The Turboprops, clearly, we expect those to be up, T-6 and we talked about all year, this was a tough year for us in \u201917 on T-6s, we see a nice increase in T-6 deliveries in 2018. We saw a fairly weak front half of the year on the commercial turboprops. Obviously, we're feeling better about where we're going in to 2018 in terms of the level of activity and frankly some backlog in those areas. ","So I certainly think that we'll see increases in the commercial turboprop in total as well and again, we saw strong growth in the second half of the year in the service side of the business, driven by high utilization rates. So clearly, we would expect that we'll see that continue, which means we will see particularly comparables in the first and second quarter of the year will be stronger than they were in \u201917. You get to the back half of the year, I mean it's hard to say at this point, but it's -- because we saw a lot of growth year-over-year already in those two quarters. But as far as I say Sam, I think that if you look at jets principally driven in our assumptions around Longitude, service growth and clearly in material, we\u2019ll probably see growth, especially on the military side of the business.","Sam Pearlstein","And is there any way to think about in terms of new programs, whether it's 525 or Longitude, how many you can expect to get out this year.","Scott Donnelly","Well, so we don't go -- we don't do units by model. Obviously, we expect to get a certification by the end of the quarter, so you would expect to enter into service with first customer deliveries in the second quarter and look, again, it depends a lot on how the market is doing and I\u2019d say, the feedback on the aircraft is very strong. As we\u2019ve seen in recent times as you won't start to see lot of these things closed orders until you worked your way through the certification. So we kind of have to play that by year. So 525, you won't have sales this year, right. We should get all of our flight test program complete and wrapped up by the end of the year. Everything should be in to the FAA and we\u2019ll be working at the certification process at the end of \u201918. But we certainly don't expect to see sales, the first 525 sales activity should be \u201919.","Sam Pearlstein","And then just more on Bell, I guess 12% margins on modestly lower sales, last year, you started at 11 in terms of the margin ended up doing better. It feels like what has changed in the helicopter business that\u2019s allowing you to put up these kind of margins versus the 10% or 11% and what are those key drivers in terms of what\u2019s down year-over-year on a sales level?","Scott Donnelly","Well, what's down on a year-over-year sales level will be on the military side, right. We'll see fewer military sales. I think that we certainly hope to turn that corner. There's a lot of FMS activity that\u2019s going on. Obviously, we've been frustrated by lack of notifications in Congress, some things in the Middle East, but clearly we have customers that want product and we think we'll get some of that progressed into the order category here as we work our way through \u201918 to try to get that turnaround. We certainly expect to be up on the commercial side. We have a good full year of strong deliveries on 505s. ","We've closed couple of important orders on 412s. So we\u2019ll certainly see an increase in 412 volumes this year, which is a great product for us obviously. So, in general, you're seeing a trade between some military product that's going to be the lower volume and commercial that\u2019s going to be at a higher volume, but net of all that, I think the team is doing a nice job of managing, driving good activity to help offset some significant investments in the new product front, but it's a pain for all for us. The 505 is driving good volume, the 412 VPI, those upgrade programs are helping to give the 412 alive and well and obviously we have the 525 and the B280 coming down the line. So, I think the business is doing a nice job of driving productivity, maintaining strong margins and yet making some pretty significant investments in products that are going to drive our future growth.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Justin Bergner from Gabelli and Company.","Justin Bergner","I just want to discuss the demand for business jets and tax reform. First off, as it relates to personal purchases of business jets, are you, as a team, aware of anything that would prevent someone from buying a business jet and taking the full deduction on their personal tax return to get a deduction where the state and local tax deduction might be going away for a wealthy individual.","Scott Donnelly","Well, I mean, it has to be a business expense, right. So I mean we certainly have individuals that purchase aircraft and they have to pro rata the depreciation between business and personal utilization. But no, absolutely, there is nothing in the tax law that changes with respect to how that's done. The only difference is that it\u2019s 100% expensing versus the 50%. Well, I mean, obviously, we have bonus depreciation, which is 50% year one. But no, there's no change in the tax law. It's purely a matter of allocation between a legitimate business expense or a personnel expense.","Justin Bergner","And then, there was a big article in The Sunday Times by a London based business jet broker talking about sort of extraordinary ramp up in demand for business jets. Over recent months, are you seeing any signs of sort of meaningful acceleration. I know you have a tempered guidance for business jets, but are there signs that you're seeing that suggest maybe things are going to ramp up much quicker than your guidance would suggest?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I have to say I don't usually read the Sunday Times, so I don't know this, but this is a article, but look, we are -- I think the sentiment that we're seeing in customer interaction, the level of activity is all very positive, we need to see these things come to fruition. There's no question that in the used aircraft market, that's continued to be a good liquidity. People are selling aircraft. Good news for us is we see fewer trades because the market is strong enough, the brokers out there are being able to move aircraft. So what I hope is right and obviously we think with the investments that we've made and the product lineup we have that if the market strengthens, we\u2019ll be a big beneficiary of that, but I think we need to see sort of that, the enthusiasm that we sense that's out there turning to sales.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Jon Raviv from Citi.","Jon Raviv","When you look at slide 9 of your presentation, where do you see some of the opportunities or risks, not just in \u201918 but really going forward and maybe speaking more about something like systems where in the past, we've seen double digit margin, industrial margin used to be higher and obviously aviation could be higher as well. On a long run basis, where do you want to see improvement in your segment?","Scott Donnelly","Well, we'd like to see improvement everywhere. I mean I kind of still think that we work with the guys all through the year, but look aviation, when we look at the aviation number, obviously, we are assuming a relatively flattish legacy jet line. And clearly, we have the ability to flex that, if we do see stronger demand. So if we see stronger demand, if market is there, then we can see upside to that. I think at Bell, you're probably not able to see a whole lot of upside on the revenue side and we pretty much know what that number is. The guys do a good job generally as we work our way through the year on the productivity side, but I think it's a pretty solid guide. ","Obviously, we\u2019ll try to work to get a little upside on the profitability side, but it's, I think, even at 12%, the business is doing really well and it's pretty balanced performance. Look, systems is tough, because if you take SFW out, which is a great program for us, we're kind of heavy right now on things like ship to shore, which are great programs, I mean there's going to be a lot of volume there and a great business going forward, but we're still in that sort of fixed price development and we\u2019re working in the integration and testing to come along okay. We should get some major milestones this year as we get the thing into the water and get it operating and go through trials. ","But, I wouldn't say that there's a lot of upside there, just given the nature of the kind of programs that we're executing right now. Industrials, probably, I mean a pretty solid guide I think. I mean there's, it gets Arctic Cat to where it\u2019s accretive, it's pretty solid performance, but I think that's where we would really expect to be. So that\u2019s kind of color around that I guess. Clearly, the largest upside would be if the business aviation market really does start to accelerate and we\u2019ll benefit from that.","Jon Raviv","And just in your commentary about the tax reform bill, creating changes in the economy, what do you guys doing maybe almost philosophically, how are you guys approaching the way you're managing the business, capital allocation with this relatively wide ranging bill now legislated?","Frank Connor","It really hasn't changed our strategy. I mean, we've already been investing significantly in terms of R&D and our next generations of products. I think, we've been appropriately putting the capital in place to support that, be it in the tooling to support new product programs, continue to win and grow in our industrial businesses. So, I think our capital allocation strategy isn't really impacted. I mean, clearly, we will see a cash tax benefit in \u201918 as a result of the lower tax rates. And as I said, I think from a capital allocation perspective, we'll continue to pursue what we did in \u201917, which was frankly pretty aggressive on the buyback side and that's been our principal way of returning cash for our shareholders and I would expect to see that continue in \u201918.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan.","Seth Seifman","Scott, in recent years, you guys have had some tough breaks in some of the end markets and some execution items that came up and so there's been a fair number \u2013 a fair amount of downward pressure on estimates. When you think about how you set up this year and how things are looking, I mean I know you always set the guidance and intend to make it, but in terms of like the puts and takes and how much risk there is around the guide this year compared to previous years, how would you sort of -- how would you assess that?","Scott Donnelly","Well, so I think it\u2019s kind of the walk that we just did through the page 9 is kind of where I would say the puts and takes are to this thing. I mean, as we\u2019ve said, we\u2019ve struggled a little bit, particularly in the third quarter in some of the industrial, on TSV. I think the guys are getting that back on track. I mean, there's obviously still work to do in finishing the integration, but we're -- I think our guidance is a fair number. There is -- I don't know that I could add a whole lot more color to it. I mean I think, yeah, we ran into some softer end markets than we expected. ","We had a couple of problem programs that put a lot of pressure on us in \u201917, which we started the year at \u201917 saying that we probably were dealing with a difficult year in terms of a lack of growth, which we've historically delivered. But I think we're positioned well going into \u201918. There's all these issues to work through the year, but I think a lot of the things that we need to do, both problem programs as well as some investments that we thought we needed to do and things we had to get in place for \u201918 are largely there. So I think we feel pretty good about where we are going into the year.","Seth Seifman","And just as a follow-up on V-22, maybe if you could give us an update on where you think we are in terms of signing the next multi-year in terms of you, if the type of appropriations bill that\u2019s being talked about gets signed, if that gives you, you think, a plus up and maybe kind of take some of the sting out of the decline that\u2019s coming for 2019 and 2020 and how you're thinking about preparing Bell for that, just sort of an overall update on V-22?","Scott Donnelly","Well, so V-22 is the multi-year three, negotiations are underway, right. We're working that in real time with the customer. I think they obviously are working and I'm trying to understand their budgets and that whole process to frame the program, but right now, I would say, we're probably looking at a Q2 or so contract to get multi-year 3 underway. I think the program record is well understood. Obviously, we\u2019ve had the ads on the Navy program that are again well understood and I don't think there's going to be a whole lot of volatility around the volumes, but it will be a step down certainly from where it was in multi-year 2. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s changed. I think it is probably looking like a five year program, all right. There was a while there, people were talking maybe it could be a seven year program. It's looking to me, I think the way they're going to appropriate, it will probably be in a more of a five year contract, which is fine.","Operator","We have a question from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro","Scott, I was wondering if you could break out at least a little bit overall, the back like increase or the book to bill that would have been in commercial versus military because it seems like military was down and commercial would have been up by more.","Scott Donnelly","George, I think from a color standpoint, the stuff that was in -- largely in the backlog, predominantly on the T-6 front has been there. So most of the movement you've seen was driven by the commercial side of the business.","George Shapiro","So if you took out the military side, what would be the commercial have been up?","Scott Donnelly","I don't think we'll probably do any more color than that, George in terms of the backlog.","George Shapiro","And then on R&D, why wouldn\u2019t R&D be down by more in \u201918? I mean, I figure Scorpion was maybe 75 million in \u201917, going down to pretty close to zero and you've got total backlog down, total R&D down 14 million. Longitude finishes, you start delivery here in the first quarter. So where's all the imputed higher R&D coming from?","Scott Donnelly","Well, we are obviously getting a benefit significantly lower funding as you say on the Scorpion program. We do have the Longitude, which will be still strong here in the -- at least in the first quarter or so of the year as we finish the certification testing. So we will certainly have less R&D spending on the fixed wing side, but we do have the knowledge heading towards its first flight. We do have the SkyCourier program, which is I think will be a great program for us and we're being pretty aggressive about getting all over that thing and doing that program in sort of that 30-month window and have a whole team work in that. ","So it's not like R&D spending is going away in the fixed wing world. We do have work to do and I think programs that will be very strong growth programs for us. As I said, I think there is a bit of a shift here with 525 being back with the whole year of the flight test program, V-280, which again is a huge potential program for us. So a lot of R&D spending in that area to support that flight test program as well.","George Shapiro","And then last one, how long would it take for you to decide that you want to increase production rates if you saw continued strengthen in the business jet market, would that be something you could do in six months or would that be something that would more affect \u201919?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I think we're in a position that we could affect \u201918 and more in a six month kind of a window.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Ronald Epstein from Bank of America.","Ronald Epstein","Can you give us an update on hemisphere in light of the engine issues, with the 5X program being killed at SO and then moving on to a different engine, where is that hemisphere and are you guys thinking about a different engine, just if you can give us an update on that.","Scott Donnelly","So, our guys are actively engaged or sort of real time I guess I would say Ron on that -- the issue of where is the engine and what will the scope and timeframe be to get the engine on track. So in the case of that particular aircraft, I mean I think what you saw, the 5X carriers do is go to a larger aircraft. You have to match engine airplanes obviously pretty well to make it work. That's obviously not a strategy that we would follow. So, in our case, to do that aircraft requires that engine. I mean to get the differentiation in the market, to fuel burn efficiency range and whatnot is dependent on that aircraft or on that engine, I'm sorry and the engine performing prospects. ","So we are working with the guys to understand where they are and what their path forward is. And look, we\u2019ll have to sort of gate off of that, Ron. So right now, we're in a position where we haven't spent a ton of money on that program. We continue to do a lot of the early work that you need to do around key subsystems, selections and basic air dynamic work and whatnot. That\u2019s at a fairly low level and we'll have to make a call, when do we lean into that program or not based on what we see as the engine timeline.","Ronald Epstein","Is there an opportunity there to maybe use Canada engine or something like that or is that kind of not a possibility?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I think the challenge to do, to make that aircraft be what we want it to be, that\u2019s the engine that makes it work. So if you go to a larger engine, then you've got to go to a larger aircraft and that's a path that we're not going to do. Ultimately, again, it all depends on where this engine is. If the engine is not there, then you're kind of would do a step back and say, okay guys, what do we want to do. Going bigger doesn't make sense to us, so we would have to evaluate a change in our strategy, but again, it\u2019s all predicated on where the engine is and we just don't know yet.","Ronald Epstein","And then maybe just a follow-on from that, if something didn't go well with Safran, is there any recourse for you guys or is it still too early to even project that?","Scott Donnelly","Well, no, not really, Ron. But again, we haven't put an enormous amount of money to that anyway at this stage of the game. So, there's obviously, I mean, you could, like I said, you could step back, you could suspend the program, you could -- there's a whole bunch of options here, but there's no significant financial harm that's been caused. So I mean, it's not like we would go back with any kind of recourse. You just have to wait and see how the engine program progresses.","Ronald Epstein","And then if I can, maybe just one more really big picture question. There's been a lot of talk in the general aviation community about like the electrification of aircraft, particularly around propulsion. Is Cessna looking at that at all? Do you have any thoughts on if that\u2019s kind of to Buck Rogers and far out there, is that something that could be more of a reality sooner?","Scott Donnelly","Look, we have spent some time and our kind of advanced concepts guys running numbers and looking at that, it's tough math, right. I mean when you look at how much energy is required to take an aircraft and go any kind of range with any kind of a weight, the energy storage technology just isn't there, right. I mean when you talk about anything in the air, weight is not your friend. So, we continue to look at that. By the way, we are doing the same thing on the rotorcraft side, right. I mean, we've probably done more work on the rotorcraft side because there are some small drone technologies and smaller vehicles that don't have to go this far and just the nature of a helicopter, you tend to do shorter ranges and less weight, so it's probably more feasible in the rotorcraft world. ","We\u2019re doing short hop kind of things as opposed to the longer haul that you see in the fixed wing aviation side. But it's largely going to be driven by energy storage and electric propulsion, which for us is -- that's our supply base that does that. So are we actively engaged with guys that are working on that? Absolutely. Do I see it as becoming a material thing that is going to happen in the sort of mid timeframe? Probably not.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Rajeev Lalwani from Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani","Just a question for you on the M&A landscape and how you\u2019re approaching it this year, whether it\u2019s a buyer or seller of assets?","Scott Donnelly","We don't make any comments with respect to M&A on either front, Rajeev.","Rajeev Lalwani","And then as it relates to Bell, Scott, you were talking about not seeing too much in terms of margin opportunity, can you maybe highlight how an oil and gas opportunity would fit into that, just with oil and gas prices obviously a bit better here?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I don't think it has anything to do with the margin side of things, Rajeev. Yeah. I mean, we\u2019re expecting the business around 12%. If you think about oil and gas, which I agree, I mean there is some -- certainly some strengthening in that -- in that end market, I think in terms of sales into the oil and gas industry, we are actually seeing some of that already, I mean, in some of the more near end, so therefore some the smaller helicopters, there is clearly opportunity in the longer haul here in terms of things like 525. But there is also a lot a assets out there, right. I mean as they went through a pretty tough contraction, they\u2019ve got a lot of assets back to work, but clearly we see that end market as a big opportunity for the 525 and hopefully here as we see that end market start to strengthen and we get the 525 through certification, we\u2019ll be about lined up in the right place, but it certainly won't be a 2018 impact.","Rajeev Lalwani","And a quicker clarification on Arctic Cat, could you say that is going to hit the target of being accretive this year.","Scott Donnelly","Yes.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Drew Lipke from Stephens.","Drew Lipke","On aviation and commercial turboprop, King Air deliveries still kind of a low level here in the second half, caravan deliveries were down pretty significantly year-over-year. You talked about inquiries picking up a little bit last quarter. Did you see that convert into increased orders and then maybe just a little commentary on that market for 2018?","Scott Donnelly","We did. I think the senior market started in the earlier part of last year, a little soft. It certainly strengthened as the year went on. I think we'll be in a pretty solid position here as we go through \u201818. Caravan similarly, we're quite soft in the first half of the year, got stronger as the year went on. I think we've seen a pretty strong level of order activity on caravan. So we feel very good about those going into 2018.","Drew Lipke","And then on Bell commercial, how much of the order book build or the strength that you've seen there has been tied to the China market and how much of that is due to just some of the regulatory changes that we've seen in that market and how is your opportunity there and how sustainable is it in your opinion?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I think we haven't seen a lot of change on the regulatory side in the low altitude spaces. I mean that has been certainly more noise than other areas. We continue to feel very good about China in terms of how we're doing and particularly on the light side. So this past year obviously, we have large orders for 407s, large orders for 505s. So I think we feel very good about our position in the Chinese market, particularly as it has to do with the light, so particularly the 505 and the 407. And I think our deliveries into China this year as we look at our backlog and our customer base is, I think will be pretty strong.","Eric Salander","Okay.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. Now I would like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Eric Salander. Please go ahead, sir.","Eric Salander","Thanks, Brad and good morning everyone. Before we begin, I would like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today\u2019s press release.","On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron\u2019s Chairman and CEO and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.","Textron\u2019s revenues in the quarter were $3.7 billion, up $122 million from last year\u2019s second quarter. Income from continuing operations was $0.87 per share, up from $0.57 per share or $0.60 on an adjusted basis in last year\u2019s second quarter. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions totaled $399 million compared to $341 million in last year\u2019s second quarter.","With that, I will turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Donnelly","Thanks, Eric and good morning everybody. Segment revenue was up again in the quarter in Industrial, Aviation and Bell partially offset by lower revenues in Systems, consistent with our expectations. Operationally, we saw continued strength in our execution with margin improvements at Aviation, Systems and Bell. At Bell, revenues were up on higher commercial volumes for the quarter. On the commercial side, we delivered 57 helicopters, up from 21 in last year\u2019s second quarter. We continue to see positive demand in the commercial space, with strong representation across all our models. In the quarter, we delivered 4 505s to the Japanese Coast Guard demonstrating the aircraft\u2019s suitability as a basic helicopter trainer. The 505 received certification in China with the first 3 units being delivered in June as the aircraft continues to broaden its international presence.","Moving to the military side of the business, we signed a third V-22 multiyear procurement contract with the DoD to deliver 58 units, beginning in 2020. The $4.2 billion multiyear contract, of which $2.2 billion represents Bell\u2019s content, provides program production stability for at least 2024. The contract also has flexibility structured to allow for additional aircraft. We also gained Congressional approval in the quarter to provide 12 H-1 attack helicopters to Bahrain.","On the new product front, the V-280 Valor is now flown in cruise mode, just 5 months after its first flight in December. It really reached 190 knots during the May demonstration and continues to expand its flight envelope to the flight test program, which is ongoing. Bell also opened its new Advanced Vertical Lift Center in May, located just down the street from the Pentagon. New office allows Bell\u2019s military customers, partners and policymakers to interact with Bell\u2019s technology for the future of Vertical Lift, including the V-280 and the unmanned in V-247.","Moving to Systems, revenues were down on lower volumes, primarily of Weapons & Sensors, related to the discontinuance of SFW production at Textron Marine and Land Systems on lower Cap D deliveries. At TRU Simulation and Training, our 737 MAX Full Flight Simulator was successfully updated to the highest level of qualification by the FAA, marking the first 737 MAX simulator to be qualified at Level-D.","Moving to Industrial, we saw a 10% increase in revenues with growth in each of our businesses. At Textron Specialized Vehicles, we introduced the Cushman Shuttle Personnel Carrier and the E-Z-Go Express personal transport vehicle both powered by the industry\u2019s first 72-volt AC electric drivetrain. Within the Textron off-road product line, we continue to expand our vehicle lineup, introducing the new Prowler Pro utility side-by-side, delivering power, comfort and reliability to this market. Also, at TSV, our growing GSC product line received an order from Beijing Capital International Airport for the purchase of 6 Safeaero deicers to increase the efficiency of its operations at the world\u2019s second busiest airport.","Moving to Textron Aviation, revenues were up 9%. We delivered 48 jets, up from 46 last year and 47 commercial turboprops, up from 33 last year. We continue to see improving order flow across our jet and commercial turboprop product lines with increasing strength coming from the international markets. On the new product front, the Citation Longitude, our new super midsize aircraft continues in the FAA certification process. Based on the FAA\u2019s new certification requirements, the number of ground and flight test conditions to be met by the Longitude program has nearly doubled the amount completed on past certification programs. This process is taking longer than initially planned, as our engineering team works alongside the FAA through the enhancement certification process for the first time. Continuing with our new products, the Denali has entered the next phase of development. Fabrication of first test articles on the SkyCourier continues to track to its development plan. We are excited to leverage these clean sheet aircraft, enter new segments of the market to provide a wider array of aviation solutions for our customers. On the military side, our AT-6 Wolverine aircraft has had very positive flight performance during the Air Force\u2019s second phase of the light attack experiment program.","With that, I will turn the call over to Frank.","Frank Connor","Thank you, Scott and good morning everyone. Segment profit in the quarter was $346 million, up $51 million from the second quarter of 2017 on a $122 million increase in revenues.","Let\u2019s review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation. At Textron Aviation, revenues were up $105 million from this period last year, primarily due to higher volume and price. Segment profit was $104 million, up from $54 million a year ago due to the favorable volume, mix and price. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1.6 billion. Moving to Bell, revenues were up $6 million, primarily on higher commercial volume partially offset by lower military revenues. Segment profit increased $5 million from the second quarter in 2017. Backlog in the segment was $5.5 billion at the end of the quarter.","At Textron Systems, revenues were down $97 million, largely on lower volumes at Weapons and Sensors related to the discontinuance of the SFW production in 2017 and lower TAPV deliveries at Marine and Land Systems. Segment profit was down $2 million primarily reflecting the lower net volume partially offset by favorable performance. Backlog in the segment was $1.2 billion. Industrial revenues increased $109 million largely related to higher volumes across all our product lines and a favorable impact from foreign exchange. Segment profit was down $2 million, despite the increase in revenues from the second quarter of 2017 due to the mix of products sold. Finance segment revenues and profit were both flat compared to last year\u2019s second quarter.","Moving below segment profit, corporate expenses were $51 million compared to $31 million last year primarily due to the impact of the increase in share price in the quarter on compensation expense. Interest expense was $35 million, about flat with last year. We also repurchased 8.7 million shares, returning $571 million in cash to shareholders in the quarter. Through the first 6 months of the year, we have repurchased 14.6 million shares, returning $915 million in cash to shareholders.","To wrap up with guidance, we are raising our expected full year earnings per share from continuing operations to a range of $3.15 to $3.35 a share, up $0.20 from our prior outlook. We expect a one-time gain of approximately $400 million from the tools and test divestiture in the third quarter of 2018, which is not reflected in this updated outlook. We are also raising cash flow from continuing operations of the manufacturing group before pension contributions to a range of $750 million to $850 million, up $50 million from our prior outlook.","That concludes our prepared remarks. So Brad, we can open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Robert Stallard","Good morning. Scott, this might be one for you. On Aviation, the backlog was flat sequentially. I was wondering if you could shed a bit of color on that, what the various parts of the division saw over the last 3 months, because that would seem to be rather contrary to the commentary about the strengthening in business jets, for example?","Scott Donnelly","Well, Robert, I think the market feels the same way that it did, it\u2019s pretty strong. I think we are pleased with the order flow. Obviously, deliveries were up as well in the quarter and I think the flow of our orders matches up pretty well. So in terms of the dynamic, it has stayed robust. Obviously, we continue to push on the pricing side in the trade for volume, because we still think we got to continue to work that, but end markets are still strong and we are seeing that in both the jet and the turboprop lines.","Robert Stallard","Okay. And then as a follow-up separately, Textron Systems in Bell, very strong margins in the quarter. How sustainable do you think these levels of profitability are particularly if you are obviously having a V-22 step down rolling through the system at some point?","Scott Donnelly","Well, look I think Bell had an extremely strong margin rate here in the second quarter. I wouldn\u2019t expect that to sustain, but we have talked about that business over the long-term being a 10%, 12% margin business and I think that\u2019s still how we feel about it. The team has done a nice job. I think the contract in terms of multi-year 3 landed about where we expected in terms of our long range thinking. As I said, the contract allows for some increases of a couple aircraft here or there. I am optimistic that we will see that both in terms of U.S. demand and as well as ultimately some foreign military opportunities. So, it\u2019s fully within our expectations and around where we thought and obviously we are glad to have it done and so it\u2019s a good contract and one that gives us some stability going forward.","Robert Stallard","And similar situation with Systems as well, that had very strong margin too?","Scott Donnelly","Yes, so I think we certainly expect Systems to be a little bit lighter in the back half of the year. They had a very strong start to the year. We are still seeing very good performance in most of businesses. Obviously, we will see ongoing reductions in a number of Cap D deliveries. As that program winds down through the course of the year, we will still see SSC obviously is still in its development and test phase, so that will dominate towards the back half of the year as well. And you won\u2019t really see the revenues and the margins pickup on that until we start into the production program in 2019. So, I guess, let\u2019s say, Rob, we expect a lighter second half, but still strong performance for the total year in that business.","Robert Stallard","That\u2019s great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland","Hey, good morning guys or good afternoon I should say. Just a quick follow-up on Rob\u2019s question, Frank, I wonder could you tell us what the net favorable items must have been in Bell and Systems? And then just a second one for Scott, can you just give us some color you called out price and mix in the Aviation margin strength in the quarter. Was it one over the other and was aftermarket a notable contributor there that we should know, just any kind of expanded color on which of those was more important will be helpful? Thanks, guys.","Scott Donnelly","Well, I can give you the color part first, I guess. I think that Aviation, it was strong pretty much across the board. Obviously, we had some pricing power in there. The aftermarket, you know we have this \u2013 an accounting change in terms of the revenue, so it will look a little flatter. The reality is on an apples-to-apples basis it was up high single-digit, which is good for us. The turboprop deliveries were obviously quite a bit stronger than in the second quarter last year, which we expected. I mean that market, particularly the international side of turboprop has been stronger. And on the Aviation front, it looks like we are up a couple of jets. The reality is as you guys know we ceased production of the Mustang. There were about 5 of those deliveries last year. So on a like-to-like basis, the mix was actually better, because we discontinued a model that was not a very profitable model for us. And those 5 aircraft turned into 5 other aircraft that are more in our \u2013 say, in our margin region. So I think the mix was positive as well. So it\u2019s both price, mix and I\u2019d say strength across all the product lines.","Frank Connor","So on the program side, we saw as the numbers would indicate good performance out of both Bell and Systems on the program side and we had $64 million of program adjustments for the quarter.","Carter Copeland","In net?","Frank Connor","That\u2019s right. Net on a consolidated basis.","Carter Copeland","Awesome. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.","Peter Arment","Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys. Nice quarter. Scott, just asking regarding on the Longitude you made some comments regarding the kind of the FAA certification process is taking longer. You are not the only one really that\u2019s been affected by this, but maybe you could just give us a little more color as you are kind of looking at the timeline for introduction of Longitude?","Scott Donnelly","Well, Peter, look I think it\u2019s within the next couple of months. The guys are working really hard at this. The good news here is there is no issue, it\u2019s not that there is a conflict between us and the FAA over anything technical or programmatic or the aircraft itself it\u2019s just \u2013 this new process involves the creation of thousands of pages of documentation, which we just haven\u2019t done in the past and it\u2019s a result of the implementation of this new process and it\u2019s just an enormous amount of work that we haven\u2019t had on previous certifications that was a bit unplanned. I mean, how this is being interpreted and implemented is just a lot of paperwork that wasn\u2019t really anticipated. So, again, the good news here is there is not a problem, it\u2019s not like we are in any form of disagreement over something to do with the aircraft or anything. It\u2019s just a lot of paperwork. So we are working our way through it. The FAA is working through it with us. You have to create all these things and review them and sign them off.","Peter Arment","Okay. And then just as a follow-up unrelated on the AT-6, it sounds like you have had some good flight performance. How is your thinking on just kind of the discussions with your potential customer there?","Scott Donnelly","Well, we think it\u2019s gone well. I mean, an awful lot was accumulated. A lot of flight testing was done obviously before the accident that resulted in sort of the discontinuance of the flight test piece of the program. But I think the Air Force has been very open about the fact that they are continuing to work this program. They have got the data they need. They felt that the flight testing that had been accomplished was sufficient. If there is more information they can certainly reach out to us and to our competitors and they are continuing with their process as described. So, we would be hopeful to see activity continue and hopefully get to some form of an RFP if we are going forward with the program in kind of the latter part of this year, but we felt the aircraft did well. We clearly \u2013 I mean, the customer is very open publicly about the interest in this area and the demand for a product like this and we feel like the guys did a great job performing and we will just continue work with the customer as they work through the next steps of the process.","Peter Arment","Great. Thanks, Scott.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.","David Strauss","Thanks. Good morning or good afternoon.","Scott Donnelly","Hi, David.","David Strauss","Hi, can you hear me?","Scott Donnelly","Yes.","David Strauss","Okay. One that\u2019s about book-to-bill assessment, ex the aftermarket in the quarter, is it fair to say the book-to-bill was about 1.2 and if so, is that a fair kind of number for what you saw on the jet side specifically?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I think when we look at the book-to-bill number, it\u2019s \u2013 I mean I think the one-to-one is a fair representation. Obviously we are always going to have a little bit of mix within that between different models within the line in jets and turboprops and military, but it\u2019s all consolidated in there, but I think the one-to-one is a fair representation of where we are in the jet side. And again as the deliveries were up, revenue was up and which means commensurately order activity was up. So, I think particularly when we think about where Q2 is, I mean, order rates were better than they were in Q1. So even though the book-to-bill number may not be what it was in Q1, the reality is that the activity in the market continues at a good pace.","David Strauss","Okay. And to follow-up in terms of your guidance for each through the year, I apologize if I missed this earlier. Are you seeing higher Cessna, higher deliveries out of Aviation, specifically on the jet side [indiscernible] today as compared to what you said a year ahead and also the 8% margin guidance for Cessna for the year, looks like you will come in better than that?","Scott Donnelly","Yes, I think David mostly as we look at our revised guidance it\u2019s reflecting the stronger margin performance in Aviation and in Bell and in Systems, obviously I think it will be slightly probably below where we were thinking just because of the tools and test disposition, which is a strong margin business at Industrial, I am sorry, but the guidance increase on EPS is really driven by better margin performance in those three segments.","David Strauss","Okay. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.","Operator","And we do have question from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Hey, good morning everyone.","Scott Donnelly","Hi, Sheila.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Scott, I was wondering can you comment on the competitive landscape and maybe the changes you are seeing given Bombardier and Embraer might be focused elsewhere? So, just on the competitive landscape, both in the bizjet market, but also maybe on the commercial helicopter market as well? Thank you.","Scott Donnelly","Sure. Well, I mean we haven\u2019t seen a big change. I mean, it\u2019s still obviously a very competitive market. There haven\u2019t been obviously here through the first couple of quarters, the competitive dynamic of the model-to-model comparisons are the same as they have been. So, it\u2019s still quite competitive. But like I said, we will and have continued to sort of trade price over volume to try to put some discipline into that marketplace, but the competitive dynamic, I would say is largely unchanged and the same is true I think on the helicopter side. The good news is the market particularly in the lighter end of the market is as competitive as it\u2019s been. Obviously, we are seeing a lot of growth around the 505 as the new model coming in and as that thing is ramping up its production and a lot of deliveries coming out, we feel great about where that product is. It competes very, very well given its performance and capabilities, but we are also seeing very strong performance on the 407. There are some nice upgrades to the product, but it\u2019s a competitive marketplace, but it\u2019s a very strong product. Even 429s, which as you guys know, we are expecting a little lighter deliveries this year, but 429 order activity has stepped up pretty significantly. So again I think the market is very competitive and we have got a great set of products that are doing very well.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Then on R&D, if you could just comment you have gone through a phase of high R&D, what are you focusing on over the next 18 to 24 months?","Scott Donnelly","Well, we are probably looking at guiding too much beyond this year, but as you know, I think our overall R&D number, we do expect to see some modest reduction on the fixed wing aviation side largely as we scale back things like Scorpion, but we continue to invest obviously in Longitude. We got Denali coming down. We have SkyCourier coming along. So there is still as strong R&D spending at Aviation just probably not as much as we have seen in the last couple of years. Bell, on the other hand, has stepped up a little bit and we have 525 in the flight test program, we have V-280 flying. So there is obviously still spending there, but we will largely see sort of a shifting in somewhat of the R&D around some of the businesses, but obviously what\u2019s important for us I think going forward is that as we see these revenue increases and we see the benefit frankly of some better end-markets in some of these new product launches, it does become a bit of a tailwind for us in terms of overall margin rates.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we have a question for the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Seth Seifman","Thanks very much and good afternoon. Following up on the V-22 and understanding that you don\u2019t want to give very much guidance beyond this year, I think one thing that might be helpful for people just to level set is the amount of our earnings headwind even if it\u2019s just some qualitative commentary that we can expect as the V-22 starts to ramp down next year we all know it\u2019s happening, little over $400 million of EBIT at Bell this year, how can we think about the headwind there?","Scott Donnelly","Well, you really won\u2019t see much impact to this lower rate really until late next year, right as you start to get into the next fiscal year funding. And I need to be careful here, because given this 606 Bell, so it doesn\u2019t play out specifically to delivers anymore, so it\u2019s really more of a cost accumulation, I think it was kind of hard for me to \u2013 I am not exactly sure how to articulate that to you beyond. I mean, you guys kind of know obviously its public in terms of what the contract delivery dates are. As I said, I think there will probably be some additional unit volumes added into each year. So I think of the new contract as sort of a floor, if you will, but I wouldn\u2019t expect a big impact in 2019, it starts to become more material into 2020.","Seth Seifman","Great. Thanks very much.","Scott Donnelly","Yes. We can probably help you guys by the way just in terms of the contract stuff probably offline.","Seth Seifman","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.","George Shapiro","Yes, couple of quick questions. Back on the book-to-bill being one, can you separate it out into how the turboprop was versus the new jets or how the defense was versus the new jets?","Scott Donnelly","No George, I don\u2019t think we are going to give \u2013 I mean we are not going to start kind of breaking out the book-to-bill by the individual product models and whatnot, but just again, from a color standpoint, it\u2019s been pretty strong. We are very, very happy with the order flow in both the jets and the turboprop side. Military deliveries were up in the quarter, right you will see that on the T-6s. So, there is obviously some impact of strong sales on T-6, but despite the one-to-one \u2013 you say, well, one-to-one that\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay the facts are their order flow was stronger than second quarter than it was in the first quarter and we continue to feel good about where the market is heading on both turboprop and the commercial jet business.","George Shapiro","And R&D in the quarter at Aviation, Scott, sequentially was it down a little bit year-over-year, can you give those two qualitative comments?","Scott Donnelly","Well, look, I mean, again from a color standpoint, George, as we have indicated, I think the quarter was consistent with kind of the color that we have been providing, which is that we will see some reduction at Aviation offset by some increases largely at Bell with the flight activity going on and the quarter was difficult there.","George Shapiro","And one for you, Frank, that the tax rate was pretty low again, have you changed your outlook for the year and why was it low?","Frank Connor","Yes. We had some benefits from some discrete items in the quarter. So our revised guidance assumes a tax rate of about 19.5% for the year, but this actually reflects the first couple of quarters of discrete items that we benefited from.","George Shapiro","Okay. Thanks very much and I will get back into queue.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Sam Pearlstein","Good afternoon. Just on the guidance, the $50 million increase in the cash flow, it looks like about half of that is a CapEx reduction. Can you just talk is it straight net income improvement and then on the CapEx, is it related to the adversary air, can you just talk about how you are viewing adversary air spend this year and next compared to before?","Scott Donnelly","Yes, Sam. So there is a couple of things going on here. Obviously, expectations for a little stronger margin rate therefore better earnings is obviously falling through in the cash flow. There is a debit that we had to take out of that with the second half of tools and test not being in there both from the free cash flow generation, but obviously some of that CapEx reduction is reflective of not having CapEx in that business in the second half of the year. And there is some benefit on the aggressor work, so given where we are on those contracts and timelines we are deferring some of that. Obviously, we are still comfortable that we have everything lined up in support of future Air Force programs, but we have been able to defer some of that CapEx in 2018. So, those are all sort of contributing to that net benefit of $50 million taking all that into consideration.","Sam Pearlstein","Okay. And then can you talk a little bit about just the distribution inventory levels with Arctic Cat now that you have kind of ended the winter season just where did you end up and how is that looking?","Scott Donnelly","So Sam, I am afraid I don\u2019t have those numbers at my fingertips here, but I mean we are continuing to make progress and I would say most importantly when we look at what\u2019s in the inventories it\u2019s pressure stuff, right. So, I mean a lot of the stuff that was really older inventory has been moved off their books. I mean, obviously these guys are taking re-stockings of current model year product, probably not a lot of change in snow. I mean, we are at that time of the year obviously where we are producing all the snow product for next year and we will start those load-ins here as we get into the latter part of the year. I\u2019d say the good news is demand from the dealers, what we are seeing is up and we have got a couple of great new products. I mean, last year it was great in terms of burning down a lot of the inventory. We had some new stuff that came out last year that helped. We have got a couple of pretty exciting 2019 models that are driving some pretty strong pre-season order demand, which we are building now, we will start to load in here in the next couple of months.","Sam Pearlstein","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Ronald Epstein with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Caitlin Dullanty","Hi, guys. This is Caitlin on for Ron today. Just wanted to touch on orders a little bit, what\u2019s driving \u2013 what do you see is really driving the incremental orders at Textron Aviation? Are you seeing more interest from individuals or corporates? And then are the orders really more for replacement aircraft up-gauging or just new purchases? Thanks so much.","Scott Donnelly","So, it\u2019s I would say that the order activity continues to be across virtually all the models, so it\u2019s not isolated in one area or the next. We always have a lot of \u2013 the bulk of our customers are current aircraft owners of one type or the other and most of them are up-gauging, although a lot are simply replacing older aircraft, they have had now for probably longer than they would like to have them. So Cait, it\u2019s across the board. There is no particular dynamic which is changing it one way or the other. I would say the one thing that we did see in the quarter which is encouraging is an uptick in the international order. So, this has been pretty U.S. centric here for the last number of years and obviously it was great to see the U.S. market getting stronger over the last say 6, 9 months, but we are also now seeing more strength in the order rate in Europe and in Latin America, some Asian activity. So we are seeing more participation in internationally as well. So it\u2019s broad based in terms of the models, the segments, be it jet, turboprop and also now starting to see some broadening of the strength internationally.","Caitlin Dullanty","Great, thank you. Thank you so much.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Jon Raviv with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jon Raviv","Hey, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. Scott, when it comes to Aviation production rates, how are you balancing that decision-making process with the pricing you want to hold on to and drive with backlog growth? And then also how much pricing you get to see before you kind of start storing up the supply chain? And I guess a related question is have you actually had any discussions with your suppliers on potentially raising production rates?","Scott Donnelly","I always felt that this is something we look at it on a really a real time basis, right. So depending on what activity we are seeing whether we can get the \u2013 meet the pricing targets that we have out there, we are looking at this on a week-to-week basis. So there are certainly suppliers that we know and have had all discussions and know where they stand, if we need to just even without a whole lot of supply work, if we need to flex a couple aircraft here and there we can do that. So I am not sure are we going to do anything further than that. I mean we feel like, right now we are well matched to meet the demand based on the price levels where we are. And if things continue strengthening and we decide that we need to take it up and well obviously we have the flexibility to do that.","Jon Raviv","And then going forward some of the margin drivers that we should think about turboprop is getting better, that\u2019s accretive, but anyhow is there something done in your production process on the jet side which could enable the typical incremental margin targets you talked about or is it perhaps enable us to exceed those?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I think part of why we are feeling good about the margin and incorporating that as part of our guidance increase is that the team is executing well. I mean, obviously, as I said, well, it\u2019s not that we are seeing a big change in \u2013 versus our plan on the volume side, but the guys are executing well, we are getting good volumes through the shop, we are getting good productivity and of course we are continuing to drive the pricing. So the combination of those is giving us an incremental margin.","Jon Raviv","Would you be able to quantify what the new margin guidance is for the year?","Scott Donnelly","No, we won\u2019t go back segment by segment, but I think just from a color standpoint, Jon, you expect \u2013 versus the kind of the aggregate numbers that we gave you guys, you expect that we will finish the year a little stronger in Aviation, Bell and Systems and probably just a little bit lighter on the industrial side.","Jon Raviv","Got it. Thank you, Scott.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr","Yes, thank you very much. Could you give us a little more color at Aviation in terms of how much of the gain was price, how did the pre-own do, did you book a profit or a loss and maybe how much was the kind of aftermarket business? Thank you.","Scott Donnelly","So I will go backwards. Aftermarket, Cai on a \u2013 again, there was a change in the accounting of how the revenue is showing on some of these engine programs, but if you look at sort of net that out, the aftermarket growth was strong with a high single-digit number. Now, on a percent basis, aftermarket did shrink somewhat as a percent of the total, because we had strong deliveries on the original equipment side. So I would say a strong contribution from aftermarket, but still somewhat smaller percentage of the total given the strength on the front end of the business, which is good. So the margin improvement obviously the price is a strong contributor in there, but we are also seeing our ability to convert some of these higher volumes into better gross margin on the products. So, the guys are doing a good job on cost and overhead control and so the intersection of those two things is what\u2019s driving that probability. We always had, it\u2019s not a big material number, there is a little bit of noise always around from quarter-to-quarter how much \u2013 due to aircraft valuation and whatnot is in there, but it\u2019s not something that\u2019s going to swing it one way or the other. Now, one thing to keep in mind, Cai, as we go through the balance of the year is we are going to have the first Longitudes coming out and as you would expect, there will be some margin pressure associated with those, but we still feel like given the performance overall of the business and how it\u2019s doing, we are still going to see, net better margin than we originally guided despite some of the overhang of the new product launch on Longitude.","Cai von Rumohr","Okay. And my question on price in the first quarter your 10-Q indicated you got $9 million benefit from price. Could you tell us how much was that benefit in the second quarter? And you had mentioned also a couple of months to certification on the Longitude, I mean, do you expect to deliver any in the third quarter and how many can you deliver given it looks like it\u2019s taking longer to get it certified?","Scott Donnelly","So, the price number in the quarter will be about $29 million. The Longitude look I am hedging a little on the date, Cai and obviously I don\u2019t want to be doing that, but we are working through a process that we haven\u2019t gone through before. So, that\u2019s why I am trying to give us a little bit of room here, but yes we certainly expect to deliver the first Longitudes in Q3, but we have to get through the process and it\u2019s proving to be a little more difficult than we thought, but we certainly still expect to make initial delivery in Q3. And I don\u2019t know that we have ever guided the total number of Longitudes we will have for the balance of the year, but I don\u2019t see us coming off of our original expectations. It just means we have all deliveries in sort of late Q3 into Q4 or even if for some reason this thing doesn\u2019t get across the goal line here for the first one, then they would all deliver in Q4. I feel good. I mean our production activity \u2013 again, there is nothing with the aircraft, there is nothing that causes us to have to go back and make changes to the aircraft. We have been building the aircraft. They are going to be ready to go. It\u2019s a matter of getting all the certification work complete. So, I don\u2019t foresee at this point a risk to what our plan was in terms of the 2018 Longitude deliveries.","Cai von Rumohr","Thank you very much.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Drew Lipke with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.","Drew Lipke","And congrats on a good quarter. Just first question on industrial, can you maybe elaborate a little bit more on the driver of the negative mix impact there and what you are seeing there?","Scott Donnelly","Well, tools and test is a good margin business. So that margin obviously won\u2019t be there in the second half of the year. So, when we look at the total mix across the industrial segment, I would expect to see some reduction in there. Now that\u2019s the operating profit level. Obviously, we are in the process of doing buybacks, we try to mitigate what that means in terms of EPS, but as we indicated when we did the transaction, we expect we will see a few cents of dilution in 2018. That\u2019s factored into what we gave you guys in terms of the revised guidance, so that takes that into consideration. But as we said, with the buyback programs and as we look into 2019, we expect that dilution goes away, but from a mix standpoint we are taking a good margin business out of the second half of the year.","Drew Lipke","Okay. And then with Arctic Cat, can you talk about ORV and its newer retail trends? I know April was tough with weather, it sounds like the ORV industry really rebounded in May and June, what are you seeing in terms of industry trends and can you comment on kind of your market share and just the overall profit improvement in Arctic Cat?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I think we are seeing profit improvement in Arctic Cat and we would continue to expect to see incremental margins frankly overall in our industrial segment improving as the year goes on, I mean despite that we are taking out tools and test. So, the total year guidance was down a little bit, but we will certainly expect to see a positive progression here through the balance of the year. Look, the snow is obviously not in a retail phase right now right, we are kind of in the production side of that and the stocking. So, that\u2019s \u2013 which again I think is quite favorable for us. We feel really good about where that business is and what the stocking orders look like. On the dirt side of the business, we are seeing improvements. Having the XX out there is it\u2019s later than was expected when we did the acquisition, but it is fully in the market and we are frankly struggling to meet demand of producing them and we have just launched the Prowler Pro, which launches into the \u2013 really the largest segment of that market. We think we have got a great product, but again, that\u2019s one that\u2019s just barely starting to run through the production line and get deliveries out to the dealer, so again a model that we are seeing strong demand. We just got to produce as quickly as we can. So, I think the end market of all the data I see is positive here in the last couple of months. We are certainly seeing strong demand on the products that we have launched into the marketplace and obviously expect to see the revenue and the margin continue to expand through the balance of the year.","Drew Lipke","And do you think you are holding a third of our market share?","Scott Donnelly","Yes. No, I expect \u2013 we are feeling very good about snow. I think our market share is going to be up, which will be quite strong and again on the sort of the backs of a couple of launches here around XX and Prowler Pro, we certainly are seeing an uptick and expect to see a continued uptick in our share through the balance of the year.","Drew Lipke","Thanks, guys.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Rajeev Lalwani","Hi, Scott. Hi, Frank.","Scott Donnelly","Hi.","Rajeev Lalwani","Just I wanted to come back on the Aviation side, you touched on this a bit before, but as you think about just trying to get margins up and before you start pushing volumes, where are you trying to get back to? I mean, are we looking at just sort of historical average going back to historical peaks kind of a thing is that guiding you at all? And then unrelated to that, as far as maybe delays around product development with the FAA certification and all, how does that impact some of the other products you\u2019re working on; SkyCourier, Denali, maybe even the Hemisphere, if at all?","Scott Donnelly","Alright Rajeev I will guide, I don\u2019t want to go out and make a like some target number or a target around historical numbers, I mean because the revenues, the mix of product, the volumes are just fully different than where those were, but our objective is to just keep improving this thing every year, driving cost, driving price, and push up but this clearly needs to be a double-digit margin business I fully expect that it\u2019s going to get back up in the double digit margin business and that\u2019s the team is pretty focused on working to get there and that\u2019s sort of all of the above, right, it\u2019s costs, it\u2019s new products, it\u2019s pricing and I think that the march we are on here, as we go from last year, through this year, into next year, is all moving in the right direction in terms of the FAA question, look, I think as these new processes are different for different models and different [indiscernible] classes and things like that, so I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll we have to understand how each model is going to go but the difficult thing, obviously, is the first time you go through this, we\u2019re learning, frankly, that our local FAA office is learning and implementing this and understanding what it really means and so, I think obviously we would be in a better position to anticipate how this needs to go, what kind of documentation needs to be created, how does the changes as changes happen through the development program so I would be, maybe, cautiously optimistic that we can execute through it better in the future, but right now it\u2019s sort of a bit of a discovery process in terms of all this documentation so it\u2019s certainly not an efficient way to go through it and I\u2019d like to think that as we and the FAA get through this process, and we\u2019ll be able to look back at it, maybe make some modification to the process to make sure those are all value-added, but then also as you go through it a second, and a third time, you\u2019re going to be better at doing it, more efficient at doing it I\u2019m sure I was not as clear as you may like, but I don\u2019t know how to make it any clear because we\u2019re just trying to figure it out, right.","Operator","And we do have a follow-up question from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Seth Seifman","Thanks. And I just wanted to follow-up, appreciate the color on industrial a couple of years ago in the middle of the decade, this was like a mid-8s business margin wise, without tools and test it seems like it should still be able to be an 8% margin business, I just want to verify that, that you think that\u2019s correct and kind of how long does it take to get there and what are the what sort of the key factor, is it execution on the specialized vehicle side, is it reaching a certain volume on the specialized vehicle side, what sort of needs to happen to get to that level?","Scott Donnelly","Well, look, Seth, I think there\u2019s no question this should be an 8% or better margin business we are just sort of caught in a position here where we disposed of something that was accretive to that margin rate and had just acquired something that was quite dilutive to that margin rate so you are sort of catching us here in the middle of this thing so, there\u2019s no question that we need to be at or north of that historical kind of margin rate, and I am confident that we\u2019re going to get there I think that there\u2019s the vehicle business is the critical one to drive that and clearly we need to see increased volumes we have every expectation that we can continue to gain share in that area we have got some great new products that are going into it, but we also have to do a great job on driving cost in that as well so I\u2019d say, we\u2019ve taken a business that was losing money and turning that around, that\u2019s making positive steps in the right direction and like I say, I think you should see us expanding those incremental margins through the balance of the year, all the way through next year now this is a business that needs to be a good healthy margin business, and I think we will get there.","Seth Seifman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we do have a question a follow-up question from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.","George Shapiro","Yes. Frank, if I look sequentially, inventories dropped like $165 million now is that partly due to taking out tools and putting it as assets for sale, or is it more due to the delivery of the high delivery of the Aviation planes? And I would expect maybe it comes down some more in the second half as you actually make some Longitude deliveries so can you give some color on that?","Frank Connor","Sure, yes. So part of the reduction in the quarter on a sequential basis was tools and test, that was about $100 million of it, as we moved the tools and test assets from liabilities to held for sale so we had about $65 million of other inventory reduction and certainly yes, given our seasonal pattern and higher deliveries in the second half of the year, we would expect for inventory levels to come down as we move through the year.","George Shapiro","And then one follow-up on Bell if you take out the $2.2 billion V-22 backlog, sequentially the Bell backlog was down a little bit now is that from military, because it would seem like commercial is getting better and then also, Scott, I think on the first quarter you expected a pick-up in the medium helicopters we didn\u2019t see it in the second quarter, we see it in the second half? Thanks.","Scott Donnelly","Sure. So, absolutely, George, the 22 went in from the multi-year obviously we continued to deliver V-22s and H-1s, which takes out of the backlog commercial side of the business quarter four continues to be strong so, again, we don\u2019t get in and break down all these pieces, but from a color standpoint that\u2019s a fair representation of what\u2019s going on in terms of the business and the order rates and the backlog at Bell on the medium side, as I said, we\u2019ve seen 412 orders, we\u2019ve seen strong 429 orders and there\u2019s still a number or 412 campaigns that are out there so I think we see practically strong order flow and activity across all the models, which is encouraging.","George Shapiro","Okay. And then just last in Aviation what\u2019s the lead time if you want to increase production rates; three months, six months?","Scott Donnelly","Well, it depends on model, George we usually would say it\u2019s more like [indiscernible] the six to nine months there you\u2019ve got the long lead items like engines for instance that kind of gate that and again, I try to be careful with an exact number, because all of our suppliers have their own flow of activity and they have flexibility within their own systems so if we want to go in and make a change to our plans that are shorter than that there are cases where we can do that so we can flex volumes by a few units but if you\u2019re really talking about a dramatic change, then yes, it takes a long time but guys, we are never going to be what you see in the media, where we\u2019re going to come out and say we\u2019re going from 40 to 50 over the next two years I mean that\u2019s not the nature of our business, obviously it\u2019s more of a flow activity and obviously we are communicating and talking to our suppliers all the time and looking at order rates all the time so I\u2019m just not worried about the market and order and getting out of line with what we can do in terms of demand it\u2019s just not an issue it\u2019s asked about a lot, it\u2019s not something we worry about a lot, we work it everyday.","George Shapiro","Okay. Thanks again very much.","Operator","And we do have a question, a follow-up question from the line of Jon Raviv with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jon Raviv","Hi, thanks for taking this follow-up, I am appreciating in Aviation, appreciating that Denali and SkyCourier are certainly important for the portfolio but just after Longitude launches, what are those engineers going to do where do you think they\u2019ll move to as long as Hemisphere is still on hold? Is there any interesting looking back at the lower end of the portfolio, considering there is relatively less new product from your competitors down there?","Scott Donnelly","I missed the engineer question Jon.","Frank Connor","What are the engineers that have been working on Longitude do?","Scott Donnelly","They are already on other programs most of them have moved already to the Denali program and the SkyCourier program that\u2019s where most of the activity is right now I mean, obviously, there\u2019s still a good size testing that\u2019s working and on the certification process for Longitude but we\u2019ve sort of worked through a lot of the design phase in Denali, we\u2019re building the first flight test articles, as we speak so a lot of the detailed design activity really now is in the SkyCourier side of things we don\u2019t have anything to announce today in terms of the rest of the portfolio I mean, obviously, we\u2019re always looking at upgrades and what we need to do to make the whole rest of the product line stay fresh, but there is nothing that I would announce at this point.","Jon Raviv","Okay. And then just on Longitude, just the short availability, can you just comment on how sold you are at that point? And then my related question is, how have you adjusted or how are you adjusting just selling a larger aircraft given Textron Aviation\u2019s historical focus on more of the owner-operator?","Scott Donnelly","Well, we have been working in the sales side of the Longitude for a while now. I think our teams have done a good job out there. We have a great set of prospects. A lot of folks have been in this aircraft. I mean, there is no shortage of customers that are interested in it and our sales folks are talking with those folks, a lot of demonstration flights have been going on, continue to go on and we feel very good about our prospect list. So, I mean, obviously some more activity is going on and there is a pretty strong pipeline of people that are very interested in the aircraft that are watching and waiting for the certification process, but in terms of our ability to go out and sell this aircraft, I am not concerned about that. We seem to be reaching the customers that have interest in an aircraft of this class.","Jon Raviv","Thank you.","Operator","And that does conclude our question-and-answer-session.

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this point, I'd like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Eric Salander. Please go ahead, sir.","Eric Salander","Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release. On the call today we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the investor relations section of our website.","Textron's revenues in the quarter were $3.8 billion, down $98 million from last year's fourth quarter. During this year's fourth quarter, we recorded an $8 million pre-tax charge, or $0.02 per share after tax, related to the restructuring plan we announced this past summer. Excluding these items, adjusted income from continuing operations was $0.80 per share, down $0.01 from last year's fourth quarter.","Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $727 million, compared to $534 million in last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, revenues were $13.8 billion, up 2.7% from a year ago. Adjusted income from continuing operations was $2.62 per share, up 4.8% from $2.50 last year. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $573 million. With that, I will turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Donnelly","Thank, Eric, and good morning, everybody. Revenues were up at Systems and Industrial, but down at Bell and Aviation, which led to an overall decrease in revenues in the quarter. Despite the decline in revenues, we're encouraged by increasing demand in Industrial, the ramp on TAPV deliveries, and strong operating performance at Bell.","Bell revenues were down on lower commercial military volumes for the quarter. Despite the lower volumes in the quarter, we continued to execute, which led to a strong 14% margin. We delivered 35 commercial helicopters, down from 56 in last year's fourth quarter; 4 B-22s, down from 8 units last year; and 8 H-1s, down from 9 last year.","On the new product front, our V-280 Valor program continues to progress and is on track for first flight this year. On the commercial side, we're continuing to see signs of stabilization of the market through improved order flow. Our new 505 Jet Ranger X achieved type certification from Transport Canada Civil Aviation at the end of 2016, with follow-on FAA certification anticipated in the first quarter of 2017. We've seen strong conversion of LOIs to orders on the 505 and expect solid deliveries beginning in the first quarter.","On the service side, we're experiencing a positive reception to our Customer Advantage Plans, including the signing of Heliservicio's fleet of 20 Bell 412s. Moving to Systems, revenues were up on higher volumes, primarily at Marine and Land Systems. The higher volumes were driven by the ongoing ramp of TAPV deliveries to our Canadian customer in the quarter.","At our Unmanned Systems business, we recently were awarded two significant contracts that display our customers' confidence in our products and support network. The first award was a $206 million contract for ongoing logistics support and sustainment on our Shadow Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System. Second, to be the sole provider of services with our Aerosonde mid-endurance unmanned aircraft for an amount of $475 million over the next several years in support of US special operations.","At our TRU Simulation training business, we delivered our first 737 Max full-flight sim to Boeing's pilot training camps in Miami as part of our 10-year exclusive agreement. We continue to look for ways to leverage our platforms across our businesses, and we recently opened our Bell Helicopter Training Academy in Valencia, Spain with EASA certification of our 429 sim. Our Citation M2 and CJ4 simulators received FAA qualification in the quarter, joining the Latitude and CJ3+ at our TRU US-based training centers.","Moving to Industrial, we saw a 3.8% increase in revenue, reflecting the impact of higher volumes at Kautex and specialized vehicles. As we look to continue our expansion in the powersports market and build on our recent product introductions, today we announced an agreement to acquire Arctic Cat, one of the industry's most recognized brands. This acquisition will immediately broaden our product portfolio as we add a variety of outdoor recreational and utility vehicles to our lineup, as well as an established dealer network.","Also during the quarter, we released our new four-seat 80 horsepower Textron off-road Stampede XTR, maintaining our new product momentum in the sports utility market. The integration of Jacobsen into our specialized vehicle business is underway and on track to be completed this year.","Moving to Textron Aviation, revenues were down $52 million. In the quarter, we delivered 58 jets compared to 60 last year and 28 King Airs, down from 33 in last year's fourth quarter.","For the full year, we delivered 178 jets, up from last year's 166, including 42 Latitude deliveries. The increased Latitude deliveries include both retail customers as well as deliveries to NetJets, and we expect that trend to continue in 2017. Offsetting this growth in Latitude volume were lower deliveries on other Citation models and turboprops, for which we are lowering production in 2017.","On the new product front, the second aircraft in the Longitude flight test program successfully completed its first flight just over one month after the prototype aircraft. The Longitude has performed very well, and at this year's NBAA, we announced an improved range of 3,500 nautical miles and an improved full fuel payload of 1,600 pounds. We also had a full cabin mock-up of the Citation Hemisphere on display at the show, and continue to believe this aircraft will be a game-changing platform in its segment.","Moving to the Scorpion program, the first production aircraft had a successful first flight in the quarter and is performing well. Along with its first flight, we achieved a number of significant milestones in the program in 2016. We entered a US Air Force Airworthiness Assessment program, we validated production manufacturing processes, and successfully demonstrated weapons and mission Systems capabilities.","With these achievements, interest in the Scorpion program is growing both domestically and in international markets. Given the status of the program at the end of 2016, we will transition financial reporting for the Scorpion to the Textron Aviation segment beginning in 2017.","To summarize, we experienced a challenging year with weaker-than-expected business jet and commercial helicopter markets, but we continue to invest in our businesses through ongoing development of new products and strategic acquisitions to support growth and create long-term value.","We were able to achieve significant increases in top-line growth at Industrial and Systems, with margin expansion and Systems, Bell, and Industrial. At Industrial, our growth for the year reflected our investment in new products, such as our selective catalytic reduction Systems at Kautex and our Stampede side-by-side sport utility vehicle. We also acquired Premier and SAFEAERO, two manufacturers of aircraft de-icing equipment, that allow us to expand our ground support business portfolio.","At Textron Systems, we began initial deliveries of our TAPV systems and anticipate delivery of our first ship to shore connector this year. At TRU Simulation and Training, we achieved a number of milestones with initial deliveries of full flight simulators for several models into the commercial, general aviation, and helicopter training markets.","At Bell, we made substantial progress on the V-280 and announced our latest innovation, the V-247 Vigilant unmanned tiltrotor, further displaying our leadership in tiltrotor technology and our commitment to meeting customer needs. On the H-1 front, we received additional orders from the DOD for 61 units, including 9 FMS units for Pakistan, taking production through the first quarter of 2019. Looking forward, foreign initiatives remain strong and we expect to secure additional contracts in 2017.","On the commercial side, after a difficult period in the market with several quarters of very low order flow, we saw a significant increase in order activity in the back half of 2016 and we are looking to carry that momentum into 2017 with higher 412 and strong 505 deliveries.","Textron Aviation, we saw higher Latitude volumes in 2016 and expect this trend to continue in 2017, with higher deliveries to NetJets and retail customers. On Longitude, we entered two aircraft in the flight test program and expect certification at the end of 2017, with deliveries ramping in 2018. We updated design details and performance capabilities for the Cessna Denali and Citation Hemisphere, two platforms that will make incremental revenue as we enter new markets in the coming years.","To finish with Textron's 2017 financial guidance, we are projecting revenues of about $14.3 billion, as we expect growth in Industrial and Systems, with approximately flat revenue at Bell and Aviation. We expect adjusted EPS from continuing operations will be in the range of $2.50 to $2.70, and manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions in a range of $650 million to $750 million.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank.","Frank Connor","Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Segment profit in the quarter was $391 million, up $13 million from the fourth quarter of 2015 on a $98-million decrease in revenues. Let's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation.","At Textron Aviation, revenues were down $52 million from this period last year, primarily due to lower commercial and defense-related turboprop volumes, partially offset by higher pre-owned volume. Segment profit was $135 million, down from $138 million a year ago. Backlog in this segment ended the quarter at $1 billion, down $73 million from the end of the third quarter.","Moving to Bell, revenues were down $148 million, primarily due to lower military and commercial volumes. Segment profit increased $2 million from the fourth quarter in 2015 despite the lower volumes, reflecting favorable performance. Backlog in this segment was $5.4 billion at the end of the quarter, up $416 million from the end of the third quarter.","At Textron Systems, revenues were up $69 million, primarily due to higher Marine and Land Systems volumes. Segment profit was up $12 million, reflecting improved performance. Backlog in the segment was $1.8 billion, down $367 million from the end of the third quarter.","Industrial revenues increased $35 million due to higher volumes at Kautex and specialized vehicles. Segment profit was flat with the fourth quarter of last year. Finance segment revenues decreased $2 million and profit increased $2 million.","Moving below the segment profit, corporate expenses were $56 million compared to $52 million last year. This reflected the impact of a higher stock price on stock-based compensation. Interest expense was $33 million, essentially flat to last year.","With respect to our restructuring plan in the quarter, we recorded pretax charges of $8 million on the special charges line. We ended the year with gross manufacturing debt of $2.8 billion.","For the full year, we repurchased approximately 6.9 million shares at an overall cost of about $241 million. Our Board of Directors also approved a new authorization for the repurchase of up to 25 million shares.","Let's turn now to our 2017 guidance beginning with our segments on slide 9. At Textron Aviation, we are expecting flattish revenues of about $5 billion, reflecting an increase in pre-owned aircraft volumes and Latitude deliveries, offset by lower defense-related turboprop volumes. Segment margin is expected to be approximately 8%, excluding the impact of the Scorpion transition, reflecting the change in mix. We expect the Scorpion program expense to be about $50 million for the year.","Looking to Bell, we expect overall revenues will be essentially flat at about $3.3 billion, reflecting higher H-1 deliveries, offset by lower V-22 revenues and spares on the military side, and flattish revenues on the commercial side. We are forecasting a margin of approximately 11%.","At Systems, we're estimating 2017 revenues of about $1.9 billion, up 8% from last year, reflecting a full year of TAPV deliveries and growth at TRU, partially offset by lower volumes at unmanned systems and weapons and sensors, as we exit the SFW product line. Segment margin is expected to be approximately 8.5%. The lower margin in 2017 reflects the impact of lower SFW activities and higher TAPV volumes.","At Industrial, we're expecting growth in each of our businesses, resulting in projected segment revenue growth of 5% to about $4 billion, with an estimated margin of approximately 9%. As Scott discussed earlier, we've entered into an agreement to acquire Arctic Cat, and we will update our 2017 outlook to include this transaction following its close. At Finance, we are forecasting segment profit of about $20 million.","Turning to slide 10, based on US pension discount rate of 4.25%, we're estimating 2017 pension costs to be flat with last year at about $81 million. Turning to slide 11, R&D is expected to be about $495 million, down from $582 million in 2016. We are expecting CapEx will be about $440 million, approximately flat with last year.","Moving below the segment line and looking at slide 12, we're projecting about $115 million for corporate expense. Next year's interest expense is estimated at $140 million. We are assuming a tax rate of about 30%, and our guidance assumes a share count of about 270 million shares. So that concludes our prepared remarks. Brad, we can open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will go to George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.","George Shapiro","Scott, I wanted to pursue Aviation to some extent. First, I mean on the third quarter you commented you expected fourth quarter deliveries to be above last year's fourth quarter. Were any of those delayed into early this year as people may have hopes that we get better tax depreciation? And two, if you can just go through what you are seeing in the market now. Are you seeing an improvement in GDP growth, business confidence is up - are well behaved at this point, pricing seems like it's getting better so I would've thought that we would start to see some more improvement then evidently you are forecasting in 2017 guidance.","Scott Donnelly","Sure George, let me start with the fourth-quarter and I think what we saw in the fourth quarter was obviously continued strength on the Latitude side. Aircraft is doing very well and demand has been strong both on the fractional side through NetJet as well as retail. I would say on the rest of the Citation family, as we went through the fourth quarter we saw a lot of price pressure and folks wanting to see lower pricing in the aircraft and what you see is that we didn't hit the volume because frankly we are not willing to go to the price levels where some people wanted to go in order to get deals done.","I think the pricing on these right now remains very attractive. It remains depressed even going back into 2008 days and to levels we are just not willing to go so what happened is that we traded out of some volume because it was priced at a level we are not willing to accept. In fact in addition to that it's part of the reason - forecast this year. While we will still have continued growth on the Latitude side based on its demand, we are pulling back on the production volumes and unit volumes for 2017 for a lot of these other aircraft because again we are not willing to go to the price levels where people seem to want to go.","Now in terms of Outlook in terms of the economy I don't think there's any question that if we see things happen with respect to corporate tax rates and regulation and all these things which I think frankly we all feel pretty good about, that that can make a material impact on GDP, that will help to create more confidence and more demand and if that demand comes back and it's willing to pay, you know, a fair price on the aircraft that we will address that at the time but we haven't seen that yet and so we walked from pursuing lower prices to get deals done in the fourth quarter and we will reflect that in lower pricing volumes going into 2017.","George Shapiro","The book to bill looked like it was around.95. Was that - did that improve after the election or was there any color you can give us?","George Shapiro","The book to bill looked like it was around 0.95. Was that - did that improve after the election or any color through the quarter you can give us?","Scott Donnelly","No, I am not disappointed with the book to bill, George. It's always tough to get the book to bill in the fourth quarter to be - predict it strong, and usually it's weaker, frankly, I think, right? Because you see a lot of sales that's in Q4 and order activity doesn't usually pick up until after the first of the year.","In other words, if people are going to do something, they tend to want to do it within the quarter for the fourth quarter. So I'm comfortable with our book to bill in terms of where we're going in the year. But again, we just - from a volume market perspective, it's a little bit of a wait and see, and we're going to adjust accordingly in the meantime.","George Shapiro","And one quick one for Frank. How much of aftermarket up in the Aviation area?","Frank Connor","Aftermarket was up, in part due to the reflection of the Able transaction. When you take that out, it was flattish.","Operator","We will go to the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason Gursky","Scott, Frank, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about the acquisition and the potential accretion and synergies and the longer-term strategic view of this particular market segment.","Scott Donnelly","Sure. I think that this is a great opportunity for us. We have been investing organically here over the last couple of years to move more into the consumer side of the vehicle business. Our vehicle business, obviously, has been performing really well in the golf side, the Industrial side, and our own consumer piece of the business.","But the consumer business, in general is a very large market. We have been fairly under-represented in that area. We have a great product line up with our personal transport vehicles under the E-Z-GO brand that does very well; it's a very nice business for us.","We wanted to get into the higher performance more off-road side of the business. We invested in the Stampede; it's a fantastic vehicle. We're really pleased with that vehicle, but we've been trying to build out the dealer side, the distribution side, which is a different distribution channel than that which we have in the rest of our vehicle business.","So opportunistically, look this is a business that's been challenged in the last couple of years. The industry frankly, after a lot of years of growth that was - had some issues this year just in terms of the economy and lack of net growth.","The snow side of the business, obviously, had a couple of bad winters. On the dirt side they had just, again, as an industry, not unique to Arctic Cat, a lot of stuff built up in the channel. And I think it's a business that has tremendous opportunities going forward, but it's been in a bit of a tough time unwinding and managing their way through a lot of the inventory issues, and frankly, positioning themselves for future growth.","So when we looked at the company - if you look at the products that we have today and the products that we've had in development, and you look at the products they have today and the products, frankly, which they have in the development pipeline, it's just a beautiful fit. I think that dealers and customers are going to be really impressed over the next couple of years about what that product line looks like. I think it will be a very attractive line for dealers.","I think a lot of progress has been made with respect to the channel. That work will have to continue after we acquire it, I think, through the first year to really get that repositioned and ready to go.","So I think long term, we see this as a mid-single-digit growth business. I think we get a lot of synergies and a lot of leverage in terms of the operations, as well as, again, just fortuitously where we were really investing and where they were investing are very, very highly complementary. So I think the combined entity will have a great product lineup, a great dealer network, and I think it's really poised to deliver some nice growth going forward.","Jason Gursky","Okay. As far as near-term accretion, dilution, when do you expect to turn on that? And then, Frank, can just talk a little bit about the cash flow conversion for the year and the puts and takes that are going on there for 2017? Thanks, guys.","Scott Donnelly","Sure, so look, on the dilution front, again, we don't have a hard number yet because we don't know when the deal closes. But if you assume it's going to close sometime toward the end of the quarter, which I don't think is unreasonable, we need to go through our regulatory issues, but I am not expecting any issues there.","The issue right now is, and what's really been driving their performance as well as a lot of their competitor's performance, has been this issue of this clearing out a lot of the older product in the channel through rebating, and that's put a lot of pressure on their margins. So I expect to see that continue through the balance of this year once we pick up the company. So I'm guessing we're probably going to see somewhere around $0.10 dilution in 2017, with clear accretion in 2018 and beyond. Frank, you can talk to the cash conversion.","Frank Connor","Yes. In terms of overall cash conversion for both 2016 and then going into 2017, in 2016, obviously, we ended strong after a weaker start to the year. We're looking for an increase, as we indicated, in cash and cash flow conversion going into 2017.","Obviously some of that has to do with the continuing ramp-up of the TAPV deliveries, as we talked about. It also has to do with the production modification that Scott mentioned at Aviation on the legacy lines and some better performance on the inventory front there. And so, we're looking for an improvement there.","As it relates to Arctic Cat, it will have some impact on that cash flow number, but not all that material of an impact in terms of the cash flow impact of the acquisition.","Scott Donnelly","Year one, as you guys could expect, normal purchase accounting and inventory values and all that stuff will create some dilution, some of which will still be a cash impact, but a great deal of it won't be.","Operator","We will go to the line of Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Rajeev Lalwani","Scott, just a question for you on the Scorpion. It seems like you're making some good progress there. Can you talk about whether or not this is the make-or-break year for the product, and then just any opportunities around the change in administration?","Scott Donnelly","Sure. Look, I think the team made huge progress last year on some really, really important milestones. Obviously, we always knew we could make a good aircraft. One of the biggest risks was always around how you get a certification. Clearly, last year with the Air Force putting a program office together and getting under contract with them to perform the airworthiness work was a gigantic milestone. Having the conforming aircraft now flying and really working our way through our production processes so it's not just a prototype, but something that's ready to turn the button and move into production was a big milestone.","And look, a lot of what we were working on was trying to position ourselves for opportunities, both internationally and domestically. As we've made those milestones, we have a lot of conversation going internationally. And I think you've all seen probably from a US standpoint, Senator McCain and his wish list of future budgets, and the Chief of the Air Force have also articulated this high-low strategy. Their expectation to run an experimentation program here in the spring, and have articulated a requirement for about 300 aircraft.","Again, as we've been articulating for some time, we believe internationally as well as even domestically, there is a market for an aircraft that is much more affordable, a lot fewer dollars per hour to operate. The 10, in fact, execute a lot of missions where we don't need to have the cost, and frankly, burn hours on the airframes of very highly utilized, very expensive aircraft.","So again, this is an experiment program; it's certainly not a contract. Senator McCain's desire for a program like this and the budget line item that he's put in has to work its way into an actual budget. And these are numbers they're talking about for FY18 through FY22, but we knew this opportunity was coming. We expected that there was an opportunity here and we wanted to position ourselves to be able to be in a good place for that.","So we spent a fair bit of money last year to make sure we're ready for that. We feel like we are ready for that, and we'll see how that program progresses.","Rajeev Lalwani","Thanks, and then a quick one for you on the biz jet side. Scott, you made a comment earlier about how customers looking for low prices and you just don't want to go there. What's behind that desire or the low prices? Is it competition, or is it just core demand not being there, or maybe too much supply?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I think it's a bit of both. I think if you looked in the Latitude space, clearly, the pricing in there has been very difficult. It has been improving, which we talked about in the past and it in continued to improve in the fourth quarter. And it's continued to improve in terms of orders that we've taken for deliveries into 2017, and we clearly expect that will continue to improve. But that's a price level that we're clearly not happy with from a profitability standpoint, so we'll keep working that.","I think on the rest of the aircraft, it's - there's just not sufficient demand there yet. So I think in a lot of cases, we have people that are going to buy new aircraft. And they're looking for further incentive to do it now rather than do it sometime in the future. And it's just reached a price point where it doesn't make sense for us to build the aircraft, so that's the reason that we pulled back in the fourth quarter and anticipate pulling back through 2017.","If the market changes and we see demand coming back, then obviously, we can react to that. And we're certainly hopeful that will be the case, but it needs to be at a price level that makes sense for us to sell the aircraft.","Operator","We will go to the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Julian Mitchell","I just wanted to start with the margin guidance in Aviation. It was flattish or slightly down progression in 2017, excluding Scorpion costs. Maybe if you could parse out which is the biggest anchor on the margins, if we think about pricing, which you've talked about, also then Longitude ramp-up costs. And also then, the lower production on the turboprop side. Which of those three, if you had to rank in order of import for the margins?","Scott Donnelly","Well, that's a tough choice, Julian. The answer to the question is yes, right? And so, we're going to see Latitude volumes increase probably on the order of about 30%. That's good in terms of volume and it's good in terms of getting aircraft out there and operating, demand environment is good. It's a great aircraft, but it is dilutive to our margins, it's not priced where we want it to be. And as I said, we are making progress on trying to move that price up and we're going to continue to work hard on doing that as we go through 2017.","So from a mix standpoint, that's a significant volume increase of something that is dilutive to our margin rate, and trying to overcome that is a bit of a headwind. On the other hand, a lot of these historical products on both the jet side, as well as the turboprop, including the defense side of the business, which were better margin, are either down in volume, AT6, for instance, is down significantly in volume. As we've finished the JPATS program, clearly, we have some international deliveries this year, but it's going to stabilize at a lower level. And then, when you look at the rest of our historical Citation products and King Air products and Caravans, these are at better margins and those volumes are going to be down.","So, and again, I am not willing to take the prices down further to try to drive that demand and end up in a situation where we have today with the Latitude, where you have a great aircraft that delivers very, very well for customers but is priced at a point that doesn't make sense for us.","So it really, Julian, it's a very simple mix change, right? We're seeing about a 30% increase so that Latitude becomes a significant portion of our sales at a diluted margin. And it's the so-called legacy aircraft that are going to be down in volume and they do have better margins.","Julian Mitchell","And then my second question is, maybe a little bit for Frank as well, but on the share buyback authorization announcement, should we read anything into that in terms of a change in approach by the Board and the management team regarding the appeal of buybacks in general? Some view on the stock's valuation? Or does it reflect maybe something about the scope for large M&A or the lack of opportunities for large M&A?","Scott Donnelly","Julian, we, as you know, over the last few years have been executing a buyback strategy that, again, remains committed to the offset of dilution. But also, we'll do things opportunistically when we think it makes sense. And as a result, we've retired a number of shares through that and we've been working our way through the previous authorization.","I think the Board is fully on board with that capital allocation strategy, and the renewal and putting 25 million share authorization is so we can continue that strategy. So we'll continue to offset dilution, and as we see appropriate opportunities that makes sense from an overall value perspective to retire shares, we'll continue to do that. And this authorization just gives us the authority and place to continue on that strategy.","Julian Mitchell","And then just following up on that, so has there been any change in view on your part or the Board's part about the right level of financial leverage for Textron? Or that view is unchanged from one or two years ago?","Scott Donnelly","No, I think it's pretty consistent. We're pretty happy where the balance sheet is, and I think the leverage numbers we've talked about before continue to be our target.","Operator","We will go to the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr","So your R&D looks like it's some $40 million to $50 million in 2016 lighter than - or something like that, lighter than you've projected going into the year. And you've projected another $87 million decline in 2017. Give us some color in terms of where was it down in 2016, and where do you expect it down in 2017?","Scott Donnelly","Sure. So if you looked at 2015 to 2016, Cai, the principal reduction was at Bell. And unfortunately, a lot of that was associated in one way or the other with the 525 program. Obviously, as a result of the accident, we curtailed the flight test part of the program.","The good news is, I think we're getting close. We have a team working very hard to try to get that aircraft back into the flight test program here in the early part of this year. But we, obviously, through suspension of that program, our costs, our funding was lighter than we would've originally expected in 2016.","If you look at the walk from 2016 to 2017, the reduction is principally in the Aviation space. And when I say Aviation, I'm including a significant reduction in spending on Longitude. We spent a lot of money last year getting those first couple aircraft into the flight test program, and that was a big milestone to get that done. But there was a lot of money spent to do that.","And parallel with that, obviously we were doing a lot of work on the Scorpion program to get into the certification program. And again, getting the first production aircraft flying into that flight test program. So there was a lot of - there's always a lot of money involved in getting an aircraft into the flight test program as you complete the engineering and all the preparation for flight tests and building out the aircraft.","And so with both Longitude and the production version of Scorpion flying, we'll see reduced spending on both of those programs in 2017. It's somewhat offset by some increased spending on the Hemisphere program and the Denali program, but net, that's where the reduction is. So that's - you'll see that all - it's really all in the Aviation side in 2017.","Cai von Rumohr","And then speaking of the Longitude, you talked of deliveries ramping in 2018. I think at one point, you were indicating expected deliveries in the fourth quarter of 2017. When do you expect to make first deliveries?","Scott Donnelly","Yes, I'm sorry, Cai, I didn't mean to change that. The wording's probably a little unclear. We're still expecting the first couple of deliveries of Longitude in the fourth quarter of 2018 - I'm sorry, 2017, but it's only a couple of aircraft. But that's been our plan all along. So it is still our plan that we would get FAA certification and make the first couple of deliveries late this year, and then you'd see a significant production ramp-up as we go into 2018.","Operator","We will go to the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Sam Pearlstein","Can I just, to just tie things up, the $57 million decline in corporate expense, is that all Scorpion moving into Aviation or is there anything else going on there?","Frank Connor","Yes, no, the bulk of that is the Scorpion program moving over to Aviation.","Sam Pearlstein","Okay. And then you talked, Scott, about the commercial helicopter business showing signs of bottoming in the third quarter and sounds like it's continued. Is there any way we can look at the aftermarket in this fourth quarter? Did you see any improvement there, since I would expect to see that turn first?","Scott Donnelly","Not really. It was a little bit better, Sam, but not appreciably.","Sam Pearlstein","Okay. And, what are you expecting in terms of commercial for 2017, and in some of the products like 412s and others on the commercial side?","Scott Donnelly","Well, we'll certainly see an increase in 412s. We've been pretty happy, as we talked about last quarter, and that continues in terms of some of the 412 orders closing, so our production looks pretty good right now. And then there's a couple more opportunities out there that I think will close here in the near future that will not only help us feel good about where we are in 2017, but also 2018 and beyond.","So that's, I think, the 412 situation is significantly improved from where it was coming into 2016. 505 obviously is incremental; we're basically, probably selling just about as many as we can make, so we feel pretty good about where that is. The 429s are doing well. 407s are still a little soft, but again, hopefully with a little bit of the economic growth, that will shore up as well. So clearly, our expectation is that we'll have a better year on the commercial side in 2017 than we had in 2016.","Operator","We will go to the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.","Pete Skibitski","I had a couple questions on Bell. The first on this framework agreement with China for the 100 407s. First, when do you expect that to finalize? And in terms of financials, is it going to be like a royalty type of arrangement like with the 412s in Japan?","Scott Donnelly","Yes, no, I think there's been a fair bit of confusion over that agreement or some misreporting by some media things. So, just to be clear, this is a customer. So we are still in the process of negotiating with them, but this would be the acquisition of 100 aircraft.","In essence, what they would do is take deliveries of these aircraft and then do local completion and finishing, depending on what application they're going to go into. So, for us this is - it's a-- we're obviously, were working with them to help them to have the capability to do what they need to do to finish and customize the aircraft in the Chinese market. But it's very much a customer relationship in terms of selling the aircraft.","Pete Skibitski","And then the other one, I think I heard you say, Scott, that you finalized the Pakistan contract for nine AH-1s. I'm just wondering when do you expect the next international sales to come on. The AH1, it seems like there's a decent amount of opportunities, see in Poland, Romania, and I think there's others out there. Just curious as to the timing.","Scott Donnelly","It is, it's just timing and, frankly, a couple of these customers were waiting for the administration change. And obviously, everybody is just getting into place and starting the process. So it's - I expect these to be normal FMS cases, so there's a little challenge around predicting when these things will go through. But there are, I'd say, a robust number of customers and volumes that are in discussion that are working LOAs, and it's going to happen. It's just everything was sitting on the side waiting for the administration to change, and these things now are going to move forward.","Operator","We will go to the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Noah Poponak","Scott, in the business jet market, given what you're describing with the price you're experiencing on your new product, and then also saying that you need to reduce production on the legacy product, I'm wondering if that has you concerned at all that the industry attempted to solve an oversupply problem with new versions of supply. Like, clearly, there was too much used inventory in the market and it, every player in the industry brought new product to stimulate demand rather than just reducing existing production to clear all that inventory.","Is that a fair assessment? And if so, even if the post-election better economy hope actually happens, is there still a decent amount of inventory to clear before new sales are better?","Scott Donnelly","Noah, that's a good question. The dynamic has been complicated, obviously, and the role that used aircraft play has been significant. But I think if you look at the used aircraft market, for the most part, it has been moving nicely. We've been disappointed in some of the price levels in the used market, but I do think it had its own little supply\/demand problem going on.","And we're sitting here today and now into 2017, and that large number of aircraft that constituted that large number of used available for sale that were built largely between 2004 and 2008 are now getting to be older aircraft, right? So I think that the attractiveness or the alternative of some of those versus the new aircraft buy is going down and just as a function of time.","Again, the used aircraft market is fairly vibrant. I think it's moving, and we hear brokers starting to actually be bullish about some of these going on. We certainly feel good about where it is, with the exception of old, very high time aircraft, and we've been hit by some of that with some of the, for instance, older 10s are challenged, But for the most part, the used market is in pretty good shape right now and things are moving.","So again, I think a part of the dynamic of this is obviously economic growth would matter a lot, right? We've been sitting here for a whole bunch of years with almost no economic growth. We're all pretty optimistic about what could happen in a 3% to 4% GDP place. I think that will help our industry, as it will help everybody in the economy.","And the other part of it, which is we are going to see a lot of these used aircraft. They are getting older; every year they get older, which is the good news. So look, I think on - in terms of the new model side, an awful lot of the investment that we've made, as have others, is the demand for larger cabins. So when you look at the market and you talk to our customers, their expectation has moved to these bigger cabins.","So when you think about the investments that we've made in Latitude, what we're doing in Longitude, ultimately into Hemisphere, people want bigger cabins. So I don't think the right answer would have been to not invest in these new spaces and expect that the older aircraft with the smaller cabins would have held in there, particularly with competition moving to bigger cabins.","Noah Poponak","Did I hear you say Latitude up about 30% in units in 2017?","Scott Donnelly","Yes, that's right. It will be up probably about 30%, and then evenly split between incremental sales to NetJets and retail customers.","Noah Poponak","And could you quantify, even if not as precisely, the order of magnitude of the decline on the rest of the portfolio? In terms of Cessna.","Scott Donnelly","No, I don't think we want to get into unit by unit, but it's pretty well across all of the historical--","Noah Poponak","I don't mean unit by unit. I just mean like total not Latitude.","Scott Donnelly","In terms of unit volumes?","Noah Poponak","It sounds like you're saying you are cutting production in Cessna jets that are not Latitude. Is that correct?","Scott Donnelly","Yes, exactly. Look, it ends up being about the same number of units.","Noah Poponak","Okay.","Scott Donnelly","I think if you looked at jet units on a year-over-year basis, it's going to be about flat. Over every incremental Latitude, you're taking out an aircraft that was either Sovereign or XLS or CJ4, CF3+ or M2, roughly.","Noah Poponak","Got it. And then just last one on the market, would full CapEx expensing in year one materially help your end market there? Or, does existing pretty substantial accelerated depreciation, is that already a pretty large input into demand in the business jet market?","Scott Donnelly","You already have bonus depreciations doing a 50-50, Noah, so I'm not sure it would make a huge difference. I think that, from my perspective anyway, I think what would provide a lot more stimulation to our customer base would be overall reductions in taxes, and a lot of reduced regulation and just creating a higher growth environment. I think that's a lot more impactful than the depreciation curve.","Operator","We will go to the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Myles Walton","Just a couple quick ones. One is on the Scorpion expense of $50 million in 2017 and the decision to put it into one of the operating segments. So it is a twofold question. One is what's the trend line of program expenditures after 2017? And Scott, to put it into a business where the business is probably, obviously, got a lot of other priorities and is trying to get to the bottom line, is this the sink or swim decision for the Scorpion? So is it now on a clock, and also, what's your expectation for expenses beyond 2017? Thanks.","Scott Donnelly","I think it is on a bit of a clock and not for any negative reasons. It's just when you get to a point where the things that you needed to be able to check off when customers talk to you about, hey we're interested but here's what we have to see, A, you've got to be able to tell us how you're going to get to certification. So we're now on that path.","You need to show us that you could actually build these on a - what's the production conforming version of the aircraft? We now have that flying. And we had customers, including our US customers, saying, look, this is a weapons system; we want to see that it's capable of delivering munitions. And so we did that; we went to White Sands and we fired several different precision and non-precision weapons and had raving success in a pretty short period of time.","So I think when you have conversations with customers, be it international or domestic, they said, here's the things we need to see to be able to really consider this platform. So we've done that now, so we don't have those impediments.","So I think we are now on a reasonable time that says, guys, we either need to see these discussions move to some form of an order, something more concrete, or we need to spend more money on it. So I think 2016 was a huge year for us in terms of being able to say, okay, guys, now we've checked these things off; albeit, not until December, obviously, in terms of getting the first flight of the production aircraft going. So I think this is now the time to see, do these things move from discussion to something that's serious.","Now, the move to put it into the business wasn't portending anything particular, right? Look, the expense is there, regardless of how we've accounted for it, but we've always had this in corporate because it was an experiment, right? And this was not something that was - had a clear linkage to a particular business to drive revenue and margin. But I think now as we get into a point that says, alright, this thing is now ready to fully be able to go to market, well that's the business' job, right? Corporate doesn't do that.","And so I think now having this where the team in Aviation, particularly on our defense side, will pick up the marketing and drive this thing to achieve its milestones, get certifications done and try to bring this thing to fruition in terms of orders, it's appropriate that those expenses be in that segment where you would also then record revenue and margin.","So it's a big change for where the program was which was in a very experimental phase up until now. To where now, we have these critical things out of the way, a clear path to a real marketable product, and therefore, it makes sense to be in business.","Myles Walton","And the $50 million step, or $50 million in 2017, is there a big step down no matter what in 2018 within Aviation?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I think you're either going to be see a big step down or you're going to see a step up, because there's a real order and an opportunity that we need to go exit into.","Operator","We will go to the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Just a few follow-ups if that's okay. On the legacy aircraft, I think the tone has been it's rough, it's a challenging market, but it's flattish. And it seems like it changed in Q4 and that's driving some of the production cuts. Can you talk about that a bit? Why the tone changed in the last quarter.","Scott Donnelly","Well, look, Sheila, I think that we were seeing some incremental pricing, we were feeling good about stabilization. And it seemed like when we got to the fourth quarter, we had a number of transactions where people just wanted to go to even lower prices, and we said that we're just not - we can't do that. We can't make it unhealthy for the business.","So again, as I said earlier, I think that's where we see it at this point, and that led us to back off on some of these production volumes because we're just not going to create capacity out there if it's not a market that's willing to at least pay a fair price for the aircraft. We're certainly hopeful that will change. And if we see that dynamic change, we can obviously react very quickly to try to get additional aircraft into the market.","But we were seeing, as we went through the year, what we thought was a reasonable progression of feeling like the pricing was firming up. And it seemed like in the fourth quarter, given the number of aircraft that were out there, the demand just didn't match up and it wanted to see a lower price point. And, as I said, we're just, we're not going there.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Understood. That makes sense. Another one on Aviation margins. I understand that the Latitude is dilutive and that might be half due to the NetJets deliveries and the competition with the legacies. And just how do you think about the market as we - the market for the Longitude, just given that there's no competitor out there, or new model out there for that aircraft. And how - if that's dilutive or not as we start production deliveries in 2017 and into 2018?","Scott Donnelly","Sure. Well, look, Sheila, obviously, the situation with Latitude, we're not happy with where that is, right? We feel like we delivered a great aircraft to the marketplace, customers loved the aircraft, it's performing well, there's just - the thing is a home run. But we're not enjoying the benefit of that because it's in there at a price point that we're not happy with, and that was obviously a competitive dynamic that caused that to happen.","Where we're positioning the Longitude, we're not going to let that happen. I think when you look at what's out there competing with it, we have superior performance, and we're going to start holding the price line from day one that has to make that an attractive aircraft for us, as well as for our customers. And so far, the discussions we're having with customers.","And look, we are taking deposits on the aircraft. Obviously, we're not through certification testing and all that, so we're not going to see - you're not going to see a big impact on backlog yet. But I think the product is being very well received by customers. There's a pretty strong interest, but it's at a price level that's a fair price. And so I think we just have to make sure that in the future, our new models are good for us and our customer.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Understood, and then just last one on Bell. What's the sequential pickup in the backlog? And then can we talk about the moving pieces within Bell profitability? I know there are a lot of moving pieces, but it seems 412 is the only one that really matters. Just looking at the second half, 2016 margins, they were pretty good, so if you could talk about that a bit.","Scott Donnelly","Sure, so Bell backlog is up. Part of that, of course, is that we put the multi-year volumes in on a year-by-year basis, and we always do that in the fourth quarter when it gets appropriate. So part of that is the military side, which is our normal cycle. But we also had some positive backlog build on the commercial side.","And again, as we talked about the Q3 and Q4, we did see nice increases in order activity on the commercial side. So they both contributed to the increase in backlog.","There's no question when you look at the mix in the business certainly matters on the commercial side. And 2016, we did have some 412 sales here in the end of the quarter. H-1s - I'm sorry, Huey IIs do well and we had some Huey II volumes in the year as well.","Again, as we look into 2017, we expect we'll be down a little bit on the B-22's which has been consistent with the plan. I think we'll do fine on the H-1s, and we'll see a little bit of an uptick on the commercial side in a number of the models. But the one that's most important from a profitability standpoint is the 412s.","Operator","We will go to the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.","Peter Arment","Scott, just a quick one. You've had a ton of questions on Latitude, so I will just ask one. Back in, at MBAA, the increases that we were thinking about for 2017 was 15% to 20%, so obviously, it's doing great in the marketplace. Is this just mainly what we're seeing demand from North America, or are you seeing some other pockets that you're picking up strength, just from a geography standpoint?","Scott Donnelly","We're starting to pick up some international orders on Latitude, but it's still very much a US story at this point, I would say.","Operator","And our next question comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research.","Robert Stallard","Just a couple of quick ones, Scott. First of all, on these customers that wanted the lower prices and you weren't prepared to give them in Aviation, do you know if they went to other manufacturers or are they still in the market?","Scott Donnelly","No, I think they're still in the market. And again, part of this is these are customers, a lot of these folks are guys who our customers today, they operate our aircraft today and they're very happy with our aircraft. And I think, ultimately, they're going to stay in our aircraft.","But if they're not ready, if they're happy with their current aircraft and they're willing to wait and run that aircraft for another year or two, then that's fine. We just don't need to take pricing to a level that doesn't make sense in order to try to make that happen now, and that's why we feel like adjusting this demand by taking the production down is fine. If the market's not --if it's fewer aircraft, then we're going to build fewer aircraft in that space and not do that.","Now, some are competitive, and obviously, and we walk away from some deals. But I think we need to do that to create some price integrity in the marketplace. It just doesn't make sense to get it to where it - it doesn't make sense to sell aircraft at that low price.","Robert Stallard","Okay. And then, secondly, on Kautex, is there any implications from this tax legislation that's being discussed in DC?","Scott Donnelly","I'm sorry, I'm not, there's a lot of tax discussion, Robert. Is there something more particular, because I don't know of anything that would directly affect Kautex.","Robert Stallard","Yes, in terms of the context of their based overseas and linked to the automotive industry.","Scott Donnelly","Yes, Kautex manufactures and ships and sells in those markets. So we go where our customers are building automobiles. And so, it's - we wouldn't expect a material impact. Now obviously, if you begin to see auto production shift, we'll follow that auto production accordingly, but we don't expect a big impact.","Operator","And no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to our speakers.","Eric Salander","Okay, thank you. Bye.","Operator","That does conclude the conference for today.

During today\u2019s call, all phone participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Doug Wilburne, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Doug Wilburne","Thank you, Gail. Good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today\u2019s press release.","On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron\u2019s Chairman and CEO and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer.","Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. Textron\u2019s revenues in the quarter were $4.1 billion, up $591 million from last year\u2019s fourth quarter. The Beechcraft acquisition completed at the end of the first quarter contributed $556 million to the increase. Income from continuing operations was $0.76 per share compared to $0.60 in the fourth quarter of 2013.","Textron Aviation operating results included an $8 million reduction to segment profit from fair value but the fair value step-up adjustments to acquire Beechcraft inventories sold during the quarter. Plus there was an additional $13 million charge in the quarter related to Beechcraft restructuring costs which were recorded on a separate line for acquisition and restructuring cost. Together these items reduced EPS by about $0.05 per share.","Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $449 million dollars compared to $774 million in last year\u2019s fourth quarter bringing full-year cash inflow to $753 million compared to $256 million last year.","With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Donnelly","Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everybody. Revenues were up 16.8% in the quarter reflecting the success of our strategy of investing in new products and complementary acquisitions.","For example, at Industrial, we saw an 11.5% increase in revenues reflected across all of our business as well as the impact of the technologies, Dixie Chopper and HD Electric acquisitions.","Most recently, in our specialized vehicles group, we purchased Douglas Equipment, a European-based aviation ground support business. Douglas Equipment are largely North American truck business with an international footprint, expands our truck portfolio to better serve the aviation ground support market.","On the new product front, the Tools & Test, we introduced a number of new products during the quarter, including a new line of Mini fiberTOOLS for working on fiber optic communications facilities, and a new 6-ton Pistol Grip intelligent electric utility crimping tool.","Contracts, we continue to win significant new automotive systems contracts around the world which we expect will support growth over the next several years.","Operating performance was also a bright spot in this Industrial in the quarter, contributing to a full-year margin expansion of 40 basis points. We expect continued margin expansion in 2015.","Moving to systems, revenues were up in the quarter as we began deliveries of the TCDL Shadow V2 systems. We also made good progress on our Canadian TAPV program having incorporated the necessary design changes and have started initial reliability testing of the vehicle. We believe we\u2019re on track to proceed full program testing in the second quarter with initial deliveries still planned for late this year.","At TRU Simulation and Training, we signed a number of air transport simulator agreements in the quarter and announced plans for a new Cessna in Beechcraft aircraft maintenance training facility in Wichita.","In our Bell segment, revenues were down as we delivered seven V-22s compared to 13 in last year\u2019s fourth quarter, reflecting a start of lower deliveries called for in the multiyear program. We also delivered seven H1s, up one unit from last year\u2019s fourth quarter.","On the commercial side, we delivered 57 aircrafts, down from 75 a year ago. Despite lower Bell volumes, fourth quarter margins were up 70 basis points from last year reflecting good cost performance.","While we\u2019ve seen a slowdown in the commercial helicopter market, our commercial win rate continues to improve around the world. For example, we continued to expand our presence in China as evidenced by our success in the Zhuhai, China Airshow in November where we signed customer letters of intent for 61 new helicopters.","We continue to make progress on development of our 525 Relentless program as we\u2019re well into our safety flight testing on the aircraft rudder system in [indiscernible]. Results of those tests have been encouraging and we expect the first flight later this spring.","Development of our 505 Jet Ranger X program is also proceeding well as we conducted a successful first flight in November. These two new platforms are expected to provide differentiated appeal with customers at both ends of our product spectrum and should create significant growth opportunities for years to come.","On the military side of Bell, the V-22 reached 250,000 flight hours during the quarter. The aircraft is performing very well for our customers, achieving outstanding mission success and deployments to Afghanistan, the Persian Gulf, the Mediterranean, Africa and the Asia-Pacific region.","The Osprey continues to demonstrate a wide range of mission capabilities and is attracting attention from customers around the world. Most recently, Japan has indicated that it has provided for the first five of its 17-unit requirement in their 2015 budget.","We\u2019re currently working with the U.S. government to negotiate a contract and delivery plan for this aircraft.","Moving to Textron Aviation, in the quarter we delivered 55 jets, down from 62 last year. For the full-year, we delivered 159 jets, up from last year\u2019s 139 jets. We also delivered 41 King Airs in the quarter bringing post-acquisition deliveries to 113.","The integration of Beechcraft continues to grow extremely well which is evident in our cost productivity as Textron Aviation achieved full-year margins of 5.1%, about 200 basis points higher than the mid-point of our initial guidance.","We\u2019ve been actively working with our new Hawker customers this past year, ensuring that they understand our commitment to support the aircraft. During the quarter, we also made progress internationally as we opened a new larger combined Hawker, Beechcraft and Cessna service center, our flagship European maintenance location at the Paris Le Bourget airport.","In addition, we delivered the first two XLS aircraft to our Chinese joint venture at Zhuhai. Development of our new Latitude continues to go well as we now accumulated 500 test flights generating 12,000 test hours.","Customer response to Latitude continues to be positive following its debut at NBAA. Customers in the North America are currently flying demo flights and they\u2019re impressed with the spacious stand-up cabin and $2,700 [indiscernible] range that Latitude offers. We expect Latitude deliveries will begin in the second half of this year.","On the market front, new jet customer interest and inquiry activity has been noticeably better than a year ago. We\u2019re also encouraged that available used aircraft continues to come down, which is resulting in used aircraft moving fairly quickly and the stabilization of residual values, especially for used aircraft with low hours. On balance, we believe our best path forward at this point is to remain conservative with respect to increasing production and to continue in our path for new product developments.","To summarize, we believe we ended the year with strong EPS and cash flow performance. And throughout the year, we took actions that should position our businesses for continued growth over the next several years.","Textron systems began deliveries of the TCDL V2 system retrofit program and made a good progress in getting the Canadian TAPV program back on track. We advanced our Ship to Shore program and began initial production activity to support first delivery plan for 2017.","We also signed additional international contracts Sensor-Fuzed Weapons that we expect will support production at current levels for 2016. And we\u2019re gaining traction with some of our new product platforms such as the unmanned naval mine detection system for which we won an initial U.S. Navy contract on October.","At Industrial, our double-digit top line growth this year reflects our continuing investment in new products such as the new electric Bad Boy Recoil iS hunting vehicle and specialized vehicles and the DataScout 10G Ethernet Network Analyzer at Tools & Test.","Industrial growth was also the result of ongoing acquisitions which demonstrates our ability to leverage these businesses for growth and long-term shareholder value.","At Bell, we continued to improve our win rate in the commercial helicopter markets based on attractiveness of our new and upgraded products, our industry-leading aftermarket support and our expanding sales business around the world.","We\u2019re also winning on the military side as we were included among the finalist to proceed with our V-280 platform for the U.S. DOD future vertical program. We also made good progress with our cost structure as we compared to the ramp-down in military production of V-22.","Looking to 2015, Bell top line will down overall. But we expect commercial to grow based on what we\u2019re seeing in the customer pipeline and market opportunities for the year. We expect Bell to return to overall top line growth in 2016 and \u201817 with the introduction of the new 505 and 525 models.","Textron Aviation, we brought the Hawker, Beechcraft and Cessna brands under one roof allowing us to offer a much wider array of products and services to our customers significantly improving cost productivity.","Looking to 2015, we anticipate moderate growth driven by our strategy and the Beech acquisition. To finish with Textron\u2019s 2015 financial guidance, we\u2019re projecting revenues of about $14.4 billion with EPS from continuing operations in the range of $2.30 to $2.50. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions is expected to be in the range of $550 million to $650 million.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call to Frank.","Frank Connor","Thank you, Scott, and good morning everyone. Segment profit in the quarter was $398 million, up $91 million from the fourth quarter of 2013 on a $590 million increase in revenues.","Let\u2019s look at how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation. At Textron Aviation, revenues were up $597 million from this period last year, reflecting a $556 million impact from the Beechcraft acquisition, higher volumes and favorable mix. The segment had a profit of $130 million compared to $33 million at the Cessna segment a year ago. This reflected improved performance including the impact of the Beechcraft acquisition and favorable volume mix and pricing. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1.4 billion, approximately flat with the end of third quarter.","Moving to Bell, revenues were down $304 million, reflecting lower V-22 and commercial deliveries. Segment profit decreased $32 million from the fourth quarter in 2013, primarily reflecting the lower volumes, partially offset by favorable performance.","At Textron Systems, revenues were up $212 million, reflecting higher unmanned systems volumes and the impact of acquisitions partially offset by lower Marine and Land system volumes. Segment profit was up $10 million, reflecting the higher volumes.","Industrial revenues increased $89 million due to higher overall volumes and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Segment profit increased $13 million, reflecting favorable performance and the impact of higher volumes.","Finance segment revenues decreased $4 million and profit increased $3 million. Non-accrual accounts ended the quarter at $81 million, down $21 million from the end of the third quarter while 60 day delinquencies were $57 million, down $13 million in the quarter.","Moving below the segment profit line, corporate expenses were $58 million and our tax rate was 25.8%. The fourth quarter tax rate benefitted from the U.S. R&D tax credit law passed late in the quarter as well as increased profits in the international jurisdictions with lower tax rates.","Interest expense was $40 million, up from $27 million a year ago, primarily reflecting debt cost related to the Beechcraft acquisition financing. During the quarter, we issued $350 million in notes and an effective rate of 3.9% and implemented an early redemption of $350 million of the existing 6.2% notes that were coming due in March of this year.","We also repurchased 545,000 of our shares at an overall cost of about $21 million. For the full-year, we repurchased about 8.9 million shares at an overall cost of about $340 million.","At the end of the year, with $3.1 billion in total company net debt, with gross manufacturing debt of $2.8 billion, resulting in a year-end manufacturing debt to EBITDA multiple of about 2x.","The work we\u2019ve been doing over the past several years to strengthen our businesses and our balance sheet was recognized earlier this month by S&P with a credit rating upgrade to mid triple-B which is consistent with our targeted rating.","Turning now to our 2015 guidance, beginning with our segments on Slide 9, at Textron Aviation, we\u2019re expecting about 9% revenue growth, bringing revenues to about $5 billion, reflecting our new product strategy and the additional two-and-half months of revenue from the Beechcraft acquisition.","Segment margins are expected to be in range of 6.5% to 7.5%, about 200 basis points higher than 2014 at the midpoint. This includes 13 million in the remaining Beechcraft fair value step-up adjustments for 2015. At Bell, we expect overall revenues of about $4 billion, reflecting an approximate $600 million decline in military revenues, partially offset by higher commercial revenues with expected margins in the range of 11% to 12%.","At systems, we\u2019re estimating revenues of about $1.7 billion, approximately 5% higher than last year, primarily due to growth at Marine and Land and TRU Simulation and Training. Segment margins are expected to be in the range of 8.5% to 9.5%.","At Industrial, we\u2019re expecting solid growth in each of our businesses resulting in 8% segment revenue growth to about $3.6 billion with estimated margins in the range of 8.5% to 9%. At Finance, we are forecasting segment profit in the range of $10 million to $15 million.","Turning to Slide 10, we are estimating 2015 pension cost will be about $150 million, up from $128 million for 2014. This reflects a U.S. plan discount rate of 4.25%, 75 basis points lower than last year, the new mortality tables and the impact of the Beechcraft acquisition.","However, we estimate that the P&L impact is relatively neutral on a year-over-year basis. Turning to Slide 11, R&D is expected to be approximately $600 million, up from $556 million in 2014 representing approximately 4.2% sales. We\u2019re estimating CapEx will be about $475 million, up from last year\u2019s capital expenditure of $429 million reflecting our investment in new products and geographic expansion.","Moving below the segment line and looking at Slide 12, we\u2019re projecting about $175 million for corporate expense. 2015 interest expense is estimated at $135 million reflecting the favorable rate from our fourth quarter refinancing activity and lower interest cost related to the Beechcraft acquisition financings.","We\u2019re assuming a tax rate of about 30% and a flat share count of about 280 million shares reflecting share repurchase to offset dilution.","That concludes our prepared remarks. So, operator, we can open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Sam Pearlstein","Good morning.","Scott Donnelly","Good morning, Sam.","Sam Pearlstein","Can you talk about - I guess oil prices is just something - you talked about commercial helicopter growth, so I guess first piece is how is that affecting in Bell and then secondly, if you can talk a little bit about how that\u2019s impacting Caltech since I would presume you\u2019re going to get lower commodity cost but also have a little more FX situation there.","Scott Donnelly","So Sam, in terms of Bell, it\u2019s sort of at the margins. As you know, we probably are less than 10% of our commercial helicopters in the oil and gas market. Frankly, that\u2019s a number we\u2019d like to see higher. That\u2019s part of the rationality of the investment in the 525 because I do think over time that will continue to be a large market segment that we would like to participate in a bigger way.","But at this point, it\u2019s a fairly small piece. Most of our aircraft are in service in that market or still flying to a lot of the Gulf of Mexico rigs and things like that. So I think there\u2019s probably some softness in the exploration world but in terms of our customers operating the aircraft under contract of the existing operating rigs, we haven\u2019t seen really material change in that.","In terms of what it means from a commodity cost standpoint, most of the contracts that we have in the automotive world, we largely pass through increases and decreases on commodity, so I don\u2019t expect it to be a big swinger one way or the other.","Sam Pearlstein","Thanks. And then just if I could follow up, Bell in Aviation, if I look relative to what you said, revenues would look like back in October versus what they were now, seemed like a shift. Did any of that shift to 2015 or can you talk a little bit about what happened on the top line with those?","Scott Donnelly","So if you look at Bell, certainly the commercial market was softer than we expected earlier in the year and so that accounts for the bulk of the lower revenues at Bell. As I said earlier, I do expect to see some pick-up. There\u2019s not a specific thing in this story [ph] that carry over from quarter to quarter but there certainly are a number of opportunities in the marketplace that we feel we\u2019re likely to win that would help us see a slight uptake in commercial activity in 2015 versus 2014.","And then on the systems front, the big impact really for us on the year was the TAPV program which moved from 2014 to \u201815. And so we\u2019ll start deliveries of those systems in the latter part of this year.","Sam Pearlstein","Thank you.","Operator","Then we\u2019ll go to Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.","Robert Stallard","Thanks very much. Good morning.","Scott Donnelly","Good morning.","Robert Stallard","Scott, before, you said it looks like the business jet environment has turned a corner. Looking forward, how long will it probably require for you to see some decent order intake before you\u2019d start contemplating rate increases?","Scott Donnelly","Rob, we - obviously, this is something we kind of look at on a month-to-month basis. At this point, clearly, we - if the order rate did increase and things did get appreciatively stronger, we could make some adjustments that would increase our production rates in the latter part of the year. Still, at this point, but that\u2019s really something we look at on a month-to-month basis based on realized orders.","So it\u2019s certainly better as we said, the amount of activity. And the first quarter is never early in the year necessarily a strong time in terms of orders but the reality is a lot of the customer conversations and demos and activity that we saw in the latter part of last year led to good orders. It seems to be continuing into the first part of this year, so we definitely feel good about where it is versus a year ago but we\u2019ll probably delay here in terms of making any commitments to increase any kind of production rates until we see more of those orders actually fall into the backlog.","Robert Stallard","Thanks. And as a follow-up, one of your competitors decided to pause development of one of their models. Do you see this as specific to the model they\u2019re working on or reflective of the broader market?","Scott Donnelly","Well, Rob, I think it\u2019s the fact that this is a very competitive segment of the market and if you\u2019ve got to make calls in terms of your prioritization, it doesn\u2019t surprise me that that\u2019s the one that you would prioritize out.","Robert Stallard","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Then we\u2019ll go to Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason Gursky","Good morning, everyone.","Scott Donnelly","Good morning.","Jason Gursky","Scott, I was wondering if you could just talk about the portfolio, broadly speaking, and your view on the outlook for the need to add or subtract from the portfolio and your view on the acquisition outlook and pipeline going forward?","Scott Donnelly","Sure. Look, that\u2019s a very dynamic thing, right? I mean we\u2019re not - we sort of keep an eye out across all the businesses and look for opportunities that we think are deals that we can do, that we can make highly accretive and bring a lot of value and good leverage into the company. So clearly, if you look back at 2014, the Beechcraft deal was obviously a sizable deal.","There\u2019s not a lot of those kind of deals that are out there but that\u2019s one that we looked at and said we think we can acquire that, integrate it and make it be good for the customers and good for our shareholders. And I think that that worked, obviously, in a smaller way in terms of the magnitude of the size of the deals.","Over the last couple of years, the technologies of the world and the Sherman + Reilly\u2019s and the acquisitions of our simulator businesses, I think these are deals that have been good deals. And they\u2019re performing at or above our expectations and I think are bringing good value to the overall company.","So we\u2019ll kind of keep an eye out on all fronts. And we don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re under any pressure to have to go do any deal. I mean most of our focus on a day-to-day basis with our businesses is very organically focused and around developing new products. But if something comes along that looks like it makes sense, we\u2019ll always take a look.","Jason Gursky","Great. Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr","Yes. Thanks so much. So maybe you mentioned that you expect Latitude deliveries in the second half. My recollection is you were expecting them before mid-year. Has that slipped at all? And maybe also give us an update on your larger plane, the Longitude.","Scott Donnelly","Sure. So, Cai, I think we\u2019ve talked about certification that could happen here in the second quarter where I think we\u2019re still on track for that. The program is going very well. There\u2019ve been no issues, technical or otherwise. The aircraft is flying great. We\u2019re working our way through the test programs.","The search schedule seems to be going very well. But getting all the Ts crossed and the Is dotted and when that happens in the quarter, I think at this point, we\u2019d say that means that likely if you get a second quarter cert, you\u2019re probably going to have third quarter deliveries. So if things go really well, could we pull an aircraft or two into the quarter? That\u2019s, I guess, possible.","But at this point, our experience on getting through the final cert is - just getting through the paperwork process is not always easy, so we\u2019ll keep working hard. But the program is in great shape. It\u2019s going as we expected and we\u2019re really pleased with it.","So in terms of Longitude, that program is ramping up pretty significantly. Teams are actively working. We think we know what the configuration of the aircraft is based on a lot of work with customers and where we are. So you\u2019ll see that really started ramping up in the latter part of last year and through all this year.","Cai von Rumohr","Okay. And could you give us any more color on new products in the aviation sector? Like when is Longitude going to come and do you have any other introductions we might see in the next year?","Scott Donnelly","I think that we\u2019re prepared to announce it this time. I do think, Cai, that you will see a debut of the Longitude sometime in the not too distant future.","Cai von Rumohr","Got it, okay. Thank you very much.","Scott Donnelly","Sure.","Operator","Let\u2019s go to Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Noah Poponak","Hi, good morning, everyone.","Frank Connor","Good morning.","Scott Donnelly","Good morning.","Noah Poponak","Just going back to the topic of the polls [ph] you\u2019re keeping on Cessna production and the overall health of the business [share market]. Can you update us on whether or not lead times have extended for your customers since your October update or how far sold out you are and then what that number needs to be? I think in the past, you said, you wouldn\u2019t let a customer wait nine months just trying to see how close we are to getting to that point.","Scott Donnelly","Oh no, it\u2019s a tough question you\u2019re asking. It really does vary model by model. You know what I mean.","Frank Connor","Yes.","Scott Donnelly","We have somewhere - again we had customers that - some would have liked probably a fourth quarter delivery that is moved out in the first part of this year because we did get that sold out point on some of those aircraft.","But generally speaking, as I said, look, we\u2019d like to be in that six to nine months. Clearly, that\u2019s not where the business is right now. But some models are - some are fairly strong in the future quarters. And others you still have availability that\u2019s within the quarter.","Obviously when you talk about new products like the Latitude, there\u2019s order book on that but that\u2019s dated obviously by getting some certification in the first delivery. So it\u2019s --","Noah Poponak","Okay.","Scott Donnelly","I\u2019d still - as I said, I\u2019d love to see every model sitting in that six month or so timeframe. And they\u2019re not. But I think the momentum in that direction certainly has improved over the past six months.","Noah Poponak","But it sounds like that hasn\u2019t really - I mean I know it\u2019s a pretty short period of time but it sounds like that hasn\u2019t really extended from your third quarter update.","Scott Donnelly","It has on a couple of models.","Noah Poponak","Okay.","Scott Donnelly","But there are still some models that are available for sale within the quarter.","Noah Poponak","And do you have a projection for how many Latitudes you\u2019ll deliver this year?","Scott Donnelly","We don\u2019t.","Noah Poponak","Okay. And can I ask you that same question on Bell commercial units?","Scott Donnelly","So we\u2019re not putting a specific number out on the Bell commercial units. No, but I would say it would be sort of up modestly from the deliveries in 2014.","Noah Poponak","Okay.","Scott Donnelly","It\u2019s pretty much across the product line in terms different models.","Noah Poponak","Okay. And is anything improved there from an end market perspective or did you just get a little bit easier in comparison? Or has anything changed there?","Scott Donnelly","No, no, it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s a market that honestly, we don\u2019t really know what has driven a lot of the slowdown. But people have been a little slower to commit capital. But the deals are still being talked about, right. So it\u2019s not like we had back in the business yet days where things really just kind of came to an absolute screeching halt.","So we\u2019re certainly disappointed with the rate of order intake and sales in 2014. Opportunities are out there and discussions are happening. And I think there are still deals that are going to be done. And a lot of those I think for whatever reason, just appeared to have been delayed from \u201814. And I certainly don\u2019t think all of them are going to come through. But I think they\u2019ll - our expectation certainly is there will be more activity in \u201815 than we saw in \u201814.","Noah Poponak","Okay. Thanks very much.","Scott Donnelly","Sure.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Hi, good morning. Thanks. In terms of Textron aviation margins into 2015, just given your underlying margin rate was about 8% in the second half, how do we think about mix in price and R&D heading into next year?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I think, Sheila, we think about price next year as probably being very slightly improved from \u201814. Mix will probably be fairly similar. I mean we already shifted in \u201814 to sort of higher ASP, larger aircraft which we saw versus \u201813.","In terms of margin, we\u2019re expecting obviously to see good conversion on leverage. Don\u2019t forget we have almost a full first quarter of the Beech acquisition which was not in 2014. So there\u2019s almost a quarter of worth for the Beech acquisition that doesn\u2019t bring with that kind of increased leverage in terms of volume.","But to back that out, overall, I think we feel pretty good about where the margins are going. And we\u2019ll probably see mid-20s conversion on the stuff that\u2019s really true; volume growth in 2015 versus \u201814.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Got it. And then just on cash flow looking into \u201815 again. What are the working capital assumptions on that 550 to 650 guidance? And I guess, what are you assuming happens to inventories at Bell and Cessna?","Then just a quick follow up on that, the capital allocation question asked before. I think you had a small bolt-on in the interiors - for an interiors business in the aviation last week. Can you talk about how you\u2019re thinking about for \u201815 the allocation of buybacks versus additional deals?","Scott Donnelly","Okay. In terms of Bell, I mean we are - we\u2019re still going to see some pressure around a buildup of 505 and 525 as we get into the latter part of the year. So that will pressure somewhat some of our working capital on specifically at Bell.","In terms of the bolt-on deal, we had a - it was a UTX business that\u2019s been doing all the interiors for our aircrafts for some time. It\u2019s basically, almost entirely, our shop. I mean it really - they did a little bit of work for Bombardier. But most of the work was for Cessna and we thought we could try better productivity and better integration, frankly, with our manufacturing lines if it was something that we picked up.","And it\u2019s nice that they were interested in disposing out. So I think we came to good terms that were good for both companies and it gives us a little more control over what\u2019s the very important part of the customer experience in terms of the interiors of the aircraft. So it\u2019s a relatively small deal. But I think a good deal for us, both financially as well as just making it better integrated with our overall manufacturing operations for our aircraft.","In terms of the capital allocation, Sheila, we\u2019re continue to kind of focus on committing as a minimum stock buyback to prevent dilution of employee program and so we\u2019re committed to do that.","And as you know, we\u2019ll always keep an eye out for acquisition activity. And from a stock buyback standpoint, if we think there\u2019s optimistic points in time to the course of the year to do additional buybacks, then we\u2019ll certainly do that if we think it makes sense.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Great, thanks.","Scott Donnelly","Sure.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse, please go ahead.","Julian Mitchell","Thank you. Just a question on the balance sheet and the target leverage. I mean, I think, Frank, you had said that the rating you now have from the agency is what you\u2019re looking for. Where do you feel the kind of optimal leverage is? And I guess, second, back to Scott, when you talked about looking opportunistically on buyback or M&A, again what size of capacity do you think you have over the balance of this year to use that leverage?","Frank Connor","Yes. So from a leverage standpoint as I indicated, we\u2019re around the area that we\u2019re comfortable at. We think about it as 2x to 2.5x that EBITDA against manufacturing debt levels. And that\u2019s where we\u2019ve gotten into. So kind of we\u2019ll - they paid down a little bit more of the debt associated with the Beechcraft acquisitions here. But we\u2019re still pretty comfortable with our overall debt levels.","And I think in terms of acquisition capacity, it really obviously depends on the transaction. I think we demonstrated kind of that we had capacity with the Beechcraft acquisition obviously to do something that was meaningful for the corporation to do with all debt. And kind of bring it in, drive the synergies out of it, and deleverage relatively quickly some of that debt to our performance.","So it will very be deal-specific. But we don\u2019t feel like we are constrained relative to the types of things that we think about as being potentially available out there in the marketplace. And we would obviously finance anything appropriately to maintain the type of leverage levels that we\u2019re talking about in targeted rating categories.","Julian Mitchell","Thanks. And then for Scott just on Bell, the guidance for 2015. I think your guidance implies of the midpoint, the sort mid-high 20s, decremental margin. Maybe you have a little bit of color on how the fixed cost base at Bell, where you are of the reductions there.","And also the impact of the ERP rollout is on the margins in \u201815 and maybe further out please.","Scott Donnelly","So I think if you look at the cost activities, we\u2019ve taken some pretty major restructuring over the last year and a half or so to align the business with where we expect to be particularly driven by the known volume around B22. I think we\u2019re largely there. We\u2019re always going to continue to look at cost and further cost reduction programs.","So I think in terms of what we set out to do knowing what was going on with B22, we\u2019re there. Now obviously, we\u2019re going to continue to watch the commercial market. And any further softness or impact or not meeting expectations around commercial would lead us to do more on cost reduction. So I think we\u2019ve demonstrated that we can do what we need to do the structural cost of the business appropriately. And if volume further adjusts, then we\u2019ll further adjust cost.","Julian Mitchell","And just on the ERP, what\u2019s the effect on margins year-on-year is this year?","Scott Donnelly","So the ERP, the impact at this point is probably largely behind us. We did have a headwind, and obviously in 2014, as a result, a lot of the inventory that was built and cost that was inventoried through that process. So at this stage in the game, most of that is largely in line [ph]. The system is working. It continues to improve and I - it was a painful process but I think we ended up in a better place. So at this point, from an accounting standpoint, most of those headwinds associated with that really played itself out through 2014. So that helps us a bit as we head into 2015.","Julian Mitchell","Right. Thank you very much.","Scott Donnelly","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Nadol with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Joseph Nadol","Thanks. Good morning. Starting on Bell, the margin was quite strong and the quarter is better than it\u2019s been for a couple of years. Is that - kind of the ERP kind of wearing off? I would have thought that the mix in Q4 with V-22 coming down would hurt you a little bit but just looking sequentially, you had a good quarter.","Scott Donnelly","Well, I mean, it did, Joe. And clearly, the cross-reduction activity is working. We did start to see less of a drag, I suppose, of the ERP activity now. We did have somewhat prior deliveries of V-22s than we expect to see on a quarter-by-quarter basis going forward because we still had a little bit left of the original multiyear and then the last deliveries on the multiyear two. In general, I think what you saw was just strong performance by the business largely driven by the cost activities that they\u2019ve taken over the last couple of years.","Joseph Nadol","Okay. And then on the commercial front, just a push on that one more time because it does seem at odds with - in terms of the outlook for growth ops with what - that we\u2019ve seen from you guys, what we\u2019re hearing from you and also some of your competitors. Is this fleet bids that are out in the marketplace that give you some confidence? Is it one-off or twosies and threesies kind of small business orders? Is it U.S., is it international? Where are you seeing a pick-up in activity?","Scott Donnelly","It\u2019s sort of all of the above, Joe. I mean, obviously the fleet deals can move the needle on these things when you get a quantity buy. But it really is across the board. There\u2019s cases of two or three 412s here, two or three 412s there which are meaningful opportunities for us.","Joseph Nadol","Okay. And then, just finally, on the aviation margins front, a real bounce-back here, obviously. And you talked about some of the - we know some of the positives coming into 2015. You obviously beat your guidance in 2014 by a pretty significant amount. So if I were to pose it this way, what\u2019s going to prevent you from beating it by a couple of hundred basis points again in 2015? What are the pressures you\u2019re seeing? What would you say?","Scott Donnelly","Well, look, largely, the reason we had such an outperform on our - versus our guidance this year was that a lot of the synergies that we expected to get in the Beechcraft deal happened. And they happened quicker than we would have had in our plans. So we realized an awful lot of that into this year.","So there\u2019s clearly some knock-on benefit of that as we go into 2015. And as we\u2019ve said, there\u2019s other projects and programs this coming year, although, we tend to put the cost and the benefit sort of wash [ph] in 2015. But I think the team just - they beat because they got to the synergy levels, to that run rate faster than what was in the plan.","Joseph Nadol","Okay. All right, thank you.","Scott Donnelly","Sure, Joseph.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Mr. Sprague, your line is open. Check your mute button. We\u2019ll move on to Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Myles Walton","Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering, with respect to R&D in the slides, you pointed out - this might be more of a correction for Bell - or sorry, Beechcraft, the $556 million full-year R&D and I think if you go back last year, you expected to do about $490 million. Is the delta there Beechcraft or is it broader than that?","Scott Donnelly","No, it\u2019s largely driven by the - the original guidance didn\u2019t have the Beechcraft deal in there, so it\u2019s largely driven by Beechcraft incrementals.","Myles Walton","Okay. And the other clarification, I guess to Joe\u2019s question, maybe when you close out the multiyear on the V-22 in the quarter, did you have a significant positive EAC [ph] that helped the margins at Bell?","Scott Donnelly","We did have an EAC that reflected part of the wind-down of the multiyear. So --","Myles Walton","But it puts [indiscernible] trend over the last couple of quarters?","Scott Donnelly","I think if you look at the total EAC adjustments in the quarter, and obviously you\u2019ll see the data for the total business, that wasn\u2019t inconsistent really with a typical quarter for us.","Myles Walton","And then the last one. Within Cessna, the mature programs versus new programs, XLS, is that softness there mostly attributable to the coming of the Latitude? And what are you broadly seeing between mature and new programs in 2015 in terms of delivery mix?","Scott Donnelly","So I would say fairly balanced. I mean, obviously the Latitude will give us a little bit of an uptake on the new product front. XLS is not particularly soft. I think that\u2019s a market, if you look at those two aircrafts, you\u2019ve got a significant range difference with a Latitude of 2,700 versus an XLS at around, I want to say, 2,000 to 2,100. I\u2019m just going to go off memory here. And clearly a very different price point.","So it\u2019s - cabin size, range, all those things that generally drive differentiation between aircraft, there\u2019s a pretty big spread between an XLS and a Latitude in terms of its performance and cabin size, and as a result, correlation in price. So we really don\u2019t see the Latitude as eating into much of the XLS market segment.","Myles Walton","All right, thanks.","Scott Donnelly","Sure.","Operator","Our next question is from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.","George Shapiro","Yes. I wonder if you might break out - you said the book-to-bill at aviation was about 1. Scott, I was wondering if you could break out what it would have been if we took out the defense piece of Beech as well as the turboprop so we kind of just looked at the jet business.","Scott Donnelly","George, we\u2019re - the book to - all the backlog will be reported just as a single number. But to your point, there\u2019s going to be volatility, obviously, from quarter to quarter depending on what\u2019s going on in the market. And we had T-6 orders in the quarter for instance with Mexico which you saw but we also had T-6 sell [ph] in the quarter. So we\u2019re not going to break that number out. It\u2019s just going to be a single backlog number for the aviation segment.","George Shapiro","Okay. And then if I looked at the incremental margin and tried to make some estimates for what it would be just to Cessna by itself, Scott, it\u2019s probably around 50%. And if I look at your guidance for \u201815 between the high and the low, the incremental ranges from 21 to 33. So to your point, the midpoint is in the mid 20s. Can you walk through kind of the drivers for the 21 to 33 next year and what doesn\u2019t recur in this quarter with the - what looks like 50%? And I recognize part of it is I\u2019m taking out Beech and Beech is in your numbers for next year.","Scott Donnelly","Yes, George, I want to make sure I follow along. When we look at leverage on kind of incremental, which is how we generally look at it, we\u2019ve been kind of sitting on that - it was actually - it was pretty high from Q2 to Q3, it was a little lower from Q3 to Q4. And we always have, again, that volatility, we have more cost around SG&A in Q4 with the NBAAs, and again, a lot of ramp on the R&D side particularly on Longitude, obviously continue flight testing on Latitude.","So we kind of look at this on a total year-over-year basis, so if you look at our guidance for next year and you backed out the incrementals of the first quarter of Beechcraft, which is additive, I would say, as opposed to leverage, we still think and we\u2019ve always said that we\u2019re going to probably sit somewhere in that mid-20s of leverage on the volume. And it\u2019s pretty much across the whole product line. It\u2019s not particularly mix-sensitive. Our gross margins are pretty good across the whole line of products. So I think the midpoint of where we are looks at about a 25% leverage on that incremental volume on a year-over-year basis.","George Shapiro","Okay, thanks very much.","Scott Donnelly","Okay.","Operator","Let\u2019s go to Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Ron Epstein","Hey, Scott. Good morning, guys. Maybe changing gears just a little bit. Scott, there\u2019s been a bunch of press lately - not a bunch, but some press lately about potential Scorpion deals with the UAE, maybe even Nigeria. I was wondering if you can give us any color, broadly speaking, on what\u2019s going on with that program and international interest.","Scott Donnelly","So there is still significant international interest. We have conversations ongoing with several customers. There\u2019s starting to be some reasonable RFI and RFPs sort of formal activity of countries that are looking at replacing the exact kinds of aircraft that we anticipated this aircraft would address in terms of the market. So we feel pretty good about that part of the uptake obviously in R&D as we go into 2015 as we\u2019ve had a very successful series of flight test programs through 2014, some good customer demos and sort of debuted the aircraft at Farnborough and Riyadh.","We certainly expect that stuff to continue in 2015 and we\u2019ll be at a point now where we expect to be responding formally to some customers\u2019 RFPs. We are proceeding with the manufacturer of the first conforming aircraft so that we\u2019re ready to enter into certification testing. And so that\u2019s why you see a little bit - part of the increase in R&D from an overall company standpoint reflects our commitment to move forward on the program.","Ron Epstein","Okay, great. And then maybe just one more broad one on the biz jet market. Given some of the troubles that your competitor to the north has had, you\u2019ve seen the Lear 85 get paused, whatever that means, so that\u2019s, I guess, out of the market for a while. Have you seen much irrational competition given that there\u2019s some discussion that Bombardier needs to generate cash?","Scott Donnelly","Well, look, I mean our sales force will always tell you it\u2019s always the other guy that\u2019s being irrational. Of course, I mean this is just the nature of selling but yes, we think we\u2019ve seen some top [ph] pricing in some places. But frankly, over the last year or so, I would say there\u2019s been kind of a stabilization.","So each of the products that\u2019s out there in the marketplace has kind of achieved a price point and I think that\u2019s been pretty stable over the last year or so. We\u2019d like to see higher, obviously, but it\u2019s a competitive marketplace.","Ron Epstein","Okay, great. Thank you.","Scott Donnelly","Sure.","Operator","And our final question will come from Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.","Pete Skibitski","Good morning, guys. Scott, I just want to follow up on the Citation XLS again one more time. I mean deliveries went down pretty sharply this year especially the fourth quarter. Did that surprise you, I guess, is my question? And just directionally into 2015, are we at kind of a new lower level now or maybe is China going to help pick that up?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I mean we saw the first couple of XLSs into China obviously. I do think overall our year in \u201814 was skewed towards the new products like the new Sovereign Plus being out there, the X-Plus being out there and so I think that had clearly some influence to the market. But I would expect XLS Plus - again, the demand we see would - it should be pretty stable.","Pete Skibitski","Okay. And then just a last one. Could you give a sense of what sense the aftermarket grew in 2014 and 2015 expectations?","Scott Donnelly","Our aftermarket businesses are growing around mid single-digits and I would expect that that\u2019s where they\u2019ll continue to be.","Pete Skibitski","Okay, thank you.","Scott Donnelly","Sure.","Doug Wilburne","Okay, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us. And, Gail, if you\u2019ll share the replay information, we\u2019d appreciate that. Good day.","Operator","And, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being made available for replay after 10 am Eastern time today through April 27th at midnight.

Welcome to the Textron Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Eric Salander. Please go ahead.","Eric Salander","Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone.","Before we begin, I would like to mention, we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release.","On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.","Textron revenues in the quarter were $3.8 billion, down $267 million from last year. During this year's fourth quarter, we recorded $73 million in pre-tax restricting charges or $0.23 per share after tax and other onetime favorable adjustments of $0.10 per share after tax. Excluding these adjustments, adjusted income from continuing operations was $1.15 per share, up $0.41 from last year's fourth quarter.","Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $284 million compared to $477 million in last year's fourth quarter. For the full-year, revenues were $14 billion, down 2% from a year ago.","Adjusted income from continuing operations was $3.34 per share compared to $2.45 last year. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $784 million, down from $872 million last year.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Donnelly","Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everybody.","Q4 was a very strong quarter. Despite low revenues, margins were up, driven by strong execution in our businesses with year-over-year in op growth of 10% and 160 basis points of margin improvement.","At Bell, execution remains strong despite lower revenues from military volumes in the quarter. On the commercial side, we delivered 46 helicopters, up from 45 in last year's fourth quarter. In the quarter, we achieved, both FAA and the asset certification of 407GXi, which offers next-generation pilot experience, connectivity, precision navigation, and enhanced engine controls.","Also in the quarter, Bell 505 Jet Ranger X fleet reached 10,000 flight hours worldwide, achieving the milestone in less than two years since entering service. In December, the Sacramento Police Department became the first police agency to take delivery of the law enforcement-configured 505, continuing to demonstrate the mission versatility of the aircraft.","On the military side that was awarded $188 million for five additional V-22s as part of the Multiyear III contract modification. That also received a multiyear contract to provide logistics and repair services for the U.S. Navy and Air Force\u2019s V-22 fleets with $277 million in backlog for year one and options for an additional two years.","Also in the quarter, the Royal Bahraini Air Force announced an order for 12 AH-1Z Viper attack helicopters at a ceremony at November\u2019s Bahrain air show. This is one of many foreign military opportunities for the H1 platform that we're continuing to pursue.","On the new product front, Bell marked the anniversary of the V-280\u2019s first flight in December. Since its first flight one year ago, the V-280 has completed over 80 flight hours and has now exceeded 280 knots true airspeed with in-flight transitions between cruise mode and vertical takeoff and landing. We're excited to continue demonstrating the agility, maneuverability, and operational readiness of this innovative and technically advanced aircraft.","At Systems, revenues were down on lower TAPV delivers at Textron Marine & Land Systems and lower volume at Unmanned Systems. In the quarter, Textron Marine & Land Systems received $314 million contract modification in support of the U.S. Navy Ship-to-Shore Connector program for the procurement of long lead material on the first production lot.","We continue to make progress on the current engineering and manufacturing development contract with first two craft in test with deliveries anticipated this year. Also in the quarter, Textron Systems received $152 million multi-year contract to provide Shadow Tactical UAS contractor logistics support, aircraft production and ground control equipment through mid-2020. Textron Systems also was awarded a multiyear contract from NAVAIR for upto $401 million to conduct intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance services with Aerosonde unmanned air vehicle.","Moving to Industrial, revenues were lower in the quarter, primarily reflecting the disposition of the Tools & Test business. This week, Textron Specialized Vehicles announced a partnership with Bass Pro Shops and Tracker Marine, to launch a line of Tracker Off Road brand in side-by-sides and ATVs. Bass Pro Shops is the world's leading outdoor retailer with a network of nearly 200 destination retail stores and 575 independent Tracker Marine dealers. Combination of Tracker\u2019s brand strength and established dealer network and our own expertise in designing and manufacturing, advanced powersports products will provide us the foundation necessary to accelerate our growth in this industry.","At Textron GSE, our ground support business received an order for 56 TUG tow tractors from Envoy Air, the largest regional carrier for American Airlines. 2018, we saw growth in revenue and operating margin at Textron GSE and expect to see this trend continue in 2019. Also in the quarter, Kautex won a contract for its first hybrid fuel system with the Renault Nissan Mitsubishi Alliance in Japan as Kautex continues to grow in the plug-in hybrid electric vehicle segment.","Moving to Textron Aviation, revenues were up $1.6 billion, up 12%. In the quarter, we delivered 63 jets, up from 58 last year; and 67 commercial turboprops, up from 45 in last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, we delivered 188 jets, up from last year\u2019s 180; and 186 commercial turboprops, up from 155 last year. We continue to see strong orders across Citation business jet portfolio, which resulted in quarterly order growth, both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis in each quarter of the year.","On the new product front, the Citation Longitude received its provisional type certification in the quarter, allowing operators to begin flight training in preparation for deliveries in 2019 as we prepare for final type certification.","To sum up, 2018 was a strong year for our businesses. We continued our strategy of investing in new products and leveraging operations to drive earnings growth and margin expansion across Aviation, Bell and Systems while returning significant capital to shareholders. While we're disciplined in our Industrial results due to performance of our specialized vehicle business, we\u2019ve implemented a number of changes, we made several leadership changes, rationalized product lines, reduced the manufacturing footprint, implemented a cost reduction program and launched a new distribution partnership for our powersports product, all of which we expect will position the business for success going forward.","Looking across all the segments, we have many other items to highlight. At Bell, we received significant procurement contracts on key V-22 and H-1 platforms from our U.S. customer. We also opened our new Advanced Vertical Lift Center in Arlington, Virginia allowing Bell\u2019s military customers, partners and policymakers to gain exposure to our technology for the future vertical lift including V-280 and unmanned V-247.","On the commercial side, we continue to see an increased demand across the portfolio. We delivered 192 commercial helicopters in 2018, up from 132 a year ago as our customers continue to acquire our aircraft for a variety of missions. For 2019, we'll continue to ramp production of the 505, and we're increasing production rates on other models based upon increased customer demand.","At Textron systems, we continue to see good progress including follow-on orders for our unmanned surface vessel, additional fee-for-service task orders with Unmanned Systems and the award of procurement contracts being ramped with U.S. Navy Ship-to-Shore Connector production program. We also announced our intent to form a joint venture between TRU Simulation and Training and FlightSafety International to better serve our Textron Aviation customers.","Textron Aviation experienced improved jet order intake throughout the year. For the second consecutive year, the Latitude earned the title of the Most Delivered Business Jets in the Midsize Category, while the Longitude successfully circumnavigated the globe, demonstrating its commanding performance and reliability to customer along the way. We announced the expanded relationship between the Textron Aviation and NetJets, reaching agreement to purchase 175 Longitudes and 150 Hemispheres. Success of these platforms demonstrates the importance of new product introductions in this competitive segment.","On the new product front, we advanced our two new turboprop programs, unveiling a full-scale mockup of the SkyCourier and NBAA, and a full-scale mockup for the Denali of Experimental Aircraft Aviation show. Both aircraft continue to make good progress and are expected to make their first flights in 2019.","With these accomplishments behind us, we're well-positioned coming into the year. As we look at Textron's 2019 financial guidance, we're projecting revenues of about $14 billion. At Bell, we\u2019re expecting strong execution again in 2019 with flat revenues of lower V-22 production is offset by higher commercial volumes. At Systems, 2019 is an important transition year as we move the Ship-to-Shore program from development to production.","At Industrial, we expect better execution in our specialized vehicle business to drive improved profitability. At Aviation, we're projecting continued growth on increased aircraft deliveries across the portfolio, including the Longitude and a double-digit operating margin in 2019. We're projecting EPS from continuing operations in the range of $3.55 to $3.75 per share and manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions to be in the range of $700 million to $800 million.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank.","Frank Connor","Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone.","Segment profit in the quarter was $397 million, up $37 million from the fourth quarter of 2017 on a $267 million decrease in revenue. Let's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation. At Textron Aviation, revenues of $1.6 billion were up 12% from this period last year due to higher volume and mix across the jet and commercial turboprop product lines as well as favorable pricing.","Segment profit was $170 million, up from $120 million a year ago due to higher volumes and favorable pricing. Operating margin at this segment was 11%, up 240 basis points from last year. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1.8 billion, about flat from the end of the third quarter.","Looking to Bell, revenues were $827 million, down from $983 million last year, primarily on lower military volume. Segment profit of $108 million was down $6 million, largely on lower military volume, partially offset by favorable performance. Operating margin at the segment was 13.1%, up 150 basis points from last year. Backlog in this segment was $5.8 billion at the end of the quarter, up $100 million from the end of the third quarter.","At Textron Systems, revenues were $345 million, down from $489 million a year ago, reflecting lower TAPV deliveries at Textron Marine & Land Systems and lower Unmanned Systems volume. Segment profit of $37 million was flat with last year's fourth quarter, with lower volume and mix offset by favorable performance.","Operating margin at the segment was 10.7%, up 310 basis points from last year. Backlog in the segment was $1.5 billion, up about $300 million from the end of the third quarter. Industrial revenues were $1 billion, down 12%, largely related to the disposition of our Tools & Test product line. Segment profit was $73 million, down $10 million from the fourth quarter last year, largely due to the impact from the disposition. Favorable performance reflecting a positive impact of $17 million related to patent infringement matter was offset by inflation and mix. Operating margin at the segment was 7.2%, about flat with last year. Finance segment revenues increased $3 million and profit increased $3 million.","Moving below segment profit. Corporate expenses were $12 million, down $32 million from last year's fourth quarter, largely due to lower stock-based compensation expense. Interest expense was $34 million, a decrease of $4 million compared to last year. With respect to our restructuring plan, we recorded pre-tax charges of $73 million on the special charges line in the quarter. We ended the year with manufacturing debt of $3.1 billion. For the full-year, we repurchased approximately 29 million shares at an overall cost of about $1.8 billion. ","Turning now to our 2019 outlook, I'll begin with our segments on slide nine of the earnings call presentation. At Textron Aviation, we're expecting revenues of about $5.5 billion, reflecting higher volumes across our commercial product lines. Segment margin is expected to be approximately 10%, reflecting higher volume and improved performance. Looking to Bell, we expect overall revenues will be flat at about $3.2 billion, reflecting lower military volumes, offset by higher commercial volumes. We\u2019re forecasting a margin of about 12.5%.","At Systems, we\u2019re estimating lower 2019 revenues of about $1.4 billion, reflecting lower volumes at Textron Marine & Land Systems and Unmanned Systems. Segment margin is expected to be about 9%. At Industrial, we're expecting segment revenue of about $3.8 billion and a margin of about 7%. At Finance, we\u2019re forecasting segment profit of about $20 million.","Turning to slide 10, based on the U.S. planned discount rate of 4.35%, we\u2019re estimating 2019 pension income to be about $10 million versus pension cost of about $33 million last year.","Turning to slide 11, R&D is expected to be about $620 million, down from $643 million in 2018. We're estimating CapEx will be about $380 million, up from $369 million last year.","Moving below the segment line and looking at like 12, we're projecting about $140 million for corporate expense, a $145 million for interest expense, and a full-year effective tax rate of about 20%. Our outlook assumes an average share count of about 233 million shares as we continue to deploy the majority of our free cash flow toward share repurchase in 2019.","That concludes our prepared remarks. So, Greg, we can open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Baird. Please go ahead.","Peter Arment","I guess, a question on Bell. Frank, you mentioned the 12.5% margins. That's a little better than I think we were expecting. Is there any differences on the first half versus second half just based on the cadence of your volume?","Frank Connor","In the outlook side of things?","Peter Arment","Yes. I mean, outlook, yes. Thank you, Frank.","Frank Connor","Yes. No, it'll be, kind of -- well, we don't expect a lot of quarter-to-quarter variation except for obviously kind of we do see differences depending on program review. So, there's no kind of significant mix issue associated with quarter-to-quarter, but it all depend on the program review.","Peter Arment","Okay. If I could squeeze one more, just on -- I don\u2019t know if I missed this Scott in your preamble. Did you mention what a total delivery number will be for Aviation for the year?","Scott Donnelly","No. Peter, we don't give that. We just gave -- I mean obviously the increase of about $0.5 billion in terms of total revenue, but not a breakdown by exact numbers of aircraft.","Peter Arment","Okay, appreciate it. Thank you.","Scott Donnelly","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Ron Epstein","With the volatility we saw in December, and it seems to be continuing a little bit into this year and all the concerns about global growth. Have you seen to have any impact on I guess broadly, any of your businesses but most specifically at Textron Aviation?","Scott Donnelly","No, we're really haven't, Ron. I mean, obviously we have -- I mean, I certainly appreciate the volatility going on in the stock markets. But, I would say that the sense we get from most of our customers is the underlying economy is still in good shape. And even if you have a little bit lower growth, there is -- still things are in a good place for their businesses. And I guess, from a pure technical standpoint, to have a book-to-bill that's pretty much right at 1, slightly over 1 in the fourth quarter is a pretty strong sign of continued strong order flows. So, we certainly didn't see it reflect in the actual orders that were taken, and in terms of the sense of customers and activity that's still ongoing, still getting very positive feedback from our sales teams.","Ron Epstein","Okay, great. And then, it seems like at Bell, that favorable performance is a theme. But, when we -- and I think we\u2019ve talked about this a bit in the past. When we think about 2019, how do we think about call it, the positive estimates of completion in the defense contracts at Bell when we think about modeling it this year?","Scott Donnelly","I think we're -- the guidance actually is down a little bit from what we achieved this year. And I'd say, the primary driver of that is that when you round out, we'll finish up a lot of the Multiyear II contracts. As you get towards the end of that you have some management reserve and performance that you're able to release. We'll see a little bit less of that in 2019 because we'll be really transitioning at that point into Multiyear III contract in terms of our cost and therefore revenues. But it's still I think quite strong performance, and 12.5% margin rate delivered by those guys is just showing they're running the business really well, even while investing in some important new things, like the V-280s of the world, so.","Ron Epstein","Got you. And then maybe one last one on Scorpion. Anything new going on there? If you could just update us on that?","Scott Donnelly","No, there's not. I mean, I'm sure you guys have seen the sort of press articles and whatnot around the future of light attack. And frankly, we read all these things too. We're not entirely sure where all that's going, but I'm sure we'll see more clearly what's happening here in the coming few months.","Ron Epstein","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead. ","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Congratulations on a good quarter. I think this is the first 11% Aviation margin you've had since 2009. Just on that, can you talk about the entrance of the Longitude coming into the market, and how you're thinking about 100 basis points of improvement within Aviation for 2019?","Scott Donnelly","I think when you look at the growth, obviously a big chunk of the growth in revenue we'll see year-over-year, Sheila, is tied into the Longitude. The aircraft is in, I think, a very good place. The production line is rolling. We've actually tweaked production up just a touch because obviously, with the NetJets announcement, they'll start taking deliveries in the latter part of next year. Retail demand is also strong. So, obviously, we'll see the first few will have some dilution from our normal margin right here at the beginning of the year. But in terms of the production line and the cost and what we're seeing, we think we're going to have a product that hits the market in terms of performance and cost, and the demand seems strong in the market. So, we're pretty excited about it.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","And then on Industrial, maybe can you provide an update on where you are with the restructuring? What the size of the specialized vehicle business look like? Your spot in it with this progress on the dealer channel and the product update?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I think the actions that we took in the fourth quarter were largely around sort of addressing some of the cost issues, adjusting some of the product portfolio, frankly some of that on the curbside, a couple of product lines that we chose to exit. We just didn't see that that was going to be a long-term profitable business for in some of those particular product lines. So, we exited some of those things. So, between the cost and some of the portfolio and manufacturing footprint rationalization that largely happened in the fourth quarter. We'll see a little of that trickle here into the first quarter, but most of it is behind us. So, I think that the team has a very good plan and is executing quite well in terms of getting our arms around the operational side.","Obviously, the other thing, which we've talked about in the past, is something that would be a more difficult thing. Something that takes longer to build out is the distribution and addressing that side of it. This partnership that we announced with Bass Pro and Tracker is obviously something we're very excited about. Building out a distribution and a strong retail channel is quite difficult, so the opportunity to partner with the guy that's the best in the world at that, I think, will be a great thing for the business in that mid- to longer term. So we're obviously, working very closely with them right now on the rollout of product into that channel. So as we look at 2019, I think we're in a -- we're obviously, in a much, much better place than where we were. So I think what the team is focused on, our operations and now growing out the new distribution channel, will be resulting in delivering a good year, I think, and then with good momentum going into 2020 and beyond.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Great. Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss from Barclays. Please go ahead. ","David Strauss","Thanks good morning.","Scott Donnelly","Good morning.","David Strauss","When you touched on the cash guidance, it looks like 2018 on a cash flow from ops came in a little bit light. I was thinking that has something to do with the delays in the Longitude and maybe some inventory build there. But it looks like you're assuming a still a pretty significant drag from a working capital perspective in \u201819.","Frank Connor","No, I mean, cash flow was kind of in line for '18 with kind of where we expected. We had some puts and takes, obviously. Kind of some of the performance specialized vehicles put a little bit of pressure on cash. But other -- the businesses did really well. We talked about one of the things that has been going on is there is a change in payment terms as we move from Multiyear II to Multiyear III, where we get less cash relative to percentage complete or kind of effort as we go forward. So we are seeing a little bit of drag on cash associated with that. Saw a little bit in '18, see a little bit more of that in '19 that is putting some kind of pressure overall on cash flow. But it's not a working capital issue. It's a timing of payments from the government on military programs. It's creating a little bit of drag.","David Strauss","Okay. And Scott, on Cessna, I think in '18 you talked about rather than taking production rates up, your kind of tweaking at the margin, getting a couple of extra airplanes off of a couple of different lines. Have you -- did you actually take rates up in \u201818 or are you taking rates up again in '19? I'm talking everything ex Longitude.","Scott Donnelly","Okay, but I mean it's a process that's sort of a continuous process, right. We don't kind of have a magic date where we decide that. But I guess, I would say that as we've seen the demands continuing to strengthen in 2018, we did make a decision -- again, ex Longitude, to take up some of those rates. So I think whether you're looking at Latitudes, CJ4s, I mean, it's in sort of across the range. Based on that demand, we have been increasing the flow rate in those lines as we worked our way through '18 with, obviously, expectations we'll see some higher deliveries of each of those models in 2019.","David Strauss","All right, thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Vertical Research. Please go ahead. ","Robert Stallard","Scott, a couple of quick ones. First of all, has the government shutdown had any impact on your business, particularly with the FAA clearance of the Longitude?","Scott Donnelly","Not yet, I would say, Robert. So we -- on the document front, which is really where we are on Longitude and have been for a while, the teams continue to do their work. The good news is that virtually all those documents are delegated to us, so that work is continuing unimpeded by the FAA guys not being in. When we finish all that, which is not too far down the line here, obviously, FAA has to issue that final type certification. And that is something -- I mean, we're obviously, we're not delegated to do that. So I would say in the next month, no, it doesn't have an effect on us. But we will reach a point here where we will need the FAA to issue the type certification.","Robert Stallard","Okay. And then secondly, in Industrial. There's been some nerves about what's going on in the automotive market. I'm wondering what you've seen at Kautex in the last 3 months. And what your expectations are there for 2019?","Scott Donnelly ","Well, I think we saw some softness on OEMs, generally speaking, around the world in 2018. And we work all of our forecasting off IHS data, so I mean we're not an independent forecaster of the automotive market. And those are the numbers will indicate some softening globally, and those are the numbers that are baked into the guidance that we gave you guys.","Robert Stallard"," Okay. That's great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Seth Seifman","Thanks very much and good morning. Just to kind of bring together a couple of other questions about Industrial. When we peel back the onion, and we look at the guidance you've given, are you assuming earnings growth at Kautex in 2019, or is a lot of what we're seeing in terms of the, I would say, relatively strong margin you're expecting there coming on the specialized vehicle side?","Scott Donnelly ","I would say the automotive side, we expect sort of flattish. And that's, again, based on IHS data. We do have some new product launches, which is helpful to us to offset some of the overall softness. But net, I would say it's relatively flattish on the automotive side of things. So not sure we would give a whole lot more color to it. I think their margin rates should be fine. Most of the margin improvement, obviously, on a year-over-year basis is driven by much better performance coming out of the specialized vehicles side of the Industrial segment.","Seth Seifman","And then when you look at the R&D forecast for this year and looking kind of down, I guess, about $25 million or so. But when you look at the different moving pieces within our R&D, is there anything that's kind of shifting around significantly in terms of where your -- where the investment is going?","Scott Donnelly ","No, there aren't big shifts. I mean, we did overspend R&D this year beyond our initial forecast, and also that was aviation really just because of the magnitude of the documentation task on the Longitude side. So obviously, we've had a lot of engineers -- a lot more engineering effort going into that here in the last 6 months than we would ever have expected. But that's obviously behind us and we expensed that as we went through the third and the fourth quarter. And we're expecting to wrap that up here pretty shortly. So that's -- there's no major shifts, I'd say, from business to business. It's just some overspend here. It's been a bigger task than we expected to get through the Longitude cert.","Seth Seifman"," Okay, thanks very much. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski from Alembic Global. Please go ahead. ","Pete Skibitski","Good morning guys. Hey, Scott, wondering how the snow season has started off for TSV. Has that contributed to the fourth quarter margin? And I just want to get a sense, do you still have a lot of kind excess dirt inventory in the channel, or is that gone at this point?","Scott Donnelly ","Well, I'd say the snow season has been okay. I mean, it's been spotty in different areas. I think in the mountainside, particularly this year as we've launched this Alpha One. That thing has been a very hot, top-selling snowmobile. So that stuff has moved very, very nicely. There's been other parts of the country where snow has been a little bit slower, so I'd say it's sort of an average year maybe.","On the dirt side, because we discussed in the third quarter, there was too much inventory out there. We've been working through that. And -- I mean, it's still there but it's -- but it goes down every week.","Pete Skibitski","Okay, great. And then just one thing I'm not clear on. The -- you got the provisional certification for the Longitude. Did you book some revenue in the fourth quarter on the Longitude?","Scott Donnelly ","No.","Pete Skibitski","You didn\u2019t?","Scott Donnelly ","No, we did not. We did not transfer title of any aircraft. It just gave the ability for those aircraft to be available to use if needed for pilot training. I mean, we're actually doing a fair bit of that and using our own experimental aircraft to help with that. But it will allow the -- those customers to use the aircraft. And there were also some programs -- international programs and special missions where you had to demonstrate to them sort of a completion of at least the flight testing phase, which we're able to do. So -- but no, we did not transfer any title nor take any revenue recognition on those aircraft.","Pete Skibitski","And then the first quarter, if we -- the shutdown continues and you don't get the full cert in the first quarter, do you expect to book any revenue there just on title transfer?","Scott Donnelly ","No, no. If we're not able to get the final cert, we wouldn't be able to do that.","Pete Skibitski","Okay. Thanks for the clarification. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Raviv from Citi. Please go ahead. ","Jon Raviv","On aviation margin, this one, can you dig a little bit more into some of the drivers of the improvement in 2019? From volume? I know you've made some manufacturing improvements, maybe pricing as well.","Scott Donnelly ","Oh, absolutely. No, we continue to see price improvement, so it's sort of all of the above, right. I mean, we had some benefits, obviously, to volume. I think the factories and efficiencies and productivity, the team is doing a terrific job of that. And if you look at price improvement again in the quarter, it was consistent with all we've been -- I'm talking about all year. We continue to see price ahead of inflation, and that's also contributing to the higher margin rate.","Jon Raviv","And any perspective on how much more room there might be to run in terms of that margin? I know we talked about reaching for double digit previously. Here we are in 2019. Going beyond these things, is there business for normalized -- more normalized margin for aviation longer term?","Scott Donnelly","Like I said, we're only probably going to guide one year at a time here for sure. We're working obviously hard to continue to drive that margin. We certainly see 2019 as getting this thing back up into the double-digit number for the full year. And so, you would expect to see -- and I think you will see incremental margins on a year-over-year basis as we go through each of the quarters and have a total year where we get a nice 100 basis points or more margin expansion for the business. And again, that's driven by having some good volume of good gross margin product coming through, ongoing efficiency and productivity. And we are continuing to drive price. I mean, you will probably see a little bit better volume here in the legacy models, but that's also with a little bit of price benefit as well.","Jon Raviv","Okay. So, no 2025 guidance, Scott? ","Scott Donnelly","Not just yet.","Jon Raviv","Okay, all right.","Scott Donnelly","But, we'll think about it.","Jon Raviv","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.","George Shapiro","Yes, good morning. And I apologize if these questions are duplicate because I've had no power here. My cell service is spotty.","Scott Donnelly","That\u2019s all right, George.","George Shapiro","Scott, could you comment on the Aviation through the quarter? I mean, there was some rumors that December slowed. I was wondering if you saw that and how you're seeing things into January as well.","Scott Donnelly","No, George, we did not see that. And I did comment earlier. We saw a book-to-bill at 1 to 1 in the fourth quarter which, for the heaviest delivery quarter of the year, is something that we would not normally expect to see. And I think that just reflects that we're continuing to see good demand in the marketplace. Our sales teams are still feeling good about where things are. There's still an awful lot of customer activity, and it's fairly broadly across the product portfolio. It's Longitude, it's Latitudes, Sovereigns, CJs. I mean, it's a -- I think it's a -- we continue to see a pretty strong market. The use available of any kind of newer aircraft continues to be at extraordinarily low levels. Those aircraft move fairly quickly. It's a healthy market right now.","George Shapiro","And then a question maybe for Frank. The Industrial revenue guide for '19 seems a little bit low. I mean, Tools & Test is in a full year that you had -- that you're backing out here. Is that lower Kautex revenues here, assuming even though you said flattish profits, or is it SPV less? If you'd give a little bit more color on that.","Frank Connor","I think as -- well, there's about $250 million of revenue kind of from Tools & Test. So that's obviously a pretty meaningful headwind of coming output. As Scott mentioned earlier, kind of at Kautex, we -- based on the IHS data, we expect kind of flattish type of numbers. And as we look at the specialized vehicle business, obviously, we're focused on performance, improved profitability there. We've taken some restructuring actions to actually kind of get out of a few product lines. So that's putting a little bit of headwind on things. And we're just, therefore, planning relatively flattish when you look at all that. But where the focus is on performance of specialized vehicle, without a lot of top line growth.","George Shapiro","And then one last one. The CapEx number, I mean, you wound up a lot lower in '18 than you thought earlier in the year, and you're continuing that trend this year. I mean, what polar ends there that you actually cut out to get the much lower numbers?","Scott Donnelly ","George, I think there was some lower CapEx spending in pursuit of some of these military programs for providing [red error] aggressive forces. A proposal for the big one has already been submitted. We expect to find out if we're on that IDIQ list sometime in the mid part of the year. And so that's, I mean, that's a business where you need to make the investment in the assets to provide the service. So we're in that today. It's a great business. We performed well, and we've seen some increase in the hours of our existing customers. Team is doing a great job executing on that. But what we were trying to do is, to the extent we can, obviously, is gate the capital expenditures with the revenue-generating opportunity. So we certainly slowed some of that from '18 into '19.","George Shapiro","Okay, very good. Thanks very much. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Noah Poponak","Hey good morning everyone. ","Scott Donnelly ","Good morning. ","Noah Poponak","Frank, I know you spoke to the cash flow a little bit in the prior question. But I was just wondering if it's possible to just sort of bridge the handful of major components in the '19 outlook, growing the EBIT and the earnings, but the cash flow being relatively flat.","Frank Connor","Well, again, no, I don't know how to -- we can take it offline to give you a little bit more color on things. But again, we -- we're not looking at a inventory build or a working capital build. There are changes in the pace of the cash receipt for effort completed on the military side. And so that's the big one. It's still pretty good cash conversion, solid cash conversion off of the after-tax earnings that we're looking at. So there is not any kind of a big change in cash relative to after-tax earnings. And then that pressure on it relative to kind of the rate that we saw in '18 does reflect those slower paces of military bids.","Noah Poponak","Okay. So that's the bigger piece. ","Frank Connor","That is the piece. ","Scott Donnelly ","That is the piece, Noah. I mean, if you look at the -- that would -- everything else is sort of bounces around off there. It's really the change in the -- going from sort of these performance-based payments to the way the how are things are done in Multiyear III.","Noah Poponak","And then in the Bell revenue, I guess, where is -- if you can tell us where V-22 is in 2019 relative to the reset that's occurring there, just so we can have the right kind of medium-term trajectory going forward? And then on the commercial side, I know you said higher units. Wasn't sure if you could quantify that and just sort of -- maybe a little bit of a state of the market there just given the fuel price volatility.","Scott Donnelly ","Well, I can address the color, I guess, on the commercial side. We do expect units to be up pretty materially next year. 505 continues to ramp, so we'll see some benefit there in terms of additional 505 units. But as we talked about kind of late last year, we have tweaked the production volumes of most of the other product lines as well. So we expect to see stronger deliveries in 407s, 429s, 412. And we're -- it's -- the magnitude varies across all the pieces of the product line, if you will, Noah. But it's certainly -- the demand environment on the commercial side is -- remains strong and has given us a little bit of tailwind on each of the models. In terms of V-22, I mean, not sure you're looking for revenue because it doesn't -- as you know, it doesn't tie up easily to unit deliveries anymore. So, you kind of...","Noah Poponak","That's why I was sort of even -- I guess what I was asking is how much lower does the revenue contribution go as it's resetting to the next multiyear?","Scott Donnelly ","I'm not sure. I'm not sure I can say much more than lower. I mean it is lower. Obviously, the -- if you look at Multiyear III coming on, the annualized delivery rates are lower, and so as you can imagine, the cost incurred under the revenue accounting is also lower. I don't know if we could give out the exact number.","Frank Connor","We're seeing pressure on the production side. We are seeing benefit of a larger fleet and kind of flight activity on the support side. So there is some offset to the lower production. It helps things as the fleet continues to grow. But kind of overall, as we transition into Multiyear III, as we talked about, there is pressure on V-22.","Scott Donnelly ","Okay. I can stick with my estimate of. ","Noah Poponak","All right. Thanks very much. ","Operator","Your next question comes from a line of David Strauss from Barclays. Please go ahead. ","David Strauss","In terms of the backlog now at aviation, do you have any NetJets Longitude orders in the backlog?","Scott Donnelly ","We do. Yes. I mean, David, the way we do this is -- and we've always done this with Latitude, is we basically, as we firm up and commit the tail numbers and firm deposits on those aircraft, we move them into backlog. So it's usually about kind of a rolling 1-year look. And as their first deliveries will be in that Q3, Q4 time frame next year, those -- they firm those units up and deposits, and so they're in the backlog. So we had the NetJets units went into backlog. And we also had obviously, retail units going to the backlog in Q4 as well.","David Strauss","And then on systems, down a little bit again in 2019 relative to 2018. Given the programs there, what's your -- is your expectation in '19 represents the bottom? And systems will grow in 2020?","Scott Donnelly ","No. Look, David, I expect so, right. I mean, we have -- as Frank said, the revenues are slightly lower forecast in '19. Principally came out less in terms of the TAPV program. The vehicle deliveries out of Slidell are done. So I mean, there is the support and service, but the unit deliveries are essentially behind us, so we'll see lower revenues associated with that program in 2019, which is fine. We have -- we do have some lower volume in the -- particularly on the Shadow Unmanned programs. We have increased volume on the fee-for-service that kind of offsets some of that. But I think if you look out into the 2020 time frame, we will start to see some revenue in 2019 associated with the long-lead procurements on the Ship-to-Shore production program. But we certainly expect to see that program definitized here in the first half of the year, and you'll start to see increased -- pretty significant increase in revenue as we go into 2020 on the Ship-to-Shore program. Then there's a number of other programs, which I think we have a good chance of adding into the backlog for systems as we work our way through 2019.","David Strauss","And Frank, just a quick follow-up for you. Can you help us mechanically how pension is swinging from an expense item to an income line -- income item. I guess, the discount rate helped you some. But given where I see your asset returns in -- more in \u201818, I'm kind of surprised we saw that big of a swing.","Frank Connor","And it has to do with the kind of a amortizations associated with gains and losses in prior years. The pension accounting has an averaging and smoothing effect on those gains and losses. So, we're just kind of rolling off of loss amortization and rolling into a better kind of amortization number. And so it's this smoothing effect associated with kind of all of those calculations. We're basically putting some of the amortization associated with things like the financial crisis behind us.","David Strauss","Okay, good for you. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Melius Research. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland","Hey. Good morning, gentlemen.","Scott Donnelly","Good morning, Carter. ","Carter Copeland","Frank, I wondered if you could just tell us for clarification that the EACs -- the gross EACs? And then, Scott, I wondered if you just can maybe comment on the Longitude. When you think that -- if you think that has a positive mix contribution to segment margin rate in \u201819, or if that's more of a 2020 phenomenon?","Frank Connor","No program adjustments were $29 million in the quarter.","Scott Donnelly","So Carter, I think if you looked at the -- over the course of the year, we will probably see some dilution to our overall margin rate, and certainly in the first quarter, maybe a little bit into the second quarter. But as we get into sort of the normal line flow in Q3, Q4, we expect Longitude will be a contributor at our sort of standard gross margin, if you will. So it probably has a little bit of a dilution that we're factoring in net from the total year. So you expect probably '20 to see a little bit better than that, because you won't have those initial units. But that is factored in, obviously, to the guidance we're giving you.","Carter Copeland","Okay, that's great color. And one last one, you got a Super Bowl.","Scott Donnelly ","Oh this would be a dangerous place to say anything we think Carter. ","Carter Copeland","I know I was just tempting you. Thanks guys for the color. I appreciate it as always. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen. Please go ahead. ","Cai von Rumohr","Could you give us a little more color on the Tracker deal? As I read the release, they are coming out with some dirt product under their brand name. Do you produce that product? And kind of what's the basis of your agreement?","Scott Donnelly ","So we do. So the whole partnership here, Cai, is that we provide the engineering and manufacturing, and Bass Pro and their Tracker independent dealers provide the distribution channel. So we do talk about it as a partnership. It's not a conventional sort of, hey, we wholesale, and you do retail. We work -- kind of have been working together on the design, the branding, really tailoring this around what Johnny and his team want to take through that channel under the Tracker brand. It's a great relationship. We're sort of a both guys win kind of a deal. They are a great company, got a lot of great people. Nobody knows the retail side of outdoor sports like they do. So it's been something where we bring sort of the technical and manufacturing capability, and they bring the branding and distribution side.","Cai von Rumohr","And do they do snow also, or is it only -- is it only Off Road?","Scott Donnelly ","They will do some snow in some of their stores, obviously, in selected regions. And where they do that, they will do that under the Arctic Cat brand. Because the Arctic Cat brand is -- I mean, that obviously, that brand stands for itself in the snow side.","Cai von Rumohr","Got it. And then -- so turning to aviation. Could you give us what the net price impact was in the fourth quarter?","Scott Donnelly ","And you'll see the numbers when they come out. We had net price of $14 million, consistent with what we saw in the third quarter actually.","Cai von Rumohr","Okay. And then R&D, it's down -- projected to be down $23 million. Is that all likely to be at aviation? Give us some color on terms of what's down and what's up.","Scott Donnelly ","Well, as you know, Cai, we don't usually bake at this thing. But I would say -- the color I would say is that we really overspent a little bit, and it was primarily in aviation, and it was primarily just because of the magnitude of the Longitude cert activity. So there are not big shifts between the businesses. So, I would expect that we would see somewhat lower R&D spending in the aviation business in 2019.","Cai von Rumohr","Terrific. And last one. So, where are we with the Denali sky tracker and Hemisphere?","Scott Donnelly ","So, both the SkyCourier and the Denali, we're expecting first flights of those aircraft this year. I think, the program is progressing well. I mean, our teams are a little bit stretched here with a lot of our engineering resource being tied up on the Longitude, but they're working hard to get those first flights this year. So I think those programs are in good shape. The Hemisphere, as we talked about, is -- there is work going on, obviously, from our concept design and whatnot as we work with NetJets on the specification of that aircraft. We will not ramp a lot of spending into that until after we're confident that the engine program is in good shape. And we expect that's kind of a -- we will understand where that is exactly as we get kind of more into the midyear time frame.","Cai von Rumohr","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from a line of Jon Raviv from Citi. Please go ahead. ","Jon Raviv","Scott, on Longitude, can you just give us sort of a state of the union address here in terms of kind of what has happened? Your perspective on the fixes that you've all proposed, the acceptance of those fixes, and kind of like what is actually left to do here to get final certification, shutdown notwithstanding.","Scott Donnelly","Boy, you got me. But the state of the thing is that the flight testing program has been done for some time. The last issue that we had that was something we really had to work with FAA was around this -- the fuel system. That was resolved. It was flight tested. It's -- I mean, that's behind us. And we're just doing documentation. It's rather staggering. I think we're -- I know we're getting close. I was down with the team about a week or so ago. But just to give you a sense, we're up to 157,000 pages of certification documents. It is truly mind-boggling. But the vast, vast majority of that is behind us. We got teams that have been working really hard to get the final documents completed. But I mean now, as I said, flight test is done. There is not a -- there's no technical issue. It's just something that we have to finalize these documents and get done.","Jon Raviv","Yes, understood. And then on the new distribution agreement. Is there any -- the way these agreements have been structured, is there any difference in terms of profitability, opportunity when you go kind of into a more tailored approach like this, or once these distribution channels get fully set up, can we see even more improvement in that business from a margin perspective?","Scott Donnelly","I think we expect it to not be very different. It should be a nice healthy margin. So I mean, it's certainly structured that way. As I kind of alluded with Cai, this is a win-win for both companies. So both we and the Bass Pro team are equally incentivized to make sure that this is a good, profitable program.","Jon Raviv","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please go ahead. ","George Shapiro","Yes. Just a quick one, Frank. How much was aviation -- what was Aviation aftermarket in the quarter compared to last year, up?","Frank Connor","So it was flat on a kind of adjusted basis to kind of adjust for the change that we had in the engine program revenues. So kind of flat for the quarter, 4% on a like-for-like for the year.","George Shapiro","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Seth, your line is open.","Seth Seifman","Sorry, I think I was on mute there. Just a quick one on V-280. Scott, can you talk about maybe the range of outcomes that you're thinking about for V-280 in the '20 budget? What would be considered good? Is there some kind of commitment that you guys have to have? And how that might affect -- how -- whether it's a lot or a little that's in the budget? How that might affect your pace of spending on V-280 going forward?","Scott Donnelly ","Well, it'll affect our pace a lot. And so I mean, we have no insight into what the [PB-20] looks like at this stage of the game. We're certainly encouraged by the dialogue that we've had and I think the army has had publicly around their desire to accelerate these programs, both Cap Set 1 and Cap Set 3. So we would certainly hope to hear shortly, to start to see that -- those statements turn into some contracted work. As I said earlier, look, we've now exceeded 280 knots. I think our team has done everything we've asked of them to design and build a terrific aircraft. Its maneuverability is understanding. It's been demonstrated. So it's sort of debunked all these notions that to order product can't have the maneuverability of a more conventional aircraft, the speed now going through and then breaking through that 280 knot performance envelope. This thing does everything and more than it was expected to do. So at this point, look, we'll have no choice but to roll back any funding that we put into it, waiting to see what the army is going to do, because we've done what we can do.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Noah Poponak","Scott, I'd love to hear your latest thoughts on Cessna product strategy, bigger picture. I mean, you had these launches at the high end of your product set that are going well for you. But it's still competitive out there. There's people that project that you guys may replace some of the stuff in the middle of your product portfolio. But -- and I know over time, you want to invest to grow, but you also probably don't want to just be constantly, perpetually spending to grow. And so I'm just curious what you're thinking your medium- to long-term next steps are.","Scott Donnelly","Well, look, I think the -- I mean, we have a pretty full plate right now. I mean, obviously, we're thrilled with how the Latitude has gone. We are thrilled with where the Longitude is and how its reception is in the market. Obviously, we feel great about the prospects of Hemisphere. We got the engine thing resolved particularly with the NetJets launch, and again, our belief in what these new products do to drive growth. So, we're certainly prepared to move on, on that. And Denali and the SkyCourier, we think are both going to be home run products. So I mean, we're just -- we're pretty loaded up right now. So, I'm probably not in a position. I mean, we do product planning, look at this stuff all the time. But, there's certainly nothing that we're prepared to announce beyond that right now. I think we're pretty full up with a lot of exciting programs. It will be terrific for the future of the business. ","Noah Poponak","That makes sense. And Frank, just two clean-ups. So, one is pension question. Where does that year-over-year change fall, just so we can look at the underlying? And then on getting the tax rate down to 20%, is that -- is there anything that's specific to only \u201819 in that, or should we be plugging that in as far as we're going?","Frank Connor","Yes, I mean, the pension change kind of falls throughout the operation. So it's obviously kind of baked into the guidance. Some of it gets kind of inventoried, but most of it is P&L. And that's in the various operational performance of the segments.","Noah Poponak","Is it heavier in one segment? But I guess, I meant\u2026","Frank Connor","No, I mean not. ","Noah Poponak","It's pretty spread out? ","Frank Connor","Yes, it's pretty spread out. On the -- sorry, what was the other question? ","Noah Poponak","Tax rate. ","Frank Connor","Tax rate. So tax rate, no, as we've indicated, there's -- it's probably in the low 20s kind of go-forward basis, not kind of at 20%. So we expect a little bit of benefit for some discrete items in '19. Obviously, we continue to work it for the future. But it wants to be a little higher than that longer term.","Noah Poponak","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And at this time, there are no further questions.","Scott Donnelly","Okay. Everyone, thank you very much.

Welcome to the Textron First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. ","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Doug Wilburne. Please go ahead.","Doug Wilburne","Thanks, Greg and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to mention, we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release. On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO, and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.","Textron\u2019s revenues in the quarter were $3.2 billion, up $128 million from last year\u2019s first quarter. Income from continuing operations was $0.55 per share, up 19.6% from $0.46 reported in last year\u2019s first quarter. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was a $222 million use of cash compared to $125 million use of cash in last year\u2019s first quarter.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Donnelly","Thanks, Doug and good morning, everybody. Revenues were up 4.2% in the quarter, reflecting the success of our strategy of investing for growth, both in new products and acquisitions. Segment revenue was up in Industrial, Aviation and Systems, while essentially flat at Bell, consistent with our expectations. At Bell, we delivered 6 V-22s, flat with last year\u2019s first quarter, 10 H-1s, up four units from last year and 30 commercial helicopters, down from 35 a year ago.","On the commercial side, we had a good showing at HELI-EXPO, where we displayed actual flight test articles of our new 525 Relentless and 505 Jet Ranger, though both of which generated significant interest. At the show, we signed a letter of intent for 10 525s with Guangxi Diwang Group, a Chinese investment company. More recently, we also signed an LOI with PT Whitesky Aviation, an Indonesian operator for 30 505s. Development on both programs are proceeding well. The three test 505 helicopters are completed over 700 test hours with certification and first deliveries expected later this year.","The 525 has two aircraft and flight test, with a third unit expected to enter soon. The aircraft is meeting or exceeding all of its performance objectives, including having demonstrated a top speed in excess of 200 knots. The effectiveness of 525\u2019s integrated fly-by-wire design has been evident during the testing by the aircraft superior in flight handling, maneuverability and stability. Combined, these factors should significantly contribute to the value of this aircraft for our customers.","At HAI, we also announced the new Bell customer advantage plan or CAP which provides our customers the opportunity to lock in predictable cost effective maintenance for their aircraft. Our CAP product delivers broad cover solutions for our customer\u2019s daily operation, which in turn protects the value of their investment, while increasing aircraft availability. We were also named number 1 helicopter service and support for the 22nd consecutive year by Pro Pilot Magazine.","On the H-1 front, we have received recent orders from the DoD for 61 additional units, including 9 FMS units for Pakistan. This takes production through the first quarter 2019. The remaining US DoD program of record and significant introduction of foreign military demand provide a solid long-term outlook for this program.","Moving to Systems, revenues were up modestly primarily driven by higher unmanned systems volumes. During the quarter at Textron Marine and Land Systems we received $174 million contract for five additional Ship-to-Shore units to be delivered in 2020. Earlier this month, we were also awarded a contract for 60 COMMANDO Select armored vehicles to be delivered this year in Iraq and Colombia.","On the Canadian TAPV program we're on track for deliveries beginning in the third quarter as we successfully completed the customer reliability testing program two weeks ago. At TRU Simulation + Training we were just awarded another contract by Boeing to design and manufacture simulators for their newest twin-aisle airplane the 777x. ","Moving to Industrial, we saw 9.2% increase in revenue reflecting our continued investments. During the quarter at specialized vehicles, we launched our newest Bad Boy product, the Onslaught 550, a mid-size 4 by 4 ATV. At Jake we announced the HR700 which is the world\u2019s first 14 foot wide rotary mower providing increased productivity for our professional turf care customers. At Tools and Test new products in our look electric utility space are driving significant growth in this category. At Kautex, our selective catalytic reduction products and geographic expansion drove growth in excess of global vehicle production rates. ","Moving to Textron Aviation, we delivered 34 jets in the quarter compared to 33 last year and 26 King Airs compared to 25 last year. Our sales success affirms that our strategy of investing in new products is resonating with aircraft buyers. During the first quarter we also received European certification for the Latitude as well as the ProLiant Fusion equipped King Air 250 and 350. Advanced sales of Latitude fractionals by NetJets to their end customers have been going very well and we look forward to starting deliveries of the new aircraft later this summer. ","To sum up, we had a good start to the year as demand in our end markets finished the quarter generally consistent with what we were expecting. Operationally we also had another good quarter as we achieved margin improvements at each of our manufacturing segments. We continue to believe that we will be able to generate solid overall growth in revenue, earnings and cash this year.","And with that I will turn the call over to Frank. ","Frank Connor","Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Segment profit in the quarter was $280 million, up $21 million from the first quarter of 2015 on a $128 million increase in revenues. Let\u2019s review how each of the segments contributed starting with Textron Aviation.","At Textron Aviation, revenues were up $40 million from this period last year primarily due to higher jet volume. Segment profit was $73 million, up from $67 million a year ago. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1 billion; $47 million lower than at the end of the fourth quarter","Moving to Bell, revenues were essentially flat as higher military revenues offset lower commercial revenues. Segment profit increased $6 million from the first quarter of 2015 primarily due to improved performance. At Systems, revenues were up $9 million primarily due to higher unmanned systems volumes while segment profit was up $1 million. Industrial revenues increased $80 million due to higher overall volumes and the impact of acquisitions. Segment profit increased $9 million also reflecting the higher volumes and the impact of acquisitions. Finance segment revenues decreased $2 million and profit decreased $1 million.","Moving below the segment line, corporate expenses were $32 million compared to $43 million last year reflecting the impact of a lower stock price on our share based compensation expense. Interest expense was $33 million, flat from last year. During the quarter we issued $350 million in 10-year notes at a rate of 4%. This was effectively prefunding the retirement of $250 million in 4.625 notes that are set to mature in September. We also repurchased 6.2 million shares of stock during the quarter returning $215 million in cash to shareholders.","To wrap up with guidance, we are confirming our expected full year EPS from continuing operations of $2.60 to $2.80 a share and cash flow from continuing operations of the manufacturing group before pension contributions of $600 million to $700 million.","This concludes our prepared remarks So, Greg, we can open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr","Yes, thank you very much. So your aviation volume was up, but your inventory step up was down. Maybe give us some color in terms of why the profitability wasn\u2019t a little bit better?","Scott Donnelly","Well, Cai, I think you look at the first quarter, the revenue increase was fairly modest. So in terms of leverage, we are talking about sort of what I recall the lot of small numbers. We I think that had pretty good execution by the team. We had an awful lot of R&D spending frankly as we are getting ready to do the first Longitude flight here coming up in the early part of this summer. And so even with the step up, as you note in there, which was probably $5 million, $6 million something like that. That was more than offset by a fair bit of R&D spending to get ready for the Longitude. So there is nothing fundamentally different. I don\u2019t think -- the mix obviously was more biased towards Latitudes than some of our legacy aircraft, but that\u2019s something we expected and kind of talked about in the context of our overall guidance for the segment leverage for the year, and I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing kind of play through.","Cai von Rumohr","And then a last follow up, so should we assume that the Latitude is a mix negative in terms of your shipment? And also could you comment on the level of used aircraft losses if any? ","Scott Donnelly","Yes, I think \u2013 as we talked about, I think the Latitude mix will be a slight drag in terms of our normal gross margin flow through. We expect obviously that should improve over time. It\u2019s still a good product for us, but it\u2019s a little bit lower on the mix side and some of our other aircraft at this point. You know, used aircraft, there were some losses in the quarter, but they were de minimis, I mean, they are not a material number. ","Cai von Rumohr","Thank you. ","Scott Donnelly","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from RBC. Please go ahead. ","Robert Stallard","Thanks guys, good morning. Scott, there has been a lot of negativity in the last couple of months by the business jet demand environment. Used inventories seem to have gone up, pricing softened. I was wondering what [indiscernible] we are seeing out there in terms of customer interest and how confident you are in your forecast for 2016 in this division?","Scott Donnelly","Robert, I would say that if we look at the first quarter, there is no question that January and February were pretty rough letting. The turmoil in the market and general sentiment, I mean, I think caused a lot of people to sort of stop, and wait and see what\u2019s going on. But as we went in through March, I would say continuing now into April, the market has been pretty good. I mean, we would always like to see it stronger, but the momentum that we felt in the latter part of last year certainly took a pause through January, February, but has returned to a pretty decent market here in March going into April. ","Robert Stallard","And then as a follow up, Frank, obviously you highlighted the buyback was strong in Q1. Do you expect it to moderate going forward and will you be more interested in acquisitions perhaps?","Frank Connor","Well, as we said, I mean, we will continue to take a look at what the acquisition opportunities look like, our cash flow needs and we returned excess capital to shareholders. As you say, we don\u2019t kind of \u2013 we did a lot of that in the first quarter. We will continue to look at kind of the appropriate use of capital as we go through the year. But we are ahead of the game in terms of our -- certainly our plan do that we saw set dilution at this point. ","Robert Stallard","That\u2019s great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. ","Sam Pearlstein","Good morning. Just following up on our last comment about the share count. Do you still assume it\u2019s going to be the 277 million shares? I know that it was heavy in the first quarter. Will that be lower for the year? ","Frank Connor","It should be lower for the year by about the number over the normal dilution, so kind of 3-ish million. We bought about 3 million more than our normal employee plan dilution would reflect, it would be lower by about that amount. ","Sam Pearlstein","Okay. And then can you talk a little bit about Bell and what you have seen as far as demand on the 412s and as the relatively stronger dollar hurt you in those sales, I guess, I am wondering with two deliveries in the first quarter, are we still on track for 12 of them?","Scott Donnelly","I think that the commercial market is still challenging for sure on the helicopter side, and exchange rates US dollar doesn\u2019t help us particularly. But the 412, I would say our line of sight on the year for the guidance we provided, which was around 12, I think is firming up. So I think we feel pretty good about that. And there is certainly opportunities out there as we look into the out years and there is deals that still need to close, but there is still \u2013 it\u2019s a great helicopter, it serves its purpose very well, it\u2019s got a great customer base and there is still people looking at expanding increasingly their fleet to 412. So I'd say we have pretty reasonable line of sight onto the 2016 in our working opportunities that are going out in the \u201817, \u201818 at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","I guess on R&D can you talk about the expectations for R&D for the full year may be on a segment basis? And then also in terms of headcount, I think you added headcount across three of the four segments with the exception of Bell and may be what that additional capacity is for?","Scott Donnelly","Well, Sheila I would say that the total year R&D is probably going to be pretty consistent with what we guided which we only do for the total company level. There is always a little bit of timing in this thing, I mean clearly with getting ready for the flight test programs and whatnot at Aviation on the longitude program we spent a disproportionate amount of that in terms of the run rate getting ready for flight test. So, the other programs are running about as we expected there is really no change to the guidance, the 525 flight test programs are going very well but consuming expenses at about the pace we expected. 280 is going very well, we\u2019ve got some nice significant milestones in the fabrication of that first unit for flight next year. So I think our guidance for the total year remains unchanged, we just had some higher spending here in the first quarter particularly aviation getting ready for the longitude program.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","And then on headcount?","Scott Donnelly","The headcount numbers, I don't - I'm not sure, I don't have the exact numbers in front of me Sheila. I don't think there is any big material changes, the only place we\u2019ve had really material changes in headcount unfortunately have really been around Bell and that's mostly been dialing back some of the production run rates in Bell on the commercial helicopter front. Other than that it's been I think relatively stable in most of the businesses.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","And then just a follow-up on the demand question I asked earlier. It's pretty original but can you just talk about pricing and maybe if the competitive environment has changed at all?","Scott Donnelly","In?","Sheila Kahyaoglu","In more so in aviation I guess.","Scott Donnelly","Aviation has been fairly flattish on a year-over-year basis Sheila as there are a couple of models that have seen a little bit of an uptick in price, a couple have been a little been down in price but overall not a big impact in pricing really across the whole company, pricing has been relatively flat. As I said, I think part of it is just we had to be a little bit patient her as we went through a couple pretty tough months and hanging in there but the demand environment which is really kind of in the end what drives it picked up in March and felt pretty good.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason Gursky","Maybe I\u2019ll go back to Bell. Scott, can you talk a little bit about the next multi-year on the V-22, there has been some recent press reports out there about that\u2019s shaping up, can you maybe provide a little bit of a color on your thoughts on that that would be helpful, particularly on the volumes?","Scott Donnelly","Sure, so I'd start by saying that it's early in that process, so we've already started to work with the customer on providing information. Right now the challenge is it\u2019s a pretty broad range of volumes depending on, as they\u2019re working on their budget for those out years and obviously it\u2019s you know there is a mix of what they want to do with the program of record for the marine core, you've been some articles out there about the air force having an interest in some additional CVs, there is the Navy card program, and how that starts to drive demand as well as creating some optionality around FMS opportunities. So, right now it's a - when we're providing numbers it\u2019s across a pretty broad range of units, so it's at this point I'd be reluctant to put a number out there, seriously I don't think there is anyone who would want to guide to yet to give you guys an idea because it's just the range of opportunity is just too high in terms of you know where that number falls out it could it\u2019s just you know they\u2019re running the numbers, running the financials and asking us for a lot of input on a pretty broad range of possible numbers of units.","Jason Gursky","Let me ask you it differently, without FMS, the top end of that range allow you to hold current production rates?","Scott Donnelly","No, I don't think it's likely that we will hold current production rates, it's going to be you know it will be south of that I really don't see a potential outcome that would be the current production rate, so we are planning for another detriment down when we get out there into that \u201819, \u201920 timeframe, but it\u2019s -- we just don\u2019t know how big that detriment is going to be right now. When you look at Navy, that\u2019s 40 some units, there is still 20 some in the Marine Corp program of record, there can be a couple of CVs, there can be some optionality built in for FMS, but I do not think that the expectation should be it would run at the current run rates.","Jason Gursky","Okay. Understood. And then the follow-on, the LOI with regard to the 505 and the 525, can you just remind us during those converts into actual contracts, when will you start telling its or have a better idea of what your ramp is going to look like on deliveries for both of those aircrafts, so just kind of the timing of the LOIs converting the contracts.","Scott Donnelly","Well, I think we\u2019ll start to see conversion on 505 contracts, probably starting here pretty soon. Those aircraft, we\u2019ll be looking at the initial deliveries likely in the fourth quarter. So there is already conversations going on with customers that are -- will convert those to actual contracts. I would say on the 525, you won\u2019t likely see that until sometime as you get closer to certification in mid-summer or so. Last year, next year, rather with just because our certification expectations are kind of late summer, early fall before we would start firming those up for deliveries by the end of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.","Pete Skibitski","Hi, good, morning, guys. Hey, Scott, geographically, is North America kind of still the only game in town. I think you\u2019ve been running, I don\u2019t know, 75% of your citation deliveries were North America and I think a similar amount at Bell Commercial. I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s the status and if there is any change that you detect in the North American market versus three or four months ago.","Scott Donnelly","Well, certainly on the Aviation side, it\u2019s still more or less US driven. I think jets this quarter were probably about 80% US deliveries, about 20% international deliveries. If you look at our turboprop product between the King Air and the Caravans, those are more like 50-50 US and International and that\u2019s more typical for those products and I think the turboprops are doing well. Caravans, particularly in China, are strong. So we -- but I would say however, we were starting to see some momentum pick up a little bit in Europe. So I think you\u2019ll start to see some increased jet deliveries over there. And turboprop, again, staying fairly balanced between US and international as we go through the balance of the year.","Pete Skibitski","Okay. Got you. And then last one, just wondering what your expectation was on this air force nuclear helicopter program. I think basically you guys are the incumbent, it\u2019s I think a few billion dollars probably and there has been a lot of chatter that they would still source it to a competitor. I\u2019m just wondering what your expectation is there and if you had any thoughts?","Frank Connor","Well, we\u2019re probably seeing and hearing the same things that you\u2019re hearing. It sounds like we are the incumbent, but those helicopters have been there, those are Hueys from a long time ago. And at least the requirements that we\u2019ve seen out there, we think they\u2019re looking for a larger and different helicopter. So we\u2019re seeing and hearing the same chatter. It sounds like they\u2019re looking at going sole source to another product at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland","Hey, good morning, guys. Just, Scott quickly, wondered if you could give us some color on what you saw in service revenues across Aviation and Bell in the quarter.","Scott Donnelly","So on the Aviation side, it was pretty consistent with where we\u2019ve been. I think it was around 35% of revenue on the helicopter side, [indiscernible] but it was down a bit year-over-year and again, I think that\u2019s just reflecting that we continue to see lower utilization, particularly in the oil and gas segment in the marketplace.","Carter Copeland","When do you think you reach a bottom on that, I mean clearly there is some destocking in that end market. So when do you start to lap some of the easier compares there?","Scott Donnelly","Hard to say, Carter. I mean I would be just making a total guess, but I think a lot of it\u2019s going to have to do with obviously what happens with oil prices and when do guys start utilizing assets. I can tell you, down in the gulf, where we have an awful lot of foreclose that are operating with oil prices being down, things have been slower. Frankly, some customers have been slow to pay some of the operators that we\u2019ve worked and so as a result, those guys will put aircraft on the ground or they will back off in general, but it\u2019s got to go through its cycle. So I am not probably the right guy to opine on the oil prices and what that recovery looks like, but I think it will tie more to that going forward.","Carter Copeland","Great. And then on Systems, just a quick follow-up. Anymore color you can give us on the unmanned revenue in the quarter, did it have a negative mix impact for the margins?","Scott Donnelly","No, I think the unmanned is probably in line with typically what we expect for margins in that business. We've seen fairly high utilization on our fee for service programs which are going well. The aircrafts are performing well and executing the contracts that we have. We've continued to deliver the upgrades for the Shadow V2 program and those are kind of flowing through exactly as we expected and we've got some decent business development work going on for some international sales and things like that. So I think everything in the unmanned world is good. The margins obviously we were this quarter fairly light at Marine and Land Systems because we will largely generate a lot of the revenue here in the third and fourth quarter associated with the Canadian TAPV program obviously getting that milestone in the test complete was a big deal for us. So I think each of the units are doing well and are where we expect it to be. Unmanned is good business and margin is consistent with our expectations.","Carter Copeland","Great. Thanks a lot.","Scott Donnelly","Sure","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, good morning. Just wanted to start with the first question on aviation margins because I guess in Q1 you were talking earlier about how the margins were a couple of 100 points short of the full year margins hogged in aviation based off of mix of leverage - volume leverage and also R&D. As we think about the rest of the year and how you make up that 200 bps, should we think about that as fairly evenly split between R&D tailing off and leverage recovering or is there some sort of waiting between the two?","Scott Donnelly","Julian, I mean, I think it\u2019s \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t read a whole lot into the Q1 numbers, right, I mean, the revenue was up $40 million, so leverage on $40 million couple of million of \u2013 few million of R&D, a couple of million of this or that just makes such as huge swing. So I don\u2019t think there is anything that I would look at the first quarter granted \u2013 yeah, just in terms of specifically R&D, the R&D spending is probably somewhat disproportionate in terms of the overall impact on margins here in Q1 that it would be in the latter quarters, but I really don\u2019t there is anything fundamental we\u2019ve looked at in the leverage issue in the first quarter as being indicative of what's going to happen in Q2, Q3 and Q4. So our guidance that we provided you guys around sort of that window of overall operating margin percent I think we're on track to do and the revenue side. So the leverage is going to pretty consistent I think with what we told you and again the number in Q1 is such a small incremental on the revenue that I don\u2019t think you can read a whole lot into in terms of leverage.","Julian Mitchell","Very clear. And then my follow-up would be around the manufacturing cash outflow, that was about 100 million higher year-on-year. The vast majority of that is due to working capital stepping up, but at the same time your buyback spend in Q1 suggests you're very confident of that cash flow swinging around. So maybe just give a little bit of background as to where that big working capital build really came. And do you think we should see the manufacturing cash flow swing positive in the second quarter?","Scott Donnelly","So I think first of all on an absolute basis you guys know we generally consume cash in the first quarter. We tend to have inventory build associated with products that do sell off good, better in different aviation and they will tend to have more higher sales in the latter part of the year. So on an absolute basis I don\u2019t think there is anything terribly surprising. In terms of the year-over-year comparative, we do have situation with respect to customer deposits primarily almost exclusively frankly on the military side of Bell where as a result of performance based payments over the last couple of years we had favorable position in terms of working capital which will unwind through the course of this year and that\u2019s a good part of what you are seeing here in the first quarter. But those numbers are absolutely consistent with what we guided you guys in the overall cash numbers. So we will see that working capital impact through the course of the year, but again completely planned and consistent with expectation and so we have no change in our confidence in terms of our overall cash flow for the year.","Julian Mitchel","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please go ahead. ","George Shapiro","Yes, Scott, I wanted to pursue a little bit more this R&D. So you\u2019ve made a comment first thing that the R&D spend was more than offset what was maybe 5 million step up in fees, could you quantify how much more it offset and then how much lower the R&D might be in the subsequent quarters?","Scott Donnelly","So the dynamics we have in the quarter, George, for sure, we have the last quarter really of any of the step up impact on accounting in aviation, that was about $5 million number. And all I am saying is that our spending on the R&D side on a year-over-year basis to be comparative was a number that was quite bigger than that. So it was \u2013 of you take those two significant pieces that was dilutive to our margin rate or overall leverage if you will on a year-over-year basis. But again, in either case where these huge numbers, it\u2019s just when you\u2019re looking at a $40 million increase in revenue, the difference between 4 million better in margin and 8 million better in margin, 10% leverage, 20% leverage, you\u2019re talking about a couple of million dollars. So it\u2019s \u2013 none of these number are big numbers.","George Shapiro","Got it. And I was just wondering \u2013 R&D 10 million versus say the step up in 5 million [ph] in the quarter, I am just trying to roughly calculate what that impact might be, and then how much higher R&D was this quarter than what you might expect it to be in subsequent quarters?","Scott Donnelly","George, it was on the order of about 10 million. I mean, I think for a modeling purpose that\u2019s about the right number to put in there. Again, it\u2019s not a particularly big number. And we don\u2019t expect it to change our overall company R&D over the course of the year. It\u2019s a relatively small number, but it\u2019s on that magnitude.","George Shapiro","Okay. So does R&D go down a little bit then in the subsequent quarters?","Scott Donnelly","Yes, but again not by a very big number, because it was only up by a very small number. ","George Shapiro","Frank, just to qualify the tax rate was, more like 30% this quarter versus the 31% guide, are we going to still see 31% or is 30% a better number?","Frank Connor","I gave you the 31, it obviously depends on at the end of the day, kind of what our international versus domestic mix is and we will know that until we move further through the year. But I continue to use 31. ","George Shapiro","Okay. And one last one Scott, orders this year versus last year\u2019s first quarter were up like 90 million or so, almost 10%, was that still primarily domestic or did you see more of the orders from international at all this quarter?","Scott Donnelly","I wouldn\u2019t say on the jet side, most of orders in the quarter were US. I think we will see a more international mix here, certainly as we are proceeding through April into Q2. ","George Shapiro","Okay. Thanks very much. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Seth Seifman","Thanks very much and good morning. I will really beg for your indulgent to ask one more question about aviation margin, which is just about \u2013 if you look what\u2019s implied for the remainder of the year, it looks fairly flat with what you did in Q2, Q3, Q4 overall last year, excluding the inventory step up and so to have flat margins year-on-year in aviation for the rest of the year, when it would seem like more latitude deliveries to [indiscernible] would be a headwind. What sort of the opposing factor that allows you to keep those margins flat?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I think in general performance in the business is \u2013 I mean, the guys are executing well and we do have some volume that\u2019s increased on a year-over-year basis. And we still have good gross margin products, so that those create some leverage to help offset some of what might be a bit of a negative mix on a year-over-year comparative basis in terms of the mix of aircraft.","Seth Seifman","And then just as a follow-up also in terms of the pickup in activity that you've seen in March and April in terms of where is it across, would you say it's across platforms or is there any place where it\u2019s concentrated. And one of the reasons I ask and that we\u2019re talking about small numbers though it's hard to tell but if you just look at the high end, the Sovereign and X deliveries were fairly low in Q1, I know Q1 is light but is that a place where you're seeing kind of incremental weakness in demand relative to the other platforms?","Scott Donnelly","It's probably some of which we\u2019re seeing is with the latitude in there we do see some aircraft that may be a year or two years ago could have been a Sovereign are now going to be a Latitude. So, the aircraft in terms of the range and performance are different and for a lot of our customers the Sovereign is still the right answer and that's why we still see reasonable sales of Sovereign but for sure when we look at the total number of aircraft in that Sovereign space, some of those are now becoming Latitude. So if someone is in the middle of the country or they are in Europe or they\u2019re in a place where about 2,000 nautical miles will get you there, they\u2019re tending to air on the side of a Latitude versus Sovereign, so that explains kind of where I think we are on Sovereigns. And on TENs as we\u2019ve said that's a fairly unique product, it\u2019s been a very popular product over time but it's relatively small number of units each year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Myles Walton","It sounded like in the fourth quarter, the thing here is maybe we\u2019re a little bit supreme on the international side, but I guess Scott some of your commentary there seems that like you had seen a pickup as expected and so I expect you and your growth in King Air?","Scott Donnelly","Yeah, I mean I think we've seen the King Air market being pretty solid in most applications, I\u2019d say it's been a little lighter on special missions that it has in the past and that\u2019s a little bit of what we saw in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of this year. But remember we also had the conversion going from the old cockpit to the new model that came out very late last year and so getting that into production, getting the last of the older models sold and now making that conversion to the new model also has some impact on volume but frankly with the new model out there is selling well, we just got certification in Europe, which is [indiscernible] is a big deal for us, so I think we feel pretty good about the King Air market and where it\u2019s going.","Myles Walton","And just a clarification on the margins, the pension tailwind year-over-year expected have been 10 million to 15 million across the segments and may be deviation in five of that, is that about the right way to think about the tailwind from pension?","Scott Donnelly","No, It was probably somewhere around that $10 million number but most of that is actually taking at corporate just the way we - well, I mean we spread out but it wouldn't be 5 at aviation, that\u2019s going to be a smaller number than that. So I wouldn't - I don't have the exact number in front of me but it's relatively --.","Frank Connor","There is a benefit but its spread around the organization.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Jeff Sprague","Just a couple of questions on cash flow, Frank thanks for the color on the or maybe it was Scott, the military dynamics but just kind of think about the quarter here. Accounts receivable and inventories were both actually up, I would guess that Bell issue was actually in some accrued accounts somewhere, can you speak to what was going on in the accounts receivables and inventories in the quarter?","Scott Donnelly","The issue I talked about on Bell is in the working capital line Jeff, so that\u2019s where it\u2019s reflected.","Jeff Sprague","I'm just looking at the absolute growth in receivables and inventories in the quarter --.","Frank Connor","Jeff, just to be clear the comment on customer deposits was a first quarter last year to first quarter this year versus end of year last year to this quarter so --.","Jeff Sprague","And then just shifting to pension, do you foresee continued contributions at this level or if there is a potential that those need to kind of move up in the out years?","Scott Donnelly","Well, it obviously Jeff depends on returns and discount rates and everything else but we don\u2019t see meaningful contributions beyond these levels in the near term unless there is some significant change in the market dynamics.","Jeff Sprague","And then I was also just wondering and back to the tax rate, Frank, there is this FASB change on stock comp that can be adopted this year. It's not required until next year, but we are seeing a few companies adopt that. Has that been a concern this year and is that something that could meaningfully impact your tax rate if you adopt?","Frank Connor","I think, we are looking at it, but as I said stick with 31 is the right place to think about things.","Jeff Sprague","And then one just last one. Could give us some idea of what percent of the Aviation backlog is the NetJets Latitudes or someway to just kind of think about that?","Scott Donnelly","No, we don\u2019t get into that level of detail on the backlog, Jeff, but the only thing I will say around the NetJets thing is that we really don\u2019t put stuff in from that just into the backlog until we have agreed delivery dates and tail numbers and that stuff. So we will incrementally add NetJets to that backlog only when we - NetJets says, hey, look this is when I want delivery, this is the date, this is the tail and so there is only a small percentage of that overall order is in backlog today and that will grow the number we\u2019ve put in there fairly linearly as they start taking deliveries and start committing to the next aircraft delivery date.","Jeff Sprague","Great. Thank you for the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Justin Bergner from Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.","Justin Bergner","Good morning, Scott, good morning, Frank.","Scott Donnelly","Good morning.","Justin Bergner","I want to ask a good question on the industrial business. Would it be possible for you to give us a sense as to how the different parts of the industrial segment grew relative to that 6.5% organic constant currency growth in that business?","Scott Donnelly","Yeah, we can provide some color around that. I did have that number right in front of me. But if you looked at the overall growth rates we are \u2013 I am not sure how to break it out exactly. Our specialized vehicle business had pretty reasonable growth. We had relatively flat market in our tools and test world, but again there is the dynamics within that which we kind of talked a little bit about. I think we are doing very well in the utility space. A lot of the other tools that were re highly consumed by a lot of the oil and gas exploration kind of guys obviously continues to be soft, but net there were some growth in that segment. We had very solid growth on the automotive side of things on a year-over-year basis. And the turf care world was relatively flat.","Justin Bergner","Thank you. That's helpful. Given that the first quarter in the industrial business is tracking slightly ahead of your full year goal, should we think about the industrial business as being a segment that could exceed your earlier guidance or are there parts of the business that you don't expect to be quite as strong as you look through the rest of the year?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I think we feel pretty good about where we're right now. The guys in pretty much all the businesses had a pretty solid quarter, but it\u2019s probably little early in the year to feel like we would materially change the range on what we told you with respect to the segment. So certainly they are on the tracks right now, they would be towards the high end of it, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty early in the year too. ","Justin Bergner","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ronald Epstein from Bank of America. Please go ahead. ","Ronald Epstein","Hey, good morning, guys.","Scott Donnelly","Good morning, Ronald.","Ronald Epstein","Just maybe a couple of quick details. You guys announced that you won 777x flight simulator at Mechtronix, so congratulations on that. How big is that potentially? I mean how do we think about that for the Mechtronix business?","Scott Donnelly","It\u2019s a good question. So the - and I have to be careful, because I don\u2019t know exactly all that was disclosed with our customer but certainly the scope of that contract is to provide the simulators for their use as well as their training centers. And beyond that obviously a lot of Boeing\u2019s 777 customers will buy their own simulators for doing their own pilot training. So I think the scope of the contract that we have is for the sales directly to Boeing, but obviously from our perspective, while that's a great contract and we're thrilled to have it, it also gives us, we think, the position in the marketplace that we should win our fair share of end customers from Boeing who buy their own simulators. So it\u2019s the contract value specifically associated with Boeing plus future opportunities that are still to be determined.","Ronald Epstein","Now, just -- maybe just for clarity, thanks for that, but this is a bigger -- Mechtronix historically wasn\u2019t as big a player, right, in large commercial, right, and this is a nice new segment, business for them, correct or no?","Scott Donnelly","It is. So true and we bought Mechtronix obviously. Part of the rationale for the acquisition was, we felt they had some terrific technologies, very capable team and a great product, but they were a very small company and they had had some challenges and got a little over-leveraged at one point and ran into some financial trouble. And I -- that hurts you in that market, because when you look at big customers, whether it's a Boeing or a lot of the major airlines in the world, these assets are like an aircraft. They're very long-lived, right. So companies want to know when you're buying a fairly high dollar capital item that you're going to be able to be around and provide the service and support and upgrades and such overtime and I do think that one of the things that hampered them in the marketplace was as a result of their financial struggles, they had some uncertainty around them. ","So it wasn't a technical or a product problem, it was a business viability issue and obviously, when we acquired them and sort of put our balance sheet and reputation behind it, that kind of got rid of that sort of barrier with a lot of customers. So the team up there won the 737 MAX a couple of years ago. I think that they've executed very, very well on that. The Boeing folks obviously have been very happy with how the team has performed on the 737 MAX and that gave them confidence to then also make us their partner on the 777X. So if you execute well and perform well, it can sort of snowball on the right direction. But for sure, part of the underlying thesis of the deal was that we thought you had a company that had a lot of great technology, great product, great capability, but it needed to have a little more certainty and strength from a financial standpoint and I think we've provided that.","Ronald Epstein","Cool. Thank you for that. And then one more, my favorite airplane, the Scorpion, where do we stand on international interest, potential order that kind of thing for it?","Scott Donnelly","So I think there is a fair bit of international interest. We still have a lot of customers that are talking to us. We have had the aircraft dollar of the country. We've had a lot of customers flying it. Really, the next major milestone for us, well, there is really two. One is that, we've had a couple of relatively minor things that we wanted to change in the production configuration of the aircraft. We've completed that engineering work and we're in the manufacturing process right now, building that, what's called the confirming production version of the aircraft. Customers obviously want to fly that and see that before they would place an order. ","And the other issue for us was always around the airworthiness and how do you get a certification and as I think you've heard publicly, there is now an air force program, there is program office, where they will conduct airworthiness certifications of aircraft that were not funded in development by the air force and so we've already submitted our application in that process. So that's sort of a work in progress as well. So, we think this all kind of dovetails with getting the first confirming article built and ready to fly here in probably early to mid-summer. And the airworthiness program will get underway and the air force ultimately will provide the airworthiness certification of that aircraft, which is a big deal to all of our prospective customers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.","George Shapiro","Yes. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. So Frank, the corporate expense being $32 million, you said it was due to the share price. Is that though changed at this point you're thinking on corporate expense being around 160 for the year?","Frank Connor","No. I stick with the same number, George.","George Shapiro","Okay. And then just to make sure you commented that aftermarket was about 35% of revenues each year, which would imply about 3.5% to 4% growth in the aftermarket?","Scott Donnelly","That's probably about right. I'd say low to mid-single digit at this point.","George Shapiro","Okay. And you had $164 million of acquisitions in the quarter, Scott, maybe if you could just list what they were because you make a couple of small ones and it's hard to keep track of them?","Scott Donnelly","Well, the principal deals in the quarter were Able Engineering, which we announced, this is a repair and overhaul business that does sort of a mix of both Bell product as well as some fixed wing products, so we acquired that early in the quarter. That\u2019s now integrated into our aviation services network, but it\u2019s providing both work \u2013 actually right now probably more Bell than anything else. So they had a \u2013 company had great relations with a number of our customers that looked at a mix of how they maintain their fleet with a combination of both new parts as well as some parts can be overhauled. We have entered that business through that acquisition with Able and frankly that\u2019s gone very well so far.","We also acquired in the first quarter a company called ATAC. This is a company that provides tactical training and principally under contract to the US Navy, so supporting our current customers. We fly missions that allow the Navy and the Marine Corps to not utilize their own asset to provide things like touch worthy [ph] training, controller training as well as adversary forces for schools like Top Gun as well as a lot of other aggressor forces to emulate enemy aircraft in exercises conducted by the US Navy and the Marine Corps. I would also as a history doing some work for the air force, there is a number of opportunities out there that we think we continue to grow in that space. It\u2019s a nice augmentation for us until \u2013 in terms of how we address customer both in the US as well as internationally to provide training capability.","There is also a very small acquisition that we did in the quarter. A lot of the service and support that was done on a true simulation and training platforms in particular. Now, the actual simulator maintenance, which is an important part of the business that had been effectively outsourced for quite some time to a small company that was doing that. We think providing the right level of service support is critical to those products over time and didn\u2019t feel comfortable that we should be dependent on a third-party, so we acquired and it was basically acquiring those people, so that they are now part of the company as opposed to having a third-party conducting that service and support. ","George Shapiro","So the M&A impact on aviation at 1.3% that you mentioned in the slides and was that all due to service or the organic service numbers, somewhat less than the 3.5% to 4% I just mentioned? ","Scott Donnelly","Yes, but again, it\u2019s not a huge number either George, but a little bit smaller. ","George Shapiro","Okay, those are my follow-ups. Thanks very much. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Noah Poponak","Hey, good morning everyone. The 34 jet deliveries in aviation, if I take out 7 Latitudes, it\u2019s 27 ex-Latitude deliveries and last year, it was 33 total with no Latitude. So there is a six \u2013 a unit decline of 6 units year-over-year ex-Latitude in the legacy business. How should I think about that rate of change, how it run rates through the remaining quarters of the year?","Scott Donnelly","Noah, I think it\u2019s still going to be relatively flattish. I think what you\u2019re seeing there is that the \u2013 in the first quarter, as I said, January and February were pretty slow months with all the stuff going on with the market and what not. But I would say the rate of how the team is doing in terms of sales that certainly picked up in March, through April and we would expect we will continue to pick up a bit through the course of the year. So I don\u2019t think we are viewing it as very different than we originally thought when we guided. ","Noah Poponak","Okay. I mean, should I be thinking rough order of magnitude. I had something close to 30 Latitude deliveries, so call that up 15 for the year. If that six run rate, that would be close to 25, giving you a net spread of up 10. Is it in that ballpark or it sort of sounds like you are saying that negative six could improve through the year?","Scott Donnelly","I don\u2019t think that we can go into that level of granularity at this point. I mean, we are going to be up. I think we might be up a little bit more in Latitudes, but the mix when you get down into M2s and CJ3s and it\u2019s \u2013 I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be materially different. ","Frank Connor","I think Noah, our original guidance in terms of top revenue, we are still on track for that. We still in track to see most of the growth coming from Latitude. And at the end of the day, we expect [indiscernible] be approximately flat plus or minus.","Noah Poponak","And I think you said you\u2019d expect the Latitude to be mix - slightly mix negative to the overall segment margin this year. Do you expect that it to be negative or positive to the mix next year?","Scott Donnelly","I think, I'm not ready to do 2017 guidance, I think we\u2019ll - we don't know yet next year on what we\u2019re going to look at in terms of the mix of NetJet versus normal retail sales I think it would be probably premature to talk too much about that.","Noah Poponak","Understood it\u2019s - the business is moving around, I just thought maybe on that airplane you might have more visibility further output understood thank you.","Doug Wilburne","Alright Greg that concludes our call for the day, thank you ladies and gentlemen for joining us.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 10 AM Eastern Time today through July 21.

Welcome to the Textron Earnings Call. And at this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the conference over to your host, Vice President, Investor Relations, Eric Salander. Please go ahead.","Eric Salander","Thanks, Kevin. And good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release.","On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO, and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our Web site.","Textron's revenues in the quarter were $4 billion, up $285 million from last year. During this year's fourth quarter, we recorded $72 million in pretax special charges, largely related to Industrial and Textron Aviation, or $0.24 per share after-tax. Excluding these special charges, adjusted net income was $1.11 per share compared to $1.15 in last year's fourth quarter. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $650 million, up $366 million from last year's fourth quarter. ","For the full year, revenues were $13.6 billion, down 2% from a year ago. Adjusted net income was $3.74 per share compared to $3.34 last year. And cash flow before pension contributions was $642 million, down from $784 million last year.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Donnelly","Thanks, Eric. And good morning, everybody. Revenues were higher in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by double-digit growth at Textron Aviation, Bell and Textron Systems. ","The bell revenues were up largely due to higher commercial deliveries of our 407, 429 and 505 models. We delivered 76 commercial helicopters, up from 46 in last year's fourth quarter. ","On the military side, the V-22 tiltrotor recently surpassed the milestone of 500,000 flight hours. With more than 375 V-22 aircraft in operation across the US Marine Corps, Air Force and Navy, as well as internationally with Japan, this increasingly large installed base continues to drive significant aftermarket opportunities to support this highly utilized fleet.","In the fourth quarter, the Bell Boeing Program Office was awarded contracts totaling over $800 million across multiple support activities, including $375 million to provide maintenance repair and consumable material support to the US Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps operations; $218 million for logistics and engineering support for aircraft across US military fleet; $146 million as part of the Marine Corps CCRam modernization program; and $68 million for logistics and engineering support to Japan.","Bell also received an $815,000 five-year performance-based logistics contract for the U.S. Navy for upgrades to their H1 Yankee and Zulu aircraft. ","On the new product front, Bell marked the second anniversary of V-280's first flight in December. In two years of highly successful flight demonstrations, the aircraft has flown more than 160 hours to collect data and inform requirements for the U.S. Army's future long-range assault aircraft program.","In December, the V-280 flew anonymously for the first time, meeting all of Bell's demonstration flight goals, including automated takeoff and landing, conversion to cruise more and precision navigation.","At Systems, revenues were up on higher volumes, largely within our unmanned systems product line. In the quarter, Textron Marine & Land Systems announced that ship-to-shore connector Craft 100 successfully completed acceptance trials with U.S. Navy.","Also in the quarter, Textron Systems ATAC was selected as an authorized provider of contracted air adversary services for the US Air Force combat air force's contracted air support program. ATAC has also started flying its Mirage F1 fighters in support of their current U.S. Navy contract.","Early in January, the U.S. Army announced its intention to award Textron Systems a contract for four Ripsaw M5 vehicles as part of its robotic combat vehicle medium program.","Moving to Industrial, we recently completed our previously announced review of strategic alternatives for our Kautex business unit. The review considered a range of options for the business. And after careful consideration, we determined that the interest of our shareholders are best served with Kautex remaining as part of Textron. ","At Textron Specialized Vehicles, we added additional independent dealers to our new tractor distribution channel and saw continued retail volume growth in the quarter. ","Moving to Textron Aviation, in the quarter, revenues were $1.7 billion, up 11%. We delivered 71 jets, up from 63 last year, and 59 commercial turboprops, down from 67 in last year's fourth quarter.","We also initiated deliveries of new Citation Longitude, with 13 aircraft in the quarter, including the first aircraft delivered to NetJets.","I would now like to update you on the December 27 accident at Wichita Plant 3 facility. First and foremost, our number one priority is the health and safety of our employees and we're fortunate that all 12 injured employees have been released from the hospital and are recovering. ","From an operational standpoint, Cessna SkyCourier, located also in Plant 3, has been unaffected by the accident and that program is containing on schedule. Just last month, we accomplished the successful wing mate of the SkyCourier, a key milestone in the development of this twin-utility turboprop.","The plant did incur significant damage, affecting our composite manufacturing operations and we are working to recover the entire facility. We do expect some disruptions to our production that will impact our ability to complete and deliver aircraft in the first half of 2020, but we fully expect to recover by year-end with no impact to our annual plan.","In December, we announced a restructuring plan to reduce cost and improve overall operating efficiencies through headcount reductions and other actions. At Aviation, these actions largely included headcount reductions, reflecting the completion of a long period of new product development, resulting in entering into service of Citation Latitude and, most recently, the Citation Longitude.","These actions were necessary to align our cost structure within the current operating environment as we ramp up production of the Longitude, anticipate lower legacy aircraft demand and reduced requirements for ongoing development programs.","We also acquired Premiair Aviation with its three locations in Australia, which has expanded our reach of aftermarket services in the Asia-Pacific region, reflecting our continued investment to support our customers internationally.","Within the aviation aftermarket, increased volumes drove higher aftermarket revenues, which were up over 13% from the prior-year. ","In summary, we have many items to highlight in 2019 across our segments. At Bell, we continued the successful flight testing of the V-280 Valor, achieving a cruise speed of over 300 knots, improved the aircraft's maneuverability and controlling the arc [ph] to the army's highest standards for aircraft agility.","We also unveiled the Bell 360 Invictus, our offering for the U.S. Army's Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft competition.","On Bell's commercial business, we saw higher deliveries from increased order demand we've seen over the last year-and-a-half. At Textron Systems, we had wins on several key development programs, including the Ripsaw M5 selected for the army's robotic combat vehicle program, Aerosonde HQ selected for phase 1 of the army's Future Tactical UAS program, ATAC selected to participate in the Air Force CAF CAS program, and [indiscernible] selected to continue in the army's next-generation squad weapons program.","Within TSV, we launched a new distribution channel, through our partnership with Bass Pro Shops and Cabela's, an independent TRACKER Marine dealers. We also implemented a new business model to better align production with demand in our snow business and we expect both actions to drive both growth and improved performance in the outdoor powersports business. ","At Textron aviation, we certified and began deliveries of our new Citation Longitude and advanced development of two new turboprop programs, the Cessna SkyCourier and Denali.","With this backdrop, we're projecting revenues of about $14 billion for Textron's 2020 financial guidance. At Bell, we're expecting continued strong execution in 2020, with lower military production offset by higher military aftermarket and higher commercial volumes.","At Systems, we're expecting modest revenue growth, partially driven by the 2019 new program wins highlighted earlier.","At Industrial, we'll maintain our focus on our vehicle business in 2020 as we continue to improve execution and drive improved profitability.","At Aviation, we are protecting growth from increased deliveries of our new Citation Longitude aircraft, partially offset by lower legacy demand. ","We are projecting EPS in the range of $3.50 and $3.70 per share. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions is expected to be in the range of $700 million to $800 million.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank.","Frank Connor","Thank you, Scott. And good morning, everyone. Segment profit in the quarter was $340 million, down $57 million from the fourth quarter of 2018 on a $285 million increase in revenues.","Let's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation. Revenues at Textron Aviation of $1.7 billion were up 11%, primarily due to higher volume and mix, largely reflecting Longitude's entry into service.","Segment profit was $134 million in the fourth quarter, down from $170 million a year ago, primarily due to the mix of products sold and an unfavorable impact from inflation net of pricing.","The resulting margin dilution in the quarter from the mix of the aircraft sold was largely due to the initial launch to deliveries and the associated higher cost basis that included rework for modifications required by the final type certification and lower legacy deliveries. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1.7 billion.","Moving to Bell, revenues were $961 million, up 16% from $827 million last year, primarily on higher commercial volume. Segment profit of $118 was up $10 million, largely on the higher commercial volume. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $6.9 billion.","At Textron Systems, revenues were $399 million, up 16% from $345 million a year ago, primarily due to higher volume. ","Segment profit of $33 million was down $4 million primarily due to unfavorable performance, partially offset by the higher volume and mix. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1.2 billion.","Industrial revenues of $927 million decreased $81 million, largely related to lower volume and mix at Textron Specialized Vehicles, principally due to the shift in the timing of snow sales to the third quarter of 2019, reflecting the new business model that was implemented earlier this year.","Segment profit was $44 million compared to $73 million a year ago, largely due to lower volume at Kautex and the shift in volume at TSV, partially offset by favorable performance and price at TSV.","Finance segment revenues increased $1 million and profit increased $2 million.","Moving below segment profit, corporate expenses were $22 million and interest expense was $36 million. With respect to our restructuring plan, we recorded pretax special charges of $72 million in the quarter. We ended the year with manufacturing debt of $3.1 billion.","For the full year, we repurchased approximately 10 million shares at an overall cost of $503 million.","Turning now to our 2020 outlook, I'll begin with our segments on slide nine of the earnings call presentation. At Textron Aviation, we're expecting higher revenues of about $5.4 billion, reflecting higher Longitude deliveries, partially offset by lower legacy deliveries. Segment margin is expected to be approximately 8%, reflecting the dilution related to higher inventory costs and learning curve associated with the increased Longitude deliveries and lower legacy volume.","Looking to Bell, we expect overall revenues of about $3.3 billion. We're forecasting a margin of about 12.5%, largely reflecting a change in mix of military volume.","At Systems, we're estimating higher 2020 revenues of about $1.5 billion. Segment margin is expected to be about 10.5%.","At Industrial, we're expecting segment revenues of about $3.8 billion and a margin of about 6.5%.","At Finance, we are forecasting segment profit of about $20 million.","Turning to slide 10, we're estimating 2020 pension costs to be about $33 million versus pension income of $11 million last year.","Turning to slide 11, R&D is expected to be about $550 million, down from $647 million in 2019. We're estimating CapEx will be about $360 million, up from $339 million last year.","Moving below the segment line and looking at slide 12, we're projecting about $135 million of corporate expense, $135 million of interest expense and a full-year effective tax rate of approximately 18.5%.","Our outlook assumes an average share count of about 227 million shares as we continue to deploy the majority of our free cash flow toward share repurchases in 2020.","That concludes our prepared remarks. So, Kevin, we can open the line for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And the first question in queue is from the line of Peter Arment of Baird. Please go ahead. One moment please. Mr. Arment, your line is open now.","Peter Arment","Yeah. Good morning, Scott, Frank.","Scott Donnelly","Good morning.","Peter Arment","Hey, Scott. I guess I'll just start high-level, I guess, on Aviation. Just talking about the outlook, it feels like with Longitude ramping and finally getting across the goal line, that's a big step forward, but just kind of I see the legacy rates coming down. Is there an expectation on kind of unit volume you expect for 2020?","Scott Donnelly","I think, overall, our unit volume will be fairly flat for the year. So, on a unit number, we'll clearly a lot more Longitudes. So, the revenue guide is obviously up. But as I said, the unit volumes will be kind of flattish, although it will have higher unit revenues driven by the fact that we'll have a significant mix of Longitudes.","Peter Arment","Okay. And then, just on the Longitude itself, there was expectation that this was going to help a lot on the factory absorption side. Is there just a point in time or an inflection where we get through kind of the learning curves? What's your expectations around that? ","Scott Donnelly","Clearly. Look, the first quarter \u2013 really, most of the first half, we'll be selling all the aircraft that we were fabricating late last year. Obviously, a number of those have a lot of the rework that was basically inventoried and we'll deliver here particularly in the first quarter. The learning curve is going well. But for sure, we'll expect to see a more normalized margin rate on Longitude as we get into the back half of the year. So, that's the challenge in terms of the mix side is our going through sort of moving the aircraft that has incurred a fair bit of rework, certification process and then getting the learning curve under our belt, which we feel good about in terms of the early fabs and all the feeder lines that are coming into final. But we'll really start to see those aircraft that are going to deliver in the second half of the year in the final assembly line here as we get into the first half.","Peter Arment","And just lastly on just overall demand in biz jets, just what's your current take? Obviously, you've had some fits and starts with trade and kind of the stresses last year. Can you maybe give us your overall environment?","Scott Donnelly","I think it's pretty consistent with what we talked about going into the third quarter. The Longitude obviously being a brand new product and very well-received in the market, we feel good about how that's going. And, clearly, a new product like that will drive some demand activity, which is great. On legacy side, things continue to be sort of flat to down. And as we talked about in the third quarter, our approach here is that we would lower our volumes, bring back some of our production capacity, and make sure that we don't have to get into a situation where we've got a bunch of excess aircraft and start to drive pricing activity. So, I think we made those adjustments going into the fourth quarter and I think we'll hold those for our prospective \u2013 at this point, we'll hold that through 2020. If something starts to change or we see things strengthen \u2013 there's certainly a lot of conversation, Peter. It's not like the market is high out there, but getting people to commit has been a little bit softer and we saw that through the whole back half of 2019. So, I think the market has been pretty stable here for the last three to six months.","Peter Arment","Appreciate all the color. Thanks.","Scott Donnelly","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Sheila Kah of Jefferies. Please go ahead. ","Sheila Kah","Good morning, guys. I'm dropping my last name. I just wanted to follow-up quickly on Peter's question. You had 7.8% margins in the fourth quarter, 13 Longitudes out the door. So, when we think about the quarterly aviation margin cadence, does it dip below that in the first half and also putting the incident in Plant 3 into the picture too? So, is this the kind of \u2013 do we expect a steeper drop in the first half?","Scott Donnelly","Yeah. So, look, we don't normally go into a quarterly kind of progression, but considering particularly with the impact to Plant 3, I think that we will probably be somewhere in the 10 to 15 aircraft light in Q1 and Q2. We're still in the process of finalizing and understanding all the tooling, which everything appears to be repairable, but it will take some time to get the composite operation back up and running. So, given that and the progression we just talked about with Peter on the margin kind of going from a tougher margin on Longitudes and becoming more normalized as we get sort of exiting 2020, I think the progression at Aviation is going to start the year sort of low single-digit in Q1. It's going to move to a mid-single digit in Q2 and then high single-digit Q3 and double digit Q4. And again, that's really \u2013 normally, we don't kind of go into that level of detail, but I think we have to make sure people understand that we are going have lighter deliveries in Q1 and Q2 driven by the composite factory issue. And that compounded with the change of margin rate of Longitudes through the course of the year will give us that sort of progression. So, it's \u2013 again, our full year sort of intact and I think consistent with the guide that we've given you. But we clearly expect that Q3, Q4 are going to be at the more normalized margin rates that we expect out of this business. But it will be light in Q1 and Q2 given the Longitude mix and the light deliveries frankly of a lot of the legacy aircraft impacted by the Plant 3 situation.","Sheila Kah","Okay. Thanks. That's pretty clear. And sorry for all that detail in the quarter. But bigger picture question, you decided to keep Kautex. I guess what was the rationale behind deciding to keep it? And you've also announced some restructuring for two years in a row now. Where is that business today and what brings the profitability levels back up to that 6.5% range that you're guiding to?","Scott Donnelly","Well, look, Kautex, as we've always talked about, is a good business. It's been a good cash generator for us. It generates a very good ROIC, solid returns. We were asked and sort of heard from a lot of investors that maybe this is something that within the portfolio holds back our PE and our ability to generate a better stock price. So, we said, look, we're going to go look at this. We went into the process knowing that considering the profitability of that business and sort of where things were in the automotive sector that we would probably see some dilution. But some dilution versus a potential re-rate on the multiple could result in something good for our shareholders. As we went through the process, the reality was that what was the pricing in terms of what anyone would be willing to pay for that business would have created a level of dilution that there's, in our view, would have created enough of a re-rate on the multiple that would have been good for our shareholders. So, we went through the process. It was very rigorous. We looked at a lot of different alternatives and options. And in the end, there was no way for us to get our head around this being something that would be accretive for our shareholders. Again, it's a good business. It generates good cash. It generates good earnings. Look, we're also sitting at kind of a low part of an automotive cycle, but that team has done a really nice job of managing through that. And it has stayed a solid business. Obviously, we did some restructuring because we think that there's \u2013 you're probably towards the bottom of the auto cycle, but it's not going to come snapping back. So, we wanted to make sure that we make sure we adjusted the right cost, so that as we go through a period of, relatively speaking, lower volumes, we maintain good margins in the business, and I think we'll do that.","Sheila Kah","Okay, thank you.","Scott Donnelly","Sure.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Carter Copeland of Melius Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Carter Copeland","Carter, you there?","Operator","Okay. Mr. Copeland, your line is open.","Scott Donnelly","We'll go to the next one, Kevin. ","Operator","One moment please. Next question is from the line of Pete Skibitski. Please go ahead, sir.","Pete Skibitski","Scott, sorry to beat on this, so the Plant 3 issue, that's more of a revenue issue in the first half than a margin issue. Am I understanding that right? So, the margin pressure in 2020 is almost wholly due to the Longitude, is that accurate?","Scott Donnelly","No, Pete. I think that the lower volume, obviously, in Q1, Q2, considering that we period-expensed all of our R&D and our SG&A, our costs are going to be more evenly spread over the course of the year. So, when you pull 10 or 15 aircraft out, that's a big chunk of revenue. And particularly, it's a lot of our legacy good margin business. So, I think that it's a combination of both the progression of Longitude profitability through the course of the year. But the Q1, Q2 impact of missing that revenue is not trivial. And that's why I thought it would help to try to guide what we expect that margin rate to look like through the course of the year.","Pete Skibitski","Yeah. No, that's helpful. Thank you. And so, if things stay on track, I know you've said in the past you've wanted this business to be a double-digit business, is there any reason to think that can't be true in 2021 assuming \u2013 obviously, [indiscernible] on Longitude, but \u2013 and assuming Plant 3 doesn't happen again.","Scott Donnelly","Look, we're going to be careful, Pete. We're not quite ready to guide 2021 just yet.","Pete Skibitski","Of course.","Scott Donnelly","But, yeah, look, as you get into the third and fourth quarter, I would expect to see margin rates in aviation that are indicative of how that business should perform in a normal place. As I said, that should be in that high-single digit, low-double digit range. ","Pete Skibitski","Okay. Thanks, guy. ","Scott Donnelly","Sure.","Operator","The next question is from the line \u2013 one moment, please. That is David Strauss of Barclays. Please go ahead.","David Strauss","Thanks. Good morning. ","Scott Donnelly","Good morning, David.","David Strauss","You noted in Q4 at Aviation, inflation net of pricing was a headwind. Could you maybe break the pieces out there, inflation versus pricing? And then also, how you're thinking \u2013or what you've got baked in for inflation versus pricing in the 2020 guide for Aviation?","Scott Donnelly","The dynamic in Q4 was price was pretty flattish, and so that's why we have a negative because, clearly, there was some inflation in Q4. And we didn't have price to offset that. So, it was fairly flat. Again, part of our dynamic and rationale for pulling back on the volume, particularly on those legacy aircraft is to make sure that we can maintain the price levels that we have in the industry. So, I don't think we'll probably get into breaking out sort of the components of the guide around the price inflation number, but clearly we would you like to drive to get that back in balance.","David Strauss","Okay. And following up on a question couple quarters ago I asked, was on the potential upside for MAX simulators. Obviously, now it looks like there's going to be mandatory simulator training. Could you just talk about what you see maybe in terms of order interest there and potential upside from this?","Scott Donnelly","Well, we have certainly continued to see order interest, I think, particularly now with \u2013 what you're seeing out there publicly around the need for MAX sim training in some capacity associated with a return to service. That's picking up. So, we've largely been following the lead of Boeing who is our biggest customer in this space and we are going to increase the number of MAX simulators that we have in production. So, I think that's good. Look, for our total company, it's not going to be a material impact, but we will certainly see a little bit of an upside on the number of MAX sims.","David Strauss","Okay. Thanks very much. ","Scott Donnelly","Sure.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of \u2013 one moment please \u2013 Jon Raviv of Citi. Please go ahead. ","Jon Raviv","Hey, thank you. Good morning. Apologies, if you'll jump back to the Aviation margin, I appreciate that high-single digit, low-double digit in second half is normative. But really just still thinking about the overall underlying earnings power of this business. At some point, we were always thinking that this could be a pretty strong incremental margin business. Clearly, with rates down, you'd beat some of that this year, but as you kind of reemerge out of what could be a tough year this year given some of the dynamics, is it still fair to think about this as a double-digit type business going forward, given some of the changes you've made?","Scott Donnelly","Absolutely. That's our expectations. I think that \u2013 look, we obviously had a fair bit of dilution here in Q4 and expect that in the first half of next year. If you set the Plant 3 thing aside, which is an unusual circumstance, obviously, Longitude, we fully expect to be a strong margin product. It's an outstanding product. We've got a bunch of them in the field now. It's been well received by customers. It's flying beautifully. Feedback on those who have taken delivery. Several customers who are flying this thing hard is outstanding. So, I think this thing is going to a great part of the business. But, clearly, there was a lot more cost in 2019 in getting through on the certification process and all that was entailed there. And we still have costs as we go into 2020 in pursuit of certifications around the world and the entry into service. There's always some costs associated with these things as you roll them out into the marketplace. But this thing is going to be an outstanding product. It's going to be a product that has the kind of margin rates that we expect across our jet line and this is a transient problem. I think we end up in a very good place and we have very good expectation for this business to be a double-digit margin business.","Jon Raviv","Thanks. And then, you talked about how some of the restructuring is based on lower development plans going forward. Something that I think has helped you guys recently is investing in new products and the ability to drive some growth in what could be a flattish market. How do you think about that going forward? There's still parts of your portfolio, some would suggest, could use some upgrades here and there. So, how are you thinking about the skyline beyond SkyCourier and Denali?","Scott Donnelly","Look, I think if you look at the product portfolio right now in Aviation, obviously, the last five years of driving Latitude and Longitude have completely transformed our jet product line and positions in a very good place when you think the SkyCourier which is a fabulous product in a new market segment for us really. It's going to be a great growth driver. We've not been in the high-performance single. That's our rationale for Denali. It's a great market, which I think will get very good participation.","Beyond that, we obviously always have some things that we're looking at. I think there's clearly opportunity to do some upgrades and refreshes across some of the core Industrial product line in both the jet and the turboprop side of things. And so, we'll pursue those. They just won't be of the magnitude of a clean sheet, brand-new airplane like a Latitude or a Longitude. So, when we talk about pulling back on some of the R&D, I think that's just reflecting that you don't have two major 525 aircraft that are in process. So, I think we'll continue to have a robust product lineup, both in the SkyCourier\/Denali and other upgrades. So, I'm not at all concerned that we're going to underwhelm the R&D side. We know you have to do and refresh products to continue to drive growth here. Well, the same is true across the rest of our portfolio. We've obviously made massive investments in things like the V-280 program, the 525 program, put a lot of money into the FARA program, you'll actually see some R&D come down in that business as we go into next year, but that's really driven because you have things like FLRAA and FARA that have been virtually all funded under our R&D that will now start to move into a larger cost share on a couple of the government programs and clearly 525 is winding down in terms of the level of R&D to support its certification.","So, those two businesses drive the bulk of our R&D, obviously. Systems is just a smaller number, but still if you look at things that are the new programs that are happening and starting to drive growth, which we're seeing in 2020, it's as a result of the investments that we've been making in some of those product lines around everything from the next generation of unmanned air vehicles, like FTUAS. Obviously, ship-to-shore was a huge investment. As that turns to production, that's going to help to drive some growth and much improved profitability. The M5, this RCV, again, this is a lot of R&D that we've been putting into these businesses and, in some cases, small acquisitions over the last few years that are starting to turn around and drive growth in those businesses.","Jon Raviv","Yeah, I appreciate all that color, Scott. Thank you.","Scott Donnelly","Sure.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Seth Seifman of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Seth Seifman","Thanks very much. And good morning.","Scott Donnelly","Good morning.","Seth Seifman","Scott, when you talked about the outlook being for flattish overall delivery volumes with Longitude adding and the legacy portfolio coming down, there's generally not a ton of visibility. Is that expected decline in the legacy portfolio kind of a view of what you're seeing in the spot market? Or is it the majority of Latitude deliveries go to one customer and that customer is changing its mix of deliveries from Cessna?","Scott Donnelly","I'm not sure I understand entirely, Seth.","Seth Seifman","If legacy deliveries are coming down, a lot of the legacy deliveries are Latitudes to NetJets. Is NetJets coming down significantly and making a transformation from Latitude to Longitude, and that's why legacy deliveries are down? Or is it your sense of the spot market being weaker and that's why legacy deliveries are down?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I think in general, as we talked about in Q3, we expect legacy deliveries just to be down given the outlook of the overall market. You're right. When you look at a Latitude, yeah, we do expect lower levels of delivery to NetJets on Latitudes next year versus this year. And you're right, I don't think it's necessarily trade. Just where the market is right now. With Longitude coming as a brand new product, you'll see a lot more deliveries to NetJets of the Longitude class aircraft in 2020. So, yes, you're right, there are certainly \u2013 we certainly expect to deliver fewer Latitudes next year to NetJets than we had previously, but the dynamic of the legacy is it's just a somewhat softer market. Not inconsistent with how we saw it back in Q3.","Seth Seifman","Yeah, understand. Understand. And then, at Bell, you've kind of traditionally talked about Bell as a 10% to 12% margin business. Starting the guide this year at 12.5%. The business has executed very well for probably like five years or so now. Is the baseline margin for Bell kind of maybe higher than you thought?","Scott Donnelly","Look, I would still say we're in that 10% to 12% range, right? So, I think at 12.5%, obviously, that's very strong performance for that business. We feel very good about it, particularly we still have a very high level of R&D. Again, we'll benefit a little bit from having higher levels of cost share as we move some of the military programs and do \u2013 in this year, real military acquisition programs as opposed to straight IRAD funded. But, yeah, look, I think the position that Bell is in right now is quite strong. If you had a large EMD program, which tends to be at a lower margin, that's going to mix it down a little bit. But I think you're going to stay in that 10% to 12% margin rate even in that circumstance, which obviously would be a terrific news story, right, that you're driving what will be a very large EMD program with a lot of future growth in the production phase. So, I would kind of leave that 10% to 12% out there.","Seth Seifman","Okay. Thanks very much, Scott.","Scott Donnelly","Sure.","Operator","And next question is from the line of Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Spingarn ","Hi. Good morning. I wanted to, Scott, go back to the higher level view here. And you touched on valuation and your desire to improve it when you were answering Sheila's question on Kautex and disposition. And I wanted to go to the valuation and think about cash flows. You've got sales growth in 2020, but we've gone through a period here, let's say, from 2018 to 2020 where earnings and cash flows have been somewhat flattish. And that's the case in the forecast again. You've talked about a number of the reasons. What needs to happen to get the cash flow return on sales above this kind of 5% level? Other than learning curve on Longitude and some of the other puts and takes you've talked about, what is the potential for this business? ","And then, separately for Frank, just regarding the extra week, I guess, in the fourth quarter and in the year, how does that play out 2020? Are we back to where we were?","Scott Donnelly","Well, from a high level, we've had Bell that has gone over the last few years from a $4.5 billion business in the peak of the V-22 world down to $3.2 billion, $3.3 billion business. At the same time, it's been investing heavily in things like 525 and things like V-280. And obviously, V-22 has done a significant ramp down from the 40 a year to 20 a year to low double digit a year. So, I think our focus in that business has been making sure that we're investing for the future, while still maintaining strong execution and strong margin rates. And I think we've been able to do that. And I certainly think we're at a point here, as we go forward into 2020, there's some really important milestones around where the acquisition process goes, on things like the V-280 program. Finally going through and completing certs on 525. So, things that have been costs with no revenue or margin over the last few years have certainly been pressure points, right? So, the margin has stayed good, but the absolute number has certainly come down owing to the reduced revenue. But I think we're in a really, really good place to see that turn here as we go through the next few years. Systems is a similar sort of\u2026","Robert Spingarn ","You could get the revenue turn a little bit here. You've got decent revenue growth in 2020. Are you saying you catch up on the other end, 2021, 2022?","Scott Donnelly","Absolutely. I think as we said, part of what we see here in the interim on Bell is this transition from unit deliveries to a very large and growing installed base which starts to drive more aftermarket, and that's what we're seeing. What's driving the growth in 2020 is that you're starting to see the significant growth in the aftermarket side of the business, largely military, but also some on the commercial side, owing to the fact that we have a very large installed base now out there on the V-22 and the H1 programs. ","What really then will drive that next tranche of growth is driven around some of these new platforms in which we've been investing, like the V-280s and the 525s. So, that is the dynamic in Bell.","Systems is a similar story. We had some great platforms, the platforms that were sort of on the downside of their program of record as they phased out, but just start to see the new program wins. Again, the investments that we've been making that are now positioned and are awarding in winning some of these contracts that will get them this year delivering 10% plus margins, forecasting 10% plus margins. That's a good business.","The issue for us has been to get the overall business to start to drive positive revenue and we're going to see that in 2020 as we've guided and talked about. So, I think that one is already making that turn.","Aviation, again, we've gone through a very heavy period of investment that has resulted in the Latitudes, the Longitudes. It's been frustrating to see that sort of in many cases just sort of replace legacy platforms. But without having that portfolio with a Latitude and Longitude, you'd be in a really tough spot. So, I feel great about where that business is positioned. The team has historically executed very well. As we have just withdrawn production, obviously, we have a challenge around Longitude and just getting those margins where they need to be, but we clearly have a line of sight to get there as we work our way through 2020.","Obviously, that business is much more dependent on what does the end market do beyond 2020, into 2021 and we have no idea how to make that call yet. But I think we have a really good product lineup and a couple of other things in the pipeline, obviously, that will help that. ","So, our earnings have been growing, but we have had too much pressure on not enough revenue growth, and I think we're seeing where the opportunities are here in 2020 as we saw at the end of 2019 that we can get the top line to start growing.","Robert Spingarn ","Okay. Thank you for all that color.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from the line of Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Noah Poponak","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Scott Donnelly","Good morning, Noah.","Noah Poponak","Scott, any new revelations into why the business jet market deteriorated over the last 3 to 6 months? And specifically, why used inventory keeps going back up every month? You just typically don't see this in the middle of an economic cycle. Is it just \u2013 PMI, has it been weak and global growth just hasn't broken out and it's as simple as that or anything new you've learned there?","Scott Donnelly","I don't think we've seen as much growth over the last 6 months. I think there's certainly been plenty of reasons for smaller biz size business guys which is the bulk of our customer base in the jet market to have some pause. Look, you've seen is in CapEx spending, right? They've been holding back a little bit. So, I think as some of the trade things are starting to get \u2013 that noise is sort of settling down, the Brexit noise which again shouldn't have a huge direct impact on us, but it does create uncertainty in the market, that seems like it's on a path to at least becoming resolved and certain. And, look, we're in the middle of a very political cycle right now. So, I think as we work our way through the year and the politics and where things are going to land become more clearer, then I'd be optimistic that businesses would get back to a more aggressive move in terms of willingness to spend CapEx and invest in their businesses, not just in aircraft, but in general which is certainly what drove a lot of the growth if you went back into late 2017, early part of 2018. So, we're hopeful that that happens, but we need to see that happen.","Noah Poponak","Do your customers specify to you that an election is particularly concerning to them and kind of puts it on pause or not necessarily?","Scott Donnelly","I'd rather not get into the politics of it, Noah. But, certainly, there's differing views about what the business climate looks like depending on the outcome of the election. So, it's kind of natural that there be some reflection on that. But people that are businesspeople.","Noah Poponak","Yeah. And then, Frank, on the cash flow outlook for 2020, can you help us out with the net Longitude related working capital assumption you're making in there because I think you had a decent amount to unwind, but you're also still ramping the production rates. So, I would just like to understand that piece and then therefore the underlying total company piece outside of that.","Frank Connor","Yeah, kind of overall the guide, at least at the upper end, reflects one to one cash conversion on net income. So, we're generally expecting good working capital performance. There isn't anything extraordinary in there kind of relative to Longitude. They kind of continue to expect maybe some ramp in the Longitude, but there's nothing significant from a working capital standpoint kind of embedded in that. I have to say that kind of certainly 2019, we did work our way through all the headwind associated with multiyear 2, transitioning to multiyear 3. So, as it relates to 2019 cash performance, we absorbed hundreds of millions of dollars of that reversal in 2019 that did kind of reflect on that 2019 performance and kind of we put that behind us as we move into 2020. So, we're expecting that we'll see good cash flow performance in 2020.","Noah Poponak","I thought you had been saying 2019 was pretty substantially impacted by Longitude buildup and that that would release beyond 2019.","Frank Connor","Well, there's some of that, but kind of there's \u2013 you can see some inventory build if there is kind of payables from overall working capital standpoint that also go to offset some of that build. The biggest drag on 2019 was this \u2013 at Bell with the kind of government payments timing where we were ahead on multiyear 2 and then we \u2013 the multiyear 3 structure has us kind of incurring costs before we receive cash. And so, that was a big reversal that impacted 2019 that we will not see in 2020.","Noah Poponak","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Robert Stallard of Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Robert Stallard","Thanks so much. Good morning. Scott, first of all, on the business jet pricing environment, I was wondering if you're seeing any of your competitors acting in an even more irrational manner in response to the demand environment? Or perhaps you are seeing any change in response to the Longitude and its entry into service?","Scott Donnelly","Well, in general, I guess, I don't know that we have seen a huge change, Robert. This is \u2013 again, I think we probably all want to be cautious about, making sure that we're not running production greater than demand. That always will create some bad behavior in the market. Of course, it always the other guy, right? We just want to make sure we're not participating in that process. And I think we have fought to get pricing back to a reasonable level, which represents the value of the product. And I think we got that back over that 2017, 2018 time frame. So, we just want to make sure that we hold pricing and get the increases that are reflective of inflation going on. It's a perfectly reasonable business position to take I think. So, I think, in general, that's the overall dynamic as the way we see it and how we think we should behave.","Look, our Longitude pricing, I think we're pleased with that. We're getting the value that we expect to get from an aircraft that's performing very well. Customers love the cabin, the range, the speed and the price levels in there are appropriate and we're continuing to make sure that we're getting the right value of aircraft.","Robert Stallard","Okay. And then, as a follow-up and on a different matter, actually, on Kautex, and the decision there to not sell the business, if the automotive environment were to improve multiples that have moved higher, would you reconsider this sale in the future?","Scott Donnelly","I don't think we will make \u2013 we don't make any comments about M&A. We went out and we had to do this in a public way which was very difficult, as you can imagine, on our team to go through that. But our general view is we don't really want to forecast or comment one way or the other on M&A. And I think given where we are in that process, we'll go back to that practice. So, it's a good business. Does really well for us and we're going to focus on running it.","Robert Stallard","Thanks very much, Scott.","Operator","And next we have George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.","George Shapiro","Yes. Good morning.","Scott Donnelly","Good morning, George.","George Shapiro","Scott, I was just wondering we had talked about if the economic environment got more stable towards the end of the year that you would see some improvement in the business. It sounds like from your comments that you haven't. I was just wondering why you might think that is. We certainly have a pretty good environment, economic and stock market wise.","Scott Donnelly","Well, George, I don't know. I'm not trying to be an economic forecaster, but I think there's still a fair bit of uncertainty. And a lot of it at this point is \u2013 I think the trade things seem like they're quieting down, but there's still enormous amount of political uncertainty that is in front of us every day. So, I think in large part, people want to see how all this plays out. It makes a big difference when you think about tax policies and things of that nature. So, I think that the market hasn't stopped. There is still a fair bit of activity going on. There's lots of conversations going on, but it's \u2013 I think that it still does \u2013 that uncertainty does create some friction to people going ahead and doing a deal, and that's fine. Again, that's why we pulled back little bit on production and our position is that customers are going to make their decision, we're not going to just priced it \u2013 to go accelerate the decisions if they don't make that decision yet.","George Shapiro","And have you seen any tougher competition from Lombardier given the state that they are in and would you ever have an interest in their aviation part of the business?","Scott Donnelly","George, I don't think we've seen any dramatic change in the dynamic \u2013 look, lots of deals are competitive deals. And price activity and whatnot seems like it's been fairly stable. So, I don't see a big change in that. And with respect to the M&A side, again, we hope we see the articles and hear all the noise, but we would not comment on any M&A activity.","George Shapiro","Okay. And, Frank, one for you. The inventories are up like $250 million for the year. So, what is still an inventory that effectively wasn't delivered in the fourth quarter?","Scott Donnelly","Well, that's across the entirety of the corporation, George. But, again, \\we are ramping Longitude, and so there is additional inventory at Aviation that reflects that ramp.","George Shapiro","I was just wondering because the cash flow turned out a little bit weaker than you were expecting. And so, I thought maybe there's something else going on there.","Scott Donnelly","No, cash flow was right in the middle of our guide. And kind of again, as I said before, the cash flow is impacted certainly for the year by a significant headwind at Bell associated with the military programs.","George Shapiro","And then, I guess one last one. The profit mix at Industrial between Special and Kautex, you've alluded to that in the release that it was primarily Special Vehicles. If Kautex wasn't down much, it would imply that Special Vehicles didn't earn much in the quarter. Is that a correct assumption? And if so, if you can expand on why.","Scott Donnelly","George, generally, we don't get into the margin mix in the segment. I think the commentary was that, as it relates to vehicles, we certainly had a lower volume year-over-year. And as Frank said, a big part of that was snow because we delivered snow product largely in Q3 versus Q4 a year ago and we should be delivering them in Q3. So, it's a good thing that we did them in Q3 versus Q4. So, the overall volume was lower, which certainly has an impact on margin, but we don't \u2013 we're not going to breakout any more detail on the margin splits between the different sub segments.","George Shapiro","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","And next question is from the line of Cai von Rumohr of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr ","Scott, maybe update us on the upcoming down selects for FARA and FLRAA. And if you win one or both of them, what's \u2013 because, essentially, a win just a ticket to the next level of competition. What's the chance that you will be spending some of your own money? And I know the dollars that they have for you are not huge. But you'll be spending some of your own money and, therefore, that would be an earnings drag because you want to win what's really a very sizeable potential.","Scott Donnelly","So, our guide incorporates that, Cai. So, we have been spending our IRAD money with really no match on FARA and little match over the years on FLRAA. There certainly has been some government money on the V-280 program, but again largely that's been funded through our IRAD numbers. So, what we have in our plans is, if you look at 2020, the amount of R&D actually increases in Bell, but you have a much higher level of participation of government co-funding than we had just under straight IRAD funding. So, it takes something like a FARA. FARA, I think they will down select to the two companies to go do the fly off. We expect that to be in the February to March time frame is what they're saying. We love our offering. We've talked a lot about \u2013 we're thinking that this is a fabulous performance. It clearly meets the requirements. We think it's taking great new technology that we matured on 525. The army \u2013 remember, the way they are running that program is they provide a few very high level critical requirements, but they're not prescriptive in terms of how you accomplish that. So, the down select process from 5 to 2 will happen again probably in that February, March time frame. If it does happen, we will have a lot more R&D effort in the business, but it will actually be less R&D in terms of IRAD than we spent in previous periods because, again, you do have a very large portion of government cost share where we had none before on the program. So, it's relatively neutral to the overall plan, even though it's a lot more R&D because of the dynamic of the cost share.","The FARA program, again, you're right. The anticipation is that sometime probably in the March timeframe, what they're saying is they would award two contracts in all likelihood. They don't say it has to be two, but sort of the expectation I suppose is it's two. With V-280, we obviously have the expectation that we would be one of those. That's not a huge program because it really is going through and sort of crossing Ts and dotting Is and working on risk reduction towards the ultimate EMD or OTA decision which is probably still in late 2021 is what they're saying. So, that's not a big mover for us one way or the other in the year, but the FARA program is. But, again, it's not a headwind because even though you have a much higher level of R&D on that program, it does have a large cost share.","Cai von Rumohr ","Terrific. Great answer. And then, second one. The coronavirus clearly becoming a bigger issue. Have you done any preliminary thinking in terms of what this might mean, i.e. taking a look at 2003 and the SARS virus and was this a benefit to biz jets because people didn't want to travel on public air transport or were not allowed to? Was this a negative? What does it do for Bell? What are your thoughts?","Scott Donnelly","Well, Cai, it's a good question. Look, I've not gone back to 2003 to try to do that. So, I don't know that I \u2013 I certainly don't know the answer to that question. In terms of the direct impact of the company, obviously, we do business in China largely in the automotive side. So, of course, automotive volumes have already been down pretty dramatically in the last couple of years. So, weather it has a further impact on that or not is hard to tell. And I think, look, like everyone, we've got to watch and wait to see what happens after they get through the Chinese New Year and does this thing get contained and start to settle down or has it become a bigger problem. So, at this point, I think we're more or less in a watch and wait.","Cai von Rumohr ","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question on today's conference is from the line of Carter Copeland of Melius Research. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland","All right. Good morning, gentlemen. I have figured out how to use the mute button. So, for anybody who's been on A&D calls for years, this isn't my first screw up. So, thanks for having me back. Scott, I wondered if you could give us some color on the board decision around the changes to the incentive compensation plan, the addition of TSR to that and just what we should take from that in terms of what you see as the relative risks and opportunities for the corporation?","Scott Donnelly","Look, Carter, the genesis of that thing is that for many, many years, this company has been on a long term plan that kind of rolled through three years, okay? So, it was a three year plan that had TSR as kind of a wrapper, if you will, around that three-year performance. So, TSR was absolutely a factor. But the goals and objectives were set annually. And that really stems back to just enormous volatility around business jets and can you really put together a three year plan that has any credibility to it. So, the new plan obviously still has TSR. It is a direct factor as opposed to a wrap around. So, it remains a very important part of our performance objectives and, ultimately, our compensation. But we try to put together something that could do a three year forecasted plan rather than a series of one year plans that built that three year plan. So, when we try to do longer term metrics, like things around ROICs and long-term cash, and we just have to adapt and consider a lot of unknown around one of our biggest businesses, is the biz jet business where it's just hard to predict what that end market looks like over a period of three years. So, I think we've come up with a set of metrics that can accommodate some of that volatility and have a more conforming, if you will, three-year plan, of which TSR still remains an important metric.","Carter Copeland","Great. Thanks, Scott.","Scott Donnelly","Sure.","Eric Salander","Thank you. Kevin. And thank you all. With that, we can end the call.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference. We do thank you for joining. You may now disconnect. Have a good day."],"20853":["Textron (NYSE:TXT) Q3 2012 Earnings Call October 17, 2012  8:00 AM ET","Executives","Douglas R. Wilburne - Vice President of Investor Relations","Scott C.

[Operator Instructions] Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Doug Wilburne, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Douglas R. Wilburne","Thank you, Terry, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release.","On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.","Moving now to third quarter results. Revenues in the quarter were $3 billion, up 6.6% from a year ago. Our income from continuing operations was $0.48 per share, up from $0.45 in the third quarter of 2011. Third quarter manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $153 million compared to $339 million in last year's third quarter. We contributed $16 million to our pension plans during the quarter.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott C. Donnelly","Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everybody. Our third quarter results reflected strength in our helicopter industrial units, continued favorable liquidation activity in our financial portfolio and good execution at Cessna in what turned out to be a weak business jet demand environment, especially in July and August. The quarter also reflected charges \tassociated with our new fee-for-service unmanned aerial systems programs, as well as lower volumes in the Systems business.","As you know, earlier this year, Systems won 2 contracts associated with our Aerosonde platform to provide UAS services to the DoD on a fee-for-service basis. Cost estimates for these programs were based on our extensive experience offering Shadow Systems for the DoD under government-owned contractor-operated contracts. We thought most of the operating expertise would be directly transferable to the Aerosonde platforms, but it turns out, the operating know-how did not transfer well, and we had significant start-up issues during the quarter as we began systems deployment.","To address these issues, we augmented training, procedures, added resources and adjusted our estimated costs to support the programs, such that we expect they will operate at a loss during the initial phase of the contracts. Consistent with contract accounting rules, in the third quarter we recorded charges of about $14 million representing the expected losses on these contracts. So we anticipate the Aerosonde activities will be recorded at breakeven through the next 3 quarters, having already booked the estimated losses.","We are also experiencing some delays in our TCDL and SFW programs. Therefore, I think it is likely that we will miss our original full year guidance at Systems for flat revenues by about $100 million to $200 million. Looking forward, we will focus on improving program execution at Systems.","Moving to our Finance segment. We had a successful quarter liquidations as we reduced noncap to finance receivables by another $161 million, including a $90 million reduction in our timeshare portfolio, which included payoff of the largest remaining individual timeshare credit, plus a $60 million reduction in our Golf Mortgage portfolio, primarily as a result of loan sales. Our noncap to finance portfolio now stands at $458 million.","Shifting to industrial. Volume has reflected normal summer seasonality, but we continue to see year-over-year volume growth in our golf and turf and auto fuel systems businesses with an overall organic growth rate for FX of about 7.5%. We do believe that we will see some volume softness in the fourth quarter as it appears that the European export auto market and the Japanese OEM auto business, reflecting current Japanese-Chinese tensions, are expected to be slower in the fourth quarter.","Moving now to Cessna. We delivered 41 jets in the quarter, down from last year's 47, reflecting the weaker summer market. Specifically, July and August were very quiet order months with a pickup of activity in September. In the meantime, we believe that generating essentially flat segment profit with fewer jet deliveries demonstrates the progress we're making with our overall cost structure at Cessna. We also made good progress on the new product front during the quarter, starting with an announcement that we increased the range of our Latitude by 25%. Latitude will now be a 2,500 nautical mile airplane, which we believe significantly enhances the value of this offering to our customers. Our design team was also able to announce a new top speed for the new Citation Ten at Mach 0.935 preserving its gestation as the fastest commercial jet in the world.","We also had important announcements in the quarter with 3 new global company-owned service centers. Most recently, we announced the acquisition of a service center in Doncaster, U.K., which followed the announcement of a new service center in Valencia, Spain. During the quarter, we also announced the opening of a new joint Cessna Bell Service Center in Singapore. These investments in aftermarket infrastructure are extremely important to both Cessna and Bell, as they capture future annuity streams in the form of service revenue and create a stronger touchpoint with -- for our customers for future sales.","To wrap up with Bell, on the military side, we delivered 11 V-22s and 5 H-1s versus 9 V-22s and 7 H-1s in last year's third quarter. We saw another significant increase our commercial business with 46 units delivered in the quarter, up from 26 last year. This growth reflects continued overall strength in global helicopter markets, as well as the ramp-up in our 429 program and the success of our new 407GX.","To wrap up the quarter, we continue to make great progress strengthening the portfolio with Finance on favorable terms. At Systems, we experienced some execution difficulties during the quarter, and we are addressing those. Industrial has maintained growth and good operational execution in an otherwise challenging economic environment. I believe Cessna did a good job in the quarter, closing new orders in a very thin market. And they have made such substantial progress with their overall cost structure over the past year. Bell continues to execute well in both its military and commercial businesses.","Finally, across our manufacturing units, we remain committed to making investments in new product development, sales capabilities, service capabilities and manufacturing productivity.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank.","Frank T. Connor","Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Manufacturing segment profit in the quarter was $254 million, down $6 million from the third quarter of 2011 on a $154 million increase in manufacturing revenues. Let's look at how each of the segments contributed, starting with Cessna.","Revenues at Cessna were up $7 million on a year-over-year basis, primarily reflecting higher used jet sales, which more than offset lower new jet and other product line sales. Aftermarket sales were up approximately 2%, which was against a tough comparison as aftermarket sales were up 13.7% in last year's third quarter. Segment profit was $30 million, down $3 million from last year's third quarter.","At Bell, revenues were up $181 million primarily due to the higher deliveries of commercial units and V-22s. Segment profit increased $22 million, reflecting the higher volume. At Textron Systems, revenues were down $62 million, primarily due to lower volumes. Segment profit decreased $26 million, reflecting the fee-for-service charges Scott described earlier, and lower volume. Industrial revenues increased $28 million, reflecting higher volumes across most of the businesses, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. Segment profit increased $1 million, primarily due to the higher volume, partially offset by cost inflation in excess of price increases.","Moving to finance. Total finance receivables ended the quarter down $233 million from the prior quarter. Non-accrual accounts ended the quarter at $145 million, a decrease of $107 million from the prior quarter. 60-day delinquencies were $114 million, a $55 million improvement from the second quarter.","Moving to corporate items. Corporate expenses were $38 million in the quarter, up significantly from the second quarter, primarily the result of higher prevailing share price, which increased compensation-related expenses. Interest expense was $35 million, flat with the second quarter.","Moving now to cash flow. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow from continuing operations of the manufacturing group before pension contributions was $168 million versus $455 million at this point last year. The most significant drivers affecting the lower cash flow this year are lower advance payments on military contracts at Bell, an increase in Cessna used inventory, reflecting higher trading activities and the wind-down of our Citation air fractional program, plus an increase in inventories at Systems related to delayed program activity. For full year 2012 manufacturing cash flow, we are maintaining our target of $700 million to $750 million.","To conclude, in anticipation of continued positive performance at Bell and our outlook for jet demand at Cessna in the fourth quarter, we are increasing our full year EPS guidance from $1.80 to $2 a share to a range of $1.95 to $2.05 a share.","That concludes our prepared remarks, so operator, we can open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go to the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Wanted to ask about Cessna demand and orders. In the past couple of quarters, you talked about cancellations still impacting the Cessna backlog. I wondered if you could speak to where gross orders and cancellations were this quarter versus last. And then in the context of that, I believe you've commented that Cessna book-to-bill could go above 1 before the end of this year or sometime soon simply by having cancellations come down if gross demand doesn't change. I wondered if you thought, if you still think that could happen next quarter or in the next couple of quarters.","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, Noah, I would say that in terms of cancellations, the cancellation number continues to come down. It was down again in the third quarter. This issue for us, of course, is the third quarter was fairly light in terms of gross orders, so order activity, as I said, was very, very light in July and August. We did see it coming back in September. So if you look at the gross book-to-bill number for the quarter, was probably somewhere around 0.85. So obviously, for it to get above 1, we need 2 things to happen. We need to see a continued reduction in the number of cancellations. I feel pretty confident that trend is obviously going to continue. We expect the cancellations will continue to come down and are really at a point where they're becoming pretty de minimis here going forward. But we need to get better gross orders. And certainly, what we're expecting is that despite a pretty tough market here in the past quarter, that we'll see a more normal gross order level activities in the fourth quarter as compared to what we've seen in, say, '11 and even '10. So that's I think a reasonable assumption in terms of what we see going on in the market. And September was certainly better, but in terms of gross orders recovering from a very, very quiet July and August, just really wasn't in the cards.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And so I guess when you put all of those considerations in, anything you can share on the current thinking for where you'll put 2013 production versus 2012?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, I mean, we're certainly not at a point where we're ready to give guidance yet on 2013. We'll do that in January, but, I mean, I think it's obvious as you watch through the course of the year, and not knowing what's going on exactly in the market, at this point, you' probably think something that's going to be around flattish, but we'll give a more refined guidance for you when we get into our January call.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just one more on the Systems charge. Did you say $13 million, 1 3?","Scott C. Donnelly","$14 million, sorry, 1 4.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So the margin would have -- I guess the operating margin would have been somewhere a little north of 8.5%, excluding that. That's kind of trending below where you've been the past few quarters. Is that sort of the run rate going forward? Or are there other reasons that should come back up on an adjusted basis?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, I think that if you think about next quarter, in particular, the revenues that we book associated with that program being in the 0 margin, that's probably not a bad way to think. But in terms of a longer-term run rate, no, I think we'll still expect to be higher than that. There were a couple of things obviously that hit us in the quarter. One was, as you know, the charge associated with these programs, which is, frankly, are just an execution problem and one that we have to go work on. But we also had delays in some volume deliveries of programs that are good programs and will deliver. But we have deliveries that were supposed to be in the third quarter, which are now moved into the fourth quarter and even into 2013 that are good, normal margin programs. And that was also a part of what was leading to the drag on the margin rates.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Can you tell us how many used Citations you did deliver during the quarter and maybe the sales and earnings associated with that?","Scott C. Donnelly","Sure, Pete. This is something that I think is important to understand when you do the analysis on Cessna margin rates. The revenues were roughly flat, but that's because we had an additional $30-some million of used aircraft sales. So really, what happened here in the quarter, is that as a result of the light orders early in the quarter, our deliveries, as we said, was down to 41 versus 47 on the new side, and that revenue or bulk of that revenue was made up for with used jets. Now it's good that the used jet market is moving and that we're able to start -- to move more used aircraft. But the way that we account used aircraft is basically we end up selling those at 0 margin. So that's a particularly bad mix when you see fewer new deliveries and more used deliveries. And so you effectively had $30-plus million of 0 margin business in there. When we bring used aircraft in, we book them at their market value, and generally, that's about where we sell them. So it's really a 0 margin mix.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Understood, understood. And then in terms of the gains on canceled jets, less than $5 million? Or was that any meaningful number?","Frank T. Connor","Not a meaningful number.","Scott C. Donnelly","Yes, not a meaningful number.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Okay, okay. And then I guess I just wanted to ask you, one thing I'm trying to get clarity on, could you update us on the status of the business jet depreciation rules as we go into 2013? Does accelerated depreciation end at this point? And if so, what kind of impact do you think that will have?","Scott C. Donnelly","I think it's still 50% first-year depreciation.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So no meaningful change kind of going into next year?","Scott C. Donnelly","No, no. and I think the one thing, other thing, Pete, when you talk about one of the dynamics in terms of these cancellations and forfeiture deposit gains, and the other dynamic, of course, is valuation of used aircraft. As we've said over the last year or so, these numbers have become small numbers, and they are still small numbers. But I do think you have to [ph] understand that I think if you went back to the third quarter of 2011, these were sort of mid-single digit number gains, primarily driven by the fact that what few deposit forfeitures you had left was greater than revaluations. You look at this third quarter, again, it's still a mid-single digit number, but it's a mid-single digit number the other way, okay? Because there are very few forfeiture of deposit gains owing to the fact that cancellations are way down. But there's also a little bit -- again, these are small numbers in terms of revaluations, but when you add a small number the right way and the small number the wrong way, you end up with a number that's sort of like a $10 million number.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Understood, understood. And if I could just sneak in one last one, I promise. The FAA denying the 429 weight increase. Can you talk about the impact to sales there going forward and the probability that you can work around that and maybe the timing? Because it does sound like that could be a catalyst if the FAA does approve it.","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, we certainly would see it as a catalyst if they do. I mean, obviously, Canada, which is the primary touch [ph] certificate holder has approved it. We've had about, I think we're up to about 10 other countries now, have approved it, based on the Canadian approval. And so we have seen some sales. I mean, because we're able to market the full performance of the aircraft in those countries. As you know, the FAA has denied that extension. Obviously, we're appealing that, and we're working with the FAA to try to find a path to do that, whether that is through just a straight appeal on the exemption or whether there's some changes in how they view the part 27, part 29 certs. I think the FAA is trying to work with us and understand the situation and see if there's not a path to get there. But that will take, obviously, some period of time. But in the meantime, in quite a number of international markets, we're able to market and sell the full capability of the aircraft. And obviously, we hope to be able to do that in the U.S. as well.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Scott, just a couple of quick questions again on Cessna. First, can you describe the pricing environment for new aircraft? And then secondly, what the fourth quarter's shaping up to look like from a seasonality perspective?","Scott C. Donnelly","Sure, Jason. So I mean, pricing remains difficult in this environment. It's still a pretty thin market and very, very competitive. There are some models that saw some better price, and there some models that saw some worse price. And I think that's kind of been the story here for a little while, and I would expect it to be a still a bit of a struggle going forward given the market. In terms of the seasonality of the fourth quarter, again, what we're assuming in our plan is that we'll see a fourth quarter in terms of order rates and activity that was similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter of 2010 and '11.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just got one last one on Cessna. Can you just describe where we are in China from a market development perspective and just offer up some updated thoughts there?","Scott C. Donnelly","Sure. So we are actively engaged. As you know, we signed a, sort of a framework agreement with AVIC. We are in active discussions on 3 separate -- with -- the structure of these is that you've got the AVIC and ourselves and then whatever municipal government associated with particular product lines, which are in different regions of China, which was part of the plan, was to have us be in several different operations. All those 3 negotiations are, I would say, progressing well. I think we're very close to getting the finalized agreement on at least one, perhaps, two here in the fairly near future. And the third, which was sort of on the back burner for a while, has kind of come back to a more active state of negotiations. And I think we'll get that done in due time as well, so they're all progressing as we expected. And as you can appreciate getting through these negotiations and setting up new operations in -- with 3 parties at the table is not easy. But we're -- been working through that, and I think we're making good progress.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wondered if you might talk about the -- I think you mentioned briefly what you saw on services. But I wondered if you could speak to Bell and what you saw in terms of spares in terms of commercial versus military, what kind of trends you're seeing there.","Scott C. Donnelly","We don't usually break out the commercial versus military...","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Were they directionally different? I'm just trying to get -- some other competitors have talked about weak military spares. Is that a trend that you're seeing in Bell?","Frank T. Connor","It is not a trend that we're seeing, Carter. Year-to-date, we're up high-single digits, overall in aftermarket at Bell.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And briefly, you mentioned in Industrial some anticipated softness there later in the year. I wondered if you might talk to sort of the magnitude of that, what you may be seeing in terms of order trends, especially on the automotive side.","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, on the automotive side, of course, I mean, fourth quarter seasonally is always a lighter quarter on the automotive side of the business in general, because they tend to shut down towards the holiday seasons. We're expecting it actually to be a little bit lighter than it normally would be, and it's really driven by 2 things. As we've gone through the year, Europe, which was supposed to be very soft all year, we certainly saw some softness in Europe, but some portions of Europe, particularly those models of vehicles, some of the large sedan, higher-end vehicles that are very export-driven, continued to be pretty strong through the year. And we've seen some softening of that here, and we expect some softness of that in the fourth quarter as the export market is a little bit slow and as opposed to most of the softness being sort of within the European consumption. So I think that will be a trend of some softening in the fourth quarter. And then the other, which is a very, sort of event-driven exercise, is that this latest flare-up between China and Japan has effectively led to sort of a unofficial boycott of Japanese product in China. And so the Japanese, still an export, but in particular, some of our larger customers in China are Japanese OEMs that have manufacturing facilities in China. And they're taking their volumes down dramatically as a result of Chinese people not buying Japanese-branded product, even those that are made in China. So I don't think that's necessarily a macro trend. And some of that share will certainly shift to other places, but it is a -- I think it'll be a bit of a problem in the fourth quarter.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And just one last quick one. With respect to the DoD contract environment and the fourth quarter activity, usually a big quarter for the government at the end of the fiscal year. Did you see anything that looked different, either better or worse, given sequestration sitting out there?","Scott C. Donnelly","No, I can't say that we've really seen anything very different. It is still very difficult to get through the contract-negotiating process and the order processes. It's taking extraordinarily long periods of time to do that, but that's a trend that we've seen for the last couple of years. On the sequestration front, you hear sort of anecdotal things from different people about people either trying to accelerate getting something under contract or delaying something under contract, and everybody wants to attribute to sequestration. I'm not really sure you can do that. I think people are sort of trying to read the tea leaves or read things into different activities also, say, with sequestration. Our view on sequestration is, in light of the fact that the government has not guided DoD, DoD has not guided the contractors, that we need to just let this thing play out. Obviously, some of our larger programs, like the multiyear that we currently have with V-22, we would not expect any impact on sequestration on that. We don't see it as a huge issue for us in the very near term. And so rather than worrying a whole lot about it, I think we need to wait, and let's see what happens as we go through November and we go through the lame-duck session and get to where sequestration is either invoked or not invoked or how it's invoked. I would say the good news for us is we will give you our guidance in the mid part of January. And by that time, I think we're going to know a whole lot more about where this sequestration process is going. But for us [indiscernible]...","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Scott, I thought I'd kick off with Cessna. You mentioned you had some, an increase in used sales this quarter. But I was wondering if you could comment on the broader used business jet market, how the inventories are looking, how the pricing is looking, and perhaps how financing is tracking as well?","Scott C. Donnelly","I would say the used market, if you look at it, it has picked up. The number of transactions has increased across the whole market. Obviously, we see that in our business. In terms of pricing, it remains quite flat. And also when the books come out, each quarter, there's, obviously, there's normal depreciation of valuations, but we haven't seen big moves one way or the other. I mean, we've seen some models where they've ticked up slightly, and we've seen others where they've ticked down slightly in terms of how BRF and the Blue Book guys view the aircraft. But so I would say on the positive side, transactions are happening, the market is moving. But again, I think there's still -- even though the numbers have come down dramatically, it is still probably in all fairness more of a buyers' market than it is a sellers' market.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And on the financing, how easy is it for customers to get financing for used aircraft, do you think?","Scott C. Donnelly","I'm not aware that there's any particular issues. I mean, again, most of the aircraft that we deal with, particularly the older aircraft, are probably at a price point right now where it doesn't take a whole lot of money to get a reasonable LTV on a note, and people seem to be able to get financing.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And secondly, on Bell, you mentioned that the civil helicopter market showing some good strength there. I was wondering if you could comment on how your market share has been tracking, and what your initial thoughts might be for where 2013 could go on the civil helicopter market?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, I think the market has remained strong. We feel pretty good about how our products are doing out in the marketplace. I would say that we believe we are still continuing to gain some share, and we'd like to think that we'll continue to do that. I think the 429 has proven itself to be an outstanding helicopter and is doing very well and competing and winning around the world. Things at the new 407GX that came out, is doing is ordinarily well, I think, and continues to pick up share in that segment. So when you look at some of those new products that are out there, and I think John and the team have done a very nice job of sort of doubling down on our sales efforts and increasing the number of resources we have out there to make sure that we're covering all the regions. We continue to do very well, and I think we'll -- I feel pretty good that we'll stay on the trend.","Operator","Next we'll go to the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Just a couple of other things coming back to Cessna. Scott, just thinking about Q4, you characterized some more seasonality to 2010 and 2011, but those were actually very different years, right? In 2010, we had a triple in Q4 versus Q3 with that big back-end load, and then last year looked a little bit more normal. I just wonder if you can put a little bit more of a fence around this and give us some color on what to expect in Q4, what's anticipated in your guidance for Q4 for Cessna.","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, look, Jeff, I think we have been sort of guiding for the total year to be up modestly. And I still believe that's where we're going to end up, is up modestly. As you know, we've tried to work hard all year to get this thing to be more level loaded. We certainly did not want to have the kind of a hockey stick delivery year that we saw, for instance, in '10, and to some degree, in '11. Obviously, we were successful at doing that in the first couple of quarters. We saw deliveries that were well ahead of the pace or deliveries that were well ahead of the pace of what we've seen in those previous years. I would be kidding if I didn't say I would've hoped the third quarter would have been a little bit stronger in terms of the number of deliveries, but the summer months were pretty tough. But again, as I -- seeing what happened in September and we look at what we need our deliveries to be to be up modestly over last year, I think that, that's still a reasonable plan. So it'll be a few more deliveries in the fourth quarter than I would have liked to in terms of trying to level load this thing a bit more, given a few deliveries light in the third quarter from where I would like to have been. But I think given the order environment and what's going on, I think that's still in the cards.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","And then just thinking about the outlook going forward, and obviously, everybody's crystal ball is pretty darn cloudy. But you made the comment after kind of a slow summer, you see some return to kind of normalcy. I mean, is there something your customers, in particular, are pointing at? I mean, does the market get better in your view regardless of who wins the election, for example? Is it -- what kind of body language, if you will, to the extent that there is any, do you get from the customer base and the outlook the next quarter or 2 in order intake?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, Jeff, I would say that if you look -- and again, Cessna, our primary customers are small and mid-size businesses. And there's no question that a lot of these guys are looking at a very uncertain next few months, right? I mean, you've got an election coming up here in a few weeks. You've got the whole so-called fiscal cliff, you've got tax policy, you've got sequestration. There's plenty of reasons to right now and say, \"Jeez, I don't know what's going on.\" I personally believe that -- well, okay, so a lot of these guys would probably prefer to see one outcome versus the other in November, but on the other hand, I think people will wake up the morning after the election, they may be happy, they may be unhappy, but to some degree, people are going to have to dust themselves off and say, \"You know what, I got to get on with my life.\" Right? So I think that a lot of these things that are giving people pause right now will -- people will get over these things, right? I mean, so as I always like to say, it's -- you'd rather have good policy than bad policy, but at least have policy, know where things are going. And so I think that the election will play out somewhat like that. It'd be better to go one way than the other, but either way, I think it takes some uncertainty off the table and that's probably good for the market.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","And just finally from me and I'll yield the floor. Just can you give us any color on where the 2013 delivery of -- deliverability of backlog stands? In other words, how much long-tailed stuff is still in backlog and how much is conceptually deliverable in '13?","Scott C. Donnelly","Jeff, we have not been given our sold-outs or anything like that. I think that -- I mean, you guys see the backlog number from a dollar basis continuing to come down. I think that the market, the way I would see it in 2013, at this stage of the game, is going to be very much a repeat of the 2012 market. So the bulk of what's out there, the bulk of the activity that has to happen in terms of selling aircraft, is going to involve getting orders for aircraft. So that's the way we've been playing here for a while and I think at this stage of the game, that would be my view of how 2013 continues to play out.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","How much of the $28 million in profit at Finance was gains on liquidation sales, sales of assets? And do you expect TFC to be in the black in the fourth quarter?","Frank T. Connor","So Cai, I think TFC is probably closer to breakeven in the fourth quarter and kind of, there were the -- of the profit at TFC, about 2\/3 of that profitability was non-captive in the third quarter, related to both kind of good liquidation activities at Golf, as well as some non-accrual returns in the timeshare business. So the captive business was about 1\/3 of the profitability. There was kind of some good credit performance embedded in that, as well as just kind of more normalized profitability level out of the captive business.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, terrific. And getting back to Cessna, Scott, could you give us some -- you've done a fairly good job, but maybe some more color with respect to strength or weakness by geographies and by product? I mean, certainly looking at your mix in the quarter, the big stuff was up year-over-year. The little stuff wasn't in terms of the jet. So give us some color on where you see the weakness.","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, I think on the -- if you look at the deliveries of jets themselves, Cai, you're right, the mix is favorable, in that it's been tending more to the sort of CJ4, XLS Sovereigns and the Mustangs in particular. So that is good mix for us. In terms of the question around geography, our deliveries in the quarter were about 2\/3 in the U.S. and about 1\/3 international, and that's versus a trend we've had that's been more like a 60-40 trend for the last few quarters or so. So if you look just at the jet deliveries themselves, I think that was a positive for us in terms of mix. The issues that were a little more trouble was having a lot of used aircraft in there, okay, which is very bad mix, in that they're basically just a pass-through, so they're not a margin. A little bit of, obviously, I would say, net pricing continues to be a challenge. So even though you had some good mix in there, I think we continue to still battle a little bit with some loss of price. And then as I said earlier, while they're small numbers, they do matter in terms of the overall result at this point, just because the overall number is small in terms of percent of naught percent, are things like the residual and the fact that thankfully, as a result of cancellations going down, we're not seeing a whole lot of forfeiture gain. So those are sort of the primary issues that are going on in terms of mix, Cai, that sort of nets out to where the operating margin landed, good on the new jets, challenged by used and again, some relatively small numbers, but things that are headwinds associated with price and just sort of the other items like residuals, values and gains associated with deposit forfeiture.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","If I look at the sales, it looks like either the prices were down or the parts and service were down, because given on those deliveries, I would have gotten a slightly higher sale, so is that the case for parts and services down? And secondly, was R&D up sequentially in this quarter?","Scott C. Donnelly","No, R&D was not up sequentially, so that was not a headwind for us. Parts and services were up, but only by a very small, 1% or 2%. And again, we didn't see a real change in dynamic in the service business in the quarter, but we're just comparing against the third quarter last year, where it was up about 14%. So and I would expect in the fourth quarter, our parts -- we'll continue to see the rate of parts and services, which was healthy in the quarter, but it was just on a V basis, a smaller piece of it [ph].","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And then you had the spectacular performance at Bell on strong V-22 deliveries. Can you comment on how large were your cum catch profits on that program in the quarter? And how much more gas is left in that tank?","Frank T. Connor","There were not cum catch adjustments, or EAC adjustments, on those programs that had any impact on the numbers.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I had a question on the core kind of gross margins in Cessna, because I guess it sounds like R&D isn't doing very much, some effect from the used aircraft which you've discussed a lot. But I guess overall, when looking at the gross margins in that business, do you feel that there's still a lot of room operationally to push that higher? Or now it's really a function of waiting for volumes? And I guess on pricing, you had mentioned on the last earnings call that your sales force had tried a couple of price increases. The rhetoric this time is very different. So I guess if you could give an update on how that went on the price increase efforts and when you think you'll next try those same efforts again.","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, I think we made some moves on a couple of aircraft types where we saw demand that we thought warranted the market tightening up enough that we could get some price through, and we have seen that on a couple of models. But we continue to have some other models where we're not able to get price through. So it's sort of a -- there's definitely mix within each model type, Julian, it's not that we don't believe we can get the price through on each model. I mean, so, yes, we've had some success, but in some areas we have not had success in driving that price. And that very much has to do with just the dynamic of the market right now and the number of opportunities out there and what the competition looks like. So obviously, that's something we'll continue to work on, and I think that getting a little bit of stronger demand obviously would help that in the marketplace. In terms of our gross margins, we continue to work the gross margin side of the business. I think we have made some overall improvements in the total cost structure of the business, both fixed and variable, and we'll continue to drive that. So we're not going to wait for volume to save us on that thing. I mean, we continue to drive productivity across all sides of the business, and I think there's still some opportunity for us to get better at that even with flat volume. Obviously, our plan here is try to position these things with a cost structure so that we get very good leverage when the volume comes back into the business, which I think is inevitable. But we're not going to just simply sit and wait for that either. So the cost activities will continue regardless.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then, just quickly, I wondered on the Hawker assets, I mean, you gave some update last time, if there was anything to add this time, in your thinking.","Scott C. Donnelly","No, there really isn't. We haven't -- we continue to sort of watch what's going on, and obviously, as everyone knows, they've been in sort of an exclusive negotiation period with the Chinese buyer, and to the best of our knowledge, that process is continuing.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then finally, just quickly on Bell commercial, in a lot of industrial end markets, you're seeing some slowing in larger project CapEx. It sounds like Bell commercial, though, in terms of order intake, still very, very good. I just wanted to make sure that, that was the case, you haven't seen any slowdowns or deferrals there.","Scott C. Donnelly","No, we haven't. Our order intake and strength in the market on the commercial side seems to be sustaining.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro","One more on Cessna and then a couple of others. Was there any LIFO benefit last year or this year?","Frank T. Connor","Yes -- there was not a LIFO benefit this year. There was a kind of mid-single-digits benefit last year.","George Shapiro","Okay. And then actually one more on Cessna. And then, Scott, as you looked at September this year, how did it compare to September last year? And I don't know if this is -- you can say it or not, but if you got similar orders the rest of the year that you got in September on a month basis, would the book-to-bill be above 1 in that situation?","Douglas R. Wilburne","Well, before Scott answers, because I -- let me just say that trying to go down to a month-by-month compare [ph] is a very slippery slope, because when an order comes in one day to the next and so forth, I think that's a difficult thing. But obviously, you picked up September recovered. And if that continues, that would certainly be what we hope for.","Scott C. Donnelly","Yes. George, I mean, I just, again -- Doug's right, I want to be careful here not to get into quarterly order flows, but let's say from an overall color standpoint, the third quarter this year was certainly very September-loaded. If you consider sort of that rate, then that's kind of the market dynamic we think we need to be able to meet our total year guidance of up modestly. So the answer is, kind of flat. Yes. Right? I mean, if we can maintain the order rates that we saw in September through the balance of the year, then I think we end up meeting our guidance of being up modestly for the year, and that's kind of our expectation.","George Shapiro","September this year, Scott, compared to September last year was better, I assume?","Scott C. Donnelly","George, I'm sorry, I do not have the month-to-months on this year versus last year. The third quarter this year was just slightly below the third quarter of last year, but I'm sorry, I don't know. I just don't recall off the top of my head the dynamics of the exact number of aircraft orders per month in the third quarter last year.","George Shapiro","Okay. And then switch to the Systems. The charge that you took on those contracts, Scott, I thought those contracts were like 3- or 5-year contracts. Are they broken into yearly pieces, so you'd have a 0 margin for the first year and then the opportunity to make money in the second year of those contracts or...","Scott C. Donnelly","Yes, that's correct. I mean, they're -- effectively, George, they're broken into options, okay, or task orders is the way they do it. And so -- but if you look at the task orders, they roughly break down to sort of 1-year duration task orders. So we have already been operating under the first couple of task orders associated with one contract. We've just begun the first task order of a second contract. And so these charges pertain to those initial task orders. And so we have effectively, we -- and the way we do our program accounting, the way we treat our EACs, all the stuff that we would normally look at, we treat looking at those on sort of a task order basis. So yes, the charge relates to our view of those task orders, the costs associated with those task orders and that's how we drive the charge. So you're right. These are, depending on those numbers of task orders that get exercised, they're probably more in the 3- to 5-year sorts of ranges. And so obviously, these can still turn out to be good programs. But our execution here in the initial phases of executing these first few task orders has not been good, and that's what's reflected in the charge, and obviously, we're going to do everything we can to work hard and be able to meet that even booking of the balance of these initial task orders and obviously to position ourselves in a way that we get the kind of profitability that we expected on those future task orders.","George Shapiro","And then maybe one for you, Frank. I mean, just give us an update of what pension might look like for next year, if you had to mark [ph] them up today?","Frank T. Connor","Sure. And obviously, it's -- there's a lot that can happen between now and year end, and we haven't kind of run any of the numbers definitively. If we maintained the existing assumptions from this year kind of going into next year, there'd be a slight headwind associated with next year's pension number, a kind of $15-ish million type number. Obviously, it remains to be seen kind of what the underlying assumptions are ultimately related to return and discount rate. On the discount rate side, we've given some sensitivities in our 10-K, but kind of for instance, a 50-ish basis point change in discount rate, has a $30-ish million kind of impact on pension expense, to give you some sensitivity around kind of those assumptions. So that's kind of generally the framework. And obviously, there's kind of fair amount that can happen between now and then in terms of what those numbers ultimately look like.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","As you talk about Cessna being flattish into '13, I guess I would have thought you'd get some contribution from the Citation Ten and M2 coming into the market. Are those not going to be big contributors? Or is the rest of the core business more where you're seeing the kind of the puts to the gains on the Citation Ten and M2?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, we will see some Ten activity, although that is very more sure as the latter part of 2013. We will have, we think, a reasonable volume of M2s as that comes into production. But we're still -- and then this is why -- I mean, I'm trying to be careful, because I'm really not trying to guide a number, okay? But I mean, just given the overall market dynamic, there can be some positive contribution by the fact that we have some of the new product getting out there, but we're also seeing not a market recovery through the course of this year that we would necessarily have liked to have seen building the kind of momentum into '13 that we would have hoped for. Now maybe that'll change as we go through the fourth quarter, right? So fourth quarter is always a very important quarter and we'll get a lot of these other issues around elections and fiscal issues and whatnot, out of the way. I think we'll be able to provide you a lot more visibility into our thoughts and rationale for how we get into 2013 guidance.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","The other one, Frank, you talked about the reason for lower manufacturing cash flow year-to-date. And I think you cited Bell advances, higher Cessna use, Systems inventory growth. I'm just curious, 4Q looks like it'll have to be as good as what was last year's 4Q, which was really quite impressive. I'm just curious, are there any of those things that you talked about as being weak points in the first 9 months that are the triggers for reverses to get you over the hump in the fourth quarter? Or just what's the put and take to kind of get you where you need to go?","Frank T. Connor","Yes. I mean, as you kind of do the numbers, essentially, we're looking at a fourth quarter this year that was similar to fourth quarter last year. And that's -- we always have a seasonally very strong fourth quarter. Obviously, the seasonality at Cessna, some seasonality at Bell, contributes to that, the timing of some of the kind of group payments coming from the military customers in terms of performance-based payments and just other contract activity, and we generally see significant inventory liquidation because of that seasonality. And kind of other seasonality with some of our other businesses result in the fourth quarter. So kind of we do expect that we will see similar cash performance this fourth quarter as we saw last fourth quarter.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Is there a big tick up in Bell backlog in the fourth quarter?","Scott C. Donnelly","So Bell backlog, remember, there's always a couple of things that happen with Bell in the military side because we take things into backlog as they're funded. The one issue that I think we should be sensitive to is that last year was the last year of the funding of the final year of the multiyear one contract, okay, which generally goes into our backlog in the fourth quarter. Given that the next funding increment to go into backlog will be associated with the next multiyear contract, which I don't believe will be definitized and completed into -- some time in the first, even second quarter next year, that will come to backlog, but I don't believe it'll come to backlog in the fourth quarter like it generally does.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","But that's not a big year-on-year headwind to cash?","Scott C. Donnelly","No, no, no. That wouldn't be calculated [ph] at all, in terms [ph] of the order. I thought you said -- the question was order, so...","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It was, yes.","Scott C. Donnelly","Yes, okay. The order seasonality will be a bit different just because of the dynamic of the next multiyear, but that should have no impact on cash.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of David Strauss with UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Scott, back to Cessna, a lot of questions on what your guidance was for the fourth quarter, but I think last you had out there, you had Cessna revenue guidance for the full year of $3.4 billion. Does that still imply? Because if it does, it seems like it implies a fairly big delivery number in the fourth quarter.","Douglas R. Wilburne","Yes, David, Doug here. I think that our guidance will be more around a $3.3 million [ph] area plus or minus depending on where the exact deliveries come in.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then while we're on that subject, because I think you said Systems now $100 million to $200 million lower, what about Industrial and Bell relative to the prior guidance?","Douglas R. Wilburne","I think Bell will come in maybe just a little bit higher than its original guidance of $4.2 billion, and obviously at this point will probably exceed the top end of our range of margins maybe by about 50 basis points. With respect to Industrial, I think that we had originally guided to an approximately flat revenue of $2.8 billion. That'll probably come in about $100 million greater, even with the softness in the fourth quarter. And margins there should be at the top end of our range of 6.5% to 7.5%.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And on Systems, if -- taking your full year guidance, it seems like it implies a fourth quarter that's flat to up versus last year, as compared to this quarter, that was way down. I mean, what changes in the fourth quarter relative to what we saw in the third quarter?","Douglas R. Wilburne","Our catching up with some deliveries, David.","Scott C. Donnelly","Yes, there were some deliveries that were pushed on the volume side from third quarter to fourth quarter. Some of those actually will go all the way into 2013, but certainly, there's some of that delivery that moved from third to fourth is what contributes to that.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Can you tell us which program, Scott?","Scott C. Donnelly","Primarily around our TCDL program for the Shadow, data link updates.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then last question, thinking about 2013 and cash, obviously, you have a fair amount of debt that matures early in the year. But thinking beyond that, could maybe Frank talk about pension contribution next year, and then maybe addressing the dividend and what you're thinking on potential share repurchase for next year?","Frank T. Connor","Yes. Certainly, on the pension front, we, first of all, obviously, kind of will give guidance in January and we'll talk about that. We're still going through our budgeting cycle. We will continue to contribute to the pension plan in 2013, and we will continue to prioritize, as you mentioned, cash towards debt pay down early in the year where we have a significant amount of maturities coming due. But we certainly have cash on the balance sheet and cash from operations to satisfy that. And then, from there, we'll look at other applications of cash. And kind of we're just going through our planning cycle right now, so it's too early to kind of talk about what that looks like. And the focus, certainly, for the first part of the year, will continue to be on that debt reduction and contributions to the pension plan. We talked in our disclosures about kind of over the next number of years, continuing to prioritize some amount of cash towards pensions in the amount of kind of $50 million to as much as $400 million a year to continue to fund those liabilities. And that all depends around, in part, the interest rate environment and the discount rate environment, and therefore kind of the funded position as well as the performance of the portfolio. So we'll continue to look at that as we plan out next year as we go through the next couple of months.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Steve Levenson with Stifel.","Stephen E. Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Could you give us figures, what percent of the fleet at Cessna is available for sale? And within that, what percent is current models?","Scott C. Donnelly","Steve, I have to get the numbers out here, because I don't want to quote an incorrect number, but there has not been a huge change, really, since last quarter. We were still sitting in the 12% total fleet, but I don't know that we give it on a model-by-model basis, but of the in-production models, the number has really been sitting down around the 6% or -- kind of range.","Frank T. Connor","Mid- to low-single digit depending on the model.","Stephen E. Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","That's good enough. And do you find yourself any closer to potential orders for V-22 internationally?","Scott C. Donnelly","I would say that the international V-22 opportunities are, in my view, still looking very feasible. There are several that are in process with customers that appear to have a very high level of interest and are requesting information and sort of initiating that process. These are all FMS programs, so they have to go through the LOA\/LOR notification -- going through that whole exercise, but they are in various states of making progress.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","You -- on the last call, you had talked about R&D ticking up in the second half of this year at Cessna and just -- I know you don't want to talk about specific dollars or percent of sales, but can you just talk a little bit about how the R&D profile looks now with Latitude, Longitude, Ten and others? And then, year-over-year, how should we be thinking about next year's growth in R&D?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, as you said, we don't like to get into the numbers on a business-by-business basis. I would say that, like everything else, one of the things we're trying to do is make sure that we're being productive and efficient in our R&D spending. So it is still a very high level of spending compared to revenue. But I do think we've reached a point where it's probably not a headwind when we think about our percent of sales on a go-forward basis.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then I know we've talked a lot about Cessna, but just as you look at the fourth quarter, there's really only 10 weeks to go, do you have unsold positions remaining this year in this fourth quarter? And is in the Cessna, all of the variance between -- in the $0.10 between the low end and the top end of the EPS guidance?","Scott C. Donnelly","Yes, there are unsold positions and that's been sort of typical as we've gone through the last few years. There are obviously a lot of discussions going on with customers. And so the process we go through to determine what we think the deliveries will be is, in fact, based on some orders converting to sales within the quarter. In terms of the variability of the range -- I mean, there's a couple of moving parts in there. Certainly, Cessna is part of that. If we were to come up light on deliveries that would obviously be part of that. There are still a lot of things on the systems side of the business that have to deliver in the quarter. And that drives part of that variability. That's probably the bulk of the range. But for sure, Cessna is always, in the market that we've been in, a significant piece of the variability of our range.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Just to follow up on the used aircraft sales at Citation, I was just wondering, is the majority of that related to trade-ins on the large NetJets order that you guys had? And if so, I'm just wondering what the profile is going forward. Should we assume that, that $30-something million is kind of constant over the next couple of years? Or do you expect that to come down? Just any kind of color there if you're able to.","Scott C. Donnelly","So, as Frank said, I mean there's a portion, maybe 2\/3 of the used that's going on in inventory in terms of our increase in sales that's associated with trade-in aircraft. And I think that trade-in aircraft is a bit of the reality of where we are in the market right now because when you talk about relatively short-cycle sales, the ability for people to go out and externally market that aircraft, wait for it to sell before they take delivery, is challenging. And so as a result, we've been doing that and then we take it and turn those aircraft over. The other part of the used in terms of inventory, and obviously some of the sales is, the unwind of our CitationAir fractional business. So those aircraft are put back and we unwind those fractional transactions, those also go into our used aircraft and then we turn around and need to go market and sell those aircraft. So I don't know -- I mean, I would say right now that we probably have had more trade-ins on a per aircraft, new aircraft transaction than we typically do, and we would expect over time to see that number start to come down again. But yes, there are certainly...","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","You'd expect it to be less of a headwind in 2013, is that a fair statement?","Scott C. Donnelly","We would like to see [indiscernible]...","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Marginalized?","Scott C. Donnelly","2013. Yes, we would like to see fewer trade-ins.","Frank T. Connor","And just to be clear, that $30 million was the year-over-year change in used. That's not the total used. The total used is a larger number than that. Total used...","Scott C. Donnelly","Right. That's a -- when I gave the $30-some million number, that's a year-over-year comparison that we had, in -- greater, $30-some greater, in used aircraft sales as opposed to new jet sales.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just a quick one.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host and your facilitators, as well as your Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Doug Wilburne. Please go ahead, sir.","Douglas R. Wilburne","Thank you, Steven, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release.","On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer.","Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.","Moving now to fourth quarter results, starting with Slide #3. Revenues in the quarter were $3.4 billion, up 3.3% from a year ago. Income from continuing operations was $0.50 per share compared to a loss of $0.06 in last year's fourth quarter, which included net charges of $0.55 per share. This year's EPS included a previously disclosed $0.06 after-tax charge at Cessna related to an unfavorable business arbitration award. Also, this year's fourth quarter per share results are based on an average share count of 291.6 million shares, which reflected the repurchase of 11.1 million shares made over the course of the quarter under our 2007 board authorization.","Moving to cash flow. Fourth quarter manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $625 million, bringing our full year manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions to $793 million. Full year pension contributions were $405 million, which reflected an additional contribution of $224 million made during the fourth quarter.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott C. Donnelly","Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everybody. Despite weakness in our automotive and business jet markets, we grew manufacturing revenues in the quarter as a result of strong military and commercial demand at Bell along with increased deliveries at Textron Systems, E-Z-GO and Jacobsen. Operationally, results were excellent at Bell and in line with our expectations elsewhere. Obviously, we had a couple of disappointments in the quarter with respect to the arbitration charge at Cessna and in other issues that emerged at our fee-for-service UAS program at Systems.","While we've made good progress with the training and interior operational deficiencies we discussed during our third quarter call, we have experienced some aircraft engine performance issues in the fourth quarter, which resulted in a pretax charge of $19 million. We believe we've identified the underlying causes that are affecting engine performance and have committed the resources necessary to address these issues.","Looking forward with these charges we've taken, we now assume both of these programs in ISR Services will generate 0 profit for 2013.","Positive news at Systems in the quarter was that we had better overall delivery performance resulting in record quarterly revenues and significant deliveries for Shadow retrofit units and Senzor Fuzed Weapons. Therefore, as we look to 2013, we see a return to top line growth and a significant improvement in margins led by growth in UAS revenues, primarily from delivery of TCDL systems.","Switching to Industrial. As expected, we saw volume soften in the fourth quarter at Caltex as a result of both European and Chinese automotive markets. Greenlee was essentially flat while E-Z-GO and Jacobsen both saw good growth, reflecting new product introductions and ongoing efforts to expand our distribution channels for customers. For the year, we posted a 10 basis point improvement in margins at Industrial on 4% revenue growth.","Looking at 2013. With continuing uncertainty in European markets, we're taking a conservative view and expect a slight increase in revenue and margins.","Moving to our Finance segment. The fourth quarter capped a 4-year effort to liquidate our noncap to Finance business. During the quarter, we reduced our total Finance receivables by another $65 million, bringing our 2012 liquidations to $820 million and our 4-year total to $8.7 billion. That leaves only $370 million in noncap to receivables, which we will continue to reduce opportunistically.","This is the last call in which we will plan to highlight receivable liquidations as the size of our noncap to portfolio is now essentially immaterial.","Moving now to Cessna. With the U.S. presidential election and fiscal uncertainty intensifying this -- during the quarter, we saw an unusually slow business jet demand, resulting in 53 jet deliveries, down from last year's 67. In total for the year, we delivered 181 jets versus 183 last year, again reflecting that economic and political volatility that developed during the second half of the year.","Looking toward 2013. We're planning on deliveries to be modestly higher than 2012, although we do expect a back end-loaded profile. This is essentially the result of our new model rollout plan this year with new Sovereign first delivering in the third quarter and the M2 and new Ten in the fourth quarter. We also believe we'll see a degree of uncertainty in the jet market as Washington works through its fiscal challenges, but we believe demand will solidify as those uncertainties are reduced.","On the aftermarket front, we acquired 2 European service centers, one in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland and one in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, bringing our own global owned service center footprint to 15 facilities. We also signed 2 joint venture agreements in the quarter with our Chinese partners for final assembly and sales activity in China for the Caravan and the XLS plus as we continue to believe that China represents a significant growth market for our Cessna product family.","Longer term, we're still expecting overall jet growth to develop as global economies gain momentum, emerging markets develop further and our new products roll into the market.","Wrapping up our operations review with Bell. Execution across programs continue to be outstanding and which reflected our strong margins in the quarter. We delivered 9 V-22s and 6 H-1s and 65 commercial helicopters versus 7 V-22s, 6 H-1s and 62 commercial helicopters in last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, we delivered 39 V-22s and 24 H-1s, compared to 34 and 25 last year.","During the quarter, we received an undefinitized V-22 contract for lot 17 and long-lead funding for lot 18, which we're hopeful will lead to the signing of a second multiyear procurement contract once the DoD receives authorization to approve new multiyear contracts. We also continue to actively pursue FMS opportunities for both the V-22 and the H-1.","On the commercial front, for the full year, we delivered 188 helicopters, up 50% from last year's 125 units, reflecting our investment in new products and increased focus on the commercial helicopter market. For example, we just received an order for 5 429 helicopters from the Turkish Forestry Department, which follows on the Turkish order placed in December of 2001 for 15 429s for their national police force.","The 429 also continues to receive regulatory approvals for additional 500 pounds of lift capability, bringing total certification to 14 countries including Canada, Brazil, China, and most recently, Chile.","The new 407GX is also selling very well with the recent order for 20 units from Air Methods.","Demand is also solid for our 412EP with contracts recently signed with the Colombian Navy and oil production transport companies in Mexico and Egypt.","Looking to 2013, based on our commercial backlog and an active order pipeline, we expect a solid increase in commercial deliveries once again.","In summary, despite continued volatility in the global economic environment, I think we had a solid year.","Our business units: Textron Systems had a number of important program wins, including the Canadian TAPV contract, 2 UAS service contracts and the Navy Ship-to-Shore development program.","At Industrial, last year's 4% top line growth reflected our continuing investment in new products and distribution.","Cessna improved margins, expanded its service footprint with new service centers, initiated our China growth strategy, announced the new Citation Sovereign and expanded their product launch family with the new long-range Citation Longitude.","Bell achieved record full year performance, announced the new 525 Relentless super-medium helicopter, won the #1 customer service rating for the 18th year in a row and opened a new joint service facility with Cessna in Singapore.","At the Textron level, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet as we liquidated most of the remaining portion of our non-captive to portfolio while generating nearly $800 million in cash for our manufacturing operations. Consequently, we reduced our consolidated net debt by $974 million to $2.6 billion even after making discretionary contributions into our pension plan. We also returned $272 million to investors through repurchased shares during the fourth quarter.","Yesterday, our board approved a new $25 million share repurchase authorization under which we intend to purchase shares to offset the impact of dilution from stock-based compensation and benefit plans, as well as for opportunistic capital management purposes.","To wrap up with our 2013 guidance. We're projecting an overall revenue increase of about 6% and EPS from continuing operations in a range of $2.10 to $2.30.","Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions is expected to be $500 million to $550 million, reflecting a significant increase in expected cash income taxes.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank.","Frank T. Connor","Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Manufacturing revenue was up $85 million in the quarter, generating an increase in manufacturing segment profit of $11 million.","Let's look at how each of the manufacturing segments contributed, starting with Cessna. At Cessna, revenues were $901 million in the fourth quarter, a decrease of $110 million on a year-over-year basis, reflecting a 21% decline in new jet deliveries, which more than offset a 12% increase in aftermarket revenues. We posted an operating profit of $23 million, down $37 million from the fourth quarter of 2011, reflecting the $27.4 million in pretax arbitration charge and lower deliveries.","At Bell, revenues were up $139 million, primarily due to higher volumes. Segment profit increased $10 million on a higher volume and mix.","At Textron Systems, revenues increased $58 million, primarily due to higher UAS and SFW volumes, partially offset by lower ASV deliveries. Segment profit increased $44 million, reflecting charges of $60 million in last year's fourth quarter and the higher volumes this year, which were partially offset by this year's $19 million charge.","Industrial revenues were essentially flat while segment profits decreased $6 million due to cost inflation in excess of price increases.","Moving to the Finance segment. Credit quality continued to improve with 60-day delinquencies of $90 million, $24 million lower than at the end of last quarter. Non-accrual accounts were $143 million, down slightly from $145 million at the end of the third quarter. The Finance segment reported a profit of $2 million, which reflects earnings in the captive business and a break-even results in the non-captive portfolio.","Moving to corporate items. Corporate expenses were $43 million, up from the $39 million last year, primarily due to the impact that higher share price had on compensation expense. Interest expense was $38 million, up $11 million from a year ago, primarily as a result of $7 million in interest income booked in last year's fourth quarter associated with the collection on an asset sale.","Our tax rate at 27% benefited from the impact of foreign taxes. 2012 results do not include the benefit of recently extended R&D tax credit as that will be recorded in the first quarter of 2013.","Turning now to our 2013 guidance, beginning with pension expense and looking at Slide 9. We're reducing our discount rate assumption, which results in an increase of just over $50 million in 2013 pension costs.","Turning to Slide 10. We're planning an increase -- to net increase R&D expense -- our spending to approximately $515 million or 4% of sales. We also plan to increase our CapEx this year to about $550 million compared to $480 million last year. These investments support our new product development and cost improvement strategies.","Now flipping to Slide 11. Here is a summary of 2013 segment guidance. We're expecting about 9% revenue growth at Cessna, reflecting growth in jets and aftermarket with segment margins in the 4% range. At Bell, we expect overall revenues to grow approximately 5%, reflecting a modest increase in our military revenues and good growth in the commercial side of the business. We're expecting margin headwinds at Bell this year, primarily due to lower military margins as well as slightly higher spending on R&D and S&A, resulting in a margin range outlook of 13% to 14%.  At Systems, we're looking for top line growth of about 9%, led by growth in the UAS revenues with segment margins in the range of 9% to 10%. As Scott mentioned, we're expecting revenues and margins to be up slightly at Industrial, reflecting continued softness in Europe, offset by growth in other regions. At Finance, we expect that captive business will generate profit in the range of $10 million to $15 million in 2013, while our non-captive portfolio is expected to approximately break even.","Moving below the segment line and looking at Slide 12. We're projecting about $160 million of corporate expense, which primarily reflects the impact of an assumed higher share price.","Our interest expense estimate, at about $115 million, is down primarily as a result of scheduled debt retirements, most notably our convertible notes, which mature in May.","We're expecting a decrease in our tax rate to about 29%, primarily reflecting the impact of the U.S. R&D tax credit extension. We're estimating that credit will provide a total benefit of approximately $22 million in 2013.","Looking at Slide 13. We're assuming an average 2013 share count of about 281 million shares, which reflects the share buybacks we made during the fourth quarter, the expected retirement of our convertible bonds and associated collar on May 1, and share repurchases in 2013 sufficient to offset dilution from share-based compensation and benefit programs.","With respect to our EPS guidance, take a look at Slide 14, which explains the $0.23 change from our 2012 results of $1.97 to the $2.20 midpoint of our 2013 guidance range. First, there is a headwind of $0.12 due to lower earnings at Finance; the increase in pension costs is $0.11 per share; R&D and depreciation represents a headwind of $0.05; lower interest expense provides a pickup of $0.06; and projected tax rate provides a benefit of $0.07; and the lower share count adds about $0.10. Therefore, we expect our underlying manufacturing business to generate an approximate $0.28 increase in EPS.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Steven, we can open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Peter Skibitski of Drexel Hamilton.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Two questions, I guess, on Cessna. Scott, are you thinking that for the first half of next year maybe deliveries could be down year-over-year just because of what you mentioned, the lateness of the new model deliveries?","Scott C. Donnelly","I do. I mean, I think, Peter, if you think about the year as being up slightly and obviously last year the first half of the year was probably stronger than normal, the second half of the year was weaker than normal, I would expect more or less the inverse of that this year, in part driven by the fact that all those new models are second half-loaded.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Got you, got you. Okay. And then can you give us a sense -- I know trade-ins are becoming such a bigger part of the business. Can you give us a sense of the revenue of trade-ins in 2012 and maybe how you see that going forward?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, I don't know if I'll do the exact number, but yes, trade-in sales were up on the -- well, particularly, on the quarter. And I think, generally, they will continue to be up. We have seen a fair bit of trade-in activity, Peter. A lot of that is driven by people that are placing orders and buying aircraft on relatively short cycle and they do need to monetize their existing aircraft for those folks that have aircraft. So we have been taking a higher ratio in terms of number of trades than we normally would. I'd say the good news is the aftermarket, used aircraft market, is doing okay. It's moving pretty well. So most aircraft that we're taking in, we're turning them over in sort of that 1- to 6-month time frame and I would expect to continue to see that. So there will be higher churn of used aircraft going through our book, but I think that, again, the market is doing fine and we are able to turn those aircraft around.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Okay, very good, very good. And then in terms of your guidance next year at Cessna, you talked about modest unit delivery increases, but it looks like about a 10% revenue increase. Is that just continued aftermarket strength as well as maybe a little bit of a mix shift to the higher price point models?","Scott C. Donnelly","It is. I think you're going to see sort of low double digit on the aftermarket side and slight gains in both the new aircraft, as well as probably an increase, sort of reasonably strong increase in the used aircraft market.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Joe Nadol of JPMorgan.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question is on the cash flow outlook. Scott, you noted that the higher cash taxes are taking a big bite. Could you just give it a little bit more context as to is this the year that we get to sort of -- to become a full taxpayer on a cash basis? And any other items that are -- that we should think about in terms of the bridge from 2012 to 2013 cash flow?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, that's really the primary driver, so you're right. I mean, I think that we certainly feel we'll be paying our fair share this year in cash taxes. And that's really been just timing associated with other things over the last few years, so we have not paid as much cash tax. That certainly catches up with us this year. We're talking about used aircraft. I do think that we will see some positive cash flow as we work some of the used aircraft balances down. But other than that, it should be relatively straight conversion of NOP [ph] into cash. Obviously, as Frank said, we will have some higher CapEx spending this year. And again, that's primarily driven by a number of new product programs that are going on, particularly at Bell and Cessna, and as a result of some facilities capital that we're spending with Bell as we consolidate what was multiple facilities in the Fort Worth area into principally one location.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. You noted that your new models, your 3 more new models -- or 1 new model with 2 updates are important to your forecast this year. Can you speak to how those -- how they're tracking, particularly the M2? I was thinking that might be delivered in Q3. It sounds like Q4. So is that slipping, or is everything on track there?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, first of all, the programs are going extremely well. Flight test activity is underway with all the aircraft. We have not run into any issues, so we're pleased with the performance and how they're doing. Of course, we do have to go through the FAA certification process. That seems to be tracking reasonably well at this point. The M2 is one that we'd like to get some third quarter deliveries, but I think the way the certification date is going to fall, that's going to be difficult to do. So I think that most, if not all, will be in the fourth quarter. But again, the program and the product has been well received and it's not having any impact in terms of our expectations for the number of units that we'll ship in 2013.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just finally, could you just expound a little bit about upon the Systems and the UAS issue? And I guess, specifically, is this a continuation of what we saw last quarter or are these discrete and new issues that popped up?","Scott C. Donnelly","No, it's a good question. I mean, the issues that we initially ran into on the Services contract were with respect to our ability to get people trained to the appropriate level to be ready for the increase -- basically, just the ramp of the program in terms of people going in theater and operating the aircraft. We put a very robust training process in place and we have not seen any continuation of that. In fact, the off tempo has gone up significantly both at -- or in the UAS program, as well as our ISR program, so for both customers. And the good news is on the second program, on the ISR Services side, we didn't see any training-related issues because we had learned from the initial launch on the MEUAS program the training programs have been effective and worked, and as a result, we seem to be in good shape even as we added a significant number of resources for ramping those programs up. What's new, unfortunately, is that as we started to fly on the first Services contract, we have run into what I believe is a number of different issues associated with the propulsion system on that aircraft. And so we were losing more aircraft than we had in our plan. We have engaged our folks from Lycoming, obviously, who are experts. They've been doing a lot of testing and evaluation. We believe we understand the critical issues that were resulting in the early failures of these propulsion systems. We have been able to implement a number of fixes already. The good news is that we are seeing improved performance in the field in terms of the MEUAS program. We are not seeing those problems with our second customer, again as a result of things that we have learned on the first program. But at this stage of the game, we don't have enough hours really logged on the second program, so when we think about estimating our cost to complete, we really have to look at the total of the combined programs. So obviously, we're disappointed. We did not anticipate having these kind of problems associated with the engines. We've taken significant charges as a result of that, but I do think we're seeing progress in terms of our ability to understand exactly what were those problems and put fixes in place that appear to be having an impact in the field.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Julian Mitchell of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just on your Cessna sort of outlook. I mean, your -- if I look at the guidance, I mean, the incremental margins in Cessna have been running at around about 19% to sort of 20% in the last 2 years. I guess, your guidance implies it stays around that level in 2013. I just wondered if you felt there may be some more volume leverage given you're in the fairly early part of the recovery and whether that incremental margin is conservative, or is it the fact that you think that earnings will be extremely weak in the first half and that's why the incremental margins for the year as a whole are only going to be maybe 18%, 19% on your guidance?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, I think, Julian, part of what you're seeing is there an increase next year in used aircraft as part of that revenue. And sort of by design, the way we typically bring those aircraft in and how we book them, those are typically sales at 0 margins. So that obviously has a dilutive impact on the overall margin rate. That's principally what guides that number to sort of net out around that 20% -- 19% kind of range.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And what sort of pricing trend in Cessna does the guidance embed?","Scott C. Donnelly","Flat.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then lastly, just on the Systems business. If we think about the guide for '13, you're implying a sort of 30%-or-so incremental margin. How much of that is just coming from normalization following the charges in '12 and how much you're assuming sort of underlying business gets a little bit better on margins?","Scott C. Donnelly","So I think, Julian, if you -- the way to think about the business is we had guided last year that '12 margins would have been in sort of that 9.5% to 10.5% kind of a range. If you take out these charges, unfortunately, with our Services contract, that's really where we were. And I think if you look at next year, the reason we guide more in that 9% to 10% range is because we have the revenue associated with those programs basically at 0 margins. So I think the margin performance on the balance of the business is where we expect it to be and would have been consistent with this year's guidance. The reason you see a slight decrement to that in terms of our '13 guide is because you do have the revenue associated with those Services contracts and they're 0.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Scott, the Cessna backlog is down again sequentially. I know you guys have discussed how Cessna has shifted from a backlog business to a shorter-cycle business. But presumably, this backlog can't go to 0 and it become just an inter-quarter sales business. So how much lower can backlog go before you have to lower production? And you sort of alluded to it in your prepared remarks, but what's embedded in your 2013 production in terms of how you think orders will compare to production throughout the year?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, I mean, look, Noah, we would certainly like to see some backlog start to build, obviously, as we introduce and get closer to the launches of things like Latitude and Longitude, we would expect to see some build in that area. We announced the new Sovereign relatively late in the year, obviously, and not in a great environment in terms of what was going on in the economy. But I would expect to see a start to build some order book of the new Sovereigns. But the bottom line is, I don't think people should be terribly surprised. I mean, the fourth quarter -- frankly, the second half of the year was not particularly strong in the business jet market. That being said, there's no reason to believe that there's going to be a -- that's not going to normalize and we're going to get back to sort of where we felt in the beginning part of 2012. With respect to production rates, again, we look at this on a very regular basis and anticipate what the order flow is going to look like based on what's going on with customer activity, and that is what is setting our production schedules as opposed to looking at backlog. This is a classic example. If you look into 2013, we're guiding to what we believe will be a modest increase in a number of jets. Obviously, that's based on what we see going on in the market, what our anticipation is in terms of order flow. It takes into consideration, though, as we set production rates, how many aircraft went from '12 to '13. As you know, we've been trying to make sure that we're forecasting this very accurately. There's no question that we would have expected higher sales in both the third and fourth quarter than what we actually saw and we've adjusted our production rates in 2013 accordingly. But we still believe, if you look at the market, you see what's going on with customer activity, where we believe the cycle is, that we still think it's appropriate to build towards a modest increase in deliveries in 2013.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, so that's helpful. And can I interpret that to mean we should expect Cessna backlog to continue to decline in the first half and then potentially start to build in the second half given everything you just said?","Scott C. Donnelly","No, no. Look, we're guessing it, obviously, right? So, yes, I think as we get closer to making deliveries in having the availability of the new Sovereigns that I would expect to see some order book built for that product. We have a limited number of Sovereigns to sell here in the next few months because we've stopped production of the Sovereigns, right? There's only a few aircraft that are left, frankly. So as we start to talk customers about Sovereigns, they're all going to be moving into aircraft that are not going to be available for delivery until third quarter.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And if I can ask one more, if I'm looking at your Slide 11, the segment revenue and margin outlook. If you had to identify the one number on here that has the most upside potential and the one number on here you're the most concerned with to the downside, what would those be?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, yes, I'm always most concerned about Cessna just because the sensitivity around what's going on in the market. We don't have a whole lot of control over what the market is doing. And as you know, the backlog, it's not something we're  -- we can just ride the backlog. It does depend on orders and conversion to sales. So that's, I would say, probably the highest risk item. But as you guys know, we have, over the last year few years, tended to over-perform at Bell. I'm sure people will think that there's over-performance opportunity at Bell. I think we can probably push Bell towards the top of the range. But we are going to have -- we're stopping the ramp here, right? So the ramp on the V-22s and the H-1s is kind of coming to its conclusion, so I don't see a lot of leverage on increased volume and we are seeing continued growth on the commercial side of the business. And how that mix plays out will largely impact, I think, what opportunity we would have to outperform on the Bell side.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","I just wondered if we can just delve a little further into Cessna margins in the quarter. Was there any particular or unusual items with used aircraft gains or other adjustments, or was that a good representation of what was going on just operationally in the business?","Scott C. Donnelly","I think it's pretty representative of what was going on operationally in the business. There was a little bit higher sales in terms of used aircraft on a year-over-year basis, but not a huge number. And obviously, the thing that really impacted us the most, Jeff, was the arbitration settlement at $27 million. So you put that back in there, I mean, I think what the team has done, frankly, as I said, obviously, we had lower revenue, lower jet -- new jet deliveries than we would have expected. And I think what you're seeing is the team's doing a nice job on costs. They're doing a nice job on efficiencies within the business. And we moved some volume through there. I think the guys are ready to make it a much more profitable business.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Yes, that's certainly my point. I mean, revenues were down $200 million and you got a high mix of Mustangs and basically held margins flat year-over-year, plus or minus a few basis points. Is there something to read into the Mustang strength? If you look at the historical relationship between business jets and profits, it has broken down, where certainly the lead lag is extended relative to prior cycles. Is there something going on to read into Mustangs being actually reasonably decent and maybe strong here in terms of just the lower end of the market actually firming up?","Scott C. Donnelly","Jeff, it's difficult to say. I mean, I really -- to be honest with you, as we go from quarter-to-quarter, it seems we see moments in time where the lower end of the market, be it Mustangs or CJs, seems like there's more inquiry and more demand. And then we have quarters where it seems to be more on the Sovereigns and the XLS side. So I think the market is still a little bit skittish, so I don't know that I would look at one or the other. It really does seem to swing as we go through the year. It's peculiar that we seem to see spikes in interest in different sizes and different classes of aircraft, but I can't say that I've been able to figure out how to correlate that to anything.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Yes. And then just on kind of the whole production question, back to that. You finished the year strong on cash flow. It does look like inventory did not decline as much sequentially as it typically does. Is there a dozen or so whitetails, or maybe they're greentails, maybe they're in whip or something, but is there a little bit of backup in the system to think about as we move into the first quarter?","Scott C. Donnelly","Yes, there is. I mean, without a doubt, we would have expected more fourth quarter sales at Cessna and those aircraft, which really are sort of the greentail. I mean, obviously, as we are working around customers, we focus our completion center activity around the demand that is there. But there's no question, there's more inventory tied up in that -- that latter stages of whip and going into the completion center than we would have expected. We always have had these discussions around the fact that we are building to a forecast and that's what we're going to continue to do. We've, generally speaking, been about where we expected. There's no doubt we were light in terms of sales activity in the fourth quarter. But again, it does take a bit of a hit on the inventory side, but these are perfectly good aircraft. And obviously, we're selling them as we speak. So it's more of an issue of looking forward and adjusting what we need to do in terms of 2013 production to accommodate the fact that we did have more whip that rolled from '12 into '13.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","And just a quick one, for Frank, if you have the number. What -- where did you end up on just your final pension funded status for the year?","Frank T. Connor","Yes, we're at a deficit of about $1.3 billion. So the obligation is about $7 billion and the assets at $5.7 billion or so.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Jason Gursky of Citi.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Scott, you mentioned that the pricing assumption for this year at Cessna is flat. Can you let us know whether that represents an improvement relative to what you saw in all of 2012, and particularly, the fourth quarter?","Scott C. Donnelly","I'd say that price has been relatively flat. We've seen some models better than others. I would say, frankly, in the fourth quarter, we certainly had some opportunities to sell some aircraft that would have reflected some significant downward pricing. I mean, people are trying to play that game. And I think our decision was we're going to walk away from some of that. So part of the behavior here in terms of pricing, I think, does have to get out of trying to move aircraft and that's behavior we're trying to see. So there's no question there were few aircraft that could have resulted in negative pricing in the quarter that we're just not going to do. So but I'd say, generally speaking, it has been flattish. And as we said earlier, that's kind of how we're thinking about it in terms of how we guide into next year.","Douglas R. Wilburne","The map on this is -- Jason, the map on this is a little bit not straightforward because we got the new Sovereign coming in and the M2. So how you kind of look at that versus last year becomes definitional. But we'll expect better pricing on those 2 relative to what's been happening generically otherwise.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, I agree. No, it is helpful to look at it on an apples-to-apples basis, I hear you. And then, Frank, in your prepared remarks, and maybe it was in response to a question, you suggested that there was some cost inflation in the Industrial division that hurt margins on a year-on-year basis. Do you have any numbers to back that up or you could provide to us? And then can you describe the types of things which you're doing to help offset any of those types of headwinds?","Frank T. Connor","Yes. I mean, it was really year-over-year on a quarterly basis. And what -- we typically do see some kind of inflationary headwind relative to price, particularly the Caltex business, and we look to offset that with performance. And so that can kind of jump around quarter-to-quarter. We also, under our Caltex contracts, recover some elements of cost inflation, but there can be a lag to doing that. And so we do get some quarterly fluctuation in that and so we just had some fourth quarter fluctuation. But generally, between kind of performance and price, we're able to offset the inflation and that's what you'd see if you look at the full-year results for Industrial. And then for the quarter, it was between $6 million and $7 million, yes, but it was not a big number.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Robert Stallard of Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Scott, on the Cessna front, you mentioned that you've been getting things done on the used market. I was wondering if you've been seeing any improvement over the last 3 months in the used pricing or the used fleet that's out there?","Scott C. Donnelly","Yes, we have seen better deals on pricing in the used market, so -- and I think that, that just in terms of publicly available data that's out there, I think it would corroborate that people are seeing a little bit of an uptick in used aircraft market. It's not overwhelming.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes. And what about the fleet for sale, has that changed at all?","Scott C. Donnelly","It's continuing to marginally drop, not a huge change, though.","Frank T. Connor","It's around 12%. And we're just -- I mean, we continue to see very good turnover.","Scott C. Donnelly","As I said earlier, most of aircraft that we're bringing in, in a 1- to 6-month cycle, we're moving them back out. So from our perspective, obviously, the rate of turn to move these things is what's most important because we are, basically, providing a service to our customer to modify that aircraft, allow them to get a new aircraft, and then we want to move that aircraft on.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Right. And then at Bell, you mentioned about V-22, you've had some success in signing up further lots. But it looks like the multiyear has slipped out. If the sequester kicks in, does that impact the ability of the Marine Corps to sign up to this multiyear? And at what point would you start to get concerned if it doesn't get signed?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, the issue with the multiyear is that as long as we're operating under a CR, they do not have authority to sign multiyear contracts. There was actually an attempt in -- to put that in and make an exemption so that you could do multiyear and that did not go through. So they had no authority to sign any multiyear contracts, be it our programs or any other programs. So it really has to do with getting legislation passed that actually gives them a budget and gives them budget authority to do multiyear contracts.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","But in terms of your timing, if we were still here in the middle of the year, would you start to have problems with long lead items?","Scott C. Donnelly","No. So what they've done is, they've gone ahead and awarded an undefinitized contract for lot 17, which would be the first lot of the next multiyear, as well as the long lead material procurement for lot 18, which would be the second year of the multiyear. So because they do have authority under the CR to award individual contracts on a year-over-year basis, they are continuing to do that. So what you're seeing with the award of lot 17 and the award of long lead material under lot 18 is on schedule and gives us the ability to deliver to what the multiyear plan would be. But just because of their contracting authority, they can only do it on a year-by-year basis.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Right. And are the terms on that comparable to what you've got on your current multiyear?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, there was a price negotiation that was undertaken and is concluded with respect to the next multiyear. Certainly, the margins, as part of that negotiation, have been reduced as you would expect normally happens when you've driven a lot of productivity and you end up with another contract. The issue, of course, is with a multiyear deal now, it's incumbent upon us to go try to figure out how you get those margins back to where they were.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of George Shapiro of Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro","Scott, I wanted to -- at Bell, the guidance to 13% to 14% margin where you almost did 15% in '12 and you're one year closer to the end of the current multiyear with the V-22, you think you'd get a margin pickup, are you being conservative or is the mix between commercial going to be that much higher that you're figuring there's a lower margin? And if you could just go through what was your commercial book-to-bill in '12 and kind of what are you looking for in '13?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, on the military side in terms of delivery, George, it's going to be relatively flat on the V-22 and H-1 front, and it is increasing. Again, we think we'll see another year of solid growth in terms of increases in the number of commercial deliveries. Also, as I said, as we increase our R&D spending and we stop having the leverage on the military side of increasing those numbers, our costs are somewhat higher in terms of what's embedded in overhead rates, and therefore, that is putting some pressure even on the military margin rates on a year-over-year basis.","George Shapiro","Okay. And then one on Textron Systems. I mean, where is the growth actually coming from? I mean, it looks your guidance are like a little over 9%, up year-over-year, and in military business that most people will be down 5% on average. And the margin there, it seemed a little aggressive to me given that the growth is probably coming from the TAPV, some of the 0 -- low to 0 margin programs. So just wondering where you're getting the profit guidance there?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, we expect to see increased deliveries in a number of areas in our UAV business and our -- I would expect to see some increased revenue in our Sensor Fuzed Weapon business. The TAPV and the Ship-to-Shore which, of course, are still in the early stages and the development phases do not contribute a lot of revenue in terms of deliveries in 2013. So it's really the core parts of SFW and the UAV business that we expect to see driving revenue growth.","George Shapiro","And then just one on Cessna. Did you see any difference in the bookings after the election versus prior to the election or in January? Have you seen any difference where they did not change the depreciation rules so there wasn't any adverse impact on general aviation?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, George, unfortunately, we were hoping to see a bit of an uptick after the election got behind us. I would say that didn't happen and from -- at least from our perspective, and certainly talking to our customers. All the stuff that was going on with the so-called fiscal cliff, most people chose to sort of wait that out, and so they did. So the normal -- I mean, frankly, the number of customers that we have sort of in the discussion phase all look very normal. The amount of activity going on are all very normal. But the mess that happened as we went through December, I think -- November, December, just led people to say they'd stand back. So we have seen delivery. We have seen orders obviously here as we've gone into the beginning of the year. I'd say we probably have had more order activities than we're used to seeing right at the beginning of January, but I would say that's probably a result of people waiting out to see what was going to happen. Remember, they didn't come to a conclusion and decide at least what they were going -- what little they were going to do on the fiscal cliff until beginning of January. So that, clearly, was a problem.","George Shapiro","Okay. But the fact that the tax laws were effectively not changed for general aviation, did that provide a little bit of a trigger here, you think, in terms of your comment that you're seeing a little better order activity here in early part of January?","Scott C. Donnelly","George, I always think the bonus depreciation is sort of beneficial, but on the fringe, right? It's not going to cause somebody to buy an aircraft or to upgrade their aircraft. I mean, you've always been looking at a 5-year depreciation schedule here. So whether you're doing 20% a year over a 5-year period or whether you get half in year 1, it's not a huge issue. So if people have room in tax, we've seen that drive their behavior. As you know, we always tend to see a stronger fourth quarter because people have always wanted to get that first year depreciation in the current tax year, and so that's always driven some cyclicality into this business. But the difference between 50%, 20%, yes, beneficial, but I still believe sort of on the margins. People don't buy an aircraft because of tax depreciation in terms of bonus.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Carter Copeland of Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Quick -- a couple of quick clarifications and then a question. Just briefly on the Cessna margin for next year, if we -- obviously, we add back the arbitration charge from the quarter, you'll be for this year close to the low end of where the guidance is for next year. And as you sort of go through the headwinds and tailwinds for next year, it would seem that used aircraft will be a headwind, R&D is potentially a headwind, mix is potentially a headwind, but volume is your tailwind. Is there any -- are there any other tailwinds there other than just improved performance out of the team that you're looking to, to see the margins come in a little bit better?","Scott C. Donnelly","No, I think you've capped it pretty well. Mix is relatively neutral. We continue -- I think if we look at our forecast for the year, the mix won't help or hurt a whole lot. Obviously, some new models coming in is beneficial to us, particularly with the Sovereign block point in the latter half of the year. So the headwinds really are increased used, which does not carry much volume or margin with it, a little bit of R&D headwind. But primarily, this is going to be how does the team do operationally. And again, I think our momentum going into the year is good. The activities that Scott and the team have been driving in terms of operational efficiencies are working. And we get some additional volume, obviously, that will be a good leverage.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And presumably, aftermarket is a bit of a mix benefit as well, so...","Scott C. Donnelly","Yes, it is. And I think we'll see, again, solid growth in the aftermarket.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. With respect to Bell and the margin in Q4, was there anything to note in terms of cumulative catch-up that benefited the margin to speak of?","Scott C. Donnelly","Yes, there's always some cume catch in terms of the program. You see accounting in the quarter. I think in terms of year-over-year, we had a pretty tough comp. We have very good mix of commercial aircraft in the fourth quarter a year ago. We probably did not have as good a mix in terms of the types of commercial aircraft that shipped in the fourth quarter this year. But overall, over the span of the year, obviously it was a very good year on the commercial side, and I think we'll see that momentum continue into '13.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And lastly, on the repurchases and the outlook for that for next year or for 2013. I wondered if you might share some detail on the decision, repurchases versus dividends, and why you chose what you chose in terms of opportunistic capital deployment on repurchases instead of maybe upping the dividend?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, I mean, there's a couple of things going on. Obviously, one, which we mentioned, is we feel like it's appropriate to be offsetting the dilution associated with the employee compensation and benefit plans, the 401(k) matching and things of that nature, and so that accounts for us somewhere in the neighborhood of a few million shares a year. And so that's one thing that we want to make sure that we offset. In terms of summer activity this year, we know we have a convertible coming up here in May and we want to try to be offsetting some of the dilution associated with the retirement of that instrument. And in terms of going forward again, we'll continue -- as a minimum on the anti-dilutive offsets and based on our perspective in terms of the company and where stock is, what do we think is in the best interest of the shareholder. And I think at this stage in the game, our conclusion was allocating some of that cash to retiring some of the shares is probably the most share-enhancing strategy in terms of capital deployment right now.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Cai Von Rumohr of Cowen and Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Last year, on the fourth quarter call, you projected R&D in 2012 at $590 million. You just reported net R&D of $504 million. So what's the difference between R&D and net R&D? And on a net basis, what did the R&D do in 2012, and where was it up if it was up?","Scott C. Donnelly","So, Cai, so the R&D was up. It was up principally driven in Bell. At Cessna, we were not up as much as we probably originally thought. That's driven primarily by the fact that if you look at our programs and the fact that we were taking Sovereigns basically out of production to bring in the new one, and a number of other changes we made, and particularly around deciding to do the Longitude program, and therefore not a couple of the things that were more shorter-term upgrade programs, we were able to shift a lot of our engineering resource from what would normally be sustaining minor change things into our primary new product programs. So we were able to staff a lot of those major programs without having to increase a lot of our R&D dollars. We would expect the same to continue to next year. So we'll see modest increases in R&D, and again, principally driven by increases at Bell and some increases at Cessna as we ramp up those programs. In terms of this net R&D, we're trying to show what is the true headwind, if you will, from an EPS perspective as opposed to not sort of all engineering as opposed to necessarily the R&D tax credit-type things that benefit or specifically fit the R&D definition. So it's reflective of all our engineering. Because what basically happened, Cai, is we're letting table a lot of our engineering that really is associated with not historically R&D, but a lot more sustaining engineering and instead move those funds and resources into our new product programs.","Frank T. Connor","Just to be clear, on the net versus what we called R&D before, they're the same. We just put the word net in there to clarify that it does not include those items that are reimbursed by third parties like the government.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, but, so you reported $504 million. The year before, you reported $484 million. You were going to be up $100 million. You were only up $20 million, is that correct?","Scott C. Donnelly","That's right. And that's principally driven, as I said, by the fact that we've been able to take a lot of our other engineering resource, which was not engaged in R&D programs, it was doing sustaining  develop -- sustaining support of our production programs, and moved a lot of that resource into the R&D area.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then as you look at the mix, then, in 2013, you said it would be neutral. But I mean, should we assume, I mean, that Mustangs might be flat to down in the mix? I would assume that M2s will be up plus in the mix, that Sovereigns and the Tens would be up, or is that incorrect because they go toward the end of the year, is that likely not to benefit 2013 that much?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, I think if you look at it, Cai, so absolutely our view would be that Mustangs will be down. M2s obviously will -- are new. So I think if you look at volumes of what was Mustang in that sort of the lighter end of the market will be made up this year of, instead of just Mustangs, it'll be a combination of Mustangs and M2s. So there's a slight mix shift up there, okay, but then you're talking about $3.2 million aircraft versus $4.5 million aircraft, so in the grand scheme of things, it doesn't change the mix shift very much from the perspective of the overall mix of the business. We will have the Sovereign deliveries, but I think if you look at combined Sovereign and Ten sales last year versus this year, they are relatively equivalent. And then you look at the balance of the portfolio through the CJs and the XLSs, again, it's going to be roughly a similar kind of number. So that's why I say, I don't think you're going to see a huge mix shift in terms of the overall average dollar waiting, if you will, per aircraft in 2013.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","That's very good. But you did mention that the Sovereign and the Ten happen in the second half. So is the fact that the volume is relatively flat, a function of when the deliveries begin, and that, therefore, the market allowing 2014 should be an up year, or is it just that demand is essentially flat?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, so, I mean, we see demand as being relatively flat. Obviously, we'd like to think that 2014 will be an up year, but that's a guidance question for another 364 days from now. But, yes, I mean it really is principally driven by demand at this stage of the game, Cai.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from the line of Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a follow-up question on Cessna. Given the back-end load of the deliveries in 2013, I mean, the usual question is will it be profitable in the first quarter. I guess, the question here is, will it be profitable in the first half given 3Q-4Q mix? And then CJ4s, are they a pressure point? Do they come off kind of being a new product? And how much per pressure point, if at all?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, I think that we would certainly expect to see profitability in the first half of the year. And CJ4, I don't expect -- in fact, I think if we look at year-over-year volumes, look like they're pretty flat on CJ4s. So it's only an aircraft that's been in the market for a few years. It's still doing very well from a competitive standpoint. It's performing -- the performance is outstanding. Customers are very happy with it. So it continues to be, frankly, probably the most from a volume standpoint, probably the most popular aircraft we have in our portfolio right now.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And then one follow-up. On aftermarket at Cessna, what was the growth in the quarter? And what's the expectation implied for '13?","Frank T. Connor","The Cessna aftermarket was 12% in the quarter, and it's now kind of 10-ish percent for next year.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Brian Jacoby of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Jacoby - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a quick one on the upcoming debt maturities at both the parent company and PIMCO, what's your plans there? It looks like you could handle it with cash, but, obviously, the markets are pretty attractive from a debt funding perspective.","Frank T. Connor","Yes, the way we think about the balance sheet is that we will handle those with cash. And kind of with that debt pay down, we will have a total debt level that is a level that we think is the right type of level for the business in its current size. And so the intent would be to pay that down and not refinance it.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Steve Levenson of Stifel.","Stephen E. Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","You've answered pretty much all the questions we had. But in terms of the percentage to fleet for sale, can you say about how much is current models and what you don't think is an issue?","Scott C. Donnelly","I'm sorry, I haven't looked at that data. Just recently, it's been -- things have been fairly stable in terms of available for sale. So I think, as Doug said, with the whole fleets around 12% kind of a number, as we look at that data through the course of the year, the models are still in production, relatively recent aircraft has really been more in the low to mid-single digit in terms of percent per sale.","Stephen E. Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And with the changes at Hawker Beechcraft, are you seeing any change in the market picking up any business, or are those used jets causing an issue?","Scott C. Donnelly","I guess, we'll have to wait to see all of the gamma numbers here. But I guess, my sense is, in terms of new aircraft, clearly, we feel we've been picking up some share over the course of the year. Part of that, obviously, is Hawker going out of the market and it was a pretty tough year when you have a competitor that's exiting a business line. But I don't think there's lots of aircraft left, so I would expect that not to be much of an issue on a going-forward basis.","Operator","Our last question will come from the line of Ronald Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kristine T. Liwag - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is actually Kristine Liwag calling in for Ron Epstein. Our question is how many whitetails or greentails do you have at Cessna?","Scott C. Donnelly","We don't do the greentail or whitetail number specifically. Just in terms of direction, as I said, we clearly would have expected some additional sales in Q4 that we did not see given everything going on. But as I said in the past, we're trying to build or forecast and estimate it as well as we can. The only downside risk if you're off on that number is you take a little bit of inventory risk, and that's exactly what we did and what happened. And those aircraft will obviously sell off here in the very near future.","Douglas R. Wilburne","Okay, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of today's panel, I'd like to thank you for your participation in today's conference call. Thank you for using AT&T.

Welcome to the Textron Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Also as a reminder, today\u2019s teleconference is being recorded.","At this time, I will turn the conference over to your host, Vice President, Investor Relations, Mr. Eric Salander. Please go ahead, sir.","Eric Salander","Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today\u2019s press release. On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron\u2019s Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.","Textron\u2019s revenues in the quarter were $3.5 billion, up $233 million from last year\u2019s third quarter. During this year\u2019s third quarter, we recorded $25 million of pre-tax special charges, or $0.05 per share after-tax. Excluding these items, adjusted income from continuing operations was $0.65 per share, up $0.04 from last year\u2019s third quarter. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $279 million, up from $94 million in last year\u2019s third quarter.","With that, I will turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Donnelly","Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everybody. Revenues were up 7% in the quarter, reflecting strong commercial demand at Bell, increased deliveries at Textron Systems and higher revenues in Industrial due to the acquisition of Arctic Cat. We saw strong execution at Bell again in the third quarter with a 13.1% operating margin, revenues were up on higher commercial volumes as we delivered 39 commercial helicopters, up from 25 in last year\u2019s third quarter, 8 H-1\u2019s, flat with last year, and 5 V-22\u2019s, down from six last year.","We delivered five 412s in the quarter related to the improved order flow we\u2019ve seen over the past year. We also began deliveries of 407GXP to Shaanxi Energy Group in China on the order of 100 units that we announced earlier this year. Also during the quarter, we received an order for eight 407GXPs from Caverton Helicopters, which included Bell\u2019s Customer Advantage Plan support solutions for each of the aircraft.","Moving to military, we delivered our first two FMS H-1 aircraft for Pakistan in the quarter. On the development side, our V-280 Valor successfully achieved ground one testing at 100% RPM and remains on track for first flight this year. Our progress on this program was on full display at AUSA last week, where we featured a video of this achievement along with our full-size V-280 mockup.","Our investment in this program aligns well with the Army\u2019s stated objective to accelerate product development and realize one of its key modernization priorities future vertical lift.","Moving to Systems, revenues were up on higher TAPV deliveries. At TRU, we delivered six full flight simulators in the quarter as we continue to grow this business. In Unmanned Systems, we were awarded an FMS contract in Bulgaria, marking our first international system sale of our Aerosonde platform. In our Textron Airborne Solutions business, we acquired a fleet Mirage F1s in support of future adversary air contract competitions.","Moving to industrial, we saw an 18% increase in revenues, primarily reflecting the impact of Arctic Cat. Overall margins were down, largely reflecting the diluted impact of the Arctic Cat acquisition and unfavorable volume and mix in other business. At Arctic Cat, we\u2019re continuing to execute to our integration plan and we remain on track for the business to be accretive in earnings in 2018.","Moving to Textron Aviation, revenues were down $44 million, as we delivered 41 jets flat with last year, 24 King Airs, down from 29 and 5 Beechcraft T-6 trainers compared to eight last year. We saw stronger international King Air and Caravan deliveries in the quarter, as compared to the first-half of the year. We recently received an additional order from Babcock Scandinavian Air Ambulance for 10 King Air 250s and the first medevac-configured Citation Latitude for deliveries beginning in 2018.","This past week at NBAA, we celebrated the delivery of the 100 Citation Latitude, the best-selling midsize aircraft in the market today, achieving this milestone in just 26 months following entry into service. Also at the show, we displayed our first production Longitude aircraft with a fully fitted interior. Following the show, this aircraft embarked on a 46C demonstration tour as we look to begin deliveries in 2018.","Moving to Textron Aviation Offense, our Scorpion and AT-6 Wolverine Aircraft, both performed extremely well during the U.S. Air Force\u2019s recent OA-X light attack demonstration program. And to sum up the quarter, we achieved top line growth and continued our strong cash performance, while furthering our business development efforts on new products across the businesses.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Frank.","Frank Connor","Thank you, Scott. Good morning, everyone. Segment profit in the quarter was $295 million, down $15 million from the third quarter of 2016 and a $233 million increase in revenue.","Let\u2019s review how each of the segments contributed starting with Textron Aviation. At Textron Aviation, revenues were down $44 million from this period last year. Segment profit was $93 million, down from $100 million a year ago, primarily as a result of unfavorable performance and lower volume and mix, partially offset by a favorable impact from pricing. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1.2 billion, up $142 million from the second quarter.","Moving to Bell, revenues were up $78 million due to higher commercial deliveries. Segment profit increased $9 million from the third quarter in 2016, primarily reflecting a favorable impact from performance and other. Backlog in the segment was $5 billion at the end of the quarter, down $413 million from the end of the second quarter.","At Textron Systems, revenues were up $45 million, primarily due to higher volumes at Marine and Land Systems, partially offset by lower volume in the Weapons and Sensors product line.","Segment profit was down $4 million. Backlog in the segment was $1.5 billion, down $85 million from the end of the second quarter. Industrial revenues increased $156 million, largely due to the impact of the Arctic Cat acquisition. Segment profit was down $17 million due to unfavorable volume and mix, pricing and inflation. Finance segment revenues decreased $2 million and profit increased $4 million.","Moving below segment profit, corporate expenses were $30 million, down from $53 million last year, largely related to the transfer of the Scorpion program to Textron Aviation. Interest expense was $37 million, up from $35 million a year ago. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2017 was 21.7%, included a net discrete tax benefit of $15 million, largely related to state income taxes.","During the quarter, we recorded pre-tax special charges of $25 million. Year-to-date 2017, we have recognized pre-tax charges of $42 million under the restructuring plans that we announced last year. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares, returning $122 million in cash to shareholders. We also took the opportunity to issue 300 million of 10-year notes at a rate of 3 and 3%ish and used the proceeds for a voluntary contribution to our pension plans.","To wrap up, we\u2019re updating our adjusted full-year EPS from continuing operations guidance to a range of $2.40 to $2.50 per share. We are also increasing our expected full-year manufacturing cash flow from continuing operations before pension contributions by $150 million to a range of $800 million to $900 million, with expected pension contributions of about $355 million.","That concludes our prepared remarks. So, Tony, we can open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Hi, good morning.","Scott Donnelly","Good morning.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Just on the cash, sorry, the EPS guidance tightening of $0.10, can you maybe talk about where it\u2019s coming? And if it is the industrial business, just what\u2019s going on within the profitability there?","Scott Donnelly","Yes, sure. I think there\u2019s two things that are contributing to sort of going towards the lower-half of our original guidance. And the first is, obviously, as you know, in the first quarter, we did take a charge associated with the TAPV program. So, the business overall has performed to our plan for the balance of the year. We expect it to perform to the balance of the year. But that charge in the first quarter is some that\u2019s basically flowing through the full-year overall compared to our original guidance in that segment.","And then on the industrial side, look, I think, we had a fairly tough quarter in industrial, particularly in our vehicle business. The Arctic Cat work is going well, but we have thrown a lot of resources, particularly people at making sure that integration goes well. And frankly, we got a little behind on some of the rest of the business in terms of line rates and production output. As we worked our way through the quarter and as we go here and in the beginning of the fourth quarter, it looks like most of the line rates are back up to where we need them to be, we\u2019re not likely to be able to catch up on some of the miss from Q3.","And so I think if you look at those two dynamics, obviously, those I think coming in stronger than the guide Aviation a little bit lighter, again, primarily driven by some lower volume that we originally expected. But those two sort of offsets or the two things that are driving really at this point are the TAPV charge we took in Q1 and just a little bit lighter volume and conversion on the vehicle business.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","All right. Thank you. And then just one more, if I may, on the backlog. Within aviation, it was up slightly. Could that be attributed to the Longitude? And then just on that program, how do we think about the ramp up and entry into service?","Scott Donnelly","So it\u2019s not really driven by Longitude, Sheila. So I mean, as you know, we don\u2019t kind of do it model by model. But it really is across other aircraft platforms, which I think is good. The Longitude, I wouldn\u2019t expect to see a lot of backlog going into that until we start getting that production aircraft out there and a lot of people have seen the aircraft and are interested in the aircraft. But now coming out of NBAA, where we have the first customer fitted out version, as I noted in the remarks, it\u2019s going to be flying around here for the rest of the year doing demonstration flights for perspective customers. And hopefully, we will start to see some backlog build as a result of that, but that hasn\u2019t happened yet.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","And just on the entry into service?","Scott Donnelly","Oh, entry into service, I think, it\u2019s probably going to be early next year. The flight test program is going extraordinarily well. The aircraft is performing beautifully. We had one of our key suppliers that has some obsolescence issues. And we decided that it was \u2013 it made sense to incorporate the latest and greatest new product before we went through the certification program. That\u2019s taken us probably a couple of months longer than we were originally have liked it to, we\u2019ll push off until probably early next year, but no material impact. So we certainly expect to see solid deliveries in 2018.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland","Hey, good morning, guys.","Scott Donnelly","Good morning.","Carter Copeland","Just a couple of quick ones. One, Scott, I wondered if you could expand on the industrial commentary. It looks like maybe the shortfall there was sort of $25 million relative to the plan. And you \u2013 I know, you called out unfavorable volume and mix and then additional resources and people on the integration. How much should we think is each of those and how of much that is sort of temporary versus things we got to watch out for in the future?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I think, on the resources piece of it, the piece specifically around Arctic Cat, frankly is going to plan. We\u2019re very happy with how that\u2019s proceedings, the inventory levels that we knew we needed to drive down in the dealer base or happening retail sales are up considerably. There\u2019s obviously a lot of work going on and aligning the product lines and getting dealers up to speed on the full range of both what was in Arctic Cat, as well as what was under development in the Textron vehicle business.","So I think, that\u2019s all progressing, the factories are up and running. There are a lot of moving parts here, Carter. We decided to move our engine manufacturing facility from Germany into the St. Cloud facility. So we\u2019re kind of centralizing all of our engine manufacturing, which is also obviously much closer to the final assembling plant in Thief River. We did move all of our dirt manufacturing out of Augusta up to Thief River, which I think is already starting to pay dividends. So, these are all things, I think, bode well for the future of the business. But they were costs some, a lot of work and distraction for the people to go pull that stuff off.","In terms of the core of the business, as I said, we got a little behind in terms of line rates and nothing particularly magical, just getting our production control and logistics programs running. We have a new facility now down in Augusta, where we\u2019re consolidating all the Jacobsen things. So there\u2019s just a lot of moving parts that had impacts really across the rest of the core business.","So, as I said, I think those line rate as we watch them here going into the quarter are getting back to where they need to be. There\u2019s still some things to work on, but I think this is something we\u2019ll have behind us as we hit into 2018. And clearly, we expect the Arctic Cat deal, it\u2019s up to be accretive as we go into 2018. So certainly, a misstep. A lot going on in that business between the Jacobsen integration, bringing in Arctic Cat, a lot of internal moves, which again, we think are the right answers in terms of driving better productivity and better margins as we go forward, but certainly impact here in the quarter.","Carter Copeland","Okay. Thanks for that color. And one for Frank. Frank, was there a tax benefit of $100 million or so from the pension prefunding that we should think about?","Frank Connor","Yes, on a cash basis, so cash tax basis, we will get a deduction for that contribution. The bulk of that will fall into this year. We\u2019ll get some of that benefit into next year. So it\u2019s spread between the two years.","Carter Copeland","Okay, great. Thanks, gentlemen.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.","George Shapiro","Yes, good morning.","Scott Donnelly","Good morning.","George Shapiro","I wanted to pursue, Scott, you were saying in aviation, you had some unfavorable performance if you could provide a little more color on that?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I \u2013 clearly, George, the numbers if you look year-over-year, we do have all the Scorpion spend in there. So when you look at relative performance from last quarter to this quarter, I think that \u2013 or third quarter to third quarter, the team actually did pretty well when you consider the margin rates that were delivered even with the increased spending. We still had a lot of activity going on with Scorpion and 86, frankly, as we went through this experimentation program.","We continue to have a very high spend as we\u2019re continuing in trying to finalize the Longitude certification. So on a cost base nothing really beyond what we would expect. I think the guys did a pretty good job on that. We are a little bit light, probably to volume, where we would have liked it particularly around the turboprops although they were considerably stronger than they were in the first couple of quarter.","So we\u2019re encouraged by what we saw on the market on both the King Airs and the Caravans now seeing stronger international demand which were important to both those platforms, but all-in-all still a little bit lighter and like I think part of that\u2019s the market and part of that is what we continue to work on the pricing side, George and we are continuing to hold the line on making sure we are getting priced in the business, we saw that, you guys will see when the Q comes out, it\u2019s falling around $22 million year-over-year, so it\u2019s a line that\u2019s obviously tough to hold that line in the market, but we are doing that and I think that\u2019s going to \u2013 we\u2019ll continue to trade that versus some volume.","George Shapiro","And Scorpion R&D, as Scott you had said on the second quarter would come down a little bit, this quarter it doesn\u2019t look like it did maybe, but if you could explain around that and how much we might expect for the year?","Scott Donnelly","Well, it did come down somewhat, George, and it will come down pretty significantly here in the fourth quarter, now I think the fermentation program is done.","George Shapiro","Okay, and if I take a look at latitude Scott, you said you delivered a 100, but if I add up all your deliveries through the year, I get about 93, I mean is that seven already in the fourth quarter, if you can reconcile the difference for me?","Scott Donnelly","George, you probably have better data than I do on that then, I thought it was a 100 through the end of the third quarter was the number I was referencing, but we\u2019ll probably have to maybe have an offline call with you and try to reconcile our database and your database first, but the number should be a 100 through the end of Q3.","George Shapiro","Okay, and then one last one on industrial, I mean you had guided earlier to a margin of 9% and with the dilution it came down to 7%, I mean what does it look like now for the year?","Scott Donnelly","Well, it\u2019s going to be lower than that obviously, so I don\u2019t think we\u2019re probably prepared to give a specific number, but it\u2019s going to be\u2026","Frank Connor","A bit lower than that.","Scott Donnelly","\u2026a bit lower than that.","George Shapiro","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Next question in queue is from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Seth Seifman","Thanks very much and good morning. Scott, I wonder if you could talk about the hemisphere program, we had the announcement of the delay on the Silvercrest engine and the source says that all options around on the table as far as that goes, how do we think about the future of this program from your point of view and how you are thinking about approaching the development next year?","Scott Donnelly","Well, that\u2019s a good question. We just learned about the issue on the Silvercrest compressor, kind of with everybody else at NBAA. We\u2019re obviously in discussions with their team to understand and in fact as they determine, I think this is still a relatively early on in terms of their understanding of what the problem is and they are still doing the work of exploring what the range of options might be to solve the problem. So it\u2019s probably premature to really know what that impact could be, it could be a minor impact, it could be a more significant impact, we just \u2013 we don\u2019t know enough yet. All we\u2019re really familiar with is sort of how it manifests itself, it certainly sounds like a high pressure compressor issue, which is exactly what they are describing I think that we need to give their engineering team a little of time here to figure out again what that range of options is.","We have continued to work on hemisphere obviously with our customers and doing a lot of our ergonomic work in modeling and supplier selections and all those kind of key things which need to continue to happen. So we are running that at a rate appropriate to that and I think we\u2019ll keep doing that and then based on where the Silvercrest is, obviously we can regulate you know what we do in terms of a program span based upon that.","Seth Seifman","Great, thanks. And then maybe one more for Frank, it looks like you are on track this year for about $68 million of pension expense. If the year ended today and we think about the contribution you just made, how do we think about the impact of the contribution on next year\u2019s pension expense possibly offset by the \u2013 or probably offset by the additional debt that you took on?","Frank Connor","Yes, well, I mean obviously a lot will depend on interest rates at the end of the year and returns and so on for this year. At a simplistically level if you think about kind of the 7.5% rate of return that has been our return assumption and look at the 3.375% cost of the debt, kind of that spread differential with some other kind of \u2013 there are some other impacts, but is generally ballpark type of impact having to do just with the contribution.","I\u2019d say, overall from a pension standpoint, as we talked about before, we think as we move into 2018, again, there\u2019s a lot still to be learned about where things are set, but we should get a little bit of a tailwind associated with pension.","Seth Seifman","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Next question in queue comes from Jon Raviv with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jon Raviv","Hey, good morning.","Scott Donnelly","Hi.","Jon Raviv","On Bell, can you just go into a little bit more on the nature of the commercial positivity. What sort of end markets is that coming from, or is a lot of it is related to those larger deals you\u2019ve signed over the past year?","Scott Donnelly","I think, it\u2019s, I mean, the activity we\u2019re seeing is pretty broad-based. So you do have deals out there that are fleet deals like some smaller oil and gas kind of guys, but there\u2019s a fair bit of yet in executive transport going on. There\u2019s a pretty broad range of EMS activity.","There\u2019s some foreign military whether it be border petrol, customs, police. It\u2019s not concentrated in any one particular area, which is good frankly, right. I mean we don\u2019t see just one sector, it\u2019s some life across most of the areas, and it\u2019s pretty broad-based geographically as well. So we\u2019re seeing activity in Southeast Asia, we\u2019re seeing it in Africa, we\u2019re seeing in South America. So it\u2019s a fairly broad-based. Again, we don\u2019t want to basically, I think, the overall market is still weaker than it has been in previous times, but it\u2019s much better than it was couple of years ago. And I think, our team is doing pretty well from a competitive standpoint.","We\u2019re seeing again, strength in pretty much all the models, obviously, 505 is a brand new as they come out. But sales are being good on 47s, 429s, 412. So it\u2019s pretty much across the breadth of our platform and then do a pretty broad-based range of geographies and end applications.","Jon Raviv","Thanks for that color. And then speaking at Bell, the thinking about the margin strength this year, you laid out what\u2019s going on there and some of the good performance? What\u2019s the opportunity to hold on to that kind of profitability as 505 ramps up perhaps as 525 spending as the level of spending picks back up again. Can you give us some sense of how those things trend going forward?","Scott Donnelly","Well, like usually \u2013 we\u2019ve usually talked about that business being able to perform in that 10% to 12% kind of a range. Although I think 13 is sustainable over a long period of time is a pretty tough part, okay? I mean, obviously, the guys have done really well this year to drive productivity and efficiency. And yet there obviously, we had a good mix with some strong 412 deliveries this quarter as well. So I\u2019d say, 13 is too strong, but it\u2019s going to remain a good healthy margin business.","Jon Raviv","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Julian Mitchell","Thank you. Good morning. Maybe just my first question on the Aviation, King Air has had a tough time, I think, on your volume delivery profile for about 18 months now, still light in Q3. Just wondered how you\u2019re thinking about, if you still think second-half deliveries can be flattish in aggregate for those, and how you\u2019re seeing overall kind of order and inquiry levels if that\u2019s giving you any optimism for the outlook for the next year?","Scott Donnelly","Well, Julian, I think that, first of all, you\u2019re right, both the King Airs, which are generally speaking have a pretty strong international marketplace. I think over the last 18 months have felt a lot of the pain of a very strong dollar and weaker economies and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been experiencing. Again, I think, the good news here is that in the third quarter, while it\u2019s not what we delivered a year ago was certainly a lot more inquiries and a lot more sales and order activity than we\u2019ve seen for a while. So that bodes well, I think.","Do I think we get the flat for the balance of the year? No, probably not. But I do think, given the level of inquiry and activity that it\u2019s going to be stronger than it has been in the first-half of the year. So definitely we\u2019ll finish the year here with a stronger King Air performance we saw in the first-half.","And again, it\u2019s to look into next year is pretty premature at this stage of the game, given the nature of how things orders and sales convert. But we\u2019re certainly happier with the level of activity in the marketplace right now than what we saw for the past year, let\u2019s say.","Julian Mitchell","Thank you. And then my second question around the cash flow very good performance year-to-date on working capital, particularly versus the same period in 2016. I just wanted to clarify if all of the cash flow guidance increase was tax-related or some of that was due to working capital as well? And then maybe any color you could give on how the introduction of the Longitude should impact your working capital from here over the next six months or so?","Scott Donnelly","Sure, Julian. Well, look, as Frank said, we do get some cash tax benefit here in the year. But most of this is driven by better performance in terms of just manufacturing cash flow and a big chunk of that is in fact working capital. As you know, you look at the number, we\u2019re \u2013 we generally just the natural cyclicality of our businesses is that you usually see the working capital burn off through the fourth quarter, and we\u2019re at a point this year, where we\u2019re basically kind of where we started the year.","So we\u2019ve had a \u2013 the teams have done a much better job on working capital management. And by the way that includes some pressure points like ramping up Longitude. So we are already in producing aircraft, which obviously won\u2019t sell until next year. So, but despite that, when you look across the businesses, we already have working capital back to sort of neutral in the year. And obviously, we\u2019ll expect a considerable burn down here as we go through our normal cycle in the fourth quarter. Obviously, net working capital come down further.","So the majority of it is the team delivering better manufacturing cash flow and that big chunk of that obviously is a working capital.","Julian Mitchell","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Bill Ledley","Hi, this is Bill Ledley on for Cai this morning. Wanted to go back to aviation a little bit and book-to-bill was 1.1. And you mentioned some favorable pricing. So could you perhaps call out, what\u2019s stronger both from a volume and pricing standpoint? Is it biz jets or King Airs? If you\u2019d give some more color there, that would be great?","Scott Donnelly","I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to go sort of model by model. But we\u2019re \u2013 the market in general has been flattish, which is kind of what we expected on the jet side of things. I think, that the pricing activities are obviously helping and we continue to hold the line on that.","And as I said earlier on the call, we will trade volume to price. We just \u2013 we\u2019re pleased with some of the increases that we have, but it\u2019s \u2013 the price levels are still, in my view, too low to look at the amount of investment that goes into producing these aircraft and designing these aircraft. And so we\u2019re going to continue to push on the price obviously as we go forward as well, and if that means some lower volume then we\u2019ll take some more volume.","Bill Ledley","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Rajeev Lalwani","Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for the time.","Scott Donnelly","Good morning.","Rajeev Lalwani","Scott, coming back to Bell, can you talk about the government side of the business. And what are going to be the big drivers there over the next, say 12 to 24 months before submitting new products get rolled in?","Scott Donnelly","Well, look, over the next year or so, V-22 is a relatively flat number in general. We expect H-1 to be up a little bit. Again, as we continue some FMS activity as we\u2019ve seen with Pakistan this quarter that\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t think there will be huge shifts going on there, Rajeev, it\u2019s going to be probably mostly up on H-1 and relatively flat on V-22, program performance is good. I would expect that to be a fairly stable part of Bell here in the next couple of years.","Rajeev Lalwani","Thanks. And then moving over to the industrial side. Once push Arctic Cat aside, what\u2019s going to be the driver there as we look forward to kind of a similar question?","Scott Donnelly","Well, if you look beyond Arctic Cat, that\u2019s the core of the business that we used to have. I think, we\u2019re doing well in most of that segment. I think, if you look into Gulf place, these are new products with the lithium-ion batteries are doing very well in the marketplace. Frankly, it\u2019s a new product launch, it\u2019s gone extremely well.","We continue to see strength in the what was the target market in terms of GSE. We actually had, continue to have strong order rates there. We\u2019ve got make sure we can line our production and get the deliveries and the output out, but the market in terms of order activity is very strong. And again, the rest of that market, I think, is in good shape. Most of getting deliveries and whatnot are \u2013 for us during the quarter was a matter of getting our lines up and running and getting to higher rates.","Rajeev Lalwani","Excellent. A quick housekeeping question for Frank. Frank, what\u2019s the tax rate benefit in \u2013 for the year on the earnings?","Frank Connor","Tax rate benefit, I mean, the \u2013 well, I guess, we \u2013 given the tax rate of this quarter and year-to-date, we\u2019re looking at kind of 26.5% or so full-year tax rate. There is no tax benefit from a rate standpoint associated with a pension contribution, if that\u2019s part of the question. It only impacts cash taxes. It\u2019s actually a little bit of a headwind from a book tax standpoint just given some other deductions and things.","Rajeev Lalwani","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Peter Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.","Peter Skibitski","Yes, good morning, guys. Hey, Scott, I think you touched on this last quarter. But can you remind us, again, why the ramp on the 505 is going so slowly? Is that, you had a lot of LOIs last I checked. So is it converting to LOIs, or is it execution at Bell?","Scott Donnelly","Well, it\u2019s just ramping the production. It\u2019s getting the certifications outside the U.S. and getting the other certification. So there\u2019s nothing significant going on there, I mean, or different than we would really expect the LOI conversion rates are very high. So we\u2019re not concerned about that. The order book is certainly there and the ramp is coming along.","Peter Skibitski","Okay. And then can you just give us an update on kind of where we go from here on Scorpion?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I think, in general here, the Air Force in terms of its experimentation program has been frankly very transparent, very open about how they saw this whole thing playing out. Dates and activities and what not were exactly as advertised. I think, the program went very well. We were obviously thrilled with how the aircraft did.","We had very good feedback from Air Force pilots that flew both the Scorpion and the AT-6. And the Air Force is also very clear through the whole process that, once they finish the experimentation program, they were going to sort of take all that information and then determine what their next steps might be. And I think that\u2019s the phase they\u2019re in. So we\u2019re sort of standing by, while they decide what it \u2013 or the next steps on either or all aircraft and how they want to move forward. So I think, we\u2019re \u2013 they\u2019re doing that and we\u2019re just kind of standing by and see how it plays out.","Peter Skibitski","Do you still need to wait for some sort of surge from them to get an international sale?","Scott Donnelly","No, we don\u2019t. I mean, I think, from an international standpoint, Peter, as we talk to customers and continue to have interaction with customers, there are certainly some that would want to see this thing have a U.S. certification or a worthiness declaration of some kind in our other customers that don\u2019t, as a military aircraft, that\u2019s not necessary. So, you definitely see differences in different countries and their approach to this. But there are certainly some that we\u2019re engaged in for whom a U.S. Air Force airworthiness certification is not required.","Peter Skibitski","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Scott Donnelly","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question that will come from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Sam Pearlstein","Good morning.","Scott Donnelly","Good morning.","Sam Pearlstein","Just wanted to follow-up in terms of, we talked about the Bell margin before, but just on the aviation margin, given your 5.6% kind of through the nine months would seem like it\u2019s going to be a challenge to get to your original plan of the 7% to 8%. Can you just talk about how we should think about the year? I know Scorpion R&D is supposed to be falling, which is how should we be thinking about the remainder of the year?","Scott Donnelly","So, in terms of the R&D, it\u2019s obviously going to ramp down here. Over the course of year internal Scorpion, the activities are pretty well wrapped up. We\u2019ll have a little bit of activity going on with some international customer demonstration flights and some things of that nature, but it will be a relatively small number. In terms of the overall Aviation segment number, as I said earlier on, I think, it will be lighter them what we were originally guiding.","Obviously, the guide included the Scorpion spend, but I think we\u2019re going to be probably a couple of hundred million dollars under \u2013 from a revenue standpoint, but we\u2019re seeing that through the course of the year, right, with particularly around the King Airs and the Caravans, and again, we continue to push on the pricing front across all these platforms. So we\u2019ll probably be a little bit lighter on revenue than we were anticipating in our original guide.","Sam Pearlstein","Okay. And just in terms of pricing, I mean, what are you seeing in the marketplace now, obviously, you\u2019re trying to hold the line, lots of others, it sounds like there\u2019s still plenty of price discounting. Have you seen just any overall change in the trend within the marketplace?","Scott Donnelly","All right. I don\u2019t \u2013 I can\u2019t, I don\u2019t know how to comment on that. Any way other than to say, we still feel like we\u2019re winning our share of the deals that are out there. We\u2019re just holding the line on trying to be responsible in terms of what we need to do as a business. And is there any difference or change in what the other guy are doing? I can\u2019t really speak to that nothing that has jump to the forefront. But I think our share is still strong and I think customers understand that there\u2019s still pricing aircraft way below where it was historically.","I mean, it\u2019s a problem, and I think people appreciate. We\u2019re investing a ton of money in the business on things like Latitudes and Longitudes and Denalis and they are \u2013 at these margin rates, so that I think the team \u2013 guys are doing a good job. And you need to have better margin rates in a business like this to be able to sustain the level of investment is good for our customers. So, we\u2019re going to continue to hold the line on it.","Sam Pearlstein","Okay. And then if I can just follow one last question up on terms of the Arctic Cat and the integration. You talked about the distraction maybe impacting some of the production. But have you seen any success in moving your product into their distribution channel and anything from the going forward side that\u2019s that showing improvement?","Scott Donnelly","Yes, I think we have. In the retail, sales have been strong on a year-over-year basis. Some of that is clearing out a lot of the older inventory. But as we\u2019ve been getting the dealers together and now being able to go into those dealers and bring not only what they may have had historically from Arctic Cat, but adding some of the Textron Off Road product, name the Stampede, you may have seen we just announced the Prowler EV.","So, we\u2019re obviously integrating these \u2013 the branding in the \u2013 at the product level and some of the technology that we bring into the EV side, as those products are rolling out. They\u2019re doing well in the marketplace, and so we\u2019re seeing dealers pick these up and we\u2019re seeing retail sell-through.","So, it\u2019s still early, obviously. It\u2019s a lot of work to go through and change \u2013 now the good news is, it\u2019s a good change for them. It\u2019s a much better product line. It\u2019s a stronger product line. But I think it\u2019s being well received and there we feel good about where it\u2019s heading.","Sam Pearlstein","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Noah Poponak","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Scott Donnelly","Good morning.","Frank Connor","Hey, Scott.","Noah Poponak","Scott, I guess, just kind of big picture top down on the business jet at market. Some of the leading indicator data has improved, flight hour growth has accelerated, used inventories come down a little bit recently, especially the youngest batch in that bucket of used inventory. But I hear you call \u2013 still calling at a flat market that\u2019s kind of how it felt at NBAA. You had a little bit of sequential growth in backlog, but it sounds like turboprop got better and that never quite sure what\u2019s happening with your \u2013 the movement of fractional into that, and maybe that helped out a little bit too? So it \u2013 I don\u2019t know, I guess, sort of what\u2019s the remaining disconnect between some of this leading indicator data and having a more definitively robust business jet market?","Scott Donnelly","Well, that\u2019s the million dollar question, so\u2026","Noah Poponak","I asked it.","Scott Donnelly","Look, let me, look, I can give you color on a couple of things. So first of all and towards the backlog, again, we don\u2019t really go into model by model or customer by customer here. But there\u2019s no material impact on the fractional thing, as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, the way we tend to work with net jets, which is obviously our big customer in that space.","We\u2019re basically because of how we sort of look at the timeline of deliveries with net jets, it\u2019s sort of more or less deliveries in a quarter equals the amount of aircraft we\u2019re adding back into the backlog, because it\u2019s pretty steady flow of aircraft.","Noah Poponak","Okay.","Scott Donnelly","So from a backlog standpoint, that\u2019s not a material change. In terms of, are we seeing that activity in the market in terms of utilization rates being up? Absolutely, I mean, I think, we had a good quarter in our \u2013 in the aftermarket business, and some of that, maybe there\u2019s a little bit of pent-up demand in there. But as you see increased flying that usually translates to increased activity in terms of the service side of our business, and we certainly saw that in the quarter, which is good.","I think in the end market, look, your statistics are all correct, right, I mean used does continue to come down. I think they are \u2013 we still struggle with this notion that used aircraft pricing doesn\u2019t seem to want to move up, right and so that does pressure customers because the trading values and the step-up to new aircraft is more challenging when these guys have low residual values and despite the fact that used aircraft availability has dropped significantly over the last ex number of years, we are not seeing that reflect in used aircraft pricing. So, that dynamic I think is still one that weighs on people and it\u2019s a nontrivial economic impact to them.","So, look, I think as we move on a lot of guys out there are flying older aircraft, they are seeing higher maintenance costs and they do want to step up and look, the challenge for us is that we can\u2019t make up for the lower residual value of the used aircraft by lowering the value of our new aircraft, okay so that\u2019s still a pressure point right. People want us to try to make up for that low residual value and I just can\u2019t \u2013 I can\u2019t do that and maintain any kind of reasonable margin and return in the business. So I think the demand is going to be out there and \u2013 but again we haven\u2019t seen, I would love to see, we obviously don\u2019t control those, we would love to see residual values of used aircraft coming up and that would take some pressure off these customers, but look that\u2019s not something we control and it\u2019s a little perplexing to us as you see tightening \u2013 when the market tightens up for those used aircraft, why you are not seeing some lift in the pricing, but we haven\u2019t seen that yet.","Noah Poponak","To me, when I look at that chart on a long-run basis, it has come down recently and it\u2019s been on a steady decline over the last several years, but it\u2019s still on an absolute basis much higher than it was in any point all of last cycle and so it just \u2013 it leaves me wondering if, yes, there\u2019s been a tightening, but on an absolute basis it\u2019s just still too high and there are still too many options in the used market and that\u2019s why pricing hasn\u2019t firmed up there? I mean is that a reasonable assumption and you just have to burn it back to where it was 10 years ago or 12 years ago before you get that better pricing?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I think there is a dynamic \u2013 first of all, it\u2019s a much bigger market, right, so the number of aircraft that are in the fleet is much higher and so therefore with similar percents we are going to have for sure more aircraft that are out there and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s part the dynamic. You know I don\u2019t \u2013 to think that we could get to where used available was in that 2006, 2007, 2008 timeframe, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s realistic, I mean it was a distortion the other way, right. People were selling used aircraft little more than new aircraft because you get one, it was a \u2013 so I think that people have to kind of get their head out of that, that\u2019s where the world is going.","I mean these aircraft do depreciate, right. There is going to be a depreciation over a period of time, it\u2019s not going to be an asset that appreciates, which is what we saw in that, say, 2002-2003 through 2008 timeframe, I think that was a probably as I said a distortion in the other direction, so. But anyway, look, that\u2019s \u2013 I think that is a dynamic now when you look at what people will have an aircraft and what the reality is of what that aircraft is worth as a used aircraft. But the good news is, there is a big market for those, the liquidity in the market is quite high, right, people are turning aircraft, people are buying aircraft, that\u2019s not \u2013 this is not like it was when we were kind of in the dark days where there is an illiquid market and nobody was buying them. So there\u2019s a lot of transactions that\u2019s not hard to move used aircraft, people just have to get comfortable with that the reality of how these things depreciate and what that residual value is over time is different than it was if you went back into the early 2000s.","Noah Poponak","Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. On that industrial margin, so for it to be slightly less than the seven you had previously been forecasting for the year would imply basically kind of stepping back up into the sort of seven handle vicinity in the fourth quarter, so it sounds like that 3Q number was fairly anomalous, is that the right interpretation?","Scott Donnelly","Yes.","Noah Poponak","Okay.","Scott Donnelly","Yes, so I think all we were saying earlier and I was like, I think we\u2019ll get things back on track here in the quarter, but I don\u2019t see a way to make up for the NOP loss that we had from our plan in Q3 and that\u2019s why we\u2019re kind of rolling that three to four year guidance.","Noah Poponak","Yes, just trying to understand the run rate given the differential between the quarter and where you kind of had been?","Scott Donnelly","Yes and I think it\u2019s fair to say that our run rate should get back up to a normalized rate in Q4.","Noah Poponak","Okay and then lastly, Frank when you were asked about tax rate, understanding there is no P&L tax benefit from what you did with pension, but there was a much lower tax rate in the quarter on the P&L. It sounds like you\u2019re saying the new earnings guidance, P&L earnings guidance has a 26.5% tax rate in it and the prior range coming into today had a 28.5% rate in it, is that accurate?","Frank Connor","Yes, basically roll through this quarters lower rate kind of to the full year just that type of impact, so kind of 29%, 30%-ish fourth quarter is where we sit right now.","Noah Poponak","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue that will come from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Robert Stallard","Thanks so much, good morning. Frank or Scott whichever one of you want to take this, you were both making comments about pricing in aviation and how you want to get better pricing, better margins going forward, and you be prepared to sacrificing volume. When volumes stabilize and since you are trying to get higher, what sort of incremental margin you think we should be expecting given this more robust stance on price?","Scott Donnelly","Well, Rob\u2026","Eric Salander","Hi, Eric Salander here, so a lot of things going on here, just in terms of the investment in the business and R&D and what not, which obviously is quite higher this year than it was \u2013 last year was \u2013 being in there, so you can\u2019t do the usual sort of quarter-over-quarter similar volume and expect what kind of a number.","Obviously as we always talked about in the business when we really do get similar mix, which again is a significant issue here that we expect kind of 20% margin conversion, we\u2019ve been obviously pressured by achieving that number based on a couple things, one is obviously we had higher R&D as we\u2019ve put the Scorpion into the business and we\u2019ve had a pretty challenging mix thing as we talked about beginning of the year, we\u2019ve seen reductions on the turboprop side, including our military turboprop, which are our good margin business and we\u2019ve seen a lot of our increase this year has been around the latitude.","Now the good news is the latitude as we look year-over-year based on the pricing actions that we\u2019ve been taking and cost actions and we are getting better margins, but they are dilutive to that overall 20% number, so the mix here has been a challenge, but on a normal \u2013 in a normal world, in terms of similar mix and whatnot, we would expect to see kind of those 20% numbers.","Robert Stallard","And presumably, heading into 2018 should be the case with longitude coming in, latitude being a like for like comp thinking on that?","Eric Salander","Well, we will always have the first \u2013 hopefully a relatively small number of longitudes that are going to be more challenging, because they are the initial production units, but yes, as we get probably more towards the back of the year and you get production stable and kind of get real run rates going, yes, that would true.","Robert Stallard","Okay, and then secondly on the cash front, does this pension contribution remove any potential contributions into the future and if that\u2019s the case, what are you going to use that additional cash flow for in terms of returns?","Frank Connor","So it certainly helps negate any contributions, so as you look at it today kind of barring some significant market events, yes it pushes things out so that we wouldn\u2019t expect additional required contributions other than our non-funded plans. And obviously as we\u2019ve talked about, we\u2019ll continue to prioritize kind of use of cash the same way we have which is continuing obviously to invest organically which is just R&D and things like that. Obviously capital for the business in terms of excess cash, we\u2019ll return that to shareholder through share repurchase and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing. Obviously we continued to buy stock in this past quarter and we\u2019ll continue that return of capital as we proceed forward.","Robert Stallard","That\u2019s great, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue that will come from Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.","Peter Arment","Thanks, Good morning Scott and Frank. Just a quick one, as all my questions asked. On the 525, the flight test program there, how do we think about the impact on kind of margins as we get into 2018? Is it something that ramps up materially or is it something that gets fairly linear and absorb throughout the year?","Scott Donnelly","I think I mean the 525 specifically, obviously we\u2019re are back in flight test, things are going well, that will ramp up here as we get more aircraft back in the air through the balance of next year that\u2019s \u2013 I think that\u2019s factored into our overall R&D numbers, Peter. And again, given where the program is, it sort of has peaked, I think in terms of its R&D consumption and obviously we\u2019re going through a flight test program here for the next year or so.","So that will be baked into our plans into our guidance, I don\u2019t see it having a material impact one way or the other. You won\u2019t start to see deliveries of that aircraft really until 2019. So in terms of any mix issue I would not expect to see that in 2018.","Peter Arment","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just a follow-up, on Scorpion you mentioned that you might not have to have a certification if you do some international. But if you do pursue that, how long roughly on a timeline does that take?","Scott Donnelly","It\u2019s probably something on a 18 months kind of line in terms of U.S. Air Force process, as you know we\u2019re already working here with the U.S. Air Force entitled to all this other stuff that\u2019s been going on. So that\u2019s probably something on that timeline. When I talk about other countries that don\u2019t need it, I mean obviously they do their own certification work and already talking about us how we work with them to do that. So those processes are probably a little quicker just because it\u2019s largely internal activity, but not something that would hold up sales or an order and that would be all incorporated as part of a program with the foreign customer.","Peter Arment","Yes, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question that will come from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Myles Walton","Thanks good morning, thanks for taking the question. First one is on Cessna and aviation general excluding the latitudes are you \u2013 or excuse me, the longitudes coming into 2018, are you expecting jet deliveries overall to be up in 2018 or is the expectation that longitude is the net add, maybe subtracting a little bit of legacy?","Scott Donnelly","Myles, I can probably answer that question for you in about three months.","Myles Walton","Okay. Well, I\u2019ve imagined you\u2019re working your production system, just wondering if there\u2019s any working capital management that\u2019s helping the cash flow this year as it relates to the aviation side or just more broad based?","Scott Donnelly","No, it\u2019s more broad based. Like I say, we\u2019re actually having to absorb the ramp on longitude, I mean obviously the aircraft that we expect to deliver in the certainly at least the first-half of next year and really probably now into the third quarter next year our aircrafts that are already in various stages of weapon. In some cases actually are all the way to finished goods, right. So that aircraft that we\u2019re flying around is a production unit. So there\u2019s definitely some pressure from our working capital to support the ramp of a longitude, but that\u2019s normal with any of our new products and we\u2019re just working to offset that working capital everywhere else in the business.","Myles Walton","Okay and the other one, Scott, maybe in industrial as a higher level question. But it\u2019s over half of the industrial business is fuel systems and the trend to electrification is obviously long, long-term but you have to start thinking and position this business for the next 10 years how do you look at that piece of industrial change it to a bit just position it for what may be a different world 10, 15 years from now?","Scott Donnelly","Well, Myles, I think there\u2019s no question that the automotive industry and it\u2019s sort of a power plant is going to change over time. And I can tell you that a lot of the work that we\u2019re doing right now in Kautex with OEMs around the world, frankly there is already a significant shift going on in terms of how people think about hybrids, like I think the notion of a full electrification is something that\u2019s going to be a much longer timeframe in terms of any material portion of the industry. But there\u2019s no question that the hybrid technology is going to become a much, much higher proportion of the market here over the next 10 years.","And we\u2019re working with a lot of those customers that actually does require some different technology in terms of how you support and build fuel systems that are hybrid, there\u2019s just a lot of \u2013 not to get into too much of the technicalities here, but the structural issues around the fuel system, the fuel tank where you don\u2019t have a constant draw of fluids and vapors out of that tank for a normal combustion engine. But can run for long periods of time on the electric side of a hybrid does drive some difference in the technology and that\u2019s something that we\u2019re already working and frankly already winning a number of programs that are our new products that they\u2019re going to have sort of these seven to 10 year horizons that we\u2019re working on right now and have already won on the program.","So we are certainly sensitive to the changes that are going on there working with the customers to do that, but a full electrification at least I think when you do look at other guys, that\u2019s going to be a fairly small piece here over the next decade, but hybrid is a whole another issue, I think we\u2019re going to see a significant proliferation of hybrid technology.","Myles Walton","And is that a place where you\u2019re willing to put incremental capital in terms of acquisitions, despite the unknown about where the market goes in the next 20 years, or is this an organic you can adapt to the hybrid move?","Scott Donnelly","This is purely organic.","Myles Walton","Okay.","Scott Donnelly","Purely organic. Obviously, it\u2019s a different pooling. It\u2019s like a normal new platform, where you\u2019ve got to invest in new tooling and downstream and things like that, but this is purely organic. And to us, while it\u2019s a different technology is not different really from a business model or business process than what we do today.","Myles Walton","Okay. Thank you.","Scott Donnelly","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Ronald Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Kristine Tan Liwag","Hi, good morning, guys. It\u2019s Kristine Liwag calling in for Ron.","Scott Donnelly","Hi, Kristine.","Kristine Tan Liwag","Scott, last month, GE announced that it\u2019s grounding its fleet of corporate jet. But your conversations with your corporate customers, do you think we\u2019ll see another wave of strategic change of how corporates look at their fleets? And if so, how much of the headwind do you think this could be in market recovery?","Scott Donnelly","Look, I don\u2019t think that it is. I think when companies look at this thing from an economic standpoint. I think, they recognize the productivity in the value of using corporate there and the timing that saves. I mean, it\u2019s a huge productivity boost. I think if you talk to any of the customer trade groups, the NBAAs, people have them and use them, it\u2019s a huge productivity boom for the company. As to whether you use your own aircraft fleet or fractional or charter is driven by economics around how many hours a year you use those aircraft.","So, looking our view the GE thing doesn\u2019t make any sense, unless you\u2019re going to stop flying corporate aircraft, when you fly that many hours, the economics is on your own aircraft is the right way to go. And I think that\u2019s the feedback we get from our corporate customers.","Kristine Tan Liwag","That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe following up on your comments on pricing in aviation and you discussed how you\u2019re using volume to manage some of the pricing expectations in the market. What\u2019s been your customer feedback and how do you approach customers that have been used to seeing discounts in the market to start getting them to believe that pricing is not coming down from here?","Scott Donnelly","So we\u2019ve been doing that by not lowering our prices. Frankly, look, I mean, customers are always going to look for the best deal, I think, everybody does. And as we have these conversations, there are always easy conversations. But we try to impress upon us, look, we\u2019re trying to run a business just like they are. And when you look at that relative price to market, it\u2019s \u2013 these aircraft are a great deal even at the current price levels compared to what they have historically been, and it\u2019s a great value. It\u2019s performance, it\u2019s economics that work for them.","So I think customers are starting to believe it, because we\u2019re not getting the ends of quarters and giving lower discounts to move aircraft. We\u2019ll \u2013 as I say, we will take the trade on having a lower value \u2013 or I\u2019m sorry, having the lower volume on those aircrafst. And I think, certainly, we\u2019ve had customer test that. And we just say guys, look, it\u2019s a great deal and we want to do business with you, and \u2013 but we\u2019re \u2013 I\u2019m not going to drop this pricing. It\u2019s just, it\u2019s not sustainable to be able to make the kind of investments that we need to make to support our customers and to have those next generations of products and not have reasonable margins on the products we\u2019re selling today.","So, yes, tough discussion, but I think, these things are still an incredible value at these price levels. And, as you can see, we still \u2013 we get a lot of deal done. But there are some more guys are still going to continue to test. And that\u2019s fine, we just won\u2019t close those deals.","Kristine Tan Liwag","That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Drew Lipke with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Drew Lipke","Good morning guys, thanks for squeezing me in here. Real quick on systems, the margins there managed to hold flat sequentially despite no Sensor Fuzed Weapon in sales and the unfavorable mix of TAPV, I\u2019m curious what drove the margin strength there and what\u2019s kind of the outlook for the rest of the year?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I think the other parts of the system business, our unmanned business, our support and services businesses, our fee-for-service flight businesses continue to deliver solid performance and I mean that\u2019s really what\u2019s making the difference. As you know we had higher volume, our higher margin is driven around some of the SFW sales which are obviously not going to be here in the back half of the year, but I think we\u2019re trying to stabilize the TAPV program and again just to kind of get that thing behind us, but strong performance in other parts of the systems, namely in unmanned systems and support solutions and these areas that are helping to make up for the loss of having the SFW program here in the back half.","Drew Lipke","Great and then on Bell, just maybe directionally looking at backlog there, can you parse out the commercial backlog and the changes that you are seeing maybe on a year-over-year and sequential basis, again just directionally?","Scott Donnelly","No, we don\u2019t. You know as you guys know the dynamic of the Bell backlog goes through this cycle because we don\u2019t add the next multi year by \u2013 or the next year is multi-year component until we get into the process in the fourth quarter, so it\u2019s basically just doing its normal cycle that\u2019s all.","Drew Lipke","Okay, and then just last one, aviation aftermarket, can you talk about what steps if any you are taking to maybe capture more within the aftermarket and then as we think about the ADS-B mandate in that March theoretical backlog of work there, do you think that\u2019s going to be a meaningful driver to spur aftermarket demand going forward and how should we think about that impact?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I think the AD is a bigger driver in terms of what we\u2019ll see in the aftermarket side of things. As you know we\u2019ve in general been open to taking back some of our aftermarket in terms of service centers and we\u2019ve played that out in a number of locations and that\u2019s gone well and we would always kind of look for opportunities to do that in the future as well, because I think that we have some good third-party service guys, but as we have opportunities to increase doing more and more of that direct, we will continue to look at those opportunities as we have done in the past, that strategy has worked out well.","ADS-B is not a huge deal for us, I mean it\u2019s a huge deal to our customers and the cost, but really the lion\u2019s share of that is I mean we do a lot of those installations, we\u2019re doing those as we speak. So it does drive visits into the shop to do it, but a lot of those dollars obviously are the equipment which is being installed as opposed to the service labor which is really our content of doing that. So, it\u2019s not a \u2013 it is a significant cost to our customer, but it\u2019s not a big upside to us by any means.","Drew Lipke","Okay, all right. Thanks, guys.","Eric Salander","Okay, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call.

Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Textron 2013 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) And as a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President, Investor Relations, Mr. Doug Wilburne. Please go ahead.","Douglas Wilburne","Thank you, Tom, and good morning everyone. On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. For everybody\u2019s reference, our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.","During the course of our call, we will be discussing future estimates and expectations including our 2014 outlook. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release. We would also like to point out that our 2014 guidance will not include the impact of our planned acquisition of Beechcraft. We will update our 2014 guidance to account for the impact of the acquisition after we have closed the transaction.","Moving now to fourth quarter results, starting with slide number three in our earnings presentation. Revenues in the quarter were $3.5 billion, up 4.3% from a year ago. Income from continuing operations was $0.60 per share, compared to $0.50 in last year\u2019s fourth quarter.","This was a few cents higher than we were expecting at the end of December when we indicated that we would likely be below the bottom end of our guidance range as a result of better operating results in our manufacturing businesses.","Moving to cash flow, fourth quarter manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $774 million, bringing our full year manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions to $256 million. Full year pension contributions were $194 million, which reflected a $21 million contribution during the fourth quarter.","With that, I will turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Donnelly","Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everybody. Overall, we had a good fourth quarter to close out the year with revenue growth at Cessna, Bell and Industrial and strong cash generation across all our businesses. Moving to our Textron Systems segment, revenues were down in the quarter as expected primarily due to lower UAS and precision weapon shipments in the quarter compared to a year ago. Operationally, Systems had a good quarter with 9.8% margins.","We also continued to make progress on the Ship-to-Shore Connector and Canadian Tactical Armored Patrol Vehicle program while continuing to make on-time deliveries on our existing Afghanistan National Army Vehicle contract. In our UAS business, we saw improvement in the operating reliability of our Aerosonde fee-for-service aircraft reflecting installation of Lycoming Build Engines into the fleet.","Also within the UAS business we made good progress in the shadow TCDL development program which we believe puts us on track to begin delivering production units in the second half of this year.","Finally we closed on the acquisitions of OPINICUS and Mechtronix in December and we are now in the process of combining with our existing military simulation business at AAI to establish the new Textron Simulation and Training Systems business. Jim Takats, the former CEO of OPINICUS is the President of the new unit and with his team he is busy with integration activities and business planning. As we look to 2014 for Systems, we significant top-line expansion led by growth in the UAS revenues, primarily from delivery of TCDL systems and the impact of the Simulation and Training business which should lead to improvement in full year margins.","Switching to Industrial, revenues were up 9.5% in the quarter reflecting higher volumes in each of our businesses as well as the acquisitions of Sherman & Reilly and HD Electric at Greenlee. For the year, we posted a 60 basis point improvement in margins on 3.9% revenue growth.","Looking to 2014, we are expecting continued margin expansion resulting from solid top-line growth driven by strong auto markets and our continued investments in new products sales and distribution capabilities.","Moving now to Bell, plant productivity and execution across our programs improve and that was reflected in our sequential margin recovery in the quarter. We delivered 13 V-22s, 6 H-1s and 75 commercial helicopters, versus 9 V-22s, 6 H-1s and 65 commercial helicopters in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. During the quarter, the V-22 program was approved which contributed to an increase in overall Bell backlogs.","On the FMS front, last week the Department of Defense notified Congress that it intends to sell six V-22s to Israel with the aircrafts expected to be in field in 2016. We continue to pursue a number of additional FMS opportunities for both V-22 and H-1 aircrafts and believe we will have incremental FMS deliveries for both of these platforms.","On the commercial front, we delivered 213 helicopters for the full year, up 13% from last year\u2019s 188 units, reflecting our investment in the products and increased focus on the commercial helicopter market.","Looking to 2014, we are expecting a flat top-line at Bell reflecting a decrease in military revenue offset by an increase in the commercial side of business. Margins are expected to be down slightly, reflecting the expected decrease in military margins and continue to back for the manufacturing efficiencies we talked about last quarter.","Wrapping up, our operations for U.S Cessna we received FAA certification for our new M2 and Sovereign in the last week of December which allowed us to deliver 12 M2s and eight Sovereigns bringing total jet deliveries in the quarter to 62. This compares with 53 units in last year\u2019s fourth quarter.","For the year, deliveries were down at a 139 jets compared to 181 last year. Looking towards 2014, while we are not counting on a significant change in overall market conditions, we do expect that full year deliveries of the M2 and the new Sovereign Plus introduction of our new 10 will contribute to increase in overall deliveries which should internally do an improvement in profitability.","Longer term, we are still expecting overall jet growth to develop as global economies gain momentum and combine with additional new products that are introduced. With our announced acquisition of Beechcraft, we believe we will be in an excellent position to capitalize on the rebound in the business jet and overall general aviation market.","To wrap up 2013 in Textron Systems, we continued to innovate on the product front including our expanded Commando family of armored vehicles and development of the next generation of the Shadow M2. We continue to increase our international customer base with finalization of a contract to supply Saudi Arabia with precision weapons.","We also made progress on a variety of product opportunities in international military markets which we expect to lead to a number of orders in 2014. And finally we established new business unit in the growing global aircraft simulation training market.","At Industrial last year\u2019s 4% top-line growth reflected our continuing investment and expanded distribution in new products such as the new hybrid-powered Bad Boy Ambush iS at E-Z-GO, and the high productivity AR722T diesel turf mower Jacobsen. And our acquisitions of Sherman & Riley and HD Electric demonstrate our commitment to leverage these businesses for growth and long-term shareholder value.","At Bell, we implemented a new Enterprise Resource Planning system and now the rollout was without issues. We believe the new system will contribute to significant improvements in our manufacturing operations over the next several years. We also introduced our new short light single and continued to expand our focus on commercial markets around the world.","On the military side, we announced an important new tilt-rotor product, the V-280 Valor and propose that as Bell Solutions from U.S. DODs Future Vertical Lift program.","At Cessna, in addition to the M2 and Sovereign, we certified the Cessna TTX the world\u2019s fastest certified fixed-gear single-engine aircraft as well as the Grand Caravan EX. Finally in December, we achieved first light of our Scorpion ISR tactical strike aircraft less than two years from when we launched our design program.","In summary, 2013 was an important year with significant new product introductions, strategic acquisitions and investments in the future of our businesses. To finish with our 2014 guidance, we are projecting an overall revenue increase of about 9% with EPS from continuing operations in the range of $2 to $2.20.","Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions is also expected to increase significantly to a range of $600 million to $700 million. With that, I will turn the call over to Frank.","Frank Connor","Thank you, Scott and good morning everyone. Manufacturing revenue was up $153 million in the quarter generating an increase in manufacturing segment profit of $26 million.","Let\u2019s look at how each of the manufacturing segments contributed. Cessna revenues were $923 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $22 million on a year-over-year basis reflecting the increase in jet deliveries partially offset by a decrease in revenues at Citation X and lower caravan deliveries.","We posted an operating profit of $33 million, up $10 million from the fourth quarter of 2012 primarily as a result of improved performance reflecting an unfavorable arbitration award recorded in last year\u2019s fourth quarter.","At Bell, revenues were up $226 million, primarily due to higher volumes across the business. Segment profit increased $1 million as the impact of higher volumes was largely offset by lower military margins and manufacturing inefficiencies related to prior period labor negotiations and the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system.","At Textron Systems, revenue decreased to $162 million, primarily due to lower volumes. Segment profit increased $4 million as improved performance more than offset the impact of the lower volumes. Industrial revenues were up $67 million and segment profit increased $11 million, primarily due to higher volumes.","Moving to finance, segment profit was $2 million. Credit quality remained stable with non-accrual accounts at a $105 million flat with the third quarter and 60-day delinquencies were $80 million, $8 million lower than at the end of last quarter. We ended the year with approximately $1.5 billion in receivables with only $185 million remaining in the non-captive portfolio.","Moving to corporate items, corporate expenses were $57 million, up $43 million from last year reflecting the impact of \u2013 that our higher share price had on compensation expense. Interest expense was $27 million, down $11 million from a year ago primarily reflecting to retirement of our convertible debt earlier in the year. Our tax rate of 23.3% benefited from the impact of lower U.S. income and a number of one-time foreign items.","Turning now to our 2014 guidance beginning with pension expense and looking at slide 8. Based on bond rates prevailing at the end of 2013, we\u2019ve increased our 2014 U.S. plan discount rate to 5%.","In combination with 14% returns on planned assets for 2013, unfunded liability of our defined benefit pension plans dropped to $200 million from $1.3 billion a year ago. On this basis, we are estimating 2014 pension cost of about $130 million. This will provide about $45 million in pre-tax year-over-year benefits to the P&L taking into account 2013\u2019s higher cost of our inventories and carried over to 2014 and a portion of this year\u2019s lower cost will be inventories and carried over into 2015.","Turning to slide 9, R&D is expected to be approximately $490 million or about 3.7% of sales, down from $511 million in 2013. We are estimating CapEx will be about $425 million, down slightly from last year\u2019s capital expenditure of $444 million.","Flipping to slide 10 which continued to our segment guidance, at Cessna we are expecting about 19% revenue growth reflecting growth in jets and aftermarket with segment margins in the range of 2.5% to 3.5%. At Bell, we are expecting overall revenues will be approximately flat reflecting lower military revenues being offset by higher commercial revenues with expected margins in the range of 12% to 12.5%.","At Systems, we are looking for top-line growth of about 20% led by higher UAS revenues with segment margins in the range of 9.5% to 10%. At Industrial, we are expecting 10% revenues growth with the expansion of 2014 margins to be 8.25% to 8.75% range. At finance for forecasting segment profit in the range of $5 million to $10 million in 2014 with minimal upside potential from non-captive asset dispositions, now that those assets are de minimus.","Moving below the segment line and looking at slide 11, we are projecting about $150 million for corporate expense, down from 2013 primarily reflecting lower compensation expense related to change in share price. Our interest expense estimate at about $117 million is down primarily as a result of last year\u2019s retirement of our convertible notes. And next year\u2019s tax rate is expected to be higher at about 31.5% primarily reflecting the discontinuance of the U.S. R&D tax credit and a higher U.S. income mix.","Looking now at slide 12, our 2014 EPS guidance reflects an increase of $0.35 at the midpoint. Let\u2019s discuss the major elements driving the increase. Tax headwinds decreased EPS by $0.14, lower expected earnings at Finance represented $0.10 headwind. Improved interest expense provides a pickup of $0.01, the absence of last year\u2019s restructuring charge at Cessna adds $0.07 and the benefit of lower pension expense is expected to add about $0.11 per share in 2014.","And finally the contribution from our underlying manufacturing business is estimated to be $0.40 per share.","Tom, that concludes our prepared remarks. So we can open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question today comes from the line of John Godyn representing Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","John Godyn \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thank you guys for taking my question. First of all, Scott, I was just hoping that now with the past at some time you could talk a little bit about maybe the internal response from the sales force as well as customer response from the announced Beech acquisition?","Scott Donnelly","Sure, I think it\u2019s been overwhelmingly positive and we\u2019ve had a ton of interactions with the Beechcraft customers and I think from their perspective this provides \u2013 uncertainty with a company that\u2019s gone some pretty difficult times. So I think that all the feedback we received has been very, very positive.","I think the notion at the customer service and support will be stable through the lifecycle of these products on both the Can aero piece which I think people are fairly comfortable with, but in large part the hawker piece with a lot of customers that were concerned about where that would go has given them a great deal of comfort and the fact that it\u2019s now in an ownership structure that\u2019s long-term committed to the business in general aviation market has been received very, very well.","John Godyn \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great, that\u2019s very helpful and I was hoping that, in terms of the 2014 outlook, you could elaborate a little bit on the assumptions or expectations underlying Cessna. In particular, kind of the pricing environment that you see next year or this year, is it getting firmer, just trying to understand the $3.3 billion revenue number a little bit better, think the uptick just within the context to the E-Z comp in 2013 struck us a little bit low and so I was hoping that you could elaborate a bit on that.","Scott Donnelly","Well, I think if you look at the 2014, the comparative, first of all I\u2019d say, the market is still challenging as I said, I don\u2019t think we are expecting any dramatic change in terms of the market dynamic that\u2019s out there. So, pricing for us was roughly flat year-over-year, so I\u2019d say it has more or less stabilized in terms of where the pricing environment is, most of what we are anticipating in terms of growth is really driven by new products.","So as you look into 2014, obviously we\u2019ve seen very strong demand around the M2 product. The Sovereign did well really at the end of the quarter obviously, the certifications happened very late in the year but will not have a full year of not just the M2 but also the Sovereign of course we are expecting the 10 to certify in the early part of this year.","So we expect the full year sales in terms of the Citation 10. So, really the dynamic is, new products matter a lot and as we talked about over the last couple of years our \u2013 one of our biggest competitors has been, our installed base have rolled to the new used aircrafts and so as we come out with new products that are differentiated from what\u2019s available out there Interviewer he marketplace in terms of the use, the customer reception has been strong and that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving most of our revenue increase in 2014 which is the full year of those new products that have been well received in the marketplace.","John Godyn \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, and if I could just ask a quick one on Systems, the margin outlook for 2014 suggests the margin expansion versus 2013. I was just hoping you could elaborate on what\u2019s driving that. Thanks a lot.","Scott Donnelly","There is two parts that are driving it. One is, we are feeling better about where we stand on our fee-for-service contracts in UAS. We certainly had another challenging year in 2013 really driven by this issue of engine reliability. The indications we are getting from the field now that we have got our Lycoming Build motors out there has certainly been on a positive trend. So we are pretty confident that we should experience better performance.","It\u2019s still a challenging program and we are booking it as your profit but again we don\u2019t expect to see the kind of impact we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years in terms of losses associated with that program and then the significant piece is that all of that delivery of production TCDL units was really something we originally expected to start delivering in 2013 as a result of the development program. That really moved into 2014 and beyond.","So, we\u2019ve been building those units. We\u2019ve been ready to ship those units but we continue to see completing the development contract which is the cost plus low margin contract we expect that to happen here in the first half of this year and so you\u2019ll see a positive mix in terms of now, this development program with low development margins you\u2019ll actually see delivery of production units at better margins.","John Godyn \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Very helpful, thanks.","Scott Donnelly","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Noah Poponak \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Hey, good morning everyone.","Scott Donnelly","Good morning.","Noah Poponak \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Scott, I wondered if you could maybe just elaborate on the comment you just made about not really expecting much of a change in underlying legacy light cabin business jet demand why not what are customers telling you on the ground today? What are the data points you are looking at that you still need to see change, maybe just a little bit more on sort of how things feel and what it can take to finally turn things?","Scott Donnelly","This is a tough one, obviously. We\u2019ve been guessing at this for quite a number of years now. The key metrics that we look at obviously continue to be favorable, number of used aircrafts available out in the market continues to go down in terms of both percent and absolute number of aircrafts, so we find that encouraging. The used market has been quite active again and in 2013 in number of transactions.","Customer activity, lot of the surveys that people do out there say people are more bullish, certainly in the U.S. Although we continue to be concerned about what\u2019s going on around the economies in Latin America and in Europe which are sort of our second and third largest markets classically for those light mid-sized business jets. So, if I looked at our legacy products which are things that we have had in production through the course of the year we are basically seeing a sort of a flattish market in that area.","Again, that\u2019s an area that we see and are pretty confident about the increased revenue is the fact that we now have full years for some of the new products. But if I look at things like M2s, we know what that is. We did grow our production a little bit about half way through the year because of increased demand for that product.","We feel pretty good about where we are on our sovereigns and obviously the 10 certifies, we have original backlog around that product as well. So I think that the safe assumption at this stage is to assume that the market dynamic overall is relatively flat to what it was in 2013 and then all the upside or improvements comes from introduction of new products.","Noah Poponak \u2013 Goldman Sachs","So, should we \u2013 when we are looking at total Cessna units, should we have 2014 production up something on a percentage basis, something similar to what you are telling us revenues will be compared to 2013 and then have \u2013 to think about 2015, it\u2019s not really changing substantially from 2014 or can you really not \u2013 is it sort of short-term still that things could really change significantly still later in the year and it\u2019s too hard to say?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I think, again the assumptions that you make around 2014 on average aircraft pricing and you are going have a mix obviously of M2s which are from a price point obviously towards the lower end of the product range. But you have the 10 and the sovereigns behind. So I think your assumptions are probably not unreasonable in terms of what you think about in terms of unit volumes in 2014.","We are certainly not \u2013 nowhere near close to 2015 yet, but I wouldn\u2019t try to make any assumptions around the market overall. I guess the only commentary I would make with respect to 2015 is that, we certainly expect to have the latitude in the market for full year of sales in 2015. So again along the same lines that way we are thinking about today, all have been equal, these new products are things that really drive growth and we would certainly expect to see growth in 2015 driven by the introduction of the latitude.","Noah Poponak \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, I appreciate the color. I\u2019ll jump back in the queue. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Peter Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead sir.","Peter Skibitski \u2013 Drexel Hamilton","","Good morning guys. Just a few more questions. Let me start with the maybe the XLS. Scott, when do the final assembly in China start for the XLS? And you maybe not expecting that to be a meaningful up tick XLS deliveries next year or I guess this year?","Scott Donnelly","We do expect in 2014 that we would make the first deliveries to the joint venture for the XLS just as we did for their caravan in 2013, but yes, they are relatively low unit numbers as we are just starting to ramping up that process and working the first couple aircrafts through it. So, we are still in the process of business licenses and starting to generate sales activity in China through that joint venture.","Peter Skibitski \u2013 Drexel Hamilton","Okay, got it. And then, can you maybe give us more detail on what Cessna aftermarket growth finished up at in 2014 and what\u2019s your assumption is in 2014 and similar question on pre-owned volumes?","Scott Donnelly","So the aftermarket was up again at Cessna in the aftermarket. It wasn\u2019t up quite as much as it was in the third quarter. But it was a pretty strong quarter in terms of aftermarket growth. The utilizations have held pretty steady. So that business continues to do well in terms of used aircraft. The dynamic that we saw was still very active market and we certainly saw more aircrafts \u2013 a net reduction in our inventory of aircrafts as we sold more than we took in trades.","Peter Skibitski \u2013 Drexel Hamilton","It seems like 2014, revenue from pre-owned, are you expecting that to be down or maybe just directionally give us a sense?","Scott Donnelly","That\u2019s probably relatively flat. It was up this year \u2013 year-over-year but I would say, probably relatively flat next year.","Peter Skibitski \u2013 Drexel Hamilton","Got it. Okay, thanks guys.","Scott Donnelly","Sure.","Operator","","Our next question is from Carter Copeland representing Barclays. Please go ahead.","","Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays","Good morning, gentlemen. Just a couple quick ones. On the Bell margin outlook for 2014, I know the sequential improvement in the fourth quarter but I was wondering why that was \u2013 what was behind the down year-over-year number there? Is that was just the V-22 in the fourth quarter? Or if that was anymore ERP bleed over from 2013? Any color there would be helpful.","Scott Donnelly","Well, certainly some of it was a bleed over from the earlier quarter in 2013. So as those inefficiencies that we had which we talked about in the largely impacting the second and third quarter, a fair amount of that stuff cost that was inventory which then will bleed out.","So it\u2019s certainly sold as we recognize revenues on aircrafts in the fourth quarter and we\u2019ll see that as we continue our way through 2014 as well. In terms of real-time operations, we have seen improvements in terms of some of that productivity but we still have a long way to go and continue to drive better margins.","Obviously, the other dynamic that we have which had some impact in the quarter and will have continuing impact on a go-forward basis is that we are now transitioning into lots of aircrafts that have been negotiated at lower rates than we were achieving in our earlier multi-year contract as a result of accumulated productivity over a period of a number of years.","Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays","Correct. And I wondered if you could just clarify the UAS commentary earlier. You weren\u2019t expecting to book, are you not booking profits at all or you are just not booking losses, is that the right clarification?","Scott Donnelly","Well, on the fee-for-service we book that at zero profit.","Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays","And your expectation for 2014 is that that will stay that way through the course of the year?","Scott Donnelly","That\u2019s correct. Our expectation is that we will say that way but we will not recognize any further losses on the program.","Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays","Okay, great. Thanks, I\u2019ll get back in the queue.","Operator","Our next question will be from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason Gursky \u2013 Citigroup","Hey, good morning everyone. Frank, I was wondering if you could just help us a little bit with the cadence of revenues throughout the year both at Cessna and its systems, just wondering if the seasonality at Cessna is perhaps going to be a little bit front-end in the past in light of the new deliveries and then the cadence that systems will be helpful given the revenues outlook quite a bit. Just getting a sense of when we are going to see an acceleration of revenues there?","Frank Connor","Yes, I think you\u2019ll see the same type of seasonality that you have seen at Cessna. It will be impart impacted a little bit by the timing of the certification of the tens which is either a late first quarter or second quarter event. But you will see kind of the same type of back-end strength relative to front-end at Cessna. And at systems, because we expect the TCDL deliveries to be second-half oriented, you\u2019ll see seasonality there as well where the second half of the year will be substantially stronger than the first half of the year.","Jason Gursky \u2013 Citigroup","Okay, great. And then just two quick follow-ups. Actually, how much is the R&D tax credit where \u2013 is it that would have sold back in and then the second question is just the R&D trajectory for the enterprise overall beyond 2014 just general trends on up or down relative to 2014 would be helpful.","Frank Connor","Jason, on the R&D credit, I\u2019ll get back to you on offline. We don\u2019t have that number right in front of us.","Scott Donnelly","","Yes, on the overall R&D it will be program specific at the end of the day in terms of what we are looking at. But I think, in and around these types of R&D levels with some probably modest growth is what you should expect.","","Jason Gursky \u2013 Citigroup","Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you guys.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to the line of Robert Stallard, Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead sir.","Robert Stallard \u2013 Royal Bank of Canada","Thanks so much. Good morning.","Scott Donnelly","Good morning.","Robert Stallard \u2013 Royal Bank of Canada","Scott, can you help on Cessna, given your comments on 2014 growth. I was wondering how much of this is actually in the back half already? Do you have any remaining slots for customers at the moment or are these pretty much sold out on the \u2013 shifted to \u2013 let\u2019s say legacy models that is still for sale?","Scott Donnelly","No we have some slots. The M2 as I said earlier, we actually added some production capacity. So we created some slots, so we do have aircrafts that are available for sale this year. Sovereign there are aircrafts that are available. We have some of the backlog and some that will be still be sales that need to convert orders. So our orders to sales in 2014 the tens are pretty well sold to this point. There is probably a couple that could be available in the latter part of the year. So the new product side is \u2013 has pretty reasonable backlog in terms of sales.","Robert Stallard \u2013 Royal Bank of Canada","Okay, and then secondly on Bell, you mentioned you turned up your contract there. There are some FMS sales floating around. Has this had any impact though on your clarity for 2015 or is it likely be a further added like 2015 and 2017.","Scott Donnelly","2015 is fairly well set, just in terms of, if you look at lead times frankly, any aircraft deliveries and the V-22 slighted for 2015 will already have had been in production. So I think the 2015 numbers that we\u2019ve provided you guys will hold where they are that\u2019s probably also true at this stage of the game in 2016. So when you see something like the Israeli deal, where they want to take deliveries in 2016, those are units that are actually coming out of the marine core and V-22 stream and so, as the decisions get made in terms of the government about how they want to treat those aircrafts, they are going to add additional that would probably at this point be something that would be a 2017 delivery in terms of any incremental volume opportunities.","Robert Stallard \u2013 Royal Bank of Canada","Thanks, so much.","Operator","We have a question from Cai Von Rumohr representing Cowen. Please go ahead.","Cai Von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen and Company","So, get us a little color on Cessna\u2019s profit looked a little bit light, was there anything in terms of R&D being higher, higher used aircraft losses in the fourth quarter because the incremental margin looks like at 16% relative to the third quarter?","Scott Donnelly","Yes, on a big piece that is, with the certifications both the M2 and the Sovereign we had a lot of cost around the certification and frankly and awful lot of variants in our manufacturing side because of a lot of updates and configurations. We are building these aircrafts and went through certification that was nothing huge but there was a fair bit of a rework that went on to get those into the certification standard. So those are cost that we bore in, in the fourth quarter and of course we also had the citation 10 certification program going in those suite as well. So, it was primarily driven around cost associated to those certifications as well as a fair bit of higher cost associated with the manufacturing efficiencies of having to upgrade and modify those aircrafts as we went through the process.","Cai Von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen and Company","Got it. And then, you\u2019ve indicated that R&D would be 490 in this year down from 511. Were the certification cost included in the R&D in 2013 and what kind of trend should we expect at both Cessna and R&D in 2014?","Scott Donnelly","If you look at R&D, Cai, obviously we don\u2019t break the sales, business-by-business, but it\u2019s safe to say that the majority of the reduction on a year-over-year basis is coming out of Cessna and that\u2019s because we did have an awful lot of R&D cost this year associated with the pack that we are doing the M2 and the Sovereign and the 10 certification programs simultaneously. Obviously, as we go into 2014, we still have to complete the certification on the 10, although the majority of that I would say is behind at this stage of the game, but we still have the spending associated with the latitude program and complete the latitude design development and getting into the flight test and that certification program on that front. So, most of that R&D reduction at a corporate level really is coming out of Cessna and it\u2019s just a function of we rarely have had a time on that. I am not sure we\u2019ve ever had a time, but we\u2019ve had that many parallel certification programs that we\u2019ve been undertaking. And again it wasn\u2019t just on the jet business but also on the prop business.","Cai Von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen and Company","So, help me understand you are talking about a 400 basis point improvement year-over-year at Cessna and it looks like we get a 100 out of the severance charge, we get close to a 100 out of pensions, we got something out of R&D. So it doesn\u2019t looks like you are giving yourselves any credit for the higher volume. Am I missing something there?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I think if you looked at the sort of the mid-point of the guidance as you are moving to next year, the leverage in terms of the incremental margin to that revenue is going to be in the low to mid-20s.","Cai Von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen and Company","Okay, and then you had mentioned that there is a $45 million positive P&L swing in 2014 in pension expense versus it looks like a $96 million decline in pension cost. Could you give us for 2013 and what you are looking forward for 2014 the actual pension expense that will flow through \u2013 that will be in the P&L?","Scott Donnelly","I am not sure we have that exact number. On an year-over-year basis it\u2019s about $45 million and of course the charge or the cost as we outlined on our schedule just $130 million.","Cai Von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen and Company","So we are ongoing with this, you are only picking up half of the decline in the cost this year and Frank alluded to the fact that the inventories flow through, should we expect the other $50 million or so to flow through in 2015 if all the assumptions remain the same?","Scott Donnelly","Yes, so, Cai, the math behind it is, we tend to inventory about a third of the pension cost differential that then gets realized in the subsequent year and so we have the benefit of the step down in 2013 to 2014 and we\u2019ll get two-thirds of that benefit flowing through in 2014 but we will continue to have one-third of the headwind that we had from 2012 to 2013 that was inventory and therefore will be realized in 2014 P&L. So, that\u2019s the net $45 million. If you then roll into 2015, assuming that we don\u2019t have any further change in downward trend in discount rate or negative rates or something, we will realize the remaining one-third of this year\u2019s benefit and then we will not have \u2013 we\u2019ll have whatever the subsequent impact is to that following year. So, we are kind of making up for the headwind two years ago in part this year and then in 2015 it should trend even better assuming things stay on track the way they happen.","Cai Von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen and Company","Thank you very much.","Operator","And next we will go to the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.","George Shapiro \u2013 Shapiro Research","Hi, yes, just following-up on Cai\u2019s question Scott, why shouldn\u2019t the incremental margins be closer to 30% at Cessna kind of versus the low to mid 20 this year, low 20 that you are suggesting on the call.","Scott Donnelly","Well, George, because they are not. I mean, as we go through the numbers and we look at where we are in the market, you take into consideration the mix of the new products legacy products, where we are in terms of pricing in the marketplace. That\u2019s where we end with the incremental that are kind of at the midpoint down there in the \u2013 I think it\u2019s around 23% if you take the midpoint of the guidance. So if we see, obviously, if we see some better volume if we see the change in the market. I think there is upside to that. But we have to see some strengthening in that light to mid-sized market but as we came through 2013 and just the dynamic that we saw which was much softer than we would have expected in 2013. The impacts in terms of \u2013 which is sure volume and pricing was quite challenging and so we factor that into our expectations for 2014.","George Shapiro \u2013 Shapiro Research","Okay, and then a follow-up on your comment there. If you looked at the orders I mean we saw a big improvement in the third quarter another big improvement this quarter were the orders really were up like 30% plus in the third quarter and certainly the best since 2008. So why wouldn\u2019t that suggest that the markets actually really beginning a big pick up here?","","Scott Donnelly","Well, I mean, we\u2019d like to think that and carry over to 2014, but again, George, if I go back to the latter part of 2012, we certainly thought there was some momentum that we are going to see coming into 2013 and we didn\u2019t see that. As a result, we ended up with production schedules and such that we are a lot more difficult than we would have expected and so I think we need to continue as we go into 2014 despite having seen what was certainly a good quarter in terms of order activity that we are going to continue to view that the strength will be around the new products and that it will still be a challenging overall market and therefore the legacy products will be under the same sort of pressure that they were in 2013.","George Shapiro \u2013 Shapiro Research","Okay, and then just one quick one on Systems, the revenue guidance you gave is a lot higher than what I would have expected. I know in your commentary you went through some of the things, I mean, is there one or two programs that are substantially increasing at that point in time and what\u2019s the mix between international and domestic that you would expect in the 2014 guidance?","Scott Donnelly","Well, the biggest driver in the Systems revenue growth in 2014, George, is around this TCDL program. So we should complete \u2013 it will be relatively back-end loaded. We will probably complete the development programs which includes an army test which will happen in the second quarter. So, you won\u2019t get sign-off on the development side until probably late in the first half of the year. So that means all that production delivery will be in Q3 and Q4. Most of those assets by the way are manufacturers. So, there is \u2013 but there is not an operational risk in terms our ability to deliver on that. It\u2019s just a matter of getting through the development program. So that will be all be third and fourth quarter but it is a significant increase in revenue over 2013 and then there is about probably $90 million to $100 million and they are incremental revenues associated with the acquisitions of Mechtronix and OPINICUS in the simulation and training business.","George Shapiro \u2013 Shapiro Research","And then Scott, what was the mix between international and domestic in 2014?","Scott Donnelly","In the systems?","George Shapiro \u2013 Shapiro Research","Yes.","Frank Connor","I don\u2019t think we would expect a big changer because we\u2019ve got the growth in the TCDL unit there, but we are still on track to get that near 50% in 2015, George.","Scott Donnelly","TCDL, George obviously is all \u2013 that\u2019s all U.S. army. So that\u2019s going to see our number a little bit and that that\u2019s sort of demand which would have been split over several years will all be domestic. But if you look beyond that in terms of our orders and our new business activity it is still biased towards the international marketplace, which as Doug said in this year \u2013 in 2015 you are looking at more like a 50-50.","Frank Connor","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","We will go to the line of Joe Nadol with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Joseph Nadol \u2013 JP Morgan","Thanks, good morning. Scott, just on the mid-sized aircrafts, it seems like you had a decent quarter in particular. XLS really picked up and then some of that timing relative to Q3. Also it seems like the sovereign adds some little more traction is that a fair statement that you try not to get ahead of yourself but things are looking a little better there?","Scott Donnelly","","Well, it was certainly a good quarter in that respect Joe and obviously the introduction in the sovereign helped aircraft available for sale in the fourth quarter and now we\u2019ll have that available for sale throughout 2014 and we do expect good performance on that platform. The XLS did very well in Q4 that was obviously some timing associated around that. But again, as we look at our forecast for 2014 we are assuming that legacy aircrafts and the XLS certainly fits that category and so it\u2019s a great airplane and it continues to do well in the marketplace. But we are expecting the dynamic for the total year of 2014 to be very similar to what we experienced in 2013 which was pretty soft until we got into that fourth quarter.","","Joseph Nadol \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay. And then just one other, on the cash flow, Frank, just looking into 2014, what are the key working capital assumptions to the $600 to $700, in particularly what are you assuming add-ins within the category at Bell and Cessna?","Scott Donnelly","Yes, the working capital is about flat. So there is no real change in working capital. We would expect it \u2013 we will continue to see some inventory improvement at Bell and Cessna here earlier in the year. And so we are always going to be seasonal from a cash flow standpoint but better seasonality, certainly than we saw last year, but kind of given our expectations that those businesses will continue to show out year growth we\u2019d expect then some kind of reversal of that that you will see later part of the year as we build into 2015 kind of particularly as we get ready for instance for the latitude launch and then other new product launches. So, kind of overall flat with some dynamic around seasonality during the year.","Joseph Nadol \u2013 JP Morgan","And what was the \u2013 can you quantify, versus maybe your expectations a year ago. The inventory build in those two businesses during 2014. how much that caused you, just in terms of Cessna deliveries not meeting your original expectations and then the issues you had at Bell.","Scott Donnelly","Joe, I think from a straight working capital management standpoint between the sort of the overbuild at Cessna part of which obviously liquidated in the fourth quarter but not fully to where we would like to have been. We had a couple of hundred million dollars of working capital different than where we would like to have been and I think what Frank is saying, is as we go through 2014 we certainly expect that we will address that issue and that we will fix that working capital problem, but it is going to be pressured as we get into the latter part of next year particularly around Latitude. We done our first engine on that aircraft. It should be flying here very soon and we\u2019ll be into the flight test program and driving towards certifications early in 2015 obviously to get a full year sales in 2015 means we are going to go ahead and turn that production line on. So we\u2019ll be building out those aircrafts but we won't be able to sell those aircrafts, deliver those aircrafts until that certification happens. And so that will happen probably in the very early part of 2015 but we\u2019ll be carrying a full production line with revenues. So I think we have a plan on how we are going to address. So what I would as the overall working capital mix in 2013 but we are going to be pressured around some of the inventory particularly around the latitude at Cessna in 2014.","Joseph Nadol \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay, thank you."," ","Operator","Next we go to the line of Julian Mitchell representing Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi, thank you. I think it\u2019s clear you are not going to change your incremental margin guidance on Cessna based on the last 15 questions. But I guess if you look at the \u2013 I just want to focus on the impact of the ramp up of the new jet. So how does that affects the incremental of Cessna, sort of year as a whole in 2014 and in particular in the first half. So I guess you have some better pricing but then at the same time you have got costs associated with the ramp up maybe some fixed cost on absorption early on.","Scott Donnelly","Actually, and that\u2019s what \u2013 I think, Cai and George\u2019s questions are good. I mean, it\u2019s easy to \u2013 we can go through some of the beneficial things that should be flowing through the P&L and try to justify a higher number and I guess the bottom line is while we expect and the new products like the M2 and the Sovereign are good in delivering good gross margin in terms of product lines, there are no issues associated with those recurring cost on the programs but as we have introduced and you ramp these new products we have had inefficiency this year around the models we made go into certification. We would expect some of that will bleed off obviously as we go through the beginning of the new year, but the real issue here is that, despite those better volumes and fairly good confidence with respect to new product programs we think that the pricing environment the challenges in the legacy product given the dynamics in the marketplace, it\u2019s still going to be pretty tough and so as we factor that in. That\u2019s where we end up with the guidance number that we are giving you guys and we would over to see that be the better number and if we see some turn in the market I think we can make that happen but we were kind of burned by the going from 2012 into 2013 and so I think we are going to be very conservative about our perspective of what the overall market is doing as we go from 2013 to 2014.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Sure and then, within Cessna off the market, it sounds like you think, this will be a pretty flattish demand here. I guess if you kind of activity take-offs and landings and so when you got some better news I guess particularly in markets like Europe versus the nine or twelve months ago the U.S. is pretty stable. I just wonder why it is you think the market is be kind of flattish."," ","Scott Donnelly","I think the commercial be up a bit at Cessna but \u2013 I mean the fleet does continue to grow a bit ADUs in the US have been quite stable kind of 0.68, 0.67 as we\u2019ve grown through the \u2013 as to what happens in the European markets or the Latin American market, I think there is \u2013 it\u2019s still bit of a wild card. But we are assuming low to mid-single-digit growth in the service business on a year-over-year basis.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Got it. Thanks and lastly just on Systems. You got a pretty healthy profit increase in for 2014. Is that\u2019s something we should see straight off from the beginning of the year, or you think there will be some lumpiness around that?","Scott Donnelly","I think it will be more back-end loaded, Julian, again primarily driven by the fact that the dynamic on the UAS business is transitioning from this development program which is a very low margin program to the delivery of the production programs which are reasonable and normal production sort of margins. But all those deliveries will be in the third and the fourth quarter of the year.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Great, thanks very much.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Jeff Sprague representing Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Thank you. Good morning. Just a couple quick follow-ups. Scott, has there been any change in just the tenor of order activity around actually getting the sorts is that something really \u2013 to a significant degree for the sales effort or not really.","Scott Donnelly","You don\u2019t know \u2013 Jeff, I don\u2019t think the dynamic and people knew they were coming and very close communication with customers for quite some time in terms of the status of those things that the fact that it happened so late in the year, probably cut a few aircrafts out that we would do. Otherwise I have expected to get delivered, but that was just more around \u2013 it became such a compressed schedule right there at the end to just try to physically make the transition happen obviously we got a quite a few aircrafts sold in a very short period of time. I mean, essentially, of course the book showing the 28. So that one with window we are able to title and transfer 20 aircrafts between M2s and sovereigns. So, but I think it had happened earlier in the quarter, clearly there was an opportunity that we would have sold a few more aircrafts. I would say in terms of on a go forward basis, Jeff, it\u2019s a biggest issue that will drive orders and backlog particularly as we look into 2015 is getting the latitude flying. So that aircraft, once it starts being able to demo the aircraft that will start to generate some order momentum and we saw that on the Sovereigns M2. So once you have aircrafts that are out flying and able to do some demonstration and get up to shows and get it around the customers, you do need to have that to start generating the order momentum.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Great, but I\u2019m just wondering on Bell, anything to be aware of their margin trajectories flows out over the year, and second the carryover inventory cost on the labor disruptions plus as we roll into the multi-year is there any \u2013 the new multi-year is there any long lead time stuff that weighs on margins in 2014 as we start the kind of movement to 2015?","Scott Donnelly","I think we are probably a little more pressured in the early part of the year. In part we are recognizing now some of these lower margin military programs, particularly in the H1s some V-22 pressure as you move through the course of the year. But because more of o our volume is going to be dependent on the commercial business. Now as you know that commercial does tend to \u2013 from a seasonality standpoint tend to be loaded more towards the latter half of the year and particularly a lot of the larger helicopter programs which tend to be the larger generator of profits in terms of the overall mix will be more skewed towards the back of the year. So, it\u2019s going to be not a wild swing, but I would say will be more pressured in the earlier part of the year on a Bell margin that we would be in the third, fourth quarter.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Okay, but for the multi-year that extended work expecting a step-down in 2015 we really feel that calendar 2015 and V-22 margins there is no kind of no early lead time stuff that starts to impact 2014.","Scott Donnelly","Now because, we do this when we recognize revenue. Now we do have some aircraft that will be delivered in the fourth calendar year of 2014 which is under that FY 2015 government calendar. So there will be some multi-year to deliveries and that will be in the fourth quarter of this year.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Okay, and then just finally on V-22, at this point it\u2019s still unclear but you would expect that the U.S. government makes the marine whole and the six unit that are going to the Israel that ultimately be made hold somewhere later in the program?","Scott Donnelly","Well, that\u2019s certainly the marine course\u2019s expectation, I would just caveat that was subject to all the budget stuff that\u2019s going on. I think that remains to be definitized.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Okay, thanks for color Scott.","Operator","We have a question from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open sir.","Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","Thanks, I did have just a couple follow-ups, one on Bell first. Can you give us a sense of the total revenue you have there with respect to the refurb and aftermarket services that the army does that stand down their fleet?","Scott Donnelly","Yes, if you look at the program, in total it\u2019s typically a little under $100 million a year of revenue between refurbishments, new cabin builds, spare parts and service.","Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank","And probably a little better than or better than the Bell average I would imagine?>","Scott Donnelly","No, it\u2019s probably about normal, if you look those total mix between new builds and spare parts.","Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay and the other follow-up was, you talked about the second half systems deliveries and just wanted to confirm, is that expectation in the backlog today or it\u2019s in the plan but we are waiting for it to land in the backlog? I\u2019m just curious in terms of the visibility?","Scott Donnelly","I am sorry, which program?","Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank","On the second half systems\u2026.","Scott Donnelly","Oh, yes, I am sorry. No, we had those programs, those contracts have been in-house for quite sometime and as I said, the units have actually been manufactured. So, it\u2019s just we haven\u2019t done condition because we can\u2019t transfer title until after we\u2019ve completed the development piece which is a separate contract. But we actually have two separate production contracts that we already have in-house for the production units of TCDL.","Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, perfect. Thanks.","Frank Connor","","Operator, before we go to our final or follow-up call, I just wanted to clarify on the question from Jason relative to the R&D tax credit that, in 2013 we had about $11 million of a tax credit related to 2012 plus another $15 million remain related to 2013. Obviously that is now taken on in terms of our 2014 tax rate. So with that we will take our final call operator.","Operator","All right, our final question today will come from the line of Peter Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton.","Peter Skibitski \u2013 Drexel Hamilton","Yes. Scott, just on the Bell commercial helicopter outlook I know you said, it\u2019s up for 2014 that\u2019s your expectation, but we had kind of a blow out this year particularly on the 407 and 429 was very strong. I am just wondering what is giving you the confidence that those that continue to see growth in 2014 on the Bell commercial side if it\u2019s primarily oil and gas or if you see other end-markets improving as well.","Scott Donnelly","You know, it\u2019s really been the growth and our order book has really been across the board. So oil and gas has been strong. Emergency medical service has been quite good and as I said, we\u2019ve seen significant growth in the 40. Now the 407GX product has done extremely well in the marketplace and have been very competitive and I expect we\u2019ll continue to see that the 429. Volumes have been up and we expect to see those volumes up again. The receptivity of the product particularly with the extra 500 pounds which we\u2019ve seen approved in many markets around the world we are still working on that with the FAA for the US market. But most markets outside of US and Europe have given the additional 500 pound gross weight increase and that product is doing extremely well in a very broad range of markets. So, the strength in terms of what\u2019s going on in the helicopter market has been good and our share as a result of the new product has been growing.","Peter Skibitski \u2013 Drexel Hamilton","Very good.

And welcome to the Textron First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. And I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Eric Salander, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Eric Salander","Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today\u2019s press release.","On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron\u2019s Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.","Textron\u2019s revenues in the quarter were $3.3 billion, up $203 million from last year\u2019s first quarter. Income from continuing operations was $0.72 per share, up from $0.37 per share or $0.46 on an adjusted basis in last year\u2019s first quarter. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions reflected a use of cash of $158 million, compared to a use of cash of $227 million last year\u2019s first quarter. We also announced that we have reached a definitive agreement to sell our Tools & Test business to the Emerson for approximately $810 million in cash.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Donnelly","Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everybody. Segment revenue was up in the quarter in Industrial, Bell, and Aviation, partly offset by lower revenue in systems consistent with our expectations. The Bell revenues were up on higher military volumes for the quarter.","On the commercial side, we delivered 46 helicopters, up from 27 in last year's first quarter. We continue to see positive customer reaction to the 505 as we ramp production and deliveries, the first units delivered to European customers in the quarter. We also continue to see international demand for the 412, closing two multi-aircraft orders.","At HELI-EXPO in February, we showcased our innovation and leadership on the commercial helicopter market with the unveiling of 407GXi, featuring a new Garmin avionic system and an upgraded FADEC controlled Rolls-Royce engine. We also announced Air Methods Corporation as the launch customer with an order for six of these new aircraft.","On the new product front, following the first flight of V-280 Valor in December, the aircraft continues to demonstrate its agility and maneuverability, hitting new milestones in the early stages of a flight test program as it moves towards operation in full airplane mode.","Each milestone represents another step forward in creating the next-generation of tiltrotor aircraft. The aircraft was flown by U.S. Army experimental test pilot, representing a great opportunity to put the aircraft in the hands of our military customer.","Moving to Systems, revenues were down on lower volumes, primarily weapons and sensors related to the discontinuance of the SFW production line. During the quarter, Unmanned Systems received two test orders for the Aerosonde with a combined value of $97 million from NAVAIR in addition to a $28 million logistics support contract for the U.S. Army.","At Marine and Land Systems, we are making good progress on the ship to shore program as the first craft began on water testing earlier this month and will proceed to builders trials next with delivery scheduled for the summer.","At TRU simulation and Training, we signed a purchase agreement for an A350 full flight sim with Airbus, and we are also chosen to provide the first-ever full flight simulators for HR600 aircraft models for Japan Air Commuter and Ansett Aviation training Australia.","At Industrial, we saw a 14% increase in revenues with growth in each of our businesses. Overall, margin was down reflecting the additional Arctic Cat operations in the quarter as compared to the prior year due to the March 2017 timing of the acquisition and the first quarter seasonality of the outdoor Powersports business.","We saw higher volumes in our growing GSE product line and also received the first order for the innovative new TUG ALPHA 4 aircraft pushback, booking five units for delivery to UPS later this year.","Within our Textron off-road product line, we unveiled the new Wildcat XX side-by-side designed with an off-road racing inspired suspension system, delivering best-in-class performance.","At Arctic Cat, we introduced our new Mountain Snowmobiles, with our ground-breaking Alpha One single beam rear suspension system, further demonstrating our industry leading product innovation.","Moving to Textron Aviation, revenues were up 4% in the quarter. We delivered 36 jets, up from 35 last year and 29 commercial turboprops, up from 20 last year. These deliveries reflect an improved mix of models across our jet and commercial turboprop product lines.","We saw continued order strength in the quarter, with a number of multi-aircraft orders, including five Caravans for service into Papua New Guinea and two special mission King Airs configured for an air ambulance fleet in Australia.","In February we attended the Singapore Airshow where we announced Latitude has been granted certifications in China and Australia, demonstrating our commitment to the Asia-Pacific region. We also had our first two Latitude deliveries into China in the quarter. For the second consecutive year, the Latitude earned the title as the most delivered business jet in the midsized category.","On the new product front, we continue to work towards certification of the Longitude, which we expect later in the second quarter. The Longitude made its APAC debut at the Singapore Airshow successfully circumnavigating the globe and demonstrating its commanding performance and reliability to customers along the way.","We also made progress on the SkyCourier, successfully completing wind tunnel testing as we look to develop this aircraft on an accelerated time line. The Denali is tracking to its development schedule and continues to generate a significant amount of customer interest. Our AT-6 Wolverine aircraft was chosen by the U.S. Airforce to participate in the second phase of Light Attack Experiment program which begins in the second quarter.","Lastly, we have agreed to sell our Tools & Test business to Emerson. While Tools & Test has been an important part of our industrial portfolio for many years, this transaction represents a good return for our shareholders and positions the business for future success as part of Emerson.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Frank.","Frank Connor","Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Segment profit in the quarter was $279 million, up $60 million from the first quarter of 2017 on a $203 million increase in revenues. Let\u2019s review how each of the segments contributed starting with Textron Aviation.","At Textron Aviation, revenues were up $40 million from this period last year primarily due to higher price and volume. Segment profit was $72 million, up from $36 million a year ago due to favorable volume and mix, performance and price. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1.6 billion.","Moving to Bell, revenues were up $55 million, primarily due to higher military volume, partially offset by lower commercial revenues due to the mix of aircraft sold. Segment profit increased $4 million from the first quarter in 2017, primarily reflecting the higher volume. Backlog in the segment was $3.6 billion at the end of the quarter.","At Textron Systems, revenues were down $29 million, primarily due to lower volume at Weapons and Sensors related to the discontinuance of SFW production in 2017. Segment profit was up $30 million primarily reflecting improved performance at marine and land. Backlog in the segment was $1.4 billion.","Industrial revenues increased $139 million largely related to favorable foreign exchange, the Arctic Cat acquisition and higher volumes. Segment profit was down $12 million, despite the increase in revenues from the first quarter of 2017 due to the timing of the Arctic Cat acquisition in the prior year.","Finance segment revenues decreased $2 million and segment profit increased $2 million compared to last year\u2019s first quarter.","Moving below segment profit, corporate expenses were $27 million and interest expense was $34 million, both flat with last year. We also repurchased 5.9 million shares returning $344 million in cash to shareholders.","To wrap up with guidance, we are reiterating our expected full year EPS from continuing operations of $2.95 per share to $3.15 per share. We also continue to expect cash flow from continuing operations of the manufacturing group before pension contributions of $700 million to $800 million. This guidance includes the expected impact of the Tools & Test divestiture on earnings per share and cash flow from continuing operations.","That concludes our prepared remarks. So, Brad, we can open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Of course. [Operator Instructions] We do have a question from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland","Hi. Good morning, gentlemen.","Scott Donnelly","Good morning.","Carter Copeland","Scott, just on Aviation, I was wondering about the margin performance there, ex the fall off in Scorpion R&D, you still had a pretty good year-over-year improvement there. I wondered if you might give us some color on how much that profit improvement was mix related versus overall price and maybe how are aftermarket sales in the quarter. Any color you can give us there would be helpful?","Scott Donnelly","Well, it\u2019s kind of all of the above, Carter, I mean, I think, our volume, obviously, was up a little bit but the mix was favorable in there. Teams continue to do a good job on the performance side in terms of cost, and therefore, delivering better margin on some of the models, and as we have been talking about, we continue to push for incremental gains on the price side and we saw that as well. It certainly helped to have some more turboprop, as you know a year ago turboprop was particularly light and so we were pleased to see some volume coming back in both the King Air and Caravan lines as well.","Carter Copeland","And on the aftermarket?","Scott Donnelly","So aftermarket was good performance. You\u2019ll see in the numbers just from a percent standpoint not as large an increase as we have been seeing and that\u2019s largely because we have had a small change driven by some of the 606 in terms of how we treat some engine programs. So the topline will look sort of a low-single digit versus the reality of without actually counting high-single digit and good performance there as well.","Carter Copeland","Okay. And then one last one and then I\u2019ll give -- the order momentum through the quarter, I mean, I know January is always a light month and February can be as well. Just in terms of the conversations with customers and what the sales team is seeing, how is that evolving over the course of the last three months and even what you\u2019re seeing in a real time?","Scott Donnelly","Well, we think it remains pretty strong, and you\u2019re right, usually the first quarter, January and February are pretty quiet. We continue to see relatively strong order bookings in that, so it\u2019s driven positive book-to-bill across both jet and turboprop lines, which is good.","Carter Copeland","Okay. Thanks, gentlemen.","Scott Donnelly","Sure.","Frank Connor","Thanks.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Sam Pearlstein","Good morning.","Scott Donnelly","Good morning, Sam.","Sam Pearlstein","Scott, you\u2019ve talked a lot, I guess, over the years about just driving earnings growth and seemed reluctant, it seems to divest some of the lower return businesses, because of earnings dilution. And I guess just based on the early reaction, certainly stockholders seem to like this, but given the buyback activity. But does this influence your views in terms of thinking about the mix of businesses, the portfolio whether it makes sense to get out of certain lower return businesses?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I am not sure, I wouldn\u2019t categorize the Tools & Test business as a low return business, but I think that our stated position with respect to any disposition is that we are going to run these businesses to the best of our ability and make the right investments in them and we certainly have done that in the Tools & Test segment both organically, as well as acquisition and with the intent to make it a great business.","On the other hand, if somebody comes along and says, look, we value that business and think it\u2019s a better fit in our portfolio and puts something on the table that we think is good for our shareholders, as well as something, obviously, they think is good for their shareholders then we are open to entertaining a transaction and that\u2019s exactly what happened here.","Tools & Test is a good business. I think it\u2019s well-positioned in the marketplace. It\u2019s performed well for us. But I think when you look at the Emerson and it serves a much larger footprint obviously into that kind of customer base and channel, they feel that it\u2019s a \u2013 it would be a better part of their business, and so I think that allowed a transaction to happen that is good for Textron and Textron shareholders, and in all likelihood a very good thing for Emerson and Emerson shareholders as well.","Sam Pearlstein","Okay. And I think when you started the year you usually put a placeholder in for making acquisitions yourself and that if you don\u2019t find any, we see a step-up in the buyback. So if I just think about the first quarter\u2019s buyback plus this, can you comment at all about the acquisition pipeline or what you\u2019re seeing, because it would seem like you probably aren\u2019t seeing a lot that\u2019s going to come to fruition.","Scott Donnelly","Well, Sam, we always keep an eye out for transactions. I mean I don\u2019t think there is any particularly large thing out there that I see on the horizon. There is always a number of things that we are looking at that are logical bolt-ons to the businesses that we have today.","But in general, though, Sam, I would say, I think that, given our balance sheet position, we are very comfortable to proceed with the level of buyback activity that we have talked about. Obviously that will step up in terms of the use of the cash from the disposition.","If something comes along that makes sense for us, I think, we have plenty of room to be able to manage that on our balance sheet through debt financing and stuff like that. So I think we are very comfortable with the level of buyback that we have in our plan regardless of whether M&A opportunities pop up or not.","Sam Pearlstein","Okay. Thank you.","Scott Donnelly","Sure.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Hi. Good morning, Scott.","Scott Donnelly","Good morning.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Maybe if you could further elaborate on the Aviation backlog, sort of what drove the strength there? It was up $400 million on a sequential basis, was that mostly Longitude jumping in and then, if you could just comment on the certification, and is it expected later in Q2 and delivery starting in Q3?","Scott Donnelly","So, as you know, we don\u2019t do a model-by-model backlog. I\u2019d say, if you look at the Textron Aviation backlog, Sheila, there was some increase on the defense side, really largely driven by 606. There were some service contracts that were longer term, which are now all booked in there, but we had strong book-to-bill on the jet product line as a whole and we had strong book-to-bill on the turboprop line as a whole. So, it was really, I would say, pretty strong bookings across all segments of the business.","In terms of Longitude, we do expect it to certify here in the quarter. We are kind of in last flights. There are a couple of delays that we would like not to have had but it\u2019s nothing serious, everything is flying well. We just had some last test flights to accomplish and some last builds. So everything is going well and we would expect that will happen here pretty soon.","Whether we get one into the second quarter or the first sales happen in the third quarter is still sort of TBD, I mean, the nature of this aircraft, obviously, is it does have a little more customization on the interiors than a lot of other aircrafts. So it will \u2013 it really will just depend on what timeline we get the final FA paperwork done and whether we can turn that around in time to get it in Q2 or certainly we would at worst case fall into Q3.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Okay. And then just one on your military portfolio, maybe if you could comment on my favorite two programs the Scorpion and Future Vertical Lift, sort of what the timelines and hurdles look like for those two? Thanks.","Scott Donnelly","Well, on the Scorpion, we are continuing some international customer activity. We just had a customer in a couple weeks ago. So those dialogues continue. On Future Vertical Lift, we continue a lot of dialogue, obviously, with the army and the Marine Corps, said, we have had the army now flying the aircraft. They are certainly very bought into this program and a very active partner in its development. We are working really at this stage of the game on envelope expansion which is going very nicely. So team is doing a great job on that. The army is following very carefully.","Now how this all works out through their budget cycles and still remains to be determined. I think, obviously, our view is that we could deliver aircraft and a lot of capability at a much faster rate than what\u2019s currently budgeted into the army budgets and just sort of the general thinking in terms of how long it takes to develop a new aircraft like this. But we are going to just continue to do our thing and demonstrate the maturity and capability of the aircraft and go from there.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.","Peter Arment","Hi. Good morning, Scott and Frank.","Scott Donnelly","Good morning.","Frank Connor","Good morning.","Peter Arment","Hey, Scott, on Textron Systems, really nice margin performance there. How should we think about that, I mean, you mentioned land and marine is improving, but it seemed pretty significantly well above our expectations. Are you \u2013 is this kind of outlook sustainable or how should we think about the overall performance there?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I don\u2019t think this margin rate is sustainable through the course of the year, right. I think it will revert and we feel pretty good about our guidance in terms of what we gave you guys. So we\u2019ll see some lower margin rates as we move on through the course of the year.","But, on the other hand, I think the team is performing well. TAPV, we have talked about a lot over the years and we are just working our way through those last deliveries, but the program is executing as we expected.","On ship-to-shore, the team is doing well. I mean, obviously, we are in integration and test, which is always a challenging time, but the team is making great progress. As we said, we actually have had the craft on the water, so it\u2019s operating and is going to enter into builder\u2019s trials here pretty soon.","And of course, the good news is on the appropriate authorized, our appropriated levels of the craft are in great shape, and we are working with our customer right now on that production proposal and we\u2019d expect that we would have something signed later this year and be able to start to see production moving.","We already have some long leave material and advanced activity going on to make sure that there is no line break as part of this process, and I say, we have worked well with the customer to make sure that that\u2019s the case, but we are working through the details now on the first production contract.","Peter Arment","Yeah. That\u2019s helpful. And just a quick follow up, on Bell the deliveries were up really nicely year-over-year, 505, 407 continue to be strong. What are you seeing in that particular end-market that\u2019s really driving this?","Scott Donnelly","Well, we have really seen strength around the world, particularly the light ends, the 505, as you say, that\u2019s really just been us having to ramp production and meet the demand for that product, which has been very strong. So we are, obviously, very pleased to see the production rates coming up and the number of units going up.","407 continues to be strong, I think the GXI also was well-received and we have strong demand in there as well. 412s and 429s, as you know, particularly 412s tend to be back-end loaded just in terms of deliveries, and I think, that\u2019s certainly what we expect we\u2019ll see over the course of the year.","Peter Arment","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Noah Poponak","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Scott Donnelly","Good morning, Noah.","Frank Connor","Hi.","Noah Poponak","Scott, just going back to the notable change in the Aviation backlog and I recognize you don\u2019t want to get too granular there, and I understand and respect that. But I think a lot of your stakeholders are sort of watching closely to see what\u2019s happening in the legacy business jet market. So I wondered just given the many moving pieces that can happen there with Longitude and Latitude and the Defense side, if this time around you\u2019d be willing to quantify what the book-to-bill was in the pure in production Cessna jet market?","Scott Donnelly","Well, we are certainly not going to go into any more granular breakdown in the backlog. But I would say that we are \u2013 we had a strong book-to-bill in Citation jets, including all of our legacy models as well, as well as in the turboprop side, which is inclusive of both the King Air and the Caravan. So I think market demand continues to be strong and we see that reflected in our book-to-bill in the backlog.","Noah Poponak","So it\u2019s safe to assume the in-production jet bookings compared to revenue was in the zone of what the total segment was?","Scott Donnelly","Yes.","Noah Poponak","Got it. And then on the pricing discussion there, can you help us out with sort of order of magnitude there? I mean, what kind of pricing increases are you seeing at this point and I guess how much has price come up off the trough at this point and I -- where I am going is sort of if backlog starts to build, it will be interesting to see how you decide to \u2013 you get asked the question if you\u2019ll raise production. But it seems like you would maybe actually just potentially let price keep going for some period of time given the success you\u2019re having there and what that does to earnings in the segment before you raise production?","Scott Donnelly","I think that\u2019s true, Noah. We have been saying that we will trade price for volume. I think these aircraft, we -- I mean, I can\u2019t tell you we are going back to trough, I guess, I mean, we look at the data on more of a year-over-year or incremental subsequent quarter basis, which is how we measure our sales teams obviously.","So as we look at the price targets and the performance for that, we are putting that higher on the list than just driving volume. This aircraft and we are getting price increases, we continue to get price increases, but they are still at price levels that we are not very happy about.","I mean, what we are \u2013 as the team did a great job in the quarter. I think we are continuing to execute well on a lot of fronts. But the amount of capital, the amount of investment that you make in this business, warrants getting a better return and we need to see better pricing in the end market and so that\u2019s the trade we are making. We are walking. We have been walking away from deals that are at price levels that are just not acceptable to the business.","Noah Poponak","Got it. Really helpful. Just one other quick one, the Bell, if I take the Bell Commercial and Military units and price on the OE side, plus the comment that total Commercial revenue was down, which kind of tells me roughly where Commercial aftermarket was, it seems like Military aftermarket was up like 75% or something like that, is that accurate and if so, what\u2019s going on there?","Scott Donnelly","Noah, I mean, I can\u2019t follow exactly your math, but the Military aftermarket was up, but it was certainly not up anywhere near the percentage you\u2019re talking, I think\u2026","Noah Poponak","Okay.","Scott Donnelly","\u2026 there is probably a little bit of our effect again, I hate getting into the 606 stuff, okay. But there is some benefit just from a quarter when you look at year-over-year in terms of the way the 606 stuff is done, particularly the Military side of Bell, because it\u2019s impacted by this, that, again over the course of the year, it\u2019s not going to make a whole heck of a lot of difference, but the way it falls out in the year, there is a little bit stronger revenue on the Military side here in Q1 than you\u2019ll see through the balance of the year, because it\u2019s a little flatter given the way the accounting is done under 606 as opposed to the unit delivery that we historically have had.","Noah Poponak","I see. Got it. Okay. Thanks so much.","Scott Donnelly","Sure.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Robert Stallard","Hi. Thanks so much. Good morning.","Scott Donnelly","Good morning.","Robert Stallard","I think I\u2019ll follow up on Noah\u2019s question on the pricing environment in business jets, whether you\u2019re seeing your competitors holding to similar levels of price discipline? And whether your overall market share is relatively constant?","Scott Donnelly","Well, look, I don\u2019t know that I could comment that there is anything dramatically different in terms of the behavior that we are seeing out there. I mean it\u2019s a very competitive market obviously, and that\u2019s the nature of the end market. So we are continuing to hold on as I said our price line, because we need to get pricing up.","Now, do we lose deals because of that? I mean there\u2019re certainly or probably deals where we lose a deal because someone is willing to go to a lower price level. But we are a pretty big part of the market, and we need to hold the line, and we\u2019ll deal with our pricing if - I think you have to leave the competitors to deal with their pricing.","Robert Stallard","But in terms of market share, are you comfortable with where you stand in the moment relative to perhaps 12 months ago?","Scott Donnelly","No, I think so. I think if you look in the quarter, we are pleased with the demand and how we are doing in both the light and the midsize aircraft, which is I think it\u2019s strong. And I think that\u2019s because our products are well regarded. Our service network is well regarded.","I think we have a strong brand, and generally our customer repurchase rates are very high. I think our team does a good job of managing the customer so that it\u2019s a win for the company and it\u2019s good for them. So they\u2019re popular products.","Robert Stallard","And then a couple quick questions for Frank on the disposal. Wondering if you can give us the post-tax cash proceeds that you expect? And also what was your anticipation of the operating cash contribution from this business for the year? Thank you.","Frank Connor","Yes, the after-tax and everything we\u2019ll net about $725 million from the disposition. And again, from a cash standpoint, there is some cash impact, but we\u2019ll absorb that within our guidance and the performance of the other businesses.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Seth Siefman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Seth Siefman","Scott, I wonder if you can talk a little bit more about future vertical lift? And from your point of view how much it matters or if it matters if the Army goes ahead first with a medium lift kind of aircraft? Or looks to do a reconnaissance helicopter first under future vertical lift?","Scott Donnelly","Well, look, I think it does matter. The Army Aviation folks are continuing to look at what their requirements are. Obviously a couple or several years ago, right took the Kiowa Warrior out of that and stated they were going to do that with unmanned aircraft. And that\u2019s sort of the path they have been going down. Cape Set 3, which is really where the V-280 is aimed we think is an important part. And certainly when they talk about their need for assault and that sort of long-range capability, we think that\u2019s where the V-280 really shines.","So the Army Aviation will obviously continue to do their work and decide how they want to handle different programs. I think obviously Army Aviation has to fly a number of different missions and a number of different aircraft.","So I think that view will obviously evolve over time as it always does, and we\u2019ll continue to work with them and emphasize the capability of the V-280 and the role and impact that we think it can have on Army Aviation. If they elect to do something more in that so-called Cape Set 1 category, then we\u2019ll obviously be engaged and talk to them about how you solve that requirement.","Seth Siefman","And do you see a time frame for when the Army might make that determination?","Scott Donnelly","No, I don\u2019t. I think there is just a lot of work going on, and it will evolve over time, I am sure.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Peter Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.","Peter Skibitski","Scott, not to belabor the aviation backlog question, but the fact that it\u2019s up so much sequentially at a time when tax reform is coming into play here, I am wondering would you use the term kind of the dam bursting in terms of the return of Bizjet demand, or is that too strong language?","Scott Donnelly","I don\u2019t know, Peter. I wouldn\u2019t say dam bursting. I think the tax reform obviously is part of it. I think more importantly, business confidence is strong. People are looking to invest. It\u2019s been frankly a long time. A lot of people out there who have aircraft that are certainly getting older. They are upgrading a lot more infrequently than they used to because we went through some of those down years that there is some natural demand in the market.","And that\u2019s I think driving positive backlog. Like I say, I don\u2019t know the dam bursting. I mean I\u2019d like to say that it\u2019s not crazy, but there is natural demand. People are out there and looking to upgrade aircraft, and that\u2019s why we have seen I think a solid order flow.","Peter Skibitski","Is the increase mainly domestic? Are you seeing any kind of outside impact from international demand?","Scott Donnelly","Well, jet is still mostly domestic. Although we are seeing some improvements in the international market as well on the jet side. When you look at turboprop, that\u2019s a more balanced demand in terms of international and domestic.","I think importantly when you looked at the first couple quarters last year, the international market was pretty quiet on the turboprop side and obviously we have seen that come back more notably on turboprops which is obviously very important for us because that does generate a lot of demand for both the King Air and the Caravan families.","Peter Skibitski","And then just last, I just want to ask on the 412s, I think I read that some activists or whatever you want to call them in Canada quashed a sale of - pretty sizable sale of 412s to the Philippines. Is that sale completely dead, number one? And number two, it sounds like you closed two other 412 orders in the quarter. So are we still pretty level, pretty decent shape for the 412 over the next couple years despite that one sale being sort of quashed, I guess is the term?","Scott Donnelly","I think so. There is a lot of 412 activity going on. As we said, there were a couple nice 412 deals that closed in the quarter, and as you know, 412 has a lot of international demand. So foreign deals are always fluid right up until they close.","So there is a lot of 412 activity, and we feel pretty good about where that demand is, so I think it will play out well through the year. Again, on a delivery basis it does tend to be more towards Q3, Q4.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.","David Strauss","Wanted to ask about the backlog at Bell down a fair amount. Was there any 606 stuff going on there?","Scott Donnelly","Well, there was some 606 that went in there. But as you know, David, because of the military side of Bell, it tends to be very lumpy, right. And I think what you\u2019ll see is that will continue to go down sort of its normal cycle through the year.","However, when we get to the point where we sign multiyear three which the negotiations seem to be going well and I will expect that will close here in the not too distant future, when that happens, you\u2019ll see because of 606 not just a one-year add of backlog as we used to do but all five years would go into backlog. So you\u2019ll see a dramatic increase and that would bleed down over the course of five years.","The issue around 606 on particularly something where you\u2019ve got a lot of military and multiyear type deals like we would do on the V-22, you\u2019re going to see some real peaks and valleys around that.","David Strauss","And then I wanted to follow up on working capital in Q1 and then the cash flow forecast. So it looks like working capital was a pretty significant drag, but inventory was actually down it looked like year-over-year. Receivables were down year-over-year. So just what\u2019s going on there?","And then your cash flow from ops forecast it looks like not by a lot but actually went up just a little bit. Does that already include stripping Greenlee out? And if so, what\u2019s going on there? Thanks.","Frank Connor","Yes, I mean, again there is some geography change again as a result of 606 that gets - makes the translation from year-end to quarter-end difficult. Working capital was I think we did a nice job on working capital in the first quarter. It\u2019s always seasonal. We did see a little bit of inventory build, but it was better than last year. Some things because of 606 shift out of inventory and into other current assets because they\u2019re contract assets now. You see a little bit of that happening on the accounts receivable side as well.","But overall, good quarter from a cash flow standpoint again relative to where we typically are in the first quarter. For kind of full year, as we said, there will be some operating cash flow impact associated with the divestiture of Tools & Test, but we\u2019ll absorb that within the forecast and kind of make up for that with better cash performance in other areas.","David Strauss","And then, Frank, any change in the tax rate expectation for the quarter? It was pretty low in Q1.","Frank Connor","No, we had some discrete items in Q1, but kind of the rate that we had indicated for the full year is still the right guidance to think about.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr","In the 10-K and 10-Q you said that price was a $20 million year-over-year plus at Aviation in the third and fourth quarter. What will that number look like in the first quarter?","Frank Connor","Cai, it sounds like you\u2019re having some office renovation work done. Can you repeat that?","Cai von Rumohr","Yes. The price was a $20 million plus for Aviation in the third and fourth quarter. What was it in the first quarter?","Frank Connor","So price net of inflation in the first quarter will be about $9 million.","Cai von Rumohr","And was there any impact - it looks like your book-to-bill at Aviation was 1.4. You mention 606. If we\u2019d use 606 would that change the backlog at year-end? So is it really a 1.4 book-to-bill? Or would it be a lower number?","Frank Connor","No, I mean, there was an impact, as Scott said, of 606 that brought some defense service business into backlog. So that\u2019s in it. But we still have kind of strong order activity and strong book-to-bill, as we said, in both jets and turboprop. We are not going to get into the kind of specifics of each of those, but those types of numbers are directionally correct.","Scott Donnelly","Yes , as you know, we don\u2019t calculate or publish that number for each of these categories, but your numbers are about right.","Cai von Rumohr","And then at Industrial, maybe update us in terms of clearing the channel overstock at Arctic Cat in terms of how the move to Augusta is going. And given that very low first quarter, are the full-year estimates still valid?","Scott Donnelly","I think, Cai, that the challenges we described in Q1 is, first of all, we had a couple months of Arctic Cat where we didn\u2019t have that a year ago. And it\u2019s a difficult quarter. I mean, I think the whole industry in outdoor power equipment when you look at this, the difficulty is that January, February into March time frame, you\u2019re done selling snow, but you haven\u2019t started selling dirt.","So it tends to be a quarter where you have - basically you have the cost of the business, but you don\u2019t have a lot of revenue within the business. So I think that\u2019s just a natural cycle, and it doesn\u2019t affect our perspective on how we feel about the year. ","In terms of the inventory reduction, we are pleased with - if you look at both dirt and snow inventory reductions that happened through the course of the year, which was a big focus of ours yielded a lot of results. So there is pretty significant reductions in that aged inventory.","And so I think combined between that and the fact that we have a lot of new product that we think the dealers are pretty excited about, and you look across both the dirt and the snow product lines, you\u2019ve got lower inventory of aged stuff and you\u2019ve got a lot of exciting new stuff that\u2019ll be on the floors that dealers are pretty excited about. So we feel pretty good about where we are for the year.","Cai von Rumohr","And the last one, could you quantify the EACs at Systems?","Scott Donnelly","Yes, we had good performance, but we don\u2019t break out those by segment, Cai.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.","George Shapiro","Scott, if we took out the Scorpion R&D, which we know went to zero in the quarter, how did the underlying R&D compare to last year\u2019s first quarter?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I think, George, again, we don\u2019t do this by segment by segment. But the color that we have provided and the way the quarter played out is that you\u2019ll have modestly lower R&D spending in the Aviation business and modestly higher spending at Bell. So you\u2019re right, Scorpion spending went down to virtually nil, but obviously we are still continuing on Longitude. We are accelerating everything we can do around the SkyCouriers and the Denalis so that\u2019s all going well.","And then obviously on the Bell side with 525 back in full flight test operations and the work that we are doing on V-280, we\u2019ll see some increased spending there. So the way the quarter played out is pretty consistent with what our expectations are and the guide that we gave you. And I think that\u2019s how it will play out over the year.","George Shapiro","And the fact that Longitude certification is getting delayed into the second quarter, that\u2019s not going to affect the R&D level in the second quarter?","Scott Donnelly","No, it won\u2019t affect the overall level. We have a little more activity going on later into the year than we would have liked on the Longitude side of things, but that\u2019s flight testing and at this point not a huge amount of spend. Most of the R&D spend now has moved into Denali and the SkyCourier programs.","George Shapiro","And if I try and take out the Scorpion R&D and look at an incremental margin year-over-year, to me it comes out more like around 40% because obviously getting help by price-in mix this quarter. That would be a lot above what you\u2019ve been saying of more around 20%, but is that the kind of number we should see going forward.","Scott Donnelly","I think we have talked incrementals George more around that 20, 25% range. I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll go into the geography of all how that gets there, but that\u2019s sort of our expectation in terms of conversion net of all of our costs and pricing and inflation and all things together.","George Shapiro","And the last one, Scott. So how many quarters of book-to-bill running like this before you sit there and have the increase the production rate even though you have been saying you\u2019ll make the trade-off between price and production?","Scott Donnelly","Look, George, we don\u2019t set a hard line on that. I mean, obviously we are looking at each model all the time, and looking at each individual backlog and its demand and how much activity is out there in the market, and as you know, we can flex a little bit here and there between different model types.","But we feel good about where the market is right now. We try to take a fairly conservative view of this and make sure that we don\u2019t start to produce more than the market demand is. I would absolutely continue our focus around driving price, driving efficiency in our operations.","But if we see that a model is reaching a demand level that we can go tweak up a few aircraft, then absolutely we\u2019ll do that. But only if we are seeing enough strong demand and pricing that it makes sense for us economically.","George Shapiro","I guess I have one more. The first margins usually are the lowest of the year. It doesn\u2019t look like it should be any different this year given that buy-ins are going to be higher in subsequent quarters?","Scott Donnelly","I think that\u2019s probably largely true, George.","Operator","We do have a question from the line of Jon Raviv with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jon Raviv","Maybe one last one on Aviation just maybe talk about pricing. I think one of the things that has held back pricing for you guys has been competing against use jets. So can you offer any color on how those conversations are going? Whether customers are now seeing more value in the new versus the used?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I think there is no question that the dynamic of used is available for sale has a knock-on impact in the low industry, including new jet sales. I\u2019d say the good news is as we have seen now for some time, the number of used aircraft that are sort of current models that are relatively young aircraft with relatively low hours continues to get smaller.","So you look at the activity in the used jet market, those aircraft tend to move pretty quickly. And there is certainly not the number of them out there that created some of the issues for us on new aircraft sales in the past.","So the reality is there is not a whole lot of low-time relatively new jets out there that are competing for someone who wants to have a new jet who wants to have warranty, who wants to have a new aircraft to think about that as a five to seven-year asset. So I think we are certainly seeing less competition from the used side and I would expect that that will continue to be the case.","Jon Raviv","And how are you feeling about Longitude pricing going into entering into service? And then one more on the new products. How are you thinking about Hemisphere strategy at this point? Any updates there?","Scott Donnelly","Well, in Longitude, we are treating the same way that we are treating the rest of the aircraft. I mean, obviously, when you get through the certification here, there is an awful lot of activity on the aircraft. A lot of customers have been flying this thing. I think it\u2019s an impressive aircraft from a performance standpoint. It\u2019s best in class.","It\u2019s got a lot of features that are really impressing our customers when you get certification done so that we can really start moving aircraft into the market. But, again, we are trying to maintain the appropriate price integrity on that thing and make sure that we do it at a reasonable margin. Obviously, it\u2019s a significant investment to bring an aircraft like that to the market and we need to make sure that we get a good return on it.","In terms of Hemisphere, look, I think everybody knows there have been some issues around the engine that was slated for that aircraft. At this point we basically have suspended the program and are waiting to see how the engine plays out. And then based on that, we\u2019ll make our decisions and move forward knowing what the performance of the engine is.","Jon Raviv","And then just last one, just going to the year we felt like 1Q is going to be a bit light due to some delivery timing, any of those deliveries kind of moved around? Or is it still fair to say that we should see incremental earnings improvement throughout the year off of this 1Q level?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I think with Q1 again, we feel good about where Q1 was in terms of both deliveries and order activity. Q1 is usually the lightest quarter, and as I kind of said with George, I think it\u2019s fair to assume that we\u2019ll see incremental volume as we move through the course of the year.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Drew Lipke with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Drew Lipke","Just circling back to an earlier question around Bell, understanding that Military can kind of mask the backlog trends that we are seeing within commercial, any color you can provide on just Bell commercial order trends and backlog and what we are seeing there?","Scott Donnelly","I think our order trend and backlog build continues to be positive. Really through the last year and into this year, the commercial market activity has been strong.","Drew Lipke","And then can you maybe just comment on what are the benefits of having industrial all under one roof here? Maybe what are the synergies that industrial brings to you from an overall portfolio perspective? And can you maybe quantify those synergies for us?","Scott Donnelly","I am not really sure how I would answer the question. I mean, it\u2019s each of the businesses in Industrial are pretty sizable businesses. They\u2019re pretty big players in their markets on their own right and that\u2019s how we manage them. And I think they\u2019re very competitive and very strong in their respective industries.","Drew Lipke","And then just last one on systems. What sort of opportunities are you seeing in terms of your unmanned portfolio with the administration\u2019s push for more international sales? What does that opportunity pipeline look like for you?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I think there is always been a really significant international opportunity for Unmanned Systems, which not just our business but for all U.S. businesses that has been greatly impacted by our export policies. I think everybody will tell you that. And unfortunately, we see lots of opportunities that come and go every year, which are won by either European or other countries because of our export policies.","So certainly the language or the rhetoric that we are hearing would be positive to allow U.S. companies to compete in that space, but that remains to be seen. The rhetoric sounds good. Whether that actually turns into policy and execution that allows us to compete in those international marks is still to be determined. But it\u2019s been a huge hindrance to the business, and like I say, there is lots of business that\u2019s done by the Russians, by the Chinese, by the Israelis, by other European countries that we are effectively blocked from participating.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Ronald Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Ronald Epstein","Just a couple quick things. On the turboprop demand, what\u2019s your sense on what's driving that? What\u2019s bringing that back? Because it sort of mysteriously disappeared, and now it\u2019s come back. What happened?","Scott Donnelly","I don\u2019t know, Ron. Just demand went down, and then it came back. Look, I think international economies were obviously been struggling for a while, and I think a lot of these aircraft go into border patrol, and sort of Medevac, and a lot of sort of special applications, and a lot of foreign economies both government and the private sector were in a pretty tough spot.","The U.S. dollar was extremely strong, which was a big problem. It wasn\u2019t a question of do they want the aircraft or not. It was when the dollar strengthened like that, it made that acquisition just a lot more expensive for them.","So I think as we have seen some weakening of the dollar and some strengthening of those economies, the intersection of that has generated the capability. So it\u2019s not like we ever lost share or that we weren\u2019t able to win deals.","I think our aircraft both the King Air family and the Caravan family are highly sought after. They\u2019re great aircraft. They meet that mission in both private and government sectors. It\u2019s just it was tough economics for them, and I think again weakening dollar and strengthening economies for them is allowing them to go back to purchasing.","Ronald Epstein","Now as a follow on, SkyCourier, how is the program going? And you had a real nice launch customer. Have you seen kind of follow-on interest in the program since the launch?","Scott Donnelly","We have had a ton of inquiry, Ron. I think the notion that you could do - I mean, for years we refer to it as a twin Caravan. Right? I mean that space the Caravan fits today in that just a workhorse aircraft. We have, as you know, those things are used for cargo. They\u2019re used for passengers all over the world. And the reputation the aircraft had, we have always had this notion of should you do a bigger one? Can you do a twin version of that? It\u2019s always been sort of on the back burner and something that we have thought about. ","And I think the opportunity when FedEx said, we are serious about this, we really need to move into something that\u2019s a larger aircraft, it was a perfect opportunity and a perfect customer to work with to go to find this thing.","And clearly once it was announced, we were getting calls all over from both people that are interested in that cargo version as well as a 19-seat pass version of it. So I think it\u2019s going to be a home run. We have got a great launch customer obviously, and we expect we are going to have really strong demand beyond that.","Ronald Epstein","And the development program is tracking where you expected to be roughly now?","Scott Donnelly","Yes, absolutely. We got through the wind tunnel work. So we are pretty happy with where the thing is. Remember, Ron, these are engines that exist. It\u2019s avionics that exist. It\u2019s construction, mechanical, aerodynamic work that\u2019s right up our alley, and this is an aircraft we know how to go design it, we know how to go build it, and we don\u2019t have to go invent something wildly new to do it.","So the team knows the speed to market here is important, and there is nothing really standing in our way from making this a huge success and doing it on a pretty aggressive timeline.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.","George Shapiro","Yes, I was just wondering in terms of the share buyback, are you going to do this evenly through the year? Are you going to try and do an accelerated buyback? If you can just give some perspective on that.","Scott Donnelly","Our assumptions right now, George, are that we are just going to continue to do it through the course of the year. I mean, that doesn\u2019t preclude an ASR or something like that, but our plan is that we would probably just play it out over the course of the year.","Eric Salander","Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us. And that concludes our call for today.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Doug Wilburne, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Douglas R. Wilburne","Thank you, Roxanne, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release. On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.","Moving now to third quarter results, starting with Slide #3. Total revenues in the quarter were $2.9 billion, down 3% from a year ago. Our income from continuing operations was $0.35 per share, down from $0.48 in the third quarter of 2012. Third quarter manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $269 million compared to $153 million in last year's third quarter. We contributed $60 million to our pension plans during the quarter.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott C. Donnelly","Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everybody. Third quarter revenues were down as growth at Bell, Industrial and Textron Systems was more than offset by decline in Cessna as the light to mid-sized business jet market remained soft. Operationally, we saw good performance at Systems and Industrial. At Cessna, despite cost actions that we implemented in the second quarter, our results reflected continuing weakness in the business jet market.","Margins and revenue at Bell were below our expectations due to manufacturing efficiencies associated with labor disruptions resulting from negotiations with our UAW bargaining employees in Fort Worth and with the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system. The factory inefficiencies had a negative impact on cost and our ability to ship aftermarket spare parts. This did not prevent our downstream and final assembly and completions centers for meeting our aircraft delivery commitments. The labor issue is now behind us as this past weekend our employees did ratify a new 5-year contract. However, we will not fully recover with respect to margins in the fourth quarter as higher-cost work in progress makes its way to our production lines and as we continue the ERP integration process.","From a market perspective, we saw another significant increase in our commercial business during the third quarter with 54 units delivered, up from 46 last year. Recent notable successes were Bell commercial products around the globe, including the first deliveries of our 407GX into both Poland and Russia; 7 orders for new helicopters at the 2013 Jet Expo show in Moscow; delivery of the first 2 429s into the U.K.; a purchase agreement signed at 2013 Helitech show in London for up to 20 helicopters for a large global operator; and orders for 14 helicopters in China.","On the new product development front, we continue to make progress on our short light single and 525 Relentless programs and remain on track to fly both of these new aircraft by the end of next year. On the military side, we delivered 10 V-22s and 7 H-1s in the quarter compared to 11 V-22s and 5 H-1s in last year's third quarter. During the quarter, we successfully demonstrated the V-22's ability to function as an air refueling tanker, which will enhance its versatility and value by expanding its mission set for future applications. We also recently announced a number of important teaming partners on our V-280 platform for the joint multi-role tech demonstration program, including Lockheed Martin, General Electric, Moog and GKN.","Moving to Cessna. Demand continues to be soft in the light to mid-sized business jet segment as we delivered 25 jets in the quarter, down from 41 last year. Cessna recorded a segment loss of $23 million as a result of the low volume and a number of headwinds in the quarter, including used aircraft valuation adjustments. Looking forward and taking into account where we are year-to-date at the current state of the business jet market, we're taking a more conservative view of Cessna full year deliveries. Despite the lack of a near-term recovery, we continue to believe that the global light to mid-sized jet market is a growth market in the long term, and we remain committed to our strategy of investing in new products.","On that front, we're on track to certify and begin delivering the M2 and the new Sovereign this quarter. And we're on track to certify and deliver the world's fastest commercial jet, the new Citation X, in the first quarter of next year. Our new wide-body Latitude is also on track to our first scheduled flight for next year as we completed wing mate on our first test aircraft this past quarter. So we believe we're doing the right things for the future success of the business with respect to attractive new products, competitive cost structure, superior service network and expanded sales coverage.","Moving now to our Finance segment. Our captive business is performing well, although the loan originations have been light, consistent with the soft new jet sales at Cessna. On the noncaptive side, we continue to liquidate remaining assets at levels favorable to book value, which benefited segment profit in the quarter.","Shifting to Industrial. We saw good top line growth, reflecting growth in auto markets and the impact of the Sherman & Reilly acquisition last quarter at Greenlee. We also had good execution with an overall margin improvement of 170 basis points. On the new product front, during the quarter, we introduced our new hybrid-powered Bad Boy Ambush iS. The vehicle gives customers 3 power modes, gas for long range, electric for quiet approach, important to hunting applications for our hybrid mode for greater power.","Moving to Systems. Revenues were up slightly over last year, reflecting growth in our precision munitions product line, and margins improved, reflecting better performance across most of the businesses. On the vehicle front, preparations for the Canadian Forces' Tactical Armoured Patrol Vehicle program continued with customer testing and training activities progressing well on the first 5 preproduction vehicles. We also signed an order for 28 COMMANDO armored vehicles for the Colombian National Police force. And we're actively working with a number of customers around the world on other vehicle opportunities. On the precision munitions front, we continued to deliver product to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia under a contract that was definitized during the quarter. And we have a number of international opportunities under active discussion.","With respect to fee-for-service UAS program, we continue to experience unacceptable quality from our engine supplier. Therefore, we've decided to transition the manufacturer of that engine into Lycoming, which we believe will allow us to improve performance on the contracts. Looking forward across Systems, we have a substantial amount of global sales activity underway and continue to believe this business can maintain a flat to slightly growing top line over the next several years.","To wrap up, the third quarter was disappointing with respect to performance at Bell and the continued lack of sales strength at Cessna. The Bell labor situation has been resolved. And this will allow the Bell management team to return their focus to ERP integration and improving factory productivity. We expected to get our M2 and Sovereign models certified. And that should provide a nice pickup for Cessna revenue and profit in the fourth quarter. Overall, we are seeing improved performance at Systems and we'll continue to pursue global sales opportunities.","Finally, in Industrial, we demonstrated solid execution and we should expect to see top line growth and margin going forward. With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank.","Frank T. Connor","Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Manufacturing segment profit in the quarter was $195 million, down $59 million from the third quarter of 2012 and a $65 million decrease in manufacturing revenues.","Let's look at how each of the segments contributed, starting with Cessna. Revenues at Cessna were down $185 million on a year-over-year basis, reflecting lower new jet volume, partially offset by growth in aftermarket revenue. The segment had a loss of $23 million compared to a profit of $30 million in last year's third quarter. At Bell, revenues were up $87 million, primarily due to higher military and commercial volumes. Segment profit decreased $34 million, primarily reflecting unfavorable performance associated with the labor disruption and ERP system integration issues.","At Textron Systems, revenues increased $5 million, primarily due to higher volumes in Weapons and Sensor products, partially offset by lower UAS and Marine & Land Systems volumes. Segment profit increased $14 million, reflecting good performance across most of Textron Systems' product lines. Industrial revenues increased $28 million, primarily due to the impact of acquisitions and increased volumes at our fuel systems business. Segment profit increased $14 million, primarily due to the improved performance and the higher volume.","Moving to Finance. Total Finance receivables ended the quarter down $94 million from the prior quarter. This segment had a profit of $13 million. Nonaccrual accounts ended the quarter at $105 million while 60-day delinquencies ended at $88 million.","Moving to corporate items. Corporate expenses were $34 million in the quarter, down $4 million from last year. Interest expense was $25 million, down $6 million from last year, primarily reflecting the retirement of our convertible debt this past May. Moving to cash flow. We generated $269 million in free cash flow, which reflected better working capital performance.","To wrap up, as Scott discussed earlier, we are reducing our outlook for the year at Bell and Cessna. On this basis, we are now targeting full year manufacturing cash flow from operations before pension contributions in the range of $200 million to $300 million with pension contributions of about $200 million. And we are adjusting our full year EPS outlook to a range of $1.75 to $1.85 per share.","That concludes our prepared remarks. So operator, we can open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Peter Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Hey, Scott, can you give us a sense of how the government shutdown is expected to impact your fourth quarter? It sounds like you don't think it will have any impact at all.","Scott C. Donnelly","I don't think it will, Peter. I mean, obviously, we had some concerns in the early part of the shutdown just because the FAA and the government inspectors are pretty important. Frankly, on the military side, the DCMA did provide inspectors an on-site support for the Bell folks even when the shutdown was going on. And now that the thing is over, any concerns we would've had around FAA and certification has pretty well been alleviated. So I would say no impact.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And the issues that you'd had previously on the Garmin avionics for the new programs, those are resolved as well?","Scott C. Donnelly","Yes, that's correct. Those have been resolved. And the M2 and Sovereign and Citation X test flights and [indiscernible] have been progressing very well.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then I just wondered what your sense is in terms of if you could sort of bifurcate your thoughts on the market versus kind of your stiffer pricing terms that you've been implementing out there.","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, as we've talked about sort of coming into -- after the first quarter, Peter, we stopped doing a lot of the very deep discounting that, I think, was helping to create some demand in the marketplace. As we went through the second quarter, obviously, we saw the impacts of that in significantly reduced deliveries. We pretty well held those prices, both sequentially and year-over-year in terms of third quarter, so we're keeping the pricing around where we expected it to be. And I think, as a result, we're just seeing what's the normal market out there as opposed to dragging people into it that aren't ready to do upgrades or trade-in activity. And so that's reflecting in lower volume, which again, I think, for the long term is healthy for the market. We've got to let this cycle play through. Certainly, as we went through the third quarter, we continued to see a fairly active used market, a lot of transactions that are happening over there. I mean, in our case, we certainly sold more aircraft than we took in trades, and we continue to see the number of used aircraft available for sale, particularly in those relatively newer aircraft, continue to bleed down. So I think at this stage of the game, we're not happy with where we are in the cycle, but we're letting the cycle play through.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And comps essentially are easier for you from here on out in terms of having new aircraft to market. Would you agree with that?","Scott C. Donnelly","Yes. I don't think there's any question. When you look at the M2 and the new X, had a very nice receptivity. And again, we're not competing against relatively new used aircraft. The Sovereign, obviously, we've been out there now doing demo flights over the last few months and have started to book orders on that. And we still have orders to go here for the fourth quarter. But yes, I think there's no question that new product does matter in the market and does help to create demand and stimulate people to do upgrades and trade-ins.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Scott, staying on the Cessna front, I saw your backlog there was up versus last quarter. I was wondering if you could comment on where that might have come from.","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, we continue to book orders for sales that will be either fourth quarter or going forward. Obviously, we started to see some Sovereign orders come into the backlog and had no sales in that area. We continue to see some sales activity around M2s and Latitude. So in general, Robert, I'd say it's just kind of a -- sales activity has gotten better. Certainly, it got a little bit better in the September timeframe. And as a result, again a part of it unfortunately is fairly low deliveries in the third quarter, generated some positive book-to-bill.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then secondly on Cessna, there was a comment you said about a negative adjustment due to pricing. I was wondering if you clarify what the situation is there. And also maybe in conjunction with that, what you are seeing in terms of pricing in the used market.","Scott C. Donnelly","So pricing on new aircraft was pretty stable, not a lot of change there from where we were in the second quarter. There does continue to be softness in the used market in terms of pricing. So I think if you look at BRF and blue book, we continue to see downward motion. So that did result in several million dollars of residual write-down of used aircraft beyond what we saw, let's say, in the second quarter. So I'd say there's still softness, a lot of activity and quite a lot of transactions but still softness in the pricing in the used market, but I would say stability in terms of pricing in the new market.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then just thirdly, you mentioned on Textron Systems, you are still confident that it's a flat to up environment. Are you anticipating a more negative drag from sequester within that forecast?","Scott C. Donnelly","As we look across those business segments, Robert, so first of all, the precision munitions business is virtually entirely driven by international sales. So there's really nothing going on there from a sequester standpoint. The same is largely true in our Marine & Land Systems business. Most of the sales, particularly in the vehicle side of the business, international at this point, we do have the Ship-to-Shore Connector program, which is a U.S. government program. Although at this point, that's in the development phase, so it's not a lot of money. The business which is most subject to annual budgets and U.S. budgets really is in our UAS business, although we haven't seen really an impact at this point of sequestration. And we do have some intelligence in the software businesses, where we have seen some reductions in the number of licenses and things like that. But at this point, Robert, we certainly have not seen anything material from, that I would say, directly from a sequestration impact.","Operator","Our next question is from Jason Gursky with Citi.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","2 quick questions. Scott, can you just update us all on the cadence of V-22 volumes as we move out over the next couple of years? And then I'd also be curious to know -- well, there's been some press reports about Beechcraft potentially being for sale. Are you aware of Beechcraft being for sale at this point?","Scott C. Donnelly","So on the firsthand, with respect to V-22, the multiyear -- and I know there's been a couple of people with questions, so I think a couple of aircraft moved in terms of which year they're delivered. And there's nothing particularly special going on there. It's just when the contract was definitized, the number of deliveries per year moved a little bit from what was originally discussed. But the multiyear contract made pushing aircraft between years. But it still is unchanged with respect to the 99-plus, so far one of the options which has been exercised. So there's no material change in terms of the multiyear, too. With respect to Beechcraft, look, we see the things in the paper. I know there's a lot of rumors and whatnot banging around. Look, our view of Beechcraft is the same as we've discussed in the past. There's certainly interest that we would have in some of those assets in terms of the status of what's going on. And all the rumors in the articles, I guess, at this point, I wouldn't comment on any of that.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And on the V-22, is there any way for you to offer a specific cadence for the next several years just to make sure we all model it correctly?","Scott C. Donnelly","We can certainly do that. I'm not sure I would do it on the call. But I mean, we -- again, it's a contract, it's a program record. And if there's any confusion out there as to how many aircraft in which years, we can certainly put something out that clarifies that.","Frank T. Connor","I mean, it's in our presentation, Jason. It's 36 next year and 22 in '15.","Operator","We have a question from the line of John Godyn with Morgan Stanley.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Scott, I was hoping to ask about how you're thinking about breakeven margins at Cessna. And what I'm getting at is, of course, the environment is soft, but you've also changed your pricing strategy a bit. You also continue to sort of restructure and try to drive productivity improvements. How many jets do we need to sell in a quarter to hit breakeven more or less?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, look, it's a tricky question because obviously it depends a lot on the mix. What I can tell you is that the way we see it right now is given where the market has been, the amount of activity that's out there right now, we feel that about the midpoint of where we're guiding to you guys would basically reflect sort of a breakeven year for Cessna.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. That's very helpful. And I was also hoping to follow up on Bell margins. I thought I heard you say that margins wouldn't recover in the fourth quarter. I was hoping that you could just sort of elaborate on the specific impact of what's going on with ERP. And if we look out sort of a year from now, should we see margins kind of recover to what we saw earlier this year? I'm just trying to kind of understand some of the nuance there.","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, so the issue for us, of course, is that obviously you saw some of the margin impact in this quarter as a result of higher cost. But at the same time, obviously we're a relatively long-cycle manufacturing business. And so there's a fair bit of product that is work in progress, which is then executed at that higher cost with those inefficiencies. And so that will turn into revenue here as we go forward, which is why we said we would not expect a lot of change in terms of margin rate going through the fourth quarter. I don't think we want to get into 2014 guidance at this point. But needless to say, we're going to be pressured in terms of the margins as we go through the balance of this year and in the beginning of next year as that higher-cost, less-efficient production works its way through into revenue, which will happen over the course of the next year. So the margin rates, I think if you look at it year-to-date, where we are on Bell is at around probably an aggregate of about 12.5%. And that's probably a number that we would expect to see through the balance of this year.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And is there anything you can tell us just to add clarity to the kind of the impact this quarter from the labor disruption as opposed to the ERP?","Scott C. Donnelly","Jason, it's very difficult because these things are sort of compounding problems, right, when you're going through one of these big IT implementation systems. We've run into a number of issues in the implementation and just sort of working our way through those challenges. And when you do that, you need to do a certain amount of sort of brute force to try to keep things going. And unfortunately, what we ran into was, at the same time, we needed to have kind of that brute force to work our way through it. We went through a labor disruption. So it'd be very, very difficult to say how many dollars is attributable to one versus the other. I think the thing we're focused on at this point is at least we have the labor issue behind us. And now we have the human resources and our ability to get our hourly workforce focused on delivering output and the management team focused on resolving those issues that we still have outstanding on the integration of the ERP system, whereas up until now, frankly, our management team and salaried teams were working most of their day jobs during the day and were working a lot of overtime and weekends to try to help make sure we got deliveries completed for customers because we didn't have the ability to get our hourly team in there doing the production work. So hard to tease out exactly. And really the impact here is, I think, we can kind of handle one or the other. The fact that we had them both at the same time was a pretty serious blow.","Operator","We have a question from the line of John Nadol with JPMorgan.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First, at Bell, Scott, were there -- or Frank, were there -- was there a negative cumulative adjustment taken on any of your major programs that was going to enable you to bounce back a little bit in Q4? Or is this all just regular way of improvement we're expecting sequentially?","Scott C. Donnelly","Yes, I'm not sure I have the data to say any kind of a -- are you talking about a kind of cume catch or [indiscernible] adjustments?","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, on H-1 or V-22.","Frank T. Connor","No, there was no meaningful negative adjustment. It kind of was prior-period adjustment.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just on the spares issue, you've highlighted for a couple of quarters, or maybe 2 or 3, the ERP system and how that's negatively impacted your ability to ship. Is the spares demand still where it was? Because some others had been talking about significantly lower aftermarket demand in the military side for rotorcraft.","Scott C. Donnelly","No, our demand actually has been up. So as a result, we've actually been building some backlog in terms of spares. So just to be clear, we kind of went through -- again, this is sort of a -- I hate to make this messy, but we had sort of a 2-step a process here, okay? The initial problems we talked about with respect to spares in the early part of the year when we first turned on our new system really had to do with our inability to ship. And when I say that, I mean that the IT system in terms of generating demand, people knowing what parts to go in and get off the shelf and put it in a box and ship it to our customers, we had a lot of those sorts of issues when we first started our new IT system. Those have largely been resolved. So the issues we have now in terms of building backlog is these are parts that we need to be manufacturing. And so the slowdowns and the inability to get enough hours into the factory to actually build the parts has what's been now slowing down our deliveries. So it's purely a matter now of working the stuff through and getting the volume out of the factories. It is not in any way, shape or form demand-related. We've actually been building backlogs. So there are demand for those parts, we've just got to get them through the factory.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then over at Cessna, just on the valuation adjustment, you said it was several million dollars larger than the one you took in Q2. So it was double-digit? Because I thought you said $8 million in Q2.","Scott C. Donnelly","Yes. And I think we were about $11 million. If you look at forfeiture deposit and used aircraft valuation, that was about minus $11 million.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just finally on the cash flow, you took it down by $100 million to $200 million, which is obviously more than the reduction in earnings. How much of that is the residual issues at Bell roughly? And how much of that is either incremental used aircraft or white tails that you expect to have at Cessna?","Scott C. Donnelly","I'd say it's predominantly related to our view on the number of Cessna deliveries we'll have. So we'll have more finished goods inventory at Cessna than we would have originally expected.","Operator","Our next question comes from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Scott, somewhere in the call on Cessna, you made the comment letting the cycle play through, which was -- and the timing of that is obviously the million-dollar question here. So I just wondered if, big picture, you could walk us through your own latest version of attempting to quantify how much longer that actually takes?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, Noah, certainly we are watching the number of used aircraft available for sale. That's, I think, one of the key, if not the most significant indicator at this point. And I think there's 2 reasons for that. Obviously, one, as we look at new aircraft that we're introducing for which there are either none or virtually no used aircraft that are like that kind of a product, we see a pretty strong uptake of the product. In the cases where we're still selling a product, where there's a significant competition out there in terms of relatively new used aircraft, we still see sluggish behavior in that marketplace. And so I think we watch that number pretty carefully. And certainly, there's some volatility as you see aircraft kind of coming in and going out of the market. But in general, we continue to see the number of used available-for-sale, particularly in that less than 5-year category, continuing to drop. Now the pace of that is not as fast as we like, but it does continue to go down.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So when you're looking out to 2014 for Cessna production, I know it's still October, do you sort of have a law of small numbers situation, where Cessna almost has to be up a decent percentage just because the starting point is so low and you have these multiple new product intros? Or can some of those legacy programs, where you still have a used product issue, decline enough to actually keep the total production number closer to flat or even down again?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, look, Noah, I hope it's a combination of both of those things. I mean, let me just give you anecdotally, if you look at something like a CJ4, okay, which has been out there in the market for a while, and certainly as you came out of '08, in the '09, '10, '11, you had a fair number of used aircraft available for sale that were CJ4s. We came into this year with around 9 of those that were out there on the market. And I think you saw CJ4 sales were pretty tough in the first couple of quarters. And we got down at the end of this quarter, we're sitting there where we know of 1 used CJ4 out there that's less than 5 years old and we see 8 sales of new CJ4s. So I mean, there's certainly a correlation of activity between what's out there that we're competing with in the used market versus what we can sell on the new. So I do think that that trend in terms of our volume, we certainly have expectation that will continue to pick up as you see these used aircraft go away. On the other hand, certainly not by design, we're working off a very low base. So yes, at some point, the absorption of those used aircraft is going to turn into demand for new aircraft. And again, on the new models, if you'll again choose a perfect example, right, that we don't have M2s out there in the market. There are no used M2s available because it's a brand-new product. And as a result, we've seen very strong uptake in terms of order generation. So I think part of it is absolutely, look, we are working off a very low base. And if you go back and you look at historical cycles and sort of average out how many aircraft should go into the market, we're on the way low side of that right now, just given where we are in the cycle. And so we would expect sort of it has to go up, right? But again, I think the -- we've been thinking that for a while, Noah. I mean, let's be honest. It's gone down lower than we would have ever imagined it to go down in terms of number of new aircraft being sold into the market. And I don't just mean Citation. I mean, you look at the whole market, right? I mean, the number of new aircraft in light to mid from anybody is, all total, is a very small number. So I think that it would tell you that eventually the cycle has to move in the other direction. And of course, I think the new product will help that.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Just one other one on Systems. With the fee-for-service product, I'm just curious if you can talk about the risk you see of cost implications as you are making that switch back internally or if you expect that to be fairly smooth.","Scott C. Donnelly","No, I would expect it to be fairly smooth, Noah. It's going to be accomplished in several phases, right? So to start with, we've been able to bring in already some of the manufacturing, where we were experiencing pretty significant quality issues. But in that case, I mean, in large part, we are manufacturing to the same sort of design criteria. And I think there are opportunities beyond just manufacturing at higher quality but also putting some design improvement into this product to make it a more robust product. And so that will happen here over the next 6 to 12 months as we go forward. So the cost side of this thing, Noah, is not something I worry. I mean, obviously, we're spending some money to do that. But that's not the big issue here. I mean, the issue for us has just been when you lose -- when one of these engines fails, you lose an aircraft. And so the cost of loss of that aircraft, which is both airframes and sensors and navigation systems, that cost is quite significant compared to the trivial amount of cost of actually manufacturing this engine. So that's what's unfortunate with this thing. I mean, we have a system out there that's a very complicated system. It involves control systems and launchers and obviously airframes and communication systems and navigation systems, all of which are working fabulously, but the weak point in the system is this engine. So it's not costing us a lot. We couldn't spend too much right now to make that engine work.","Operator","Question from Ron Epstein with Bank of America.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So just maybe a yet even bigger-picture question. So Scott, when you think about the portfolio of businesses that you have, I think among investors, kind of the elephant in the room is what happens if we go through another year or 2 and the mid and light market still is punky, right? I agree with you completely that longer-term, it's going to come back. Who knows exactly when? Maybe in 6 months, that'd be great. But say that doesn't happen, right? So say, as the leader of this organization, you're looking at your businesses, say, Cessna is still punky 2 years from now. Then the question becomes, all right, Bell gets a little bit tougher. What do you do? I mean, how do you manage through that, right? I think that's probably, I think, one of the biggest questions right now among at least the people I talk to. I mean, how do you think about that?","Scott C. Donnelly","Look, Ron, you do some things we've been trying to do over the last few years. You continue to focus on both the cost of your current operations to try to get enough productivity to improve as much as you can. You try to make sure that you're investing in the thing so that when the cycle does turn, you're in as good a position as you can be in to do that. So I think if you look at Cessna today, there's no question, we've been in a very, very deep down cycle. But as you know -- and again, I don't know either. Is it 6 months? Is it 2 years? That's sort of the unknowable. But the cycle will come back around and you've got to make sure that you're positioned to capitalize on that. When we've seen up cycles in this business, we've been able to capitalize and take advantage of that. But you don't do that if you don't have competitive product and you don't have the right service network, you don't have the right sales force out there. So I think that's what we'll continue to focus on. If you look at where we are today, obviously we've spent a lot of R&D dollars, but we're on the cusp here of having the new M2, having the Sovereign, having the new X. So I think over time, those investments will have proven to be the right things to do. As you look into 2015, you're going to have the Latitude coming in. I think that's the right thing to do. That program is coming along very well. It's a significant change in our product portfolio at Cessna, and I think one that would be very, very attractive to a lot of our customers out there that want to upgrade from current product into our wider-body aircraft. So we -- I don't know, Ron, if there's really anything you would do different. If you mothball the business, if you don't invest in having the right products, you're not going to be able to capitalize on this market when it does turn. So calling it is virtually impossible, but I think that we have to continue to do that. I'd say the same thing is true at Bell. We know we have enjoyed a great ramp on V-22. We know where the production volumes of V-22 are going. But we also know that we have the ability to grow that business through the commercial side. We've been successful doing that over the last couple of years through some product upgrades, through better focus in terms of how we go to market in the commercial world. But we also know we need new product, and so the investments in the 525, the investments in the XLS, clearly longer-term investment on the military on the V-280. All we can do is make sure that we're making the right investments and that we're ready to serve that market as it turns at Cessna and that we're ready to expand the portfolio and continue to gain share in the commercial market at Bell.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And I mean, is there any point -- you probably can't answer this, so I'll just preface it with that. I mean, is there any point where you -- I think you can kind of see what's going to happen in the 2Ds [ph] at Bell. We're not exactly sure with Cessna. Although long term, we do think it's going to come back, that were you step out a year or 2 or 3 from now and you have to do something strategically very different, either just pursue a different path and strategy to continue to grow the company. I mean, do you ever think about that? Or is it just too soon to even think about that?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, certainly, across all the businesses, we look at things that we can do that are complementary to those businesses to try to give us some more markets and give us some abilities to grow beyond just that quarter that we're in today. But now look, as we talked about before, we're not going to stray very far from these things. We need to do things that are the same customers in the same markets and the places that we understand and feel comfortable from an M&A standpoint. In terms of the current businesses, I mean, if you look at Cessna, Ron, I mean, look, if we knew we were 2 years from seeing a market rebound, it'd be wonderful if you had some concept of a way that you could just sort of mothball a business. I don't think there's any precedent for doing that. I mean, this is a very highly technical business. You need to have a great engineering team, you need to have a great sales force and you can continue obviously to service the customers that we have out there today. So it would be great if you can go into sort of a state of suspended animation. I don't think you can do that. I think you hunker down as much as you can on cost and productivity. But I think you've got to continue to make sure that you're doing the right things in terms of new product because that's what you're going to be rewarded for when the market does turn. You don't make those investments, then you're not going to have the upside when it does go.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Sure. And then maybe one last question related to that. Just I thought probably 1 of the coolest new things out there in the last 6 months was the Scorpion. Nobody has asked about that. I mean, can you give us some more color on the Scorpion and maybe more specifically, how it came to be and maybe what your hopes are for what it could mean for Textron?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, Scorpion is a good example of some of the things we're trying to do, Ron. I mean, and obviously, we haven't talked much about that. We kept the thing pretty well a secret for almost 2 years. But as we look at what kind of technical skills we have, what we think is going on in market dynamics and where growth opportunities are in something that's pretty close to home, namely, fixed wing aviation, our perspective was that there is going to be a need out there in the market for a military aircraft that is something that has a better performance envelope, more capability than a turboprop but not something that has the price point and the sophistication and both the acquisition cost and the maintenance and operating cost of something like an F-35. And so if you look at historically, the U.S. has had a family, a range of military product -- the industry, frankly, has usually had a range of military product that span all these various price points and capability points. And the trend seems like it's been for the last 20 years or so to only invest in very, very high-performance, very high-end fighter\/attack aircraft. And look, these are amazing machines. An F-35 can do amazing things and F-22 and so on and so forth. But we see a very large customer base out there in both the U.S., as well as a lot of international opportunities that will never be able to afford aircraft at those price points, and yet need a capability and need to replace aircraft here in the coming years that historically have been more affordable to acquire and operate. And so we decided this was something that was an investment worth making. And so I think we positioned ourselves now where we can enter a segment where we have not participated in many, many, many years because we see a gap capability in the industry. And so, so far, I'm not talking too much about the program yet. I mean, we're making very good progress towards first flight. And just last week, we were able to run full engine power and verify inlet designs and airflows. So I mean, we're getting very close to starting taxi and flight tests. We've had a lot of interest from the international community, as well as within the U.S. about the aircraft. And so it's still obviously in its very early days, but we think it represents significant growth opportunity for the company. We're not talking too much about it yet because it's not quantifiable yet, right? But we're working on it.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And maybe just one last question, and then I'll hop off, I know other people have questions. Most of your peers, as you know, if you look at any of the other defense contractors, typically, they're not willing to, so far, put their skin in the game in terms of making a company-funded investment in a new product, particularly a piece of big hardware like that. When you thought about the business case for it, can you add any color around, and I commend you guys for doing it, I mean, I hope it's a huge success, about doing some R&D on your own P&L for a defense product? How did you think about that trade? Because most of your peers don't do it or if they do it, they do it to a very teeny, tiny extent.","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, Ron, I think within the defense community, if you look on a purely defense basis, we've been trained over the years that the way this works is that you have a customer who comes out with a requirement, and then you bid to that requirement and you design and develop to that requirement. That can take a very long time. It's a very, very complex process, a very expensive process. And in this case, we felt there's -- this was really thought of more along commercial lines. In other words, when you look at our commercial businesses, we think about market opportunities, we talk to lots of different customers, and then we derive a requirement and we go design and build to that requirement. And then we look to go market that capability to many different customers. So our view, again, seeing what we think is a market opportunity, the whole genesis of this thing was derived more like you would think about the way the process we use for a commercial product, talking to lots of different customers, looking at the whole competitive dynamic and the marketplace needs and deriving and designing and building to our own requirement. So it's a military application that has been derived through a more commercial process, and as a result, moving more at commercial speeds and at commercial costs. So it is different. But I think what we're trying to do here is say, \"Look, we understand military, we understand how you market and sell to the defense -- to the DoDs around the world, but we're able to leverage and utilize more of a commercial practice in terms of market identification, design and build, which we think is kind of a unique capability because we understand military, but we understand commercial.\"","Operator","We have a question from Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So Cessna, could you give us some color? Was R&D up? Or where was R&D relative to prior quarters?","Scott C. Donnelly","Yes. Cai, R&D was up. As you can imagine, we're sort of in the -- we're sort of at a point right now with both the M2 and the Sovereign and the new Citation X all in the certification process and a lot of work going on, on the Latitude program. As I said, we've got first wing mate, so there's a lot of work going on getting that aircraft prepped and ready to go into flight tests starting next year. So R&D was certainly up in the quarter. And I would expect that we'll continue to see a lot of R&D spending through the fourth quarter.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So I mean, can you give us some quantification, $5 million to $10 million or more?","Scott C. Donnelly","No, Cai, we haven't historically done this on a by-business basis. I guess, all I would say is the R&D spending is on track and consistent with what we guided for the year. And the total number we gave you guys, we spend about 3\/4 of that. So I'd say I mean, yes, it was up, but in line with what we had guided in terms of R&D spending across the company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Terrific. And then can you give us some color by geography of demand at Cessna?","Scott C. Donnelly","It stays -- both orders and deliveries in the quarter, Cai, were about 2\/3 domestic and about 1\/3 international. And if you look at deliveries, it was 2\/3, 1\/3. And that 1\/3 was pretty evenly spread between Latin America, Europe and Asia Pacific.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then you mentioned near-breakeven in the fourth quarter. That would imply, I mean, by my math, something like $80 million, a swing of $100 million from the third, $400 million uptick or 26% incremental margin. Is that kind of the way you're looking at it?","Scott C. Donnelly","Yes. I still think, as we've kind of always talked, Cai, I think incremental margins at Cessna should be around 25%. Now when we go quarter-to-quarter, we had some quarters where it's been more or less than that, up or down. And frankly, that's largely an artifact of the numbers are pretty small. And so if you get a few million dollars of aircraft valuation change or you get a few million dollars of a LIFO or whatever adjustment, it's going to swing around a little bit. But yes, 25% incremental conversion is about right.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then pension, maybe you can give us some color. What was your investment performance like year-to-date? And maybe give us some preliminary color on where you think that could be both in terms of P&L impact and cash impact next year.","Frank T. Connor","Sure. We haven't obviously made any decisions about kind of necessarily the '14 plan. But as it relates to performance to date, we've been above our kind of expected return levels, so we're positive to that. Obviously, we need to close out the year, but that is positive. As we look at '14, I think we should get some tailwind on the pension side. We'll get a little bit of a tailwind from just with lower prior-period amortization expense. From a P&L standpoint, that's a $25 million-ish type area when you look at what would flow through the P&L in 2014. And as we sit here right now, the discount rate, if you valued it today, it's probably 75 basis points higher than it was a year ago. And that would give you another $25-ish million P&L-type impact, so as much as kind of $50 million-ish P&L impact based on where we are today.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Terrific. And then a last question, with regard to Beechcraft, if you were to look at it, under what circumstances would you kind of buy any or all of Beech? What would you -- I mean, what kind of financial metrics do you have to see if you were to consider kind of any transaction?","Scott C. Donnelly","It would have to be good. Cai, I just don't think -- I mean, it's -- given the nature of where all this stuff is, I just don't think we'd want to comment. We certainly wouldn't going into any kind of commentary. It just wouldn't be appropriate because they're rumors.","Operator","Our next question then comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro","A couple of questions on Cessna. One, if I look at the Q3 profit or loss after the $11 million inventory adjustment you said, so it would have been up about $2 million from the third -- from the second quarter making the same adjustments, in essence, a loss of $12 million versus a loss of $14 million. Based on what you just said of 25% incremental margins, since revenues were up 33%, you would have expect that the sequential profit to be up $8 million. So is that difference of 6% primarily R&D? Or is it reflecting the mix difference, where you had probably lower -- higher-margin XLSs versus higher deliveries of the lower margin CJ4s?","Scott C. Donnelly","Yes, George, I think your math is absolutely correct. And this was referring to -- when we're talking about these spreads of $8 million, a few million dollars of used aircraft valuation, some numbers, a small number of millions dollars of R&D being up, you look at the fact that we only had a small -- the 4 XLSs, which is some amount of mix that's in there. These small numbers, you can take 3 or 4 factors and pretty quickly get to $8 million.","George Shapiro","Okay. And then Scott, if you look at the orders itself in the third quarter, there were $654 million. That's the best third quarter order number since in at least 4 years or so. Is there anything to draw that that is a beginning of some improvement in the market? Or is it just reflecting orders for the newer planes that you have?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, George, I mean, we can only hope, right? If you look at the quarter, I mean, I can tell you that July and August were -- which are typically slow, were very, very slow this year. September was certainly considerably better. We just -- it'd be too early to comment at this point to know whether that's going to continue through the fourth quarter or not. So certainly, that -- the number on an absolute basis is encouraging. The dynamic of the fact that it was virtually all the month of September is encouraging. But whether that's the beginning of anything or how that plays out through the fourth quarter obviously remains to be seen.","George Shapiro","And then one, how much was the aftermarket up at Cessna? I know that's been running pretty double-digit increases.","Frank T. Connor","Yes. Aftermarket was up year-over-year at 25%. 15% of that or 15 percentage points was organic and 10% was due to some of the service center acquisition activity that's taking place.","George Shapiro","Okay. And then just one last one. Commercial helicopter deliveries, I mean, last year, they were up 20-plus or so in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. Would you expect them to be up at least 20% again or maybe even more?","Scott C. Donnelly","Right. It's going to be in that range, George. We would expect another pretty significant growth in Q4.","Operator","Question from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a couple of quick cleanups. You talked about the pension expense side. Can you talk about the funding side for next year, Frank? And also with respect to CapEx for the full year, what's the current guidance?","Frank T. Connor","Yes. On the funding side, again we haven't made any decision yet. We'll kind of see how things close out here. But I would expect that the funding will come down from what we've been doing in the past couple of years. So I think that will be, we think higher discount rates and with good returns, and therefore, a significant reduction in the overall kind of liability relative to the asset pool, I think we'll be looking at pulling our funding activity down as we look at 2014. On the CapEx side for this year, we're in the $510-ish million type area at this point. So we've continued to look hard at the CapEx budgets and are kind of still spending a lot of money to push forward on all the important programs that we have. But we're clamping down a bit on some of the other things.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So a little bit of a pullback from where you started the year, but not -- you're still implying a pretty big quarterly number?","Frank T. Connor","Yes. We've tended to kind of underspend over the past couple of years, what people have looked a lot to do. And we're doing -- we're kind of in the same type of position this year.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then Scott, on the 25% incremental margins, I mean, you point out the light versus the heavy. But what about new versus current -- new products versus in-production products, how much of a discrepancy are we going to see in that kind of incremental margin as it folds in over the next several quarters?","Scott C. Donnelly","I don't think that you should expect to see very much in terms of the change. In other words, if you looked at the margin rates of Sovereigns versus new Sovereigns or you look at the margin rates of M2 versus sort of CJ or the Mustang class, there's not a big discrepancies in there. So I think we'll continue to see a fairly similar margin rate, depending on the kind of mix of the size of aircraft you're talking about.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then the last one for me. I mean, earlier in the conversation, you talked about managing the down cycle at Cessna. But managing the down cycle of Bell is really a lot different because you can see, map, know exactly what at least the military production is going to be contractually. So from a standpoint of getting the cost structure right for '15, when the production of the V-22s, 22 aircraft, can you put up the same margins? Can you put up the 13% margins in a context of V-22s at 22, that you can put up the V-22s in the context of 40 deliveries a year?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, I mean, we'll -- again, we don't want to do any long-term guiding here. But certainly, we have a lot more visibility at Bell today and very good visibility obviously with respect to V-22. And so in terms of cost actions, I mean, these have already started. We've already done several pretty significant reductions at Bell. And clearly, there will be more to come as that volume works its way through the factory. We know exactly what we need to do in terms of the V-22 volumes, and we'll be making adjustments accordingly.","Frank T. Connor","Listen, the other part of that, Myles, is not just the reduction in volume, but the contractual rates that we're going to be able to earn on those contracts are different. So at the end of the day, you can't make up all that margin out of cost savings.","Operator","We have a question from Julian Mitchell with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Charles Clarke - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","It's Charlie for Julian. I just didn't know, just 2 real quick ones because obviously we'd run over here. Just to know just for expectations if you could kind of frame just -- probably don't want to get into specific numbers, but just maybe frame kind of a range for kind of what you guys are thinking for M2s or what you guys are thinking for the new Sovereigns, just to kind of put expectations kind of in context for Q4.","Scott C. Donnelly","In terms of?","Charles Clarke - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just delivery numbers.","Scott C. Donnelly","Deliveries, number of aircraft? We haven't been providing any sort of guidance on particular models, so I don't think we probably want to go there.","Charles Clarke - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Or even just for mediums versus lights, I mean, any -- I mean, obviously, I think mediums -- sorry, lights, through the first 3 quarters, down about 40 and mediums down about a little over that. But anything different into the end of Q4, no?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, the only thing I have to say is, I mean, you certainly would expect to see more of the mediums in Q4 because we're at least back shipping Sovereigns again. We were absent in the second and third quarter. But that's really only the color, I guess, I would provide on that is that...","Charles Clarke - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes. I just didn't know if you thought, like, if Sovereign would be between 5 and 10 -- or I mean, obviously, I think it'd be higher than that. Or if 10 to 20 is a range or -- but I guess you guys want to get away from that.","Scott C. Donnelly","Yes. No, we haven't been providing that number.","Charles Clarke - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. No. Yes, I just -- and then just real quick at Bell. Obviously, commercial has been strong. I just didn't know if you had any color on just customers, just end-market customers. Is it still a lot of oil and gas? Is it a lot -- where are the customers coming from here?","Scott C. Donnelly","Oil and gas has still been strong. A lot of foreign military customers are still in there, a lot of police, emergency medical services. It really has been reasonably across the board.","Frank T. Connor","So I think [indiscernible] in Scott's comments. We're seeing a lot of good development of demand around the globe outside the United States, like Russia and China, the Middle East.","Operator","Last question is from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just on the Cessna deliveries, I know you don't want to get into specific models, but the increase in the finished goods inventory that you see at year end, is that M2s and Sovereigns because the timing of the certification? Or is it anticipation of the Xs? Can you give any color as to what's increasing in terms of finished goods?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, certainly, Xs, right, because we had originally been manufacturing, expecting to get cert by late this year. Those have all moved into 2014. Beyond that, I guess I wouldn't provide any guidance. I mean, it will depend on obviously how this quarter plays out and what orders and sales conversion looks like.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then if I can ask you just a question on Bell and the V-22 multiyear, you talked about some of the delivery expectations over that multiyear. We've seen recently companies like Sikorsky talk about a reduction in volume even within a multiyear. And so, is there flexibility from the customer to adjust those, even if it's in delivery and still be able to move it even though there is a firm commitment on the total?","Scott C. Donnelly","No, it would be a renegotiation if there was a change. That's a mixed multi-year contract.","Douglas R. Wilburne","All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us today. And we know we have a couple of follow-up calls in queue that we'll call back.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Eric Salander","Thanks Brad.","Operator","Go ahead.","Eric Salander","And good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today\u2019s press release. On the call today we have Scott Donnelly, Textron\u2019s Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.","Textron\u2019s revenues in the quarter were $3.1 billion, down $108 million from last year\u2019s first quarter. During this year\u2019s first quarter, we recorded $37 million of pre-tax special charges, or $0.09 per share after-tax, of which $22 million was attributable to the Arctic Cat acquisition that closed on March 6, 2017, and $15 million related to the restructuring plan we announced last year. Excluding these items, adjusted income from continuing operations was $0.46 per share, down $0.09 from last year\u2019s first quarter. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions reflected a use of cash of $205 million compared to a use of cash of $222 million in last year\u2019s first quarter.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Donnelly","Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everybody. Overall, revenues and profits were down in the quarter, consistent with our expectations. We\u2019re continuing to execute our restructuring plan while maintaining our focus on new product introductions and integration of acquired businesses, all of which will have a positive impact on our long-term growth outlook.","At Bell, revenues were down on lower military volumes for the quarter due to the timing of H-1 deliveries. Despite the lower volumes in the quarter, Bell achieved an 11.9% operating margin. We delivered 27 commercial helicopters, down from 30 in last year\u2019s first quarter; six V-22s, flat with last year; and three H-1s, down from 10 last year.","On the commercial side, we\u2019ve seen our third straight quarter of improved year-over-year order flow. And we achieved the first deliveries of our new 505 Jet Ranger X helicopter in the quarter, and order conversion remained strong. We also had a good showing at HAI this year, where we displayed our first concept aircraft, the FCX-001, demonstrating innovations that could revolutionize the future of rotorcraft. On the service side, we were named number one in the helicopter service and support for the 23rd consecutive year by Pro Pilot magazine.","Moving to systems, revenues were up as we were able to accelerate our weapon delivery in the quarter, along with continued TAPV deliveries, although the TAPV program remains a challenge. During the first quarter of 2017, TAPV production has not ramped up as anticipated, resulting in inefficiencies and revised estimates for production costs on the remaining vehicles still to be delivered under this contract.","Based on our revised estimates, we\u2019ve recorded a $24 million loss in this contract in the first quarter of 2017. This unfavorable performance was partially offset by strong program execution at Unmanned Systems. In our Unmanned Systems business, we received an award for two additional common unmanned surface vessels in support of the Navy\u2019s mine countermeasure mission. In our TRU Simulation + Training business, we qualified six commercial air transport full flight simulators and received an additional 777X full flight simulator order from Boeing.","Moving to industrial, we saw a 4.2% increase in revenues, primarily reflecting the impact of higher volumes at Kautex and the acquisition of Arctic Cat, which we closed in the first week of March. Arctic Cat, which is now part of our Textron Specialized Vehicles business, immediately broadens our presence in the powersports segment and significantly expands our dealer network.","In specialized vehicles, we also began delivering on our new ELiTE series lithium golf cars in the quarter. The ELiTE offers high efficiency with zero battery maintenance and further demonstrates our industry-leading product innovation.","Moving to Textron Aviation, revenues were down $121 million. We delivered 35 jets, up from 34 last year; 12 King Airs, just down from 26 last year; and two Beechcraft T-6 trainers compared to 11 last year. We were encouraged by the pricing trends on retail sales in the quarter as we experienced a sequential increase in price across all Citation and King Air models.","Citation Longtitude continues to makes progress towards certification by year-end, with a third aircraft entering a flight test program during the quarter. On the military side, last week, we received a $61 million contract from the U.S. Air Force for services and support on our Beechcraft T-6 aircraft.","Moving to Scorpion, our second production aircraft had a successful first flight earlier this week and will enter the flight test program. In March, the U.S. Air Force formally authorized our OA-X light attack aircraft experimentation program, for which we have offered to demonstrate the capabilities of both the Scorpion and the AT-6 later this summer.","To finish, we are updating Textron\u2019s 2017 financial guidance to adjust for the Arctic Cat acquisition. We\u2019re now expecting full year adjusted EPS from continuing operations in the range of $2.40 to $2.60, which reflects earnings per share dilution of $0.10 per share, consistent with our expectations at the time we announced that transaction. Our outlook for cash flow for the continuing operations of the manufacturing group before pension contributions remains in the range of $650 million to $750 million.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Frank.","Frank Connor","Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Segment profit in the quarter was $219 million, down $61 million from the first quarter of 2016 on $108 million decrease in revenue. Let\u2019s review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation. At Textron Aviation, revenues were down $121 million from this period last year, primarily due to lower commercial and defense-related turboprop volumes, partially offset by higher pre-owned volumes.","Segment profit was $36 million, down from $73 million a year ago, primarily as a result of lower volume and mix. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1 billion, approximately flat from year-end. Moving to Bell, revenues were down $117 million, primarily due to lower H-1 program revenues. Segment profit increased $1 million from the first quarter of 2016 despite the lower volumes, reflecting favorable performance. Backlog in the segment was $5.7 billion at the end of the quarter, up $292 million from the end of the fourth quarter.","At Textron Systems, revenues were up $92 million, primarily due to higher Weapons and Sensors and Marine and Land Systems volumes. Segment profit was down $9 million due to unfavorable performance at Marine and Land. Backlog in the segment was $1.7 billion, down $113 million from the end of the fourth quarter.","Industrial revenues increased $40 million due to the impact of acquisitions and higher volumes at Kautex. Segment profit was down $15 million, primarily due to unfavorable performance, which includes the operating results of Arctic Cat. Finance segment revenues decreased $2 million and profit decreased $1 million.","Moving below segment profit, corporate expenses were $27 million compared to $32 million last year. This reflected the transition of the Scorpion program to Textron Aviation, partially offset by the effect of a higher stock price on stock-based compensation. Interest expense was $34 million, essentially flat with last year. Our effective tax rate was 17.4%, reflecting benefits recognized in the first quarter of 2017 resulting from audit settlements and the recognition of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation.","During the quarter, we\u2019ve recorded pre-tax special charges of $37 million, which included $22 million attributable to the Arctic Cat acquisition and $15 million related to the restructuring plan we announced last year. To update our previously announced restructuring plan, we now anticipate pre-tax charges of $155 million to $170 million from a previously announced range of $140 million to $170 million.","Through the first quarter of 2017, we have recognized pre-tax charges of $38 million under this plan. In connection with the Arctic Cat acquisition, we are estimating full year pre-tax restructuring charges of $30 million. During the quarter, we issued $350 million of 10-year notes at an attractive rate of 3.65%, and we repurchased approximately 4 million shares, returning $186 million in cash to shareholders.","As Scott mentioned earlier and consistent with our initial full year guidance range, we are now expecting a full year adjusted EPS from continuing operations in the range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share, which reflects earnings per share dilution of $0.10 per share from Arctic Cat. We are maintaining our outlook for cash flow from continuing operations of the manufacturing group before pension contributions of $650 million to $750 million despite an estimated use of cash of $55 million related to the Arctic Cat acquisition.","That concludes our prepared remarks. So operator, we can open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll move to the first question with George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.","Scott Donnelly","Hi, George.","Operator","Mr. Shapiro, your line is open. George, you may have your mute on perhaps.","Scott Donnelly","Probably move to the next question.","Operator","Sure. We will go to Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr","Thank you very much. So your guide update, based on the first quarter tax rate, it looks like we\u2019re going to have a lower tax rate and weaker ops than you had when you first guided. So maybe update us in terms of where is the tax rate likely to be for 2017. And maybe run us through the operations because it kind of looks like some of them are going to be light.","Scott Donnelly","Well, Cai, let me say, on the operational side, most of the businesses performed consistent with where we expected and actually, most of them probably a little bit stronger performance, the exception, of course, being the TAPV program. And obviously, that\u2019s a headwind for us. So that $24 million of NOP, I think, largely, over the course of the year, we think we can offset that. As I said, we saw stronger performance in our Unmanned Systems business, we saw stronger performance at Bell. And again, in general, most of the businesses are performing well. The tax rate certainly will have some benefit.","Although the tax rate this quarter is lower, I think in the second, third, fourth quarter, we would expect to be in our more nominal rate, which means we\u2019ll probably finish the year something just under 30% in terms of the overall tax rate for the company. But the issue for us really is to focus on the operations and find offsets to the impact of the $24 million charge on the TAPV program, and I think we can work hard to get there through better performance in most of the businesses.","Cai von Rumohr","Okay. And then a quick one on aviation. Maybe explain why the turbo \u2013 the King Airs were as weak and what you expect for the year. And walk us through your color about pricing improvement \u2013 improving as you went through the quarter for biz jets.","Scott Donnelly","So I would say, on the King Air side, Cai, as you know, the King Air side traditionally had been a fairly international product, usually averaging around half of our sales, sometimes more than that. And right now, with kind of where economies are and the strength of the dollar, it\u2019s just been tough selling on the King Air front, so we only had three international deliveries of King Airs. I think if you look at the order pipeline, you talk to our sales teams, they feel pretty good that we\u2019ll see a positive trend as we go through the course of the year and feel like we can get to what our original plan was even though we\u2019re obviously lighter than we would have expected to be here in the first quarter. So that\u2019s kind of the color, I suppose, on the King Airs.","The T-6s, that will not be the case, right? I mean we know \u2013 that was built in to our original plan, that we would see low deliveries on T-6s. And again, there\u2019s some other opportunities out there, which I think will help us in the future, but it\u2019s going to be a pretty tough year. And we always understood that on the T-6 front. On the pricing in general, as we talked about on the last call, we\u2019re just \u2013 we\u2019ve sort of reestablished what we\u2019re willing to do in terms of pricing in the marketplace, and obviously, we\u2019ve had to communicate that with customers. There is still a very good deal, frankly, compared to historical pricing in the market, but I think it reflects our view of where we need to be to have a healthy business.","And so there were difficult conversations with many customers. I think as we got towards the end of the quarter, people started to understand that, that\u2019s just the reality of where we are. And we did see incremental improvements in pricing across every model, and we expect to continue that on a go-forward basis. And that was true on both the Citation as well as the King Air front. So again, I think we\u2019re in a \u2013 we all know we\u2019re in a weaker demand environment maybe than we\u2019ve seen in the past. We\u2019ve adjusted production rates down on a number of these aircraft, and we need to hold the line on the pricing to keep the business healthy.","Cai von Rumohr","Thank you so much.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to the next question in queue that will come from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Julian Mitchell","Thank you. So I guess one bright spot in these results was the Bell margin performance. I think you\u2019d guided that to drop about 100 points for the year as a whole. Obviously, you had a good improvement in the margin in the first quarter. So was there anything specific around mix or anything that supported the Bell profits in Q1 that you think unwinds over the balance of the year?","Scott Donnelly","Well, Julian, I mean, we\u2019re a little bit light, obviously, on the revenue side, but that wasn\u2019t really a mix issue. It\u2019s H-1s, which were something that which \u2013 was relatively minor issue. We had some tolerance issues, which has been resolved in aircraft during flight tests, so I expect we\u2019re more or less on plan in terms of how we expect the year to go from a revenue standpoint. I think I wouldn\u2019t change our guidance in terms of how we think about Bell for the balance of the year. But \u2013 certainly strong performance, but it was across the board, with one \u2013 no one specific thing or no specific mix impact that affected it.","So I think we\u2019ll perform to what we guided, and maybe there\u2019s a little upside based on the performance of the business for the year. I think the guys are doing a nice job.","Julian Mitchell","Thanks. And then just with the aviation profitability, you talked about the Scorpion being about a $50 million EBIT impact in that segment for the year. Was there any particular sort of front loading in those costs? And I guess, related to that, how do you feel about the overall aviation cost base exiting Q1 in light of the orders performance?","Scott Donnelly","Yes. Sure, so absolutely. If you look at the Scorpion program, we forecasted kind of within the guide to be about 100 basis point dilution for the year. That\u2019s certainly very much front-end loaded. It was in the order of a couple of 100 basis points or so in the quarter, just to give you a sense of that. And that\u2019s just the fact that we\u2019re sort of in the heavy-spend part of that program in the latter part of last year, beginning half of this year as we get the aircraft ready for the flight test program, for the airworthiness as well as, obviously, our expectation that we\u2019ll be able to participate in this Air Force experimentation program.","So we\u2019ve got a lot of spend here in getting those aircraft in the air and not just the aircraft themselves but the mission systems that are expected to be there for the Air Force experimentation program. So absolutely, in the case of Scorpion, that\u2019s very front half of the year loaded in terms of its impact to the aviation business.","I\u2019d say in terms of the cost base, in general, the aviation guys actually did a pretty nice job in the quarter, delivering where we expected them to be, even though we were lighter than we expected to be on the King Air front. So there\u2019s no question that volume was below our plan for the first quarter, again, driven primarily by the King Airs. But given the King Air volume that was not there and what we anticipated in terms of the volume and mix on the jet side, the performance and the cost controls were where they needed to be to deliver on the operating plan.","Julian Mitchell","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Sam Pearlstein","Good morning.","Scott Donnelly","Good morning.","Sam Pearlstein","Could you talk a little bit more about Arctic Cat? Just help me understand, I guess, what should the Industrial segment look like this year now as you consolidate that and we look at the intangible amortization? And you talked about the $55 million of outflow this year. How should we think about, I guess, from an earnings benefit or even a cash impact into 2018 at this point?","Scott Donnelly","Well, most of the negative impact of the acquisition in terms of the 2017 financials is driven by solving the inventory issue, which has been out there for some time and which we knew about, obviously, and talked about as part of the deal. And that was clearly factored into our valuation of deal economics. So this issue of 2017 operating performance is really very highly correlated to those rebate programs associated with clearing out the older-model product, and that will have, obviously, the operating profit hit and, certainly, the cash hit.","And we have factored that in. As you noticed, we did not change our cash forecast for the year. We think we have other opportunities in general in terms of working capital management that we can use to offset that $55 million of cash outflow associated with, in essence, cleaning of the inventory balance and the dealers as we go through the balance of the year.","We expect to clear the lion\u2019s share of that out. Frankly, we\u2019re already getting pretty good traction. The guys are very, very focused on resolving that issue. So we\u2019ve already seen a fair bit, which is why we had some impact in the quarter, of coming out of the gate and we know we have to go clean up the dealer channel to get this thing back on a growth trajectory and then generating good profit. And that\u2019s certainly our expectation for 2018.","Sam Pearlstein","Okay. And then from a restructuring standpoint, can you help me just to \u2013 it looks like the total restructuring plan moved up a little bit relative to, I guess, the case that you could spend up as much as \u2013 or have as much as a $47 million hit this year, but now it looks like it\u2019s a smaller amount. So did programs get pushed into 2018? Does it carry forward longer? Can you just update us on the restructuring?","Scott Donnelly","No. I think on the initial restructuring program that we announced, we brought the bottom of the range up a little bit, so we\u2019ve tightened it. But the top of it remains what we had discussed in previous guidance, so there\u2019s no real change there other than just tightening it. And then that will certainly be done by the end of 2017. I mean the bulk of it will be done by the end of the next quarter. There\u2019s a little bit that trickles out towards the end of the year, and that\u2019s just because, in the case particularly of Jacobsen, we\u2019re sort of moving that stuff one production line at a time, and so it does go out to the end of the year.","In the case of the restructuring associated with Arctic Cat, the bulk of that was taken here in the first quarter because it had to do primarily with deal costs and change of control clauses and things associated with the transaction, severance of folks here immediately. And there\u2019s a little bit through the \u2013 principally through the second, somewhat third quarter, but the bulk of it has already been taken.","Sam Pearlstein","And one last question. Just with all the discussion about the Navy potentially looking at more ships, has there been any change in terms of the desire to pull forward Ship to Shore Connector? Is there any change in kind of the outlook for that program?","Scott Donnelly","So there are \u2013 there have been some discussions about increasing the initial LRIP buy. Right now, the original plan was a couple of ships. They\u2019re talking about that could be as high as 5 ships. We\u2019re in discussions with the Navy right now in terms of getting ready for the long-lead material to support that contract. But to be honest, I mean, they don\u2019t have a budget right now.","So I can\u2019t tell you whether that number is 2 or 5, but the program of record appears very solid. The program \u2013 I think the Navy is happy with where things are and how they\u2019re progressing and, as I said, are ready to start long lead for the LRIP program, but unfortunately, just given the status of \u2013 I mean, the CR and all the budgetary turmoil that\u2019s going on, we nor they, I don\u2019t think, have a very good visibility right now as to what the number of units will be for this first LRIP tranche.","Sam Pearlstein","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Recearch. Please go ahead.","Robert Stallard","Hi, Thanks very much. Good morning.","Scott Donnelly","Hi, Rob.","Robert Stallard","Scott, I was wondering if you could start on aviation and whether you could comment on the regional demand profile, whether you\u2019ve seen any pickup in demand from the U.S. region.","Scott Donnelly","Well, most of the demand is still very U.S.-centric. I think, obviously, we\u2019ve been there for a while, and I don\u2019t necessarily see that changing here over the next few quarters. We do see some activity in Europe, which is encouraging. We\u2019ve had a couple of transactions in South America, but it\u2019s still a very U.S.-centric market right now.","Robert Stallard","And have you now seen any major pickup in the U.S. because we\u2019ve seen some pretty positive economic indicators?","Scott Donnelly","There\u2019s \u2013 the pipeline, I think the guys feel pretty good about. And obviously, we\u2019re pretty flat on a year-over-year basis in terms of the number of jets, but I think there\u2019s still folks that are kind of waiting to see what happens particularly around the tax reform side. So there\u2019s a little bit of a stall, kind of waiting to see what\u2019s going to happen around taxes and, therefore, expectations that people have around the U.S. economy. So I think people are still positive, but a little bit guarded, waiting to see what will happen.","Robert Stallard","Okay. And then on the TAPV, could you elaborate on what the issues were in the quarter and why you are confident you can reclaim the situation by the end of the year?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I hate to go through a litany. Look, the problem of this thing has been a series of issues, none of which are rocket science to fix, but things that just have not been \u2013 met the expectation that the customer has in terms of some things around finish, and we\u2019ve had some paint issues. I mean it\u2019s \u2013 yes, it\u2019s been a handful of issues, each one of which has largely led to some increases in bill of material cost and, more importantly, rework to get the vehicle to an acceptable condition.","And again, it\u2019s not stuff that\u2019s particularly technically challenging, but they\u2019ve been a series of issues, and that\u2019s driven not only bill of material growth but an awful lot of rework. And that\u2019s slowed down the pace of deliveries, and it has driven increased rework costs. And that\u2019s why we finally got to a position, so look, we just have to take this charge.","Obviously, our expectation is, is that we\u2019re done with that. We need to do a better job here on the ramp of deliverables. I think we can still get to where we need to get to by the end of this year per our plan, but certainly, the first quarter, we did not see the ramp that we expected to see. And that impacted both cash in terms of getting these things delivered and out of inventory and, even more importantly, it\u2019s driven higher costs, which has resulted in the charge.","Robert Stallard","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani","Good morning.","Scott Donnelly","Good morning.","Rajeev Lalwani","Scott, a couple of Scorpion questions for you. Can you walk us through the process from here, a possible Air Force order, implications for the program, whether you win or lose and just the competitive landscape there as you progress?","Scott Donnelly","Well, the experimentation program is a stand-alone program, right. So this is basically Air Force saying, we want to see what\u2019s out there that would support that category of mission. So they have articulated what their expectations are, what kinds of things they would like to see demonstrated. They issued that. Companies were invited to send in proposals on what they would be able to demonstrate if they were invited to do that. We have done that for both Scorpion and AT-6.","We think both aircraft, I mean, whilst they\u2019re different aircraft in terms of the performance envelope, can both fit within the realm of what kinds of capabilities the Air Force is looking to see demonstrated. So we\u2019ll know here probably in another month whether we have been invited to participate in that.","The expectation right now is, at that program, the actual flying of the aircraft would occur in that kind of August into September time frame. And what the Air Force has been saying publicly is that they will use that experimentation program to help inform them as to what\u2019s out there and available and use that as a basis to decide whether they\u2019re going to put together a program of record on a go-forward basis.","Rajeev Lalwani","And given your comments earlier on Ship to Shore, how does CR come into play and budgetary concerns, et cetera, if at all?","Scott Donnelly","Well, under a CR, obviously, you\u2019re not going to see any new programs. So \u2013 but I think that anything that would happen around Ship to Shore expansion is going to be a combination of what ultimately is approved even in the FY 2017 budget, as you know, which doesn\u2019t exist. So the resolution of the FY 2017 and then, clearly, what\u2019s going to be in the FY 2018 budget will drive programs like Ship to Shore in terms of their ability to ramp up and go into a limited-rate and, ultimately, full-rate production. And certainly, anything around an OA-X-type program is something that\u2019s going to need to be embedded within an FY 2018 budget.","So obviously, the Air Force has the flexibility to allocate some money to do things like an experimentation program to understand what\u2019s out there, but any kind of real acquisition program is something that would have to, I think, at this point, be in the FY 2018 budget. Maybe there is something they can put in to get something started in FY 2017, but I think most of the funding associated with these larger programs would have to be FY 2018 budgets.","Rajeev Lalwani","A quick question for Frank, if I could slip one in. Frank, I think you mentioned buybacks in the quarter, $180 million or so. Can you just talk more about the step up there and internally, how you\u2019re thinking about capital returns given that shift?","Frank Connor","Yes. It\u2019s consistent with where we\u2019ve been, which is we\u2019ve said we\u2019re going to look to buy stock to at least offset the dilution associated with our employee stock programs and that, above that, we would look to be opportunistic kind of around share repurchase and return of capital relative to acquisition activities and other needs for the cash. And so it was just a reflection of the fact that with the Arctic Cat acquisition happening kind of fourth quarter, we didn\u2019t buy much stock kind of, and so we look to offset some of the dilution and do other things in the first quarter here.","Rajeev Lalwani","Thank you, gentlemen.","Operator","And our next question comes from Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton.","Pete Skibitski","Good morning, guys. Just to finish up on Arctic Cat, can you give us your updated expectations for Industrial revenue for the year?","Scott Donnelly","So the Arctic Cat is probably going to be somewhere around $0.5 million, I\u2019m sorry, $0.5 billion of revenue, and it\u2019s about 100 basis point dilution, which obviously hits sort of $0.10 EPS that we talked about and now have baked into the latest number.","Peter Skibitski","Got it, okay. Thank you. And then, Scott, is there any upside to Bell margin guidance for the year? You started off pretty well there, and you talked about H-1 timing. And so those will ramp the rest of the year, and I\u2019m assuming they\u2019re at least in line with the sector average. Any thoughts there?","Scott Donnelly","They are. Yes, look, Pete, I think, if we look at businesses that had strong performance in the first quarter or that we expect to continue through the balance of the year, it\u2019s certainly a couple of the systems businesses and Bell. I think the guys \u2013 again, it performed very well on the margin rate, and I think that we continue, as we\u2019ve talked about, to feel pretty good about opportunities around the 412, which is a good margin product for us. And you\u2019re right, the H-1s is purely a timing issue, and they tend to be in line with the segment margin rates. So yes, I would say there is probably some upside potential at least on the margin rate side at Bell for the year.","Pete Skibitski","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Seth Seifman","Hey, good morning. Thanks very much. I guess, can you tell us \u2013 do you plan to also offer the T-6 for the light attack experiment?","Scott Donnelly","Sure, yes. No, we\u2019ll submit both the Scorpion as well as the AT-6, which is the attack variant of the T-6 trainer. So the experimentation in terms of the way it was expressed by the Air Force, in terms of the requirements or what they want to see demonstrated was, I think, intentionally broad enough to pick up a pretty broad swath of capability that would involve everything from aircraft class of the AT-6 in the sort of the single-engine turboprop class of aircraft up to and including twin jet kind of aircraft like a Scorpion-type aircraft.","So it\u2019s a \u2013 the breadth or how wide, they kind of said, hey, here\u2019s what \u2013 we\u2019d like to see aircraft with the following kinds of capability, was, I think, very \u2013 intentionally very broad. And so where ultimately they want to go from a requirement standpoint, then \u2013 if they go at all, is I think to be informed by that. And so they\u2019ll be able to see aircraft that range everything from, I\u2019d say, the light turboprop space to the heavier jets. And the good news for us is we can put both capabilities into the program.","Seth Seifman","Yes. And just as a follow-up, just a follow-up on Pete\u2019s last question. Guidance for Industrial, excluding Arctic Cat, is that still about $4 billion of sales and a 9% margin?","Frank Connor","Yes. That was the original guidance. And as Scott said, kind of Arctic Cat will be $400 million to $500 million, and about 1% dilution will be best reflected in that $ 0.10 of dilution that we indicated.","Seth Seifman","Okay. Great, thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question will come from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Hey, good morning, guys.","Scott Donnelly","Good morning.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Frank, if I could start with you. Just on the manufacturing cash flow, can you talk a little bit about the working capital build in the quarter? And how do you think that swings, if it swings positively in Q2, and just the ramp-up for the full year?","Frank Connor","Yes. Sheila, obviously, kind of Q1 is always a bit of a build for us as we \u2013 given the seasonality of the business. The first quarter from a balance sheet impact \u2013 or standpoint was impacted by Arctic Cat. So when you look at working capital, for instance, about $140 million of the inventory increase related to the Arctic Cat acquisition. So it\u2019s hard to make an apples-to-apples comparison. But kind of generally, we did okay on the working capital side, I\u2019d say, in the first quarter, and we expect things to improve as we move forward and that Q2 kind of will be better than Q1 and cash flow will continue to improve as we move through the year.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Okay, got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then one on systems, if I could ask, just the top line trajectory there. Weapons and Sensors is pretty strong. Is that expected to continue throughout the year? Or is that the \u2013 how do we think about the last Sensor Fuzed Weapons shipments and just the profitability swings there quarterly?","Scott Donnelly","So there\u2019s, basically, at this point, Sheila, one additional delivery that will happen for the balance of the lot on SFW. Right now, we\u2019re in conversations with the customer on that as to whether that will be a third quarter or a second quarter delivery. Right now, on a contractual basis, it\u2019s probably out in the third quarter. If they have an issue in taking them, we could probably \u2013 and again, not certain but we could probably get the deliveries and inspections completed to deliver on the second quarter if that\u2019s what they want to do, and that would be the last delivery.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Okay, got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then so the profitability mix sort of is in line with the full year guidance of 8.5%. It normalizes once weapons comes down a bit and TAPV, I guess, resets.","Scott Donnelly","Well, the impact there \u2013 the only thing that\u2019s not factored into that guidance is that $24 million of the impact on TAPV. Now as I said earlier, I think some of the offsets to that, from a program performance standpoint, are likely to be Unmanned Systems. So we\u2019ll see some mitigation in \u2013 within the systems segment, but part of the offset will also be in other segments. So you can certainly expect that we will be on the low end or below the guidance range on systems as a result of that TAPV charge.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Understood, got it. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.","Peter Arment","Yes. Good morning, Scott and Frank. Just a quick one on \u2013 back on Scorpion. Just Scott, how many \u2013 you mentioned the second production aircraft just had its first flight. How many do you need for the Air Force program?","Scott Donnelly","What you could do it with just one. They kind of leave that up to the companies. We obviously have 2 that are flying right now. We\u2019ll actually have a third that will be flying at that point in time. And so depending on how they want to schedule things and run the operation, we could support that with probably 1 or 2 aircraft. And then we would have a third aircraft that\u2019s really dedicated to the flight test program associated with airworthiness.","Peter Arment","Okay. And then just switching over on the \u2013 you mentioned unmanned, that demand was there. Is that really \u2013 is that just operational tempo that\u2019s impacting that? Or what specifically is driving that?","Scott Donnelly","It\u2019s operational tempo, which is strong, and just performance in terms of managing cost and executing on the other contracts pretty efficiently. So I think, overall, that business is \u2013 flows to the next quarter, and I would expect that will continue for the balance of the year.","Peter Arment","Okay. And lastly, just you mentioned \u2013 I think the T-6 shipments for the year, we know, are going to be down significantly. I think the last time I heard, it was about 15 or so. Is that still a good number to use?","Frank Connor","It\u2019s a little lower than that.","Scott Donnelly","Probably 10 to \u2013 somewhere in the 10 or 12 for the total year.","Peter Arment","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ron Epstein","Yes. Good morning, guys.","Frank Connor","Good morning.","Scott Donnelly","Good morning.","Ron Epstein","Just a couple of quick questions. Most \u2013 everything has been asked. Frank, on the delinquencies, they were up, and just not a big number but it was up 50% year-over-year. What\u2019s going on there? Is there anything? Is it just seasonality? Or what\u2019s going on there?","Frank Connor","Yes. There is no \u2013 really no trends. It bounces around a little bit quarter-to-quarter, but there is no trends. And we feel good about kind of how the portfolio is doing.","Ron Epstein","Okay, great. And then moving back to the vehicles business. As we go into the spring here, and I would imagine the selling season for side-by-side vehicles is picking up, how does that look? I mean, can you give us any color on the order activity and the shipment to the channel and all that sort of stuff?","Scott Donnelly","Well, it\u2019s fairly soft right now, Ron. Again, the challenge that we have on the company as we acquired it was the \u2013 frankly, they have too much inventory. And so the first step out of the gate here has been to put together these programs to help \u2013 put rebating together to help the dealers move it out. I think that\u2019s been very well received, and as I said, we\u2019re already starting to see the impact of that. In terms of restocking, which is certainly very important to us, we have, obviously, the Stampede product line and we have some additional \u2013 new products that are coming out.","And we have scheduled, frankly, the \u2013 basically just about the whole month of May are going through with that dealer channel and meeting with them and explaining the products that are in the pipeline and what\u2019s available to show them what\u2019s new that they want to put out on the floor. So the timing of the deal was probably not ideal just in terms of when it closed because you\u2019re kind of into that season. Obviously, we couldn\u2019t go out and be part of that process before the deal closed.","But having the deal now closed, we do have meetings set up with all the dealers in kind of a region-by-region basis. We\u2019ve got all our sales folks now aligned post deal. So I\u2019d say we\u2019re just now, frankly, as we\u2019re going to the month May, able to have these conversations with that channel around what products are now being added, what\u2019s going on in terms of new products, both things within the Arctic Cat pipeline as well as what was in the Textron off-road pipeline and to really start that selling process.","Ron Epstein","Okay. And then maybe one last one. Kind of moving back to Scorpion again. In the past, there had been some discussion around international opportunities, right? Kind of everybody is focusing on this U.S. Air Force light attack. But in the Middle East, there were some opportunities and so on and so forth. What\u2019s going on there? Can you give us some color on what\u2019s going on with Scorpion outside of the U.S.?","Scott Donnelly","Sure. So they\u2019re still there. We continue those conversations with those customers. We are at the phase right now, frankly, with one of the more important ones who\u2019s already scheduling when they\u2019re coming over to fly the aircraft. We have to do a certain number of hours and get certain tickets from the FAA to allow somebody that\u2019s not our experimental pilots to fly these things. But now that we have the aircraft flying and are working our way through that with the FAA, we can start to actually schedule demo flights.","As you can imagine, the foreign customers are also very interested in this U.S. Air Force program because they like to see what the U.S. Air Force is doing. So I think that is a \u2013 I don\u2019t know if that helps or hurts, but certainly something that they\u2019re watching as well. But anyway, I would say, the international conversations continue.","Ron Epstein","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason Gursky","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Scott Donnelly","Hey, Gursky.","Jason Gursky","Scott, I was wondering if you could spend a few minutes on Kautex. Talk a little bit about some of the competitive dynamics going on in that market, and describe to us, perhaps based on new wins that you had there in 2016, what we might expect the growth rate at Kautex to be relative to the overall market. Certainly, the market is flat. What would Kautex do in that environment, given what you know about the wins that you had in 2016 and the legacy things that might be rolling off?","Scott Donnelly","Sure. Look, it usually takes a couple of years from the time between a new model win is announced and the time that, that manufacturer is going to roll that product down the line. So that translation from a selection to an SOP or start of production in the auto lingo is usually 2 to 2.5-year kind of window. So we have pretty good visibility into what they tell us, but do keep in mind that, that\u2019s based upon what their forecasts are and, in general, what the overall automotive industry forecast is for those units.","Of course, that\u2019s true even for our current production rates. So there always a \u2013 as you compete for those deals, there\u2019s sort of a maximum number and then there\u2019s usually some percentage discounts applied in terms of how much capacity you want to allocate to it because they\u2019re going to have an ability to flex in terms of their order rates based on what the end market is doing.","So all that being said, I think that if you look at where we are with Kautex, where we have been over the last few years and, certainly, where we expect to be over the next few years, given some new technology, given some of the conversion and FCR and things of that nature, we have tended to outgrow what the end market is doing, and I expect that we\u2019ll continue on that trend. So we will \u2013 I feel very comfortable that we can outgrow the overall industry. What we always have to have in terms of how we forecast is what is the overall industry doing. And if the industry has, in general, been growing, we see some volatility between regions at times.","So far this year, I\u2019d say it\u2019s more or less operating the way we expected it, maybe a little bit of North American softness offset by a little higher growth in some other regions, but that\u2019s kind of normal for us. I mean when we look at our plan every year, there\u2019s usually a little bit of shifting back and forth between the regions, but it\u2019s still been a net growth. And again, our growth has been in excess of that of the industry. And again, based on the win rates and based on our products, I think that\u2019s a trend that will continue.","Jason Gursky","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. I appreciate that. And then as a follow-up \u2013 I may have missed it, but you talked about pricing for new jets. I was wondering if you might make a comment, if you haven\u2019t already, on the pricing environment in the used markets, what you\u2019re seeing from an inventory level, pricing of Citations out there in the markets. And if you can make some general comments about the pricing environment across the various segments of the business given the fact that your portfolio was expanding to cover some more segments here. Just kind of give us a flavor of what you\u2019re seeing in the used market, would be helpful, across the industry.","Scott Donnelly","Well, I think \u2013 I mean, obviously, I\u2019ve spent more time looking at our particular numbers than some of the other classes. But our used available for sale has been a pretty flat, stable number now for a while. The pricing, for the most part, has been a pretty flat, stable number. If you look at sort of publications, you\u2019ll usually see that the \u2013 we have one model in particular, the Citation X, that has seen pricing pressure in the used market.","But that\u2019s \u2013 I mean that\u2019s been true with that aircraft now for as long as I\u2019ve been around. For some reason, the pricing in the aftermarket for that one has been tough. But if you look across the rest of the core of our businesses, from CJs up to XLS and Sovereigns, it\u2019s been pretty stable, and certainly, that\u2019s generally what we see as we\u2019re selling aircraft from our used inventory.","So I guess I would say that it\u2019s \u2013 I mean I\u2019d love to see prices going up in that segment. I don\u2019t think I could say they\u2019re going up in that segment, but the used market has been fairly stable. And I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t \u2013 I just don\u2019t track enough probably on the other classes of aircraft to give you much commentary on that.","Operator","And we can move to the next line. It would be George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.","George Shapiro","On aviation, Scott, you mentioned Scorpion was maybe 200 basis points and maybe about $19 million. Is the second quarter going to be relatively high and then will tail off so we get to the $50 million for the year?","Scott Donnelly","Yes. That\u2019s what I would expect, George. We\u2019ve got the \u2013 as I said, we\u2019ve got \u2013 2 of the aircraft are flying. We have the third one that\u2019s in its sort of final assembly. There\u2019s a fair bit of work going on right now on the mission systems, which is very specific to what we know the Air Force is going to want to see demonstrated in their experimentation program. And obviously, all that culminated in having these aircraft ready to go do that program by the beginning of August, actually a little bit earlier than that because the program will require flight training for some of the Air Force pilots. So it\u2019s certainly been very heavy here in the first quarter. I would expect it to be pretty heavy in the second quarter and then tail off through the balance of the year.","George Shapiro","And how about other R&D? I know, last year, you said R&D was abnormally high because of Longitude expenses. How was the rest of the R&D this quarter compared to, say, last year\u2019s first quarter?","Scott Donnelly","Yes. There was certainly a benefit if you look at \u2013 have you looked at the business without Scorpion in there, would have had a bit of a tailwind on the R&D front for exactly what you just said. We had a lot of spending. We had Longitude in a very similar situation last year at this time as we have with Scorpion right now. Obviously, that program was very heavy in the first half, got all the aircraft flying into the certification program. And we have three aircraft now on the Longitude program, but they\u2019re all flying. And it\u2019s kind of normal flight test type of expense that we certainly have gotten past the blows of R&D spending on that program.","George Shapiro","So would have been down $5 million, $10 million relative to last year, can you ballpark it for me?","Scott Donnelly","Somewhere in that range, George. But I mean, as you know, we don\u2019t break out business by business. But certainly, it would have been a slight tailwind to the business if we didn\u2019t have the Scorpion running.","George Shapiro","And then if I go to Industrial, where the margin was a little less than I was looking for. Can you break out how much of the impact was from Arctic Cat and how much was just from the restructuring to combine the couple of divisions that you talked about?","Scott Donnelly","Well, on the order, we probably had about \u2013 somewhere around half of it was really associated with the costs that were incurred on the Arctic Cat front, and it was a little bit lighter quarter on the NOP front in a couple of other businesses. But again, nothing that was beyond what we have expected or expect certainly for the full year.","George Shapiro","And then at systems, Scott, if I take out the $24 million charge you mentioned, you would have had a margin over 10%. I mean, is that kind of a run rate or it will be a little bit lower because you still have higher deliveries of the zero margin TAPV?","Scott Donnelly","That\u2019s correct, George. Yes, we would have had, frankly, a great quarter in the systems business had it not been for the TAPV. I think the other businesses will continue to perform well through the balance of the year, but we are going to have a lot of revenue that\u2019s coming through with zero margin on TAPV for the balance of the year.","George Shapiro","Okay. Those are my questions. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question Justin Bergner with Gabelli & Company.","Justin Bergner","Hi, thank you for taking my questions Scott and Frank. Just on the last question, you mentioned in Industrial that it was a little bit lighter quarter on \u2013 and you were referring to part of the business. I think I missed that.","Scott Donnelly","Well, we had some issues around some deliveries in other parts of our vehicle business. Frankly, the good news is some new product came out that was very well received, and we just couldn\u2019t build it fast enough. So that will move some things into the second quarter, but there\u2019s nothing fundamental issue there. It\u2019s a little bit of timing on that front. The rest of the business of tools and test of \u2013 was performing as we would expect. Kautex was where we expected. And again, with the exception of being a little bit light on some vehicle deliveries just based on getting production units out, I think we\u2019re fine.","Justin Bergner","Okay, great. And then, secondly, on your Textron Aviation revenue and margin guidance for the year that you gave at the start of the year, I mean, given that pricing is firming, are you expecting margins to potentially come in above the earlier range? Or is Textron Aviation not a source of sort of upside for your annual guidance at this point?","Scott Donnelly","I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an upside source of guidance. I mean, obviously, we talked about in the latter part of last year what we had to do on the pricing front, and that\u2019s absolutely baked into our operating plan for the business.","Justin Bergner","Thank you.","Scott Donnelly","Sure.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Myles Walton","Thanks. Good morning, thanks for taking the question. There\u2019s just two that I had still left. One was on King Air. Scott, you mentioned, despite of slow start, you think you could still reach the original plan. Could you remind us what the original plan was for King Air is year-on-year 2017?","Scott Donnelly","No, we don\u2019t guide at that level. But it\u2019s going to be roughly \u2013 I mean, our expectation is it\u2019s roughly flat year-over-year, is, I think, what we originally talked about. And that\u2019s still our expectation in terms of units.","Myles Walton","In terms of units, yes. And so \u2013 but your sales force, they kind of see this 1Q as being anomalous, and you mentioned the dollar strengthening. Is it competitive? Is it market? Or is it \u2013 competitive in the sense of they\u2019re finding competition at lower prices? Or is it that they\u2019re deferring the purchase because \u2013","Scott Donnelly","No. It\u2019s just generally deferring the purchase, which is \u2013 again, that\u2019s just kind of \u2013 that\u2019s part of the impact I think of how we saw some of the lower volumes as people say, well, geez, the dollar strengthened, so you need to lower the price. And \u2013 but we can\u2019t do that. So we\u2019d rather take the hit on some of the volume because these are deals that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s a great aircraft. It\u2019s the right aircraft for the mission. And when people can afford the aircraft, even considering the strength of the dollar, I think they\u2019ll buy the aircraft. So I think it\u2019s largely deferrals of purchase decisions.","Myles Walton","And then could you just give us the data points for aftermarket growth for the Bell and the Cessna on a year-on-year basis?","Scott Donnelly","Bell was probably up very slightly, and actually, aviation was probably down very slightly.","Myles Walton","Okay. Thank you so much.","Scott Donnelly","Sure.","Operator","And our next question comes from Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland","Hey, good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for fitting me in.","Scott Donnelly","Good morning, Carter.","Carter Copeland","Just a couple of quick kind of cleanups here. On TAPV and TMLS, usually, these sorts of realizations are accompanied by changes in process, review process, leadership. Have you had any of that at TMLS? And then you talked last quarter about the 412 outlook at Bell in 2018 and beyond looking a little bit more healthy. Wondered if you could give us some color on that?","Scott Donnelly","So I would say, in the case of TMLS, yes. I mean there have been a number of changes operationally to try to address some talent issues around there, and so that\u2019s been done. On the 412 yes, look, we still \u2013 our sales teams still feels pretty bullish on a number of important 412 opportunities that are out there. Several units did close in the quarter, and we have a number of deals which are sort of multi-aircraft orders that are progressing well. As you know, the 412 is virtually exclusively an international product. So these things, particularly the extent that some are government involved, usually take a little bit longer than any of us would like, but they continue on the path to closure, and we still feel good about it.","Carter Copeland","Okay, great. And with respect to the Latitude, one last one. The profit profile you saw there, essentially unchanged versus the end of last year?","Scott Donnelly","Yes. Look, the volume that goes into NetJet is the same on a year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter basis, and I expect it to stay there sequentially and year-over-year. Based on the actions that we\u2019ve taken on Latitude pricing, we\u2019ve seen improvements.","Carter Copeland","Okay. All right, thank you gentlemen.","Scott Donnelly","Sure.","Operator","Your next question will come from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Noah Poponak","Hi, good morning, everyone.","Scott Donnelly","Good morning.","Noah Poponak","Scott, do you think the Cessna book-to-bill will move above one as you move through 2017?","Scott Donnelly","I don\u2019t know that it will. I think that we\u2019re really in a mode now where there\u2019s no reason for people to book aircraft very far in advance. So the \u2013 we usually, as we\u2019re working with somebody, kind of know when their delivery \u2013 when they want their delivery to be. They may have aircraft that\u2019s coming off lease or we have guys that want to go do their trade obviously, go to look to remarket their existing aircraft. But there\u2019s no reason, given the sort of where the industry is, to be looking at deals that are a year out or even six months out.","So I think that\u2019s just the nature of where we are in the market. And again, Noah, it\u2019s different than the industry used to be, for sure, but we\u2019ve been doing this for a lot of years now, so it\u2019s just a bit of the nature of the beast.","Noah Poponak","Yes. I guess I was a little surprised that it was one in the quarter, given you\u2019re early \u2013 I guess, early in the process of trying to incrementally hold firmer on price. I would think that would sort of weaken the bookings. But was there firming of NetJets in the quarter that contributed to backlog?","Scott Donnelly","I think it\u2019s just a subsequent quarter. So if you look at what we delivered in the quarter versus what got out of the backlog, there\u2019s not net change in terms of the NetJet deliveries. And look, I think on the dynamic of the sort of, let\u2019s call it, the retail booking of all of the aircraft, I think, as we went through the quarter, we certainly had some customers that said, look, as I \u2013 give me a little better price, I\u2019ll do it this quarter. I\u2019ll go ahead and book it now. And as I said, we can\u2019t do that. And so we\u2019re working with them, and so then deals do start to book at that higher price, which is where we need to be.","Noah Poponak","Okay. So the amount of NetJets units that firmed and went into backlog was about the same as what was delivered?","Scott Donnelly","Yes. We\u2019re looking just to get and see if it\u2019s the exact number or not. But \u2013 so I mean, there \u2013 it might have been up a couple of units. As you know, the way we treat the NetJet stuff is once we\u2019ve identified the specific tail number, the specific delivery date, that\u2019s when we move them into the backlog. So again, these aircraft are coming into backlog and then delivering over a \u2013 it\u2019s probably six to nine month or so period.","Noah Poponak","Okay. What are you seeing your competitors do as you incrementally hold the line on price? Are you seeing them do the same or not?","Scott Donnelly","I think it\u2019s been largely the same. Look, I think we \u2013 collectively, the industry has been a little unhealthy. That\u2019s certainly how we\u2019ve seen it, and I suspect they see it the same way. But I don\u2019t know, they\u2019re \u2013 obviously, they have to make their own calls in terms of the pricing environment. But I certainly would say that, as we work for the customers and explain what we\u2019re doing and then why we have to do it, it\u2019s \u2013 I mean, they\u2019re unhappy, but they do realize these are \u2013 these aircraft are still a heck of a price compared to historicals and it\u2019s a good deal. And that\u2019s why we still see deals closing.","Noah Poponak","Yes, okay. And then just to make sure I\u2019m clear on the systems margin. Is it the correct interpretation that I should be thinking about that $24 million contract reset as going to zero in the second quarter and rest of the year and, therefore, the margin should be pretty even in the kind of 9% to 10% range each of the next three quarters to get you in the vicinity of your original 8.5% guidance.","Scott Donnelly","No. So I think you need to take that $24 million largely out of our guide number. And I mean \u2013 I would guess we can probably relook at that. We tend not to get into the revisions of segment-level guidance. But the color on it, Noah, is that we will certainly miss that segment-level guidance given that $24 million charge. I think we\u2019ll make up some of that $24 million within the other systems businesses, but some of it will be made up across the rest of the company.","Noah Poponak","Okay. So as you look out of the original systems guidance, assuming you\u2019re outperforming a little bit in the rest of systems, outperforming a little bit in Bell and then getting a little tax rate.","Scott Donnelly","Yes. That\u2019s correct.","Noah Poponak","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Drew Lipke with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Drew Lipke","Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I\u2019m curious in aviation. Do you have a sense if just the prospect for tax reform has caused customers to maybe take more of a wait-and-see approach on placing orders? Are you hearing any commentary on that through the sales channel?","Scott Donnelly","A little bit. But I think the tax \u2013 the specific tax impact of acquisition on aircraft, while \u2013 if you take view that says, hey you\u2019re going to get 100% deductibility on a capital acquisition like that, that certainly gives some incremental benefit in terms of the math behind that transaction, and so I think that would be beneficial. But I have to say the bigger issue here is not just the particular tax rate. Because, remember, under bonus depreciation, you\u2019re really talking about a two year window here anyway.","So it is an improvement, but it\u2019s not a huge improvement. The issue for most of our customers is \u2013 the bigger issue is what kind of economic growth are we going to see in the country and, therefore, what\u2019s the outlook for the performance of their businesses. And so an overhaul of the tax system, a reduction of rates, the stimulus that, that would generate in terms of economic growth is the bigger factor for them, I think, than the particulars associated with the tax treatment of this particular transaction.","Drew Lipke","Okay.","Scott Donnelly","And that\u2019s why they\u2019re kind of waiting what\u2019s really going to happen here in terms of tax reform and how does it play out from a legislative standpoint.","Drew Lipke","Okay. So you\u2019re seeing it in the sentiment and the confidence but not follow through yet in orders?","Scott Donnelly","Correct.","Drew Lipke","Okay. And then we\u2019ve seen some slowing trends pretty consistent in terms of utilization rates for Citation and for Beechcraft. How should we think about aftermarket trends in aviation over the next 12 to 18 months?","Scott Donnelly","Well, we seem to be pretty flat in terms of utilization. Particularly as it \u2013 if you look at the average utilization rate, I would expect, as we go forward, given that we\u2019re starting to put \u2013 obviously, Latitudes now have been going into the NetJet fleet for coming up on a year. As we get into the latter part of the second quarter and to the third quarter, we\u2019ll start to see some growth in services associated with those, but obviously we also see some decrement associated with \u2013 from the other NetJet fleet.","So it\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t think we see a reason for a whole lot of change here on the total year service side.","Drew Lipke","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks a lot. Thanks guys.","Eric Salander","Okay, Brad. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for joining us, and we\u2019ll talk to you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President, Investor Relations, Mr. Doug Wilburne. Please go ahead.","Douglas R. Wilburne","Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release.","On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.","Moving now to first quarter results, starting with Slide #3. Revenues in the quarter were $2.9 billion, up 15.2% from a year ago. On a GAAP basis, we recorded income from continuing operations of $0.41 per share, which compares to earnings per share of $0.10 in the first quarter of 2011. ","Moving to cash flow, first quarter manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was a $106 million use of cash. First quarter pension contributions were $144 million.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott C. Donnelly","Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everybody. I believe our first quarter financial results represented a very solid start to the year, reflecting growth in our commercial aircraft and industrial end markets and continued operational execution improvements across all of our businesses. We also secured a number of key program wins and made some important strategic moves in the quarter that should help provide growth in the long term.","Starting with systems, we won 2 important unmanned aerial systems fee-for-service contracts from the U.S. DoD. The business model for these fee-for-service programs is different, and we normally -- in that we will be investing CapEx in the platforms upfront and in turn, we'll be receiving cash over time as we operate the assets to deliver services to our customer. These 2 contracts were important for a number of reasons. First, the addition of what we expect will be meaningful revenue streams over the next several years at Textron Systems. And second, both these awards are based on our Aerosonde unmanned aircraft, which is a smaller air vehicle than our traditional Shadow models. So we'll now have a second product platform deployed with the U.S. military, which should lead to future opportunities. Finally, these contracts provide an opportunity to demonstrate the attractiveness of fee-for-service UAS arrangements for additional U.S. and foreign military applications.","Moving over to our Finance segment, we continue to have success with our non-captive exit strategy as we liquidated $171 million in non-captive finance receivables during the quarter, including $67 million reduction in our Golf portfolio. This included the disposal of 13 golf course mortgages and one owned golf course at favorable prices. Our non-captive portfolio now stands at $780 million. We generated income in the quarter, which reflected profitability in both captive and non-captive portfolios.","Shifting to Industrial. Operating performance was solid, with revenues up at each of the business units. We did see some softness in European auto and tool markets as expected, but this was more than offset by strength in North America.","Moving now to Cessna. We delivered 38 jets in the quarter, up from 31 last year and saw a double-digit growth in our aftermarket business. More importantly, we continue to see improvement in customer activity. New orders were higher than last year's first, second and third quarters combined; and our customer prospect list continues to improve. We had several additional positive developments at Cessna in the quarter, including an improvement in the range specification of the new Citation Latitude from 2,000 nautical miles to 2,300 nautical miles, the first flight of the new Ten, the first flight of the M2, delivery of our 400th Mustang and the announcement of new service capabilities in China.","Expanding our Chinese service capability is part of our accelerated China strategy for which we also announced a very important agreement with AVIC to develop a Chinese general aviation business. We expect that this agreement will lead to a number of business opportunities. We expect to form a JV with AVIC and the Chengdu municipal government, which will focus initially on final assembly and completions of our Sovereign product line for our Chinese customers and will ultimately evolve to include a number of activities, ultimately including the development of a new aircraft. We're obviously very excited about this opportunity and believe this positions Cessna very well to participate in what will be a significant growth market.","To wrap up with Bell, we delivered 10 V-22s, 7 H-1s and 30 commercial helicopters in the first quarter versus 9 V-22s, 4 H-1s and 15 commercial units in last year's first quarter. Solid execution on the ramp up in these deliveries allowed us to post another quarter of excellent financial performance. The commercial demand environment of Bell continues to strengthen and based on order activity underway, we still expect to see a significant increase in deliveries this year. ","During the quarter, we also expanded the addressable market of Bell with an important product announcement at Heli-Expo, the 525 Relentless. This new 16-passenger super-medium helicopter will offer best-in-class capabilities, including superior payload, range, cabin, and cargo volumes. The 525 will have a fully integrated glass cockpit featuring the Garmin 5000, integrated avionics suite, a pair of GE CT7 engines and a BAE fly-by-wire flight control system. The Relentless will be especially well suited for deep water offshore applications in oil and gas and will also serve as a great platform for search and rescue, emergency medical services, and VIP and corporate missions. The 525 is a strategic new product for Bell, which we will expect will meaningfully contribute for future commercial growth.","To wrap up the quarter, we are seeing encouraging signs in our commercial aircraft markets at both Bell and Cessna. We posted strong results at Bell and Industrial and much improved results at Cessna. ","At systems, we had 2 important program wins in a challenging defense environment. Overall, I think we're focused on continuing to prove our tactical execution, at the same time, we're also investing in making strategic moves to grow our business over the long term. ","With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank.","Frank T. Connor","Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone.  Manufacturing segment profit in the quarter was $247 million, up $80 million from the first quarter of 2011 on a $342 million or a 13.9% increase in manufacturing revenues.","Let's look at how each of the segments contributed, starting with Cessna. ","At Cessna, revenues were up $113 million on a year-over-year basis as a result of a $23 million -- or a 23% increase in jet unit deliveries and an 18% increase in aftermarket revenues. We narrowed our operating loss by $32 million from the first quarter of 2011, primarily on higher volume.  ","At Bell, revenues were up $245 million on increased V-22, H-1 and commercial deliveries. Segment profit increased $54 million, primarily reflecting higher volumes and the mix of commercial aircraft.","At Textron Systems, revenues were down $68 million, reflecting lower volumes. Segment profit decreased $18 million, primarily due to the lower volumes.","Industrial revenues increased $52 million, reflecting higher volumes, partially offset by a $12 million negative impact of foreign exchange. Segment profits increased $12 million, primarily due to the higher volumes.","Moving to Finance. Segment profit was $12 million for the quarter. Finance receivables ended the quarter down $267 million from the end of last year. Credit performance improved during the quarter with non-accruals ending the quarter at $290 million, a decrease of $31 million from the prior quarter. And 60-day delinquencies were $143 million, an improvement of $23 million from the fourth quarter.","Moving to corporate items. Corporate expenses were $47 million, up from $39 million last year, primarily due to the impact of -- that our higher share price had on compensation expense. Interest expense was down $3 million from a year ago.","To conclude, we remain on track for our full year EPS outlook of $1.80 to $2 a share and cash flow from manufacturing operations before pension contributions of $700 million to $750 million.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Greg, we can open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question will come from Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley.","Heidi R. Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes. Can you talk us through the puts and takes on Cessna reconciling the 18% increase in aftermarket with -- which should reduce profits with what we saw and why you're so confident in achieving this for your goals for the year?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, I think, Heidi, if you look at the conversion rates, obviously, I think if you go back to the first quarter of last year to the first quarter of this year, it's quite a bit higher than the 18%, but I do think that if you look at over the course of the year, we still think that given what remains kind of a difficult pricing environment and relatively lower volumes, you kind of get into a laundry list of things that are moving around. I still think that over the course of the year that, that's about the leverage that we'll expect to see. So we had a reasonable conversion versus the previous quarter, but I think as you look through the year, I still feel pretty confident it's going to end up somewhere around that 18-or-so percent.","Heidi R. Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","All right, great. And one last question. Can you -- we want to dig into the Bell margins a little bit more. Talk a little bit about the sustainability of that and what sort of drove that nice margin performance.","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, the Bell margins, as you know, we've talked about the challenges this year of being around significant increases in commercial deliveries. Obviously, even within that there are some mix issues depending on the models. So I think for the quarter, obviously, we saw solid growth in terms of the military side. Certainly, commercial was up from 15 to 30 helicopters, but I think we're going to see even more significant unit growth over the course of the year on the commercial, and most of those are going to be somewhat dilutive in terms of margin rates. We also have increased R&D that's going up. So again, I think the numbers that we've guided over the course of the year is certainty attainable. The guys are doing a nice job in managing the ramp and controlling costs, but we are going to see a much heavier mix through the balance of the course of the year on the -- particularly on the wider commercial helicopter volume.","Operator","And our next question comes from Carter Copeland of Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just quickly on systems, I wondered if you might give us a little bit more color about the decliners there. You had mentioned your expectations for flat revenues, although I recall in the last quarter, there was some commentary about conversion of some opportunities on UAVs. Any color you can provide us there on what you saw the decline in the quarter and what surprised you there?","Scott C. Donnelly","I don't know that anything surprised us a whole lot in the quarter. Obviously, the trend that we saw all through last year and that we still see into this year is just things moving relatively slowly in terms of getting contracts let, going through the whole proposal, evaluation and award process. We didn't have any surprises in the quarter, where something that we thought was going to happen either didn't happen or volumes were issued at a lower rate, and I still think that we're feeling like we're going to guide to a flat year. Obviously, what was important in the quarter as we came into the year needing to get a couple of very important wins on the UAS business in particular, and we won both of those. Now those don't generate a lot of revenue in 2012, so we said we'll spend most of the rest of the year building out the systems and getting those deployed per specific task orders with both the Navy and the Marines and SOCOM, but those things will all be out there. And they've got between 3 and 5 years of pretty solid revenue generation beyond that. So I think those were important wins, again, not so much they had a lot of impact or were forecast to have a lot of impact in 2012, but very important for us in the '13 to 'l5-or-so time frame.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. And one quick follow-up for Frank. The corporate expense, you noted the step-up due to the higher stock price and relative to the amount, I think it was $145 million, you talked about on the last call for corporate expense for the year. How much should we be assuming that, that steps up as a result of this?","Frank T. Connor","Yes, it probably steps up about $10 million if the share price stays in and around these levels.","Operator","And our next question is from Jason Gursky with Citigroup.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about this DoD contract structure that you talked about on the UAS. Is that something unique? And how did this come about?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, I think this is a trend that you're going to see more of in this sort of a fee-for-service, so particularly these UAV vehicles, how much ISR is required and where is it required both by, in this case, the Navy and Marine Corps is one program and SOCOM being the other program, where instead of having the military tie up a certain number of systems, they're looking for the industry to provide those systems and actually own and operate those systems and be able to deploy as required. So I think it's trying to create -- at least, it's a tool they're looking at and a technique they're looking at, I think, to create a more dynamic, more capital efficient way of utilizing these kinds of assets. So instead of tying it up within the 4 structure in one particular location, by having those resources and that capital owned by the industry, they can simply issue task orders and deploy them as required in a much more capital efficient structure. I think that's the intent. And of course, the difference for us is, I think ultimately from a profitability standpoint, we'll do quite well on this, but it does require that we have that capital because then we're the ones that can turn around and respond to what their needs are and allocate those same resources in different locations at different times over a period of 3 to 5 years.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. Okay, that's helpful. And then Frank, you've mentioned that the guidance holistically stays in place. I'm wondering, given the results of this quarter, whether you wouldn't mind walking through the segment level guidance and maybe give us some puts and takes on what you're now expecting for the rest of the year.","Frank T. Connor","Yes, well, we're really the same in terms of that segment level guidance as we've -- there are puts and takes in and around the ranges, but generally within those ranges we're still fine with that. The one change to that being on the Finance segment, given the first quarter results, we had suggested Finance to be kind of breakeven-ish. We think that the captive business will be profitable as we had indicated in our outlook. We think that non-captive, given the performance we're seeing right now, probably is more around breakeven. So overall, we think Finance will be positive for the year versus breakeven, but otherwise, kind of we're in the same ranges on the segments.","Douglas R. Wilburne","And then Jason, just to add to that, I think that when you think of the holistic picture there, Frank mentioned that corporate expense is going to be up a bit, we're looking at a higher share count given the share price as well. So all in, it still comes out into the same range as we're sitting here today.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Strauss with UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Back to the margin question at Cessna, you compared it to Q1 of last year. But if you look at it compared to Q2 of last year where deliveries were pretty similar overall but your mix was actually a little bit better this year. Last -- in Q2 last year, you were able to generate a profit. Could you maybe just compare this quarter, the moving pieces this quarter versus Q2 of last year where the deliveries were pretty similar?","Scott C. Donnelly","Yes, I think if you looked at the comparison, and we've obviously done that, David, just to understand sort of the moving parts here, I mean, you're right. We had a few fewer Mustangs than we had back in that quarter. There are some other mix issues pushing around there in terms of just the mix of the different models of aircraft that was -- that worked against us a little bit. But look, there's also some pricing that is still difficult in the marketplace out there. I think ultimately, we got to push to get that better, but it has not been favorable over the past year, so we took a bit of a hit on pricing. And I think really one of the bigger issues here is at the volumes that we're running and the cost structure we have, the numbers are such that things that would normally be sort of lost in the noise around LIFO adjustments and accrual for some severances in our Citation, you get down to sort of a laundry list of numbers that are frankly all relatively small numbers, but when you're talking about small numbers of absolute margin, they make a difference. So I guess, the bottom line is a little bit of unfavorable mix in the numbers of jet deliveries, continued pricing pressure and a bit of one-timers in there that normally I don't think would be something that would move the needle very much that in this environment is making a difference.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So R&D wasn't a major factor?","Scott C. Donnelly","It wasn't a huge factor. I mean, again, you get into this saying, well, look, our R&D, absolute spending can go up, but we also had some stuff we wrote off in the quarter which went back to 2011. So at least, in that kind of a causal, if you look between those 2 quarters, not a major factor.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And as a follow-up, moving to Bell on the commercial side, 429 deliveries were a lot lower than where I thought they would come in. Talk about what's going on there, and have you gotten the certification for the 500-mile-range increase in the U.S. yet?","Scott C. Donnelly","So 429, there's no change in terms of our expectation in 429 deliveries this year. There's a bit of timing in there just because of where they're laying in the year, so you're right, there was only a couple in the quarter, but there's no fundamental change in what we're expecting in terms of 429. That's part of the issue that's a pressure for us, obviously, in the next 3 quarters, is we'll see significant increases in things like the 429 models. The regulation issue, that's 500 pounds of capacity, which has gotten through and been approved by the Canadians. It is in with the FAA right now. I feel pretty good about it, and I think it's something that will happen in the fairly near term","Operator","And our next question comes from Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So kind of moving back to Cessna, could you tell us where is the level of any abnormal preowned losses or forfeiture gains, and maybe give us some color -- the trend in demand and pricing as we went through the quarter. I mean, do we enter the second quarter with any appreciable change, or is it kind of really the same throughout the quarter?","Scott C. Donnelly","I think it's about the same throughout the quarter, Cai, in terms of pricing environment. In terms of the used market, I would say, it continues for the most part to be pretty stable. I mean, we're talking about fairly small numbers in terms of things like write-downs and forfeiture deposits. These numbers have become sort of a couple million here, fairly inconsequential numbers, so fairly significant. I would say, continued stability and when you look at our used available for sale of our kind of in-production models, they're getting lower and lower, right? They're down in the 5%, 6%, 7% of the fleet kind of numbers. So that piece of the market in terms of competition for new orders, which is part of what makes pricing tough when you've got relatively new aircraft out there, does continue to get smaller, but it's not gone.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then to the first question, the preowned losses or forfeiture gains, were they much of a factor?","Frank T. Connor","They are low -- very low single digits and largely offset each other.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, one of your competitors, Hawker, has asked for -- has a forbearance agreement with its lenders currently. If Hawker were to go into bankruptcy, would you be interested in pursuing any or all of that operation?","Scott C. Donnelly","I guess, Cai, I would say that we keep an eye on that like most people, and there are certainly some assets there that we think would be very interesting.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes. So just firstly on Cessna, I mean, it sounded like from the volume outlook, at least, you are more positive in terms of order trends, what you've seen in Q1. If you could talk a little bit about maybe anything on, by region, what you're seeing and then also the effect that, that might have had on your sort of updated assumptions for things like R&D and CapEx. I mean, I think for overall Textron, you talked 3 months ago about R&D up $110 million, CapEx up about -- to about $450 million. Have you sort of changed any of those outlooks given what's happening with demand in Cessna and in Bell commercial?","Scott C. Donnelly","No. I think, Julian, everything's very consistent with our plan. Obviously, the new product programs at Cessna, driven large part right now with the M2 and the Ten are in-flight test programs. The Latitude, obviously, is in its early stages of detailed design. The 525, as we announced, is also a program now that's in its early stages of detail design. So the CapEx associated with those programs, again primarily around tooling, which is really what's driving most of our CapEx budget there and the R&D numbers that we kind of guided to are all completely within what we expect them to be for the year. So there is no change. And again, in terms of the market, I think if you look at what's going on in the orders and level of customer activity at Cessna, it's where we expected it to be. So I still feel pretty confident about what we are thinking in terms of the total volume of deliveries for the year. And the same is true with Bell. The market's been strong, the backlog is there, the level of activity and order rate is where we expected it so that we should ultimately have the commercial deliveries fall in line with our guidance.","Frank T. Connor","Yes, I'd just add, the only thing that -- on the CapEx side that puts a little pressure on our CapEx number to the upside are these wins at systems. And depending on the volume ultimately of the task orders that are let, the amount of equipment that we would look to field this year. But we don't think that, that's a big number, but that kind of does have some impact on the CapEx number.","Scott C. Donnelly","Right. The only differentiator there is those are revenue-generating numbers as opposed to what we traditionally think of as CapEx, right, which is around the tooling and our infrastructure. Those are assets that would be required to go perform those contracts.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Sure. And then just a quick follow-up on systems. I mean obviously you had -- in Q4, you had a charge around severance relating to the cost base and so on. You've had a decent sort of revenue drop here, but it sounds like the full year outlook is still flattish. How do you feel about the cost base in systems when you're looking out this year or thereafter? I mean, do you think you've done enough on the costs for the time being given that Q1 was, it sounds like, as you expected?","Scott C. Donnelly","Yes, I think, again, it's pretty consistent with our expectations. When we announced the restructuring and we looked at the costs and in particular, for the most part employees affected by that, where we thought we needed resources and where we thought we needed to do restructuring given the current environment, really remains unchanged. I mean, the reality is for some of these programs, particularly for these fee-for-service, where we actually will be adding resources to go execute those programs. But those are different people in a different skill set than those who've been affected by the restructuring. So again, Julian, I think, pretty consistent with what our expectations were going into the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro","At Bell, can you tell us what the commercial aftermarket and military aftermarket growth rates were?","Frank T. Connor","Yes. We did see some growth there that -- those are not numbers that kind of we break out separately, but we are seeing growth in those areas -- and on the commercial side, it's at rates that are lower than what we've seen at Cessna, but we are seeing growth.","George Shapiro","Still double-digit numbers or below that?","Frank T. Connor","We don't kind of -- we don't break those numbers out separately.","George Shapiro","Okay. And then one, Scott, maybe if you could give a little more color on the JV with AVIC. I mean, you were talking about potentially a larger cabin jet. I mean, is this something in the Columbus category or even bigger, and if you could give some specifics about timing and development.","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, the timing, George -- as you know, the joint venture kind of goes through a few phases here. We started out by putting a completion center capability in Chengdu so that we can deliver basically a green aircraft out of Wichita and do all of our customizations interior completions, paint, finish and all that for delivery into China out of our Chengdu operation. Ultimately, we'll do some additional manufacturing work in the location and greater levels of assembly around the Sovereign and ultimately, longer term, around the Latitude. The new development program, which I think really, ultimately, will be sort of a highlight of this whole activity, is one where we really start the definition and kind of market research of what's the right product for the market as part of the formation of the JV. So that's usually a year or 2 activity when we look at most of our aircraft to really decide what are the right specifications, how do you really do the concept work and define the right product. Certainly, our expectation is that this is going to be a larger, longer-range aircraft than anything else that's in our portfolio, and that's why this is something that makes an awful lot of sense, both for us and for AVIC to invest in. There is no comparative analysis, I would say, against something like a Columbus -- it's not really working from the Columbus baseline . It's really working from what's the right thing given this timing and our current position in the market and, frankly, other things we've done in our portfolio. So I think any specific discussions or disclosures of technical specifications is probably a couple years downstream.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Scott, I was wondering if you could comment on the market share situation, to follow up from Cai's question whether the issues at Hawker have had any impact on your market share and also with regard to your comment on pricing.","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, I think the -- you've had historically 4 guys really working pretty hard at most of that market, 5 if you include some of the bits of Gulfstream and even Dassault to some degree at this point. But I think if you look at the market right now, and I'm sure you'll see this as it comes out through the industry data, is that no doubt you're going to see loss of share in the jet business at Hawker Beechcraft and I think that, that share is sort of dispersing itself between Cessna and Embraer and Learjet. I think, understandably, it's pretty hard to have a serious discussion with the customer about buying a $10 million, $15 million , $20 million asset if there's uncertainty about who's going to be there to support that aircraft. I mean, I don't think this is a secret, right? I mean, guys that are buying aircraft are -- buying the aircraft is just the beginning, right? I mean these are very long-life assets, and the support and have the manufacturer behind it is an important part of a purchase decision. And I think it's probably giving them a fair bit of difficulty right now given their financial situation. So I can't tell you or wouldn't guess at this particular point where that share is going, but I would suspect that it's moving amongst the other few big OEMs in those markets.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just a follow-up on the pricing issue. I was wondering what your assumptions are for pricing at Cessna through the rest of this year. Are you assuming they stay pretty flat or that they improve?","Scott C. Donnelly","I think it's going to -- it will vary probably a little bit from model to model and region to region. But we would like to think that as we bring new orders in place at this stage of the game that we're going to try to figure out how to drive pricing back up, but that's going to be a difficult fight on a deal-to-deal basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Just a couple follow-up, a lot of ground covered already. First, just back to the, I believe, the first question that Heidi asked. Scott, I think she was talking about aftermarket, but it sounded like you were kind of talking about contribution margins a little bit. Can you just clarify your comments on what to expect for contribution margins on Cessna? Were you trying to get at that?","Scott C. Donnelly","Yes, I think if you look at -- well, I mean, we're not going to -- I don't think we've ever talked about contribution margins on aftermarket or whatever, I guess maybe I misunderstood it. I think if you look at our guidance for the year at Cessna, you get incremental margins on the additional volume year-over-year of around 18-or-so percent. Now in the first quarter, those incremental margins were considerably higher than that versus the first quarter of 2011. But I don't think that the incremental margins that we saw year-over-year in the first quarter are going to sustain that high. I think we ultimately will be around where we guided, which is about an 18% incremental margin on that additional volume.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Okay. I just wanted to clarify that because that was the same number as the aftermarket growth, and it just sounded like there was some apples and oranges in that.","Scott C. Donnelly","And it could be, Jeff, I'm sorry about that.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","No problem. And Frank, can you just give us a little more color on kind of how to think about cash flow? You have this big use and other assets and liabilities in the quarter and some working capital pressure beyond that. What's going on there? And how does that play over the balance of the year?","Frank T. Connor","Yes. There's not anything unusual in the first quarter. First quarter is always a significantly negative cash quarter for us. There was some inventory build, there's receivables build, there was some timing and -- in terms of payments from customers and things like that, particularly on the military side, that can tend to be lumpy. So it was negative. It was a little worse than the prior year. If you go back 2 years, it was kind of pretty much in line with what we did in the 2010 first quarter and consistent with generally how we had planned the thing. And again, we believe for the year, we'll be in the $700 million, $750 million cash flow range, just as we had talked about in our guidance.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","And then just on Cessna orders, Scott, I think you said Q1 was better than the first 3 quarters of last year, but maybe that's a little bit of kind of the small numbers on small numbers we've been kind of talking about. But can you give us some sense on where book-to-bill was and how you expect book-to-bill to play out into the second quarter?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, I think you're right. I mean, it's growth over a small number, but it is growth. So we feel pretty good about that. I think on a book-to-bill basis, you're at like 0.75, right, if you looked at just the -- break out the first quarter numbers. But again, I think that what we've guided, our expectation in terms of what we saw in the order flow in the first quarter, what the customer prospect looks like, that we still feel pretty confident that we're going to see the kind of order flow through the course of the year that we need to get to the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, I was hoping to go back to the China JV for a second. And Scott, if you could talk about some of the coproduction platforms that you would think about moving over there and whether -- and how much that would help demand towards the end of this year, if not into 2013.","Scott C. Donnelly","I think by the time the -- we're doing the finalization right now, kind of the Ts and Cs of getting the joint venture itself, formed. We do have to go through the Chinese business license process, which can take a number of months. So we're trying to work towards a target where all these things will be lined up and ready to go at the end of the year. Obviously, we're already working on putting together the requirements in terms of what we have to do for a facility from a completion center capability in Chengdu so that as soon as we get all the licenses in place, we're ready to get all that stuff rolling and capitalize the business, but I don't think you're going to see any kind of impact really in 2012. I think maybe till late 2013, you'll start to see some flow in local deliveries. Now we already have Chinese deliveries, and I will continue to have Chinese deliveries anyway, but at a relatively small number through '12 and '13. But I think this really is something that will start to have an impact in '13 and become more material in '14 and on.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And as you look into '13, Embraer coming out with the Legacy 500, what kind of demand impact do you think that will -- or erosion potential impact that will have on your higher end of your line up, Sovereign in particular?","Scott C. Donnelly","That's kind of a difficult question to answer right now. I mean, obviously, there's things that we have going on. Latitude is a good example, where you look at customers that are looking for the larger cabin and that really addresses more specifically the 450, and I think gives us a much better aircraft, much better performance in that space and, obviously, there's some other things that we have going on that would, I think, address well what will happen in the space that represents the 500, which is obviously a bigger, considerably larger aircraft than a Sovereign, at a considerably higher price point than Sovereign.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Levenson from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Stephen E. Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","On Textron Systems, you talked about the fee-for-service business for the UAS. And can you discuss what the margins are relative to an outright sale and where you think the additional opportunities might come from?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, I think the -- you wouldn't expect in a government environment to be able to negotiate a very different profit margin on what's expected versus what you would do if you were just selling these assets. I would say that the upside to this thing is that if the utilization ends up being higher, and we are good at utilizing the capital behind these things and the demand is greater, that, that represents upside to us. So I think on an apples-to-apples basis, you would expect pretty similar levels of profitability for the base case. And if we're able to more effectively use -- utilize the capital and there's a demand that allows us to do that, that I would say we would have upside.","Stephen E. Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the other opportunities are...","Scott C. Donnelly","Just higher-level utilization, additional task orders.","Stephen E. Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Not necessarily from other customers though?","Scott C. Donnelly","It can also be other customers, right? I mean, these assets are spoken for on sort of a task-order basis, and so it certainly can give us the opportunity, again, depending on what the demand is on these particular contracts can you also utilize those assets on other contracts over time, which could be with other customers as well.","Stephen E. Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And again, I'm sorry, domestics such as customs and border patrol, or more likely a European customer, for example.","Scott C. Donnelly","All of the above. I think this is a -- we're sort of in an interesting point right now. This is sort of the beginning of this kind of a concept, right, and so I guess, that's why I say when I think it could lead other opportunities, I think about all those kinds of applications. There's stuff within sort of civil applications like border patrols, monitoring of national or emergency areas or disaster areas. There's a lot foreign military applications, so I mean, obviously we'll be taking this model and trying to utilize it on a pretty broad range of applications.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I've just got a couple of questions for you, maybe just a quick accounting one. When you look at Textron Financial, what provisions were taken during the quarter?","Frank T. Connor","$4 million, Ron.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, $4 million. Okay, that's great. And then kind of switching gears to the Chinese JV, how do you think about protecting intellectual property when you go into something like that?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, I think it's pretty easy for us, Ron. I mean, people talk a lot about intellectual property protection, and I think if you're a consumer goods kind of guy, you probably rightfully should worry about that a lot. On the other hand, I think as you get into some more sophisticated technology, there are sort of national protections. I think when you look at China in particular, I think it bears some understanding. Chinese are also very brand conscious, right? So if you look at -- I think what we're doing is much more akin to what's happened in the automotive market than a lot of other industries, where the Western companies that went in and set up joint ventures with the government and did local manufacturing and really had a footprint in the country are the ones that not only enjoyed the growth of that market and helped make the market, but are still the brands and the products that dominate that market today. You go to China, whether it's Shanghai, Beijing or the smaller cities, it's VWs and Audis and Buicks. I mean, these are the guys that were first movers, and they still have very powerful brand presence. People make a lot about sort of the knockoff car companies, the reality is they haven't done all that well. You don't see very many of those. I think when you look at our business in the aviation space, it's even further sort of down that continuum, if you will. And that if you're in the country and you're finishing your final assembly on Sovereigns, you're not going to see a company down the street all of a sudden and pop out with a Sovereign lookalike. You can't -- aviation is a global industry. You have to have certifications, you have to have the FAA and the CAC. So if anybody is going to try to take our intellectual property and do a knockoff of our products, that's going to be a very, very, very public thing. You're not going to all of a sudden see these things on the market for sale. It's years and years of development, a very, very difficult certification process. So I frankly think that people are, in our case, in our industry, our kind of product, our -- this is not an issue to worry about. And frankly, I think you're much, much better off being in the market and participating in the market than thinking you can avoid that market and somehow not worry about IT by taking that strategy. I mean, you're more susceptible to having intellectual property issues if you're not there and participating in the market.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Interesting. I guess what the counterargument would be is what happened to some of the rail companies over there, correct?","Scott C. Donnelly","I'm sorry, to who?","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Like Siemens and some of the other companies when they were doing high-speed rail.","Scott C. Donnelly","Yes, and I've heard of some of that, but again, I think when you think about all the certification requirements, and again, people buy aircraft and fly them around the world. There's not a local market or a specific local project, it really has to be a global product.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes. And then maybe just one last question for one of you guys, there's been a lot of discussion on the call both from you guys and from other analysts about pricing. Doesn't it imply, I mean, if pricing is still soft, that there's just too much supply on the market, that either on the used end or on the new end, that there's just too much supply, and that's why we're not seeing pricing get better? That really the only way we'll see pricing get better is we just need less supply somehow.","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, I -- there's absolutely no question there's a supply and demand issue going on here and part of that supply includes those used aircraft. And so I think if you look at sort of competition in the marketplace, that's exactly the dynamic that you have going on. And so everybody -- I don't think anybody wants to short the market, right, as things start to come back, so everybody is doing what we're doing, you're trying to understand what -- where you think the market's going and you're trying to build to a forecast because you can't do it month to month, you've got a fairly long-lead assets here. But I think what we -- we would love pricing to get better tomorrow, I would love pricing to be better yesterday, but I think we are where we are in the cycle. I think the used, as it starts to wind down in, particularly on the stuff that's still in production kind of aircraft, will help get that supply demand back into balance, but you still have at least 3, really 4 competitors out there that are all trying to make sure that they keep their position in the market. So as demand comes back and it is getting stronger, you'll start to see that switch just like it has in -- every time you go through these cycles.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Have any M2 or Latitude orders in the quarter?","Scott C. Donnelly","Yes.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Any numbers?","Scott C. Donnelly","No. But, Steve, I just -- just to put some color, they're not overwhelming numbers, okay? I mean, we're in a position here still in the market where people aren't -- you don't see lots of people lining up that want to place orders for aircraft that aren't going to deliver until 2015, okay? So yes, there are some, there are certainly people that want to be sort of first in line for the aircraft and love the airplane and want to do that. Obviously, we have more entry-level buyers and some current Mustang guys who are already thinking about their step-up and then looking at an M2 and saying, \"That's where I want to go.\" Some of them have gotten to the point where they're putting money down and saying, \"Yes, I want one of the first units.\" But there's not a panic yet in the market of people saying, \"Geez, if I don't put an order in here real quick, I won't be able to get an airplane.\"","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right, right. And then you guys aren't going to give kind of your sold-out position for next year?","Scott C. Donnelly","No. That we're definitely not going to do.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Since there are no questions on Industrial, just I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that. Just given the growth you've seen in the first quarter, if you're going to have flattish sales, is there any part of that, that you're expecting or worried about weakening as we go through the year?","Scott C. Donnelly","The part I still worry the most about is around the automotive build. I think the first quarter is always strong in the automotive industry, I mean, just the way that cycle tends to work, and it was pretty strong. It was a little softer in Europe, which we expected, but it was also considerably stronger in North America, actually even a little bit stronger than we would have expected. Asia was stronger, but not as strong probably as we would have liked. So I would say in terms of how the quarter went, we're happy with what we saw in terms of volume and the health in the industry. But I'd say we remain still a little concerned about what's going on in the -- what will happen over the course of the year, particularly in the European automotive market. And we have a significant share over there, right? It's about 40% of our automotive business.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then just on that topic, is Kautex, do they use this nylon, that seems was in the papers today about shortages in their fuel systems? And how does that play out?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, so they do. All of the major suppliers of full-molded tanks use the, I think it was PA12 was what you're referring to. So there was an explosion at a plant in Germany that manufacturers that material system. So it's too early to say exactly what's going to happen. I mean, it certainly has the potential to have an impact. They represent a significant source of supply for that particular material so there's -- all I can tell you is there's active discussions underway with our customers about material systems, alternate material systems, sort of how to manage and sort of bridge our way through that, given what has been sort of a key supplier that has had a real problem. And that's not unique to us, by the way. I mean, that's material that feeds into everybody that makes this kind of a tank.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss from UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","As a follow-up, I think it's Cessna, I don't think you've talked about regionally. Could you comment, Scott, specifically on North America, what you're seeing? And is North America, if you look specifically at the North America book-to-bill, is that above kind of the Cessna average?","Scott C. Donnelly","So I'm sorry I haven't done a book-to-bill on a per region basis, but I would say that the U.S. continues to be healthy, but I would say as we've gone into the year, we've seen some strengthening internationally as well. So I mean we're looking at order book that comes about, I mean I think over the course of the year and what we certainly see indicative in the first quarter, it's going to look more like a 60% international kind of a number as opposed to last year, which was more like a 30% and 70% U.S.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro","Yes, just following up on David's question, Scott, how about demand-wise, you're seeing more for your bigger planes versus the smaller ones?","Scott C. Donnelly","George, the mix continues to be, in terms of the order rates, favorable. So we're seeing sort of stronger demand in the CJ4 and up than say the Mustangs. And again, that's kind of consistent with what we saw in the latter part of last year and what our forecast is based around for this year.","George Shapiro","And then, did you give or will you give how much R&D change from last year at Cessna?","Scott C. Donnelly","Not on a by-business basis, George. But in terms of how you guys think about it, the only thing I would say is that we've talked increased dollars, still putting some pressure probably this year around percent of sales, but our expectation is that even though we'll continue to increase the dollars going forward, that we would start to lose that headwind in terms of percent of sales on R&D.","Douglas R. Wilburne","It appears now that we've exhausted all the questions and follow-ups. So thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for joining us, and we'll talk with you soon.

Welcome to the Textron Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. And at this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the conference over to your host, Vice President at Investor Relations, Mr. Eric Salander. Please go ahead.","Eric Salander","Thanks, Gregg, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to mention, we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release.","On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO, and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our Web site.","Textron's revenues in the quarter were $3.3 billion, up $59 million from last year's third quarter. Net income in the third quarter was $0.95 per share, compared to $0.61 per share of adjusted net income in the prior year. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions totaled $181 million, compared to $259 million in last year's third quarter.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Donnelly","Thanks Eric, and good morning, everybody. Revenues were up in the quarter primarily driven by Textron Aviation and Industrial. Segment profit margin was up 140 basis points as we continue to see strong execution across our businesses. Bell revenues were up in the quarter largely due to commercial deliveries of our 407 and 429 aircraft. Year-to-date orders of these models are ahead of last year's rate and we look forward to continue higher deliveries of these popular platforms as we continue to ramp production to align with customer demand.","In the quarter, our Bell 407 GXI received IFR certification from the FAA. Bell has proposed the new 407 GXI as its entry from the Navy's advance advanced helicopter training systems program where an award decision is expected later this year.","Moving to the military side. The Czech Republic announced their intent to acquire our mixed fleet of eight Bill UH-1Y utility and four Bell AH1- Z attack helicopters as part of a total transaction estimated at $620 million. This is one of several foreign military opportunities for the AH-1 platform that we're continuing to pursue. ","Within the future vertical lift, we recently unveiled a full-scale model of the new Bell 360 Invictus Rotorcraft, our entrant in the future attack reconnaissance aircraft program at the US Army's AUSA annual meeting. The Bell 360 Invictus combines new technologies validated on our 525 commercial helicopters with unique characteristics to deliver the US Army an affordable, agile and lethal solution to win on the more modern battlefield.","At systems revenues were down on lower armored vehicle deliveries at Textron marine land systems. In a quarter Textron systems was among three companies down selected by the US Army to deliver prototypes for the next phase of the next-generation squad weapon program. Also in the quarter, our ship-to-shore connector craft 100 successfully completed builders' trials will now be followed by Navy acceptance trials.","Within unmanned, our fee for service product line captured over $50 million of new wins in the quarter for the Aerosonde platform. Earlier this week at AUSA, we unveiled the Ripsaw M5 as Textron systems offered to the US Army's robotic combat vehicle program. ","Moving to industrial, revenues were higher primarily reflecting improved pricing at Textron specialized vehicles. Specialized vehicles, we saw continued favorable performance from a cost reduction and manufacturing realignment actions we initiated in the fourth quarter of last year. Also in the quarter, we continue to onboard Bass Pro and Capella stores as well independent track marine dealers and have seen steady retail volume growth through this channel.","Moving to Textron aviation, revenues were up from hired jet and aftermarket volumes, partially offset by lower defense volume. In the quarter, we delivered 45 jets, up from 41 last year and 39 commercial turboprops down from 43 last year. Looking at commercial turboprops, we saw a pickup and order activity sequentially as well as compared to the third quarter of last year. In late September, we received FAA certification of the all-new Citation Longitude and began customer deliveries in the first week of October.","We're really excited to have this innovative aircraft in the hands of our customers and expect this platform to drive revenue growth and margin expansion in the future. Overall, aviation had a solid quarter with mid-single digit revenue growth. ","Coming into the year, we had planned for higher growth in our legacy jet models with commercial turboprops about flat. Year-to-date, legacy jet volume is running ahead of last year with 135 deliveries compared to 125 with commercial turboprops tracking to plan. As it will occur in the remainder of the year and in light of some uncertainty in the marketplace, we're adjusting our outlook for legacy aircraft sales and now expect Q4 deliveries excluding longitude to be about flat with last year. With respect to longitude, we started customer deliveries and expect to continue those through the current quarter. Although, we've seen some deliveries pushing next year to allow for require aircraft modifications related a certification that was granted at the very end of the quarter.","We've also experienced some delays in defense order activity and volume compared to original plan, all of which have been reflected in our revised full-year guidance for 2019. With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank.","Frank Connor","Thank you, Scott. And good morning, everyone. Segment profit in the quarter was $297 million, up $52 million from the third quarter of 2018, with segment profit margin of 9.1%, up 140 basis points from a year ago.","Let's review how each of the segments contributed starting with Textron Aviation. Revenues at Textron Aviation of $1.2 billion were up $68 million from last year's third quarter, primarily due to higher jet and aftermarket volumes, partially offset by lower defense volume. Segment profit was $104 million in the third quarter, $5 million from a year ago due to the higher volume and mix and favorable performance, partially offset by higher net inflation.","Textron Aviation backlog at the end of the third quarter was $1.9 billion. Bell revenues were $783 million, up $13 million from last year on higher commercial revenues, partially offset by lower military volume. Bell delivered 42 commercial helicopters in the quarter compared to 43 last year. The segment profit of $110 million was down $3 million from a year ago, primarily due to an unfavorable impact from performance which included lower net favorable program adjustments, partially offset by higher volume and mix. Bell backlog at the end of the third quarter was $5.6 billion.","Revenues at Textron Systems were $311 million, down $41 million from last year, primarily reflecting lower armored vehicle volume at Textron Marine & Land Systems. Segment profit of $31 million was up $2 million from last year's third quarter. Textron Systems backlog at the end of the third quarter was $1.4 billion.","Industrial revenues of $950 increased $20 million from a year ago, largely related to a favorable impact from pricing within the Textron specialized vehicles product line. Segment profit was $46 million from the third quarter of 2018, largely due to favorable performance and a favorable impact from net pricing primarily related to the specialized vehicle product line. Finance segment revenues were down $1 million and profit was up $2 million from last year's third quarter.","Moving below segment profit, corporate expenses were $17 million and interest expense was $39 million in the quarter. We also repurchased 2.3 million shares at an overall cost of $109 million. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 9.3 million shares returning $470 million in cash to shareholders.","To wrap up with guidance, we are narrowing our expected full-year earnings per share to a range of $3.70 and $3.80. This includes revised tax guidance and an effective rate of 17% for the full year. We are revising our outlook for manufacturing tax flow before pension contributions to a range of $600 million to $700 million largely reflecting higher ending inventories at Textron Aviation. That concludes our prepared remarks. Gregg, we can open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Your first question comes from the line of Sheila Kah from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","SheilaKah","Hi. Good morning and thank you for the time. I wanted to talk about how tax and your decision to put out strategic alternatives for the business. You've talked about not selling it for as long as I've known you. Kind of what's changed and what are you thinking about them here?","ScottDonnelly","FrankConnor","Well, Sheila, I there's obviously we get a fair bit of feedback from investors as to the fit of a tier 1 automotive business in a company that is otherwise kind of an end market product, highly engineered sort of a business. And we've been paying attention to that. We think that we do a pretty good analysis every year to make sure that nothing in portfolio is holding back our stock from some of the per se standpoint. And we've obviously seen a disconnect in that over the last year or so. And given that and the feedback that we get we thought it was appropriate to at least explore what it would look like and what alternatives there might be for Kautex. And so that's why we announced that we were launching that process.","SheilaKah","Got it. Thank you. And then, Frank, on just a free cash flow, working capital has been in hindrance here. Kind of how do we think about that ramp? How much is pushed out given the longitudes and working capital into 2020?","FrankConnor","Yes. Again, we're going to see we think some higher inventory levels at Aviation given kind of the outlook on the legacy models as Scott discussed and a little bit of longitude, the $100 million reflects that working capital growth will liquidate a lot of inventory here in the fourth quarter. But we think some will get pushed into early next year. ","ScottDonnelly","So, Sheila, there's several pieces of that as Frank said, we will have a few longitudes just the mods of the aircraft which are trivial from a technical and production standpoint. But are kind of invasive and we're rolling each aircraft through that based on these last-minute changes, means a few aircraft that we've had in our plan will probably move into next year. They'll still be a bunch of longitude deliveries in the quarter obviously. We have a military customer for whom we built T6s that originally was planned to take delivery this year has asked to take that delivery next year, which again that's fine but it does put some obviously some inventory. And as we've said all year, if we see any softness we're going to align and trade volume versus having to drive price to get there.","So with sort of the dynamic we're seeing in the marketplace, we'd rather back off on that number and obviously there's some penalty to us and carrying some of the inventory in the next year. But I'd rather do that than try to push more volume into a market if it's if it shows any signs of softness.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Textron. Please go ahead.","CaivonRumohr","Thank you. I didn't know I joined --","ScottDonnelly","Welcome to board, Kai.","CaivonRumohr","Yes. So to follow up on Sheila's question, if you sell Kautex it looks like it's quite dilutive and then if you're going to look at selling that part of industrial wouldn't you also sell the more troubled part specialty vehicle, so ultimately I think the question becomes, Scott, what is Textron going to be in three to five years?","ScottDonnelly","Well, Cai, obviously, we haven't made had any commentary on the vehicle business. As you know, the vehicle business historically for us has been a good business. It had good growth. It generates good margins and cash. I think obviously we went through some issues last year, which we've been working harder to get turned back around. I think it's heading absolutely in the right direction. And in a business that has a lot of potential for us in terms of growth and strong performance. And it is like the rest of our businesses one where product matters, investing and having a better product than the other guy is how you win in the market. And those are the kind of businesses we like.","CaivonRumohr","Got it. Thank you. And then so, Frank, if we look at Industrial, the margins looked like they were weaker than I thought and you keep on talking about the better pricing in specialty vehicles. Was Kautex down significantly?","FrankConnor","No. Kautex was fine. I mean, we -- this is the pricing obviously was relative to the third quarter of last year which was a really tough quarter at GSP. And so we made considerable progress in terms of kind of no longer discounting in the marketplace and having a more appropriate distribution strategy and pricing. Therefore pricing strategy but Kautex perform well, Kautex was kind of flat at the revenue line. And saw better kind of margins year-over-year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","SethSeifman","Thanks very much and good morning. Scott, I just wanted to follow-up on some of the weakness that you mentioned in the business jet end market. I think the commentary made suggest that excluding longitude deliveries will be down about 10 units year-on-year in the fourth quarter. And is there a particular set of models that's affecting more a particular geographical area or customer set that's driving that?","ScottDonnelly","So, Seth, on the fourth quarter we would expect again ex longitude to be fairly flat from 2018. So we're not expecting it to be down but the market knobs you order activity has been obviously there's sort of an implied book-to-bill Bill here about one in Q3. So it's not horrible market, but I mean we do see some softness as we saw sort of in the latter part of Q2. We saw again the latter part of Q3 just uncertainty in the Indian market and some customers who have been in discussions and clearly intend to buy new aircraft, debating do I do it now, do I wait.","And again I think we would rather take prudent action and not go out and try to use price to incentivize those transactions to happen. They're going to move in the next year then they move in the next year. But there's no reason after all the work we've done to try to get pricing back to a healthy level that we should compromise that. But, yes, it's-- I think we're talking about a flat market on in terms of legacy deliveries not one that's down. We're up, we're 10 units on non longitude so far year-to-date. So that's where we're comparing right, it's not that we're giving those 10 back. We just expected to be flat on a quarter-over- quarter basis, year-over-year basis, I'm sorry.","SethSeifman","Okay. So year-on-year then you'll be up 10? You're up 10 year-to-date and if you are flat, okay--","ScottDonnelly","Yes. That's right. Now sorry for the confusion. It's not down, it's a flat on a year-over-year basis on a quarter.","SethSeifman","In the fourth quarter?","ScottDonnelly","Correct.","SethSeifman","Okay. Great. Thanks. And then just as a quick follow-up in terms of thinking about Kautex proceeds that come in. There's obviously potential do share buyback. There's also I think about a $1 billion a debt coming due in the next two years. So how do you think about those proceeds in light of the --also in light of whatever target leverage level you have?","ScottDonnelly","Well, look, I think our balance sheet while it's somewhat under levered at this point, we'll have to make a decision at that point how much you think is appropriate on the share buyback. And then obviously some debt retirement would go in line with that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Baird. Please go ahead.","PeterArment","Yes. Thanks. Good morning, Scott, Frank. Hey, Scott, just to follow up I guess on Seth's question lastly on Kautex. Can you maybe just provide a little color? Is there since you've made the announcement have you seen interest in what historically has been a very good business for you?","ScottDonnelly","Look, I -- we can't give a whole lot of commentary. I mean, obviously, the process is fairly early on. Goldman has been running that process for us. There's been a lot of NDA's. There have been a lot of management meetings with prospective interested folks. But it's fairly early on in that process.","PeterArment","Okay. I appreciate that. And then just quickly on the 360 Invictus unveiling. Maybe you could just give us some commentary what the feedback you've heard already since that announcements come out kind of leveraging 525 and what advantages you think you'll have there?","ScottDonnelly","Sure. Right. I was at AUSA all day on Monday. So we had the opportunity with our teams to interact with a lot of folks from the customer community. I'd say the interest level is pretty high. They're intrigued with what we've done. Obviously, the army has seen this for a while when we submitted our proposals and are under contract is at this point as well as a number of others for the first phase of that program, which is kind of aiming towards a down selecting. And I think probably March of next year to go down to the two that will then go build flyable aircraft. ","But I think the positive -- the reaction is very positive. I mean and clearly this is great technology. It's not in some were procreated as well this is older technology, absolutely not. I mean this is-- the way that you get the speed and the agility from this craft leverages a huge investment that we made obviously on the 525 front and scaling that rotor technology and fly-by-wire technology into the Invictus. So their performance numbers meet or exceed the customer's requirements. And we think we can do it very cost-effectively. And as I said, the risk in terms of the entrance of the technology has been validated already with a lot of flying on the 525. ","So I think the response was very positive. But what we'll see where this falls out obviously the down select is next March and we're hoping to be one of the two that gets to proceed into the fly out phase.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski from Alembic. Please go ahead.","PeteSkibitski","Yes. Good morning, guys. Scott, I want to ask you just kind of lessons learned from the longitude certification. Anything you guys are taken away from future design or documentation or process efforts that would lead you to think that maybe the next certification effort won't be so painful? And another hand I think about this issue that the FAA is going through with Boeing. Is this going to maybe make things going for more painful for everybody? Just want to get your thoughts on all that.","ScottDonnelly","Well, Pete, I think there's a lot to learn from this both on our part and interactions with the FAA. I think this is a pretty extraordinary case. The reality here is that we had a new process, frankly one that we did not understand very well and which was evolving and sort of changing. And the reality is we had an aircraft that was essentially designed and built for the total scope of the process was understood. And so we ended up having to do a lot of work to conform what we had done which is a very safe, fantastic aircraft to this new process. ","And the scope of the changes was not material but they were painful to have to go through and make the mods and the changes and understand this new documentation process. And the analysis and what that drove in most cases didn't actually impact the aircraft, but in several critical cases it did. And so again, the aircraft we end up with today through certification is not wildly different than and fundamentally different than what we had already designed and built. But there were several critical areas that in order to gain the certification work our way through that process required changes that were painful. And so, look, I think as we go forward we now first of all understand that process very well.","The aircraft that are in our pipeline I'm going to start with SkyCourier that's next on deck. Obviously, this is a part 23 aircraft not a part 25 aircraft. So the process is much different. Obviously, we've done lot our 23 aircraft in the past. So I think we understand and have been working very close with the FAA in a very collaborative way to make sure that we lay out what is the process and what how do we get from here to there on certification of that aircraft.","So I think we're in a much better place in terms of understanding of the process, interaction work with the FAA. And again, this is a part 23 aircraft as it Denali. So it's something that's much more familiar to us and I would certainly expect it to go much smoother than the process that we went through on longitude. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please go ahead,","GeorgeShapiro","Yes. Good morning. Scott, you commented in the release that the net inflation was higher in aviation. What's happened since the last three or four quarters we've been seeing you ahead of that?","ScottDonnelly","Well, what happened, George, is I mean we do have inflation and unfortunately price was pretty flat. But we didn't have price to offset that inflation. And generally speaking we should. And look as part of our looking at the market and the dynamic and saying that we're going to be cautious about the volume side of this thing because we need to be netting price inflation obviously. Now there was a lot of performance in aviation and a lot of good execution that helped to offset some of that disconnect between price and inflation. But we need to be, I mean, I'm not suggesting we are going to continue to get big price increases, but we certainly can't get price up. And we really saw price flattened in the quarter.","GeorgeShapiro","So is that continuing to the fourth quarter or no?","ScottDonnelly","Well, we'll see, right. I mean, I think clearly from a volume standpoint what we're saying we're going to back off a little bit on our plan on volume to continue to maintain and not give up on the price front. Obviously, we got to continue to do work offset inflation.","GeorgeShapiro","And, Scott, you talked about the market weakening some into September. Did it continue into October and where was the strength? Because normally you've said July and August are pretty weak?","ScottDonnelly","So, George, I would say that when you looked at the level of activity with customers has been bumpy. It's been that way through the whole year, right. I mean a turboprop is a great example when you look at for instance Q2 to Q3. Q2 was very light in turboprops and we had a fair number concerns and what should we do on volume and Q3 we had a lot of order activity in turboprops. So it literally is --when you have a market that has uncertainty in it, that's kind of something we did see high-level activities and things softened out a little bit. So it kind of comes and goes. And that's why we'll keep an eye on it as we work through the quarter.","GeorgeShapiro","And then one last one. In industrial, you said that Kautex did quite well, so that would imply to me that special vehicles perform worse than in the second quarter. Is that a correct statement?","ScottDonnelly","Well, George -- ","FrankConnor","No. We -- I mean we don't disclose things at that level, George. But my comment was that Kautex did on a year-over-year basis, Kautex did -- kind of improved margins Q 2018 to 2019.","GeorgeShapiro","Okay. And then let me get one last one. How much was aftermarket after you'd comment release?","ScottDonnelly","In aviation?","GeorgeShapiro","Right.","ScottDonnelly","About 7%.","GeorgeShapiro","Okay. And you've been running kind of flat or down a little bit but that was due to 606 or maybe you've overlapped that. Is that's what's happening?","ScottDonnelly","No. I think on the Aviation side, George, the first half of the year was a little lighter than we expected. It kind of stabilized more in the second quarter. And again we saw the 7% increase in Q3. So again whether there are deferrals, what was going on, but I mean it started out a little bit lighter but obviously it's 7% in Q3 was a pretty strong quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rajeev Lalwani from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","RajeevLalwani","Hi, good morning. Just two relatively quick questions. Scott, can you provide a little more color on your comments into the fourth quarter on the aviation side? Just different parts of the market and how they're doing? Whether it's turboprop or going to the upper end of the business side for you on longitude? So just some broader color there. And the second question is just higher level, Scott, do you think in order to get aviation margins back to where they used to be you simply need a recovery in the end market? Do you think consolidation may be necessary just given how fragmented the overall market is?","ScottDonnelly","Well, so first of all this commentary on the quarter again. I think we've seen this thing moving around a little bit in terms of strengths and weakness and in the end market through the course of the year or should I say the order activity, right? I mean you've see turboprops kind of softened, turboprops are pretty strong. Jet again for a month to month is moving around. I don't think there is a certainly not a collapse in the market, it's just a question of is it a stronger market and can you deliver more volume than you delivered last year.","And I think we've been sort of when the non-longitude has been exceeding at from last year a little bit. We think it'll be more flat in Q4. Longitude at the high-end, the demand and the interest in that aircraft continues to be very strong. Obviously, we're in a good position in terms of the units that we have on the book. And we just got to get deliveries rolling as we go through the quarter and in the next year. So I think we feel good about where that aircraft is in terms of its interest in the marketplace. But like you say like I said, we're seeing is kind of flattish at this point. And we've talked to you about the fact that given where the market is mostly legacy probably is kind of flat.","I mean that we need to control our own destiny in terms of growth by putting new products out there and longitude obviously is a big example that. SkyCourier behind that, Denali behind that we need to make sure that we're making the right investments to continue to grow our business even in a flattish market. Sometimes the market is going to be better, sometimes it's not going to be better, but we got to manage and whatever that market is.","So we're continuing to drive the margin performance of the business. We expect certainly to see dilution associated with these early aircraft, particularly in light of the rework that we're having to put into them. But in terms of learning curves and the productivity in the cost line, I think we're in a good place with that. But we need to get through this rework phase of getting these aircraft modern and getting him into the field. Again, from a technical standpoint it's not a big deal, but it's fairly invasive just in terms of the amount of touch labor that we have to put in to make those mods.","So I think margins will continue to track in the right direction. Obviously, volume and a strong end market is only helpful to us. As to is there opportunity for consolidation, look, I think everybody would tell you given the nature of how this market has been for the last decade or so that they're probably still are too many guys and too many products and in some of these crowded spaces. We think we've been performing very well and gaining share in these areas. We continue to invest in the right products. I know if there's consolidation opportunities and we'll see how that plays out over time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss from Barclays. Please go ahead.","DavidStrauss","Thanks. Good morning. Scott, following up on that on the longitude. When the longitude got certified we saw a very aggressive quick ramp. You had big backlogs with NetJets there. You had big backlog of NetJets on the longitude. How should we think about that program ramping? And has NetJets firmed up any additional options since the airplane was actually certified?","ScottDonnelly","Longitudes for NetJets as we do with latitudes, we work with NetJets and kind of have sort of a one-year horizon as we looked at what comes in to the order book. So we don't put, as you know, we do not have that big longitude order with NetJets in our backlog until it firms up, which is again roughly, you'd would be looking at about 12-months is the horizon that they do their planning and we work together to move those in to kind of firm backlog. So like they're --the absolute numbers obviously are not going to be as high on a longitude is they were on latitude. That's a smaller piece of the market but I think that the ramp obviously will, we will see a significant ramp here in Q4. And we'll see that continue to ramp through 2020.","DavidStrauss","Okay and from an inventory perspective on longitude. I mean given the airplane was delayed 12 to 18 months or certification was delayed 12 to 18 months. I mean can you give us any sort of sense how much kind of excess inventory or inventory- your extra inventory you're carrying on longitudes given that it's kind of delayed?","ScottDonnelly","Well, I mean wouldn't give you absolute number, David, as long as we said I think as you look at our revision to our cash guidance for the year that is inventory aviation and several aircraft that will have been in our plan with our original guide are going to move into 2020. I mean these are aircraft for which they're sold. This is just a matter of our ability to make these mods and incorporate the mods and get them delivered to a customer. So I think just given the limited amount of time we're going to see several of those move into 2020 that would have originally been in our 2019 plan. So you combine that. You combine a few T6s that were expected to be delivered this year. That drives the bulk of that change to our cash guidance.","It is inventory at aviation, but again these are largely aircraft that are sold aircraft or ordered aircraft deposited aircraft that are simply going to turn into deliveries in 2020.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Raviv from Citi. Please go ahead.","JonRaviv","Hey, good morning, guys. So just on biz jets once again. Just last year around this time we talked about tweaking some like you see rates up, sounds like we're tweaking down right now fully understand that. Would it though be fair to expect the legacy jet deliveries to perhaps be down in 2020, if we just run rate 4Q, 2019 or is it still too early to say? And can you improve legacy jet margin if volumes are down?","ScottDonnelly","I would say it's a long way till 2020, right. So I mean we still have NBAA coming up. We got another full two and a half months. So I think again as we said the deliveries we would expect in the quarter would be flat on a year-over-year basis. That's our view of how we finish 2019. It's way too early for us to be guiding what we think 2020 is going to look like. But, obviously, we will be working that over the next few months. And as always adjust our production run rate accordingly.","JonRaviv","Thanks, Scott. And then follow up on the Industrial segment. Can you just give -- I understand you don't guide by segment within industrial, but margins didn't seem to get that pick up in 3Q that perhaps some of us had expected with the restructuring efforts going through. How do you see that industrial segment margin pacing out over the rest of the year into next year?","ScottDonnelly","I think they're pretty in line with what we expected given our year-over-year changes in terms of the inventory levels. And not needing to do the kind of rebating that impacted us in 2018. The discipline around inventory management is on track with what we said we were going to go do. The volume increased, channel development it's going on both in the old Arctic Cat channel as well as the tracker channel is going well. We had a very successful launch of kind of our business model around snow with Snowmageddon. The vast majority of that was delivered obviously in Q3.","We built what was pre-ordered. So from our perspective the margins and the performance of the business are in line with what we expected in our plan. So it's not a one-year turnaround to get to where we want to be. There's more improvement coming, absolutely, but I think we're on track that's where we want to be.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","RobertSpingarn","Hey, Good morning. I just wanted to ask with the fading of the longitude how we think about margins in aviation in Q4 and beyond? How will that learning curve factor in?","ScottDonnelly","For Q4 the longitudes obviously as we've talked about all along we're going to have a significant dilution to our overall margin rates as those coming to the market. And again, the early units combined with labor that we're putting into to incorporate the modifications again are not material from what is the aircraft, but it's a fairly labor-intensive invasive process are going to cause us dilution. So I think we will certainly see that. In Q4, we've accounted for all that in the guidance that we've put out. And clearly as we go into 2020 you get to where you're now running aircraft, they're just coming through our production lines, productivity, which is good, our cost position which is good. so we'll see those margins become stronger as we work our way into 2020.","RobertSpingarn","Okay and then just separately on the helicopter side. With FARA, I guess coming in the spring what is the trajectory of the military if you're not part of that down select?","ScottDonnelly","Well, there's two big pieces of development, I shouldn't say just two , there -- the Bell military story is more complicated than that, right. I mean I think we continue to sustain the multi-year three rates on non V-22 which is where we are. I think we're seeing a significant uptick in after-market because those fleets both on B-22 and H1 continue to grow. Obviously, FMS is important. We just saw the announcement of being selected in the Czech Republic. There are several additional FMS in case that is out there. I think you've probably seen publicly the Israelis have now requested formally a P&A on the B-22, which is encouraging.","Obviously, we've started deliveries on the Navy for their CMV 22s. I think there's potential to see that and that grow over time which is -- which would be very good for the business. So I think we have a pretty good plan in place to sustain where we are on the military side of Bell. The long term, big upside is around FARA and obviously around FARA which is the V-280. And the good news is both those programs seem to be moving out very well with the army. As I said, we already are under contract on FARA. We'll see that down select I think next March. And on the V-280, as you know, the Army has come out and made a pretty significant move to the left in terms of their dates from 2035 to 2030. I think there's potential for that to accelerate further.","But at this point they expect to put people under contract again in the early part of next year to do to start their official process. It would be under contract. They're saying it's probably 19- months processed and then award in the MD contract or the selected winner .And I think our V-280 is in a great position, obviously, that's an army decision that's got to be made. But I think we have clear line-of-sight to compete and hopefully win what would be a very large program on the V-285 front. So those are the future obviously and they are terrific programs. But I think we have a pretty good plan in place to sustain that military business in both B-22 and H1 and after market to bridge that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","NoahPoponak","Hey, good morning, everyone. Scott, when you're talking to the team at Cessna or talking to customers directly, is it possible to kind of hone in on what your customer set was enthused about in the world order in their business earlier in the year and what has some concern today? Is it just total broad macro or stock market, if you get a trade deal, does that help your business or folks going to now want to wait till the 2020 election passes to act? Any help you can provide there?","ScottDonnelly","Noah, I think, I don't think it'll be a surprise that when you talk to customers and they look at uncertainty. You got trade deals, you got Brexit. Most of these guys can't feel good watching the political stuff that's going on in DC. I mean it's just, it creates a lot of uncertainty. And look, I think we see this reflected in business confidence numbers, right. In the surveys and we weren't -- we're not economist here, but we read all those numbers as well. And it's understandable that a lot of businesses particularly small midsize guys which is our big part of our customer base are in many cases deferring CapEx and investments in their business via business jets or otherwise just because of uncertainties.","And obviously the trade kind of things and the Brexit things and the prospects. I mean I think concern over a administration that's anti businesses is one that makes people pause.","NoahPoponak","Yes. Okay. On the cash flow change, the longitude inventory builds makes total sense, but that the cash flow guidance before today's change, I think would have had the free cash to net income conversion a little bit below 100% and it's kind of been below 100%, five of the last six years or so. And there's been a negative change in working capital. Can you guys help us better understand why that is? Is it percentage of completion accounting somewhere in the business or what's driving that? And do you get to that -- do you get to a better conversion rate going forward?","ScottDonnelly","So, look, we talked about a number of additional issues. Obviously, the build that we've had it at Aviation around the longitude coming in clearly has been a drag. We've had a similar situation with 525 going on in Bell. Yes for sure there has been change on the military side from a cash flow -- from performance base to the 606 and how you roll the cash versus the cost kind of revenue recognition. So those things are all contributors. I don't know, I'm not probably prepared to go back into a five-year look at it but -- ","FrankConnor","Yes. I mean certainly not analyzing all five years as Scott said. But most recently particularly this year in addition to the aviation stuff that we're talking about, we've highlighted kind of what's going on at Bell, which is a significant difference from a cash timing standpoint in revenue and profit recognition relative to cash where we were kind of ahead on cash, if you will. And now we're reverting to being more in line as we close out multi year or two. So that's been the kind of the big drag in terms of conversion this year away from the aviation inventory issue.","NoahPoponak","Should we -- what kind of drag or lack thereof from that accounting perspective should we expect in 2020-2021?","ScottDonnelly","That will have washed itself out as we close out multiyear two here, so you shouldn't expect that.","NoahPoponak","Got it and then if I could just sneak one more in on Ripsaw that you displayed at AUSA for RCB, I was curious if you could talk about your decision to partner with FLIR? And to have the new unmanned offerings that they've recently acquired as part of that vehicle?","ScottDonnelly","I'm not sure I would go into a whole lot more detail than what we've talked about at the show. And what we have on display. Obviously, FLIR, I think when you look at the --obviously, we acquired Howe & Howe because we felt they had some fabulous technology in terms of the vehicle, which I think shows itself in both SMET and now the RCB programs. FLIR has been a terrific partner in terms of bringing their technology to that platform. Obviously, the technology that we've brought really which has its roots in our Hunt Valley and then aircraft business. The intersection of that stuff is really I think brought out a terrific vehicle with a great sensor partner in FLIR and obviously our organic technology around the control capability.","So I don't know that I would go into much more than that. I think it's been really well received. It's a spectacular vehicle and obviously one that we're looking forward to competing for some of these future army programs.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ronald Epstein from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead .","CaitlinDullanty","Hi. Guys. This is Caitlin Dullanty on for Ron. Textron Systems was down 12% year-over-year this quarter and you mentioned that Aviation saw weaker military volumes. Can you expand on what areas and programs will provide growth in defense for you guys in a short to mid term? Did anything new come from AUSA this week?","ScottDonnelly","Well on the system side, obviously, we're sort of the year-over-year change is the end of the TAPV program and the ANA programs which are all vehicle programs. In terms of the rest of that business look like it's in pretty good shape. Obviously, as we go into 2020 and beyond now the big change in the marine and land systems business is ship-to-shore connector moving from a developmental program into a production program.","We're in detailed negotiations with a customer at this point on the FY 2017, 2018, 2019 as I said, we've passed our builder files. We're getting ready to go through the Navy acceptance trials. By the way earlier this week, we flew craft 101 which is the second one. It did its first time on the water and ran flawlessly for over six hours and accomplished an awful lot out of the test card. So in terms of the, I think we feel very good about that program which has been a challenging developmental program transitioning now into the balance of those units.","And obviously in the production contracts. So that is a big turnaround for the business as we go into 2020. On the defense side at Aviation, again T-6 has been, that's -- it's mostly foreign military sales. These things always take time. Again, we -- it's a little bit problematic this year that we had a delay in the light attack program. Obviously, something at this time a year ago was going to start early in 2019. We're still being assured by the customer this program is going to happen. Obviously from budgeting and funding standpoint in Congress, it's fully supported.","So we expect and are being told this is now going to be a 2020 activity. That sort of deferred that from 2019 into 2020 versus our plan. And again we have a customer that was already on the books, but just for budget reasons whatever that moved into 2020. So there's a lot of -- there's not one big program in aviation. These are tending to be a number of smaller FMS driven programs. You saw we just were notified to Congress on Tunisia, which again is a nice T-6 program, but one that will -- in all likelihood probably have deliveries in 2021, but which would starting to production next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","RobertStallard","Thanks so much. Good morning. Scott, on the Biz jet front, and I'm not sure you get on to this but you never go. What are you seeing from the competition? Are they matching what you're doing in terms of discipline on price and volume? Or is that making your life more difficult?","ScottDonnelly","Well, Rob, I'd say, well, Rob, as always say it makes our life more difficult, but like this is every deal is a competitive deal. And I think again our share is based on the products we're put in front of customers. We absolutely as we look at things like longitude feel like we've got a better product in the market than our competitors do. We get great feedback from customers that look at the aircraft. They fly the aircraft to take demos in the aircraft. And I think we see those convert to sales. And I do believe that today we see a premium on the pricing on that because it's a better aircraft\/","RobertStallard","Are you seeing similar sort of dynamics on some of your older models as well?","ScottDonnelly","Yes. I mean but I don't know that it's very different than it's been for the last few years, Robert. It's -- I mean be it competition M2s and CJ's and XLS and Embraer, obviously, it's-- I don't think there's a big difference in the dynamic that we're seeing in most of that -- most of those segments of the market which again we've been driving prices over the last couple years successfully. And I think we want to make sure that we continue to do that.","RobertStallard","Okay. And then secondly on Kautex, and what could happen there historically been very reluctant to make any disposals, if they are diluted to earning. So is it pretty big change here? Are there any other parts of the portfolio where you think there is this disconnects between what's reflected in the share price and what people think of the business is? ","ScottDonnelly","I don't think so.","RobertStallard","So this is a one-off thing, Kautex?","ScottDonnelly","No, look, Robert, as we said it's -- it is arguably a different business model, right, at Tier 1 automotive is different than engineering and manufacturing and selling and servicing in products. And that's the difference in that model. It's a good business. It's been a successful business for us. But it's one that warranted at least understanding what options there might be.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Melius Research. Please go ahead.","CarterCopeland","Hey, guys. Thanks. Just a couple of quick clarifications. One, Scott with respect to the longitudes and rework roughly how many aircraft we talk about here? Is it a handful? Less than that, slightly more than that. And then, Frank, just I wondered if you could give us some insight in what the --if there was a favorable net EAC impact in systems? Thanks.","ScottDonnelly","Carter, I don't -- we don't go into specific unit numbers. We haven't forecast specific number of deliveries. So I'm not sure to go into that number. Obviously, it's a finite number. The aircraft had been produced and we'll get this behind us here in the quarter. So it shouldn't. obviously will not extend beyond that.","FrankConnor","Yes and in terms of the EAC, as you know, we don't break that out by segments. There was for the total companies the net program adjustments was $21 million in the quarter. But we don't break that out between where that resides.","CarterCopeland","Okay and just maybe to get out in another way, Scott, just to try to bound that the outcome here were-- was it a limited finite number of aircrafts in construction that had to go back to rework or was it all of them pre cert?","ScottDonnelly","I mean it's all of them, right. I mean you have to bring them all up to the same configuration. So all of the aircraft are going through the same process in terms of the mods. And these mods, by the way, Carter, as I said, it's wiring for some changes. So hey guys we got to go through multiple channels or different connectors. It's not a big deal. But it is kind of invasive right to get at that.","CarterCopeland","Yes. Its' a lot of work. ","ScottDonnelly","And so it's --you wouldn't see any difference in the aircraft. There's no performance difference in the aircraft. Their customer, there's no change to the aircraft. It's largely to do with some of these redundancies and things that we just had to make these really technically minor modifications. But there --they are in basic, but again yes you'll have that behind.","CarterCopeland","It's well understood work scope, it's just tedious.","ScottDonnelly","It's tedious.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss from Barclays. Please go ahead.","DavidStrauss","Thanks. Thanks for taking the follow up. So you talked a little bit about this on B-22. Can you talk to us exactly when you're going to be through all the way through multiyear II and completely onto multi year III? And how is that transition going and how do you feel about the Bell margin profile as you get close to being pulling on multiyear III?","ScottDonnelly","Well, I think the last delivery is probably in the late Q1 or in the beginning of Q2 next year. And I remember under the accounting that most of the revenue is complete. So from a margin standpoint, no, look I think the margin and the productivity we continue to drive a multiyear III is -- it's going to take a little time to get to multiyear II. Obviously, the big difference which again we've seen a lot of this year is that the program adjustments are lower than they were a year ago because of the reaching in a multiyear II and the reductions in management reserve and so forth so. ","But most of that we're seeing as we go from 2018 into 2019 but there'll be some further into 2020. I'm not sure I can give you a lot more on, nothing we want to get in a margin rates pipe specific contract at this point. But like all multiyear, you had some pretty good productivity and efficiency and we're working on that now as we've started to roll the multiyear III aircraft. I mean a lot of that revenue this year is multiyear III aircraft because it's on the cost to cost basis. ","DavidStrauss","Right, okay. And, Frank, with interest rates down a fair amount year-over-year at least based on where we are today, any thoughts on pension for next year? I think you're booking pension income currently and contribution. And then also on corporate, corporate and the tax rate burning I think a fair amount lower than what you originally projected. Are those kinds of numbers carrying through in the 2020?","FrankConnor","So on the pension, obviously, kind of we'll see how things ultimately play out from a rate standpoint kind of 50 basis points of discount rate is about $31 million. About pension expense, that's disclosed in our 10-k and so well we haven't kind of obviously run those all those numbers yet as we looked at corporate. Kind of for this year we're probably maybe 10-ish million below our original guide of 140, we're probably looking at 130 that obviously depends on share prices that impacts corporate expense.","I wouldn't expect any kind of significant change to those types of ranges as we look at next year. But we haven't gone through all those budgeting exercises yet.","DavidStrauss","And tax rate for next year?","FrankConnor","Tax rate kind of we've had some discrete items this year that got us to 17. We're probably in the 20-ish percent type area, we will continue to have some items as we kind of look forward that are a slight benefit to rate versus kind of a lower 20s area that we had talked about. So maybe 20-ish percent type area.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.","GeorgeShapiro","Yes. Just a couple of quick ones. Frank, earlier in the year you said that systems revenues for the year would be about $1.4 billion, certainly doesn't look like we're going to get there. What's kind of a new number for the year?","FrankConnor","We're running around to that level maybe a little slightly less than that level, but not a significant change from that level. Systems, it's going to do better on a margin standpoint and kind of maybe just a little short of that $1.4 billion from a revenue standpoint, but it's in that area.","ScottDonnelly","The revenues should be very close to what we thought, George, and the performance in the business has been very good from a margin standpoint. So I think it'll actually exceed our guidance on --for sure it will exceed our guidance on an upside and should be pretty much in line of the revenue side.","GeorgeShapiro","Does that imply a big jump to like $470 million or so in the fourth quarter? And what's going to drive that from what was like $311 million this quarter?","ScottDonnelly","I don't know, George. I never heard that. I mean your numbers are roughly, right. It's probably going to be north of 400 to do the math, but it's-- I mean we're not going to get into program by program deliveries, but that's what's in our plan and our latest forecast. As Frank said, it's probably going to be a little wider than 1.4 but not dramatically and the margin end performance is very strong. And I think we continue to feel very good about opportunities and the wins on new programs and selections are obviously more to come, but I think we're in a pretty good place.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Raviv from Citi. Please go ahead. ","JonRaviv","Hey, thanks. On the longitude, I think for waiting for the certification for a while. What does certification and entering the service mean for actually selling the plane? Can you talk a little bit about your backlog and pipeline, whether it's fractional versus individual versus corporate? And does the pricing in that backlog support the margin plan?","ScottDonnelly","Look, as I don't -- I mean we're not going -- I don't think we're going to go into dissecting the backlog. I think we have a good backlog on longitude. It's -- it has certainly some fractional with NetJets who's a great partner. We expect to see a lot of success of that platform much as we saw with latitude in that class, but also we have a lot of retail customers as we said all along is are lined up for the aircraft as well. So the pricing has been where we expected it to be, the costs are where we expect it to be. Again, we have this issue of getting through the already built aircraft and making the mods which is a problem, but yes we'll just as we finally got sort of behind us we'll get that activities behind us here in the fourth quarter.","And I think we have a great outlook on both the success of the product and the profitability of the product going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen. Please go ahead. ","CaivonRumohr","Just a quick follow-up. So obviously with interest rates down close to a 100 bps you're talking $50 million -$60 million non cash headwind. Any thoughts about switching to mark-to-market?","ScottDonnelly","I don't know if we had comment on that yet, Cai. I mean certainly we've seen some other companies do that and it's something our team will look at just as I'm sure many companies are. Right, your math is probably about, right. I'm sure you're.","End of Q&A","Eric Salander","Okay. Gregg. I think that does it for the call. And if there are any follow-up questions, I can be reached today, tomorrow, next week, so that's it.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Textron First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Doug Wilburne, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Douglas R. Wilburne","Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to mention we'll be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release.","On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.","Moving now to first quarter results, starting with Slide #3. Revenues in the quarter were $2.9 billion, approximately flat with the year ago. Income from continuing operations was $0.40 per share compared to earnings per share of $0.41 in the first quarter of 2012. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was a $425 million use of cash. First quarter pension contributions were $140 million.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott C. Donnelly","Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everybody. Manufacturing revenues were up slightly in the quarter based on strong commercial demand of Bell, increased deliveries of Textron Systems and sales growth at E-Z-GO. Unfortunately, demand for business jets was soft again this quarter. We were hopeful that demand would recover as the impact of last year's election and fiscal uncertainties were behind us. We also thought the recent strength in U.S. equity markets would have supported improved business confidence and therefore, business jet demand.","Sales dialogue and customer recruit was reasonably active during the quarter. However, customers, especially in the light jet segment, who tend to be small business owners, continue to defer purchase decisions, reflecting continued concerns about their financial outlook. As a result, we delivered 32 new jets in the quarter, down from 38 a year ago, resulting in a segment loss in the quarter of $8 million. On the positive side, we continue to see good volume in the used market, leading to a significant increase in used jet sales, which resulted in higher overall Cessna revenue despite lower new deliveries.","Looking forward, given the lack of recovery in the business jet market, we're reducing our 2013 business jet delivery outlook and now expect that deliveries will be down this year compared to 2012. This reflects our expectations for lower deliveries in the light category, partially offset by growth in the midsized category. Accordingly, we're adjusting our production schedules and implementing other appropriate cost actions at Cessna. In addition, we've initiated a salary workforce reduction program, the largest portion of which is a voluntary separation plan.","While we are taking these immediate actions, we believe the global business market has significant long-term growth potential, and we remain committed to our new product plans, which include the introduction of the M2 and the new Sovereign and Citation X models later this year, as well as Latitude in 2015 and the Longitude in 2017.","Moving now to our finance segments. Slowness in the business jet market resulted in only a few new loan originations during the quarter. However, segment profit benefited from good performance in our captive portfolio and a number of small asset transactions in our non-captive business. Shifting to industrial. We saw lower volumes in the quarter at Caltex as growth in North America was more than offset by weakness in both the European and Asian automotive markets. Greenlee and Jacobsen were down slightly, reflecting weakness in European markets, while E-Z-GO saw good growth, reflecting the success of new product introductions. Moving to systems. Revenues were up, reflecting growth in our UAS and weapons and sensor product lines. We continue to see operational improvement in our fee-for-service UAS programs, but as previously discussed, these are essentially break-even programs for us at this time. Finishing with Bell, operational results reflected good program execution in both military and commercial product lines. We did experience a decline in aftermarket deliveries during the quarter. This a result of the conversion to a new ERP system. I would note that the underlying aftermarket order flow actually remained quite strong.","The global commercial original equipment demand environment also remained strong as we delivered 40 commercial helicopters in the first quarter versus 30 in last year's first quarter. We also had a very good showing at this year's Heli-Expo, announcing 2 new products, the Bell 412 EPI and the Bell 407 GT. The new 412 EPI includes a fully integrated glass flight deck and 1,400-pound increase in maximum hot and high payload capacity. These are significant enhancements to the value of what is already one of Bell's most versatile and reliable helicopters, and the customer response, so far, has been very positive. Likewise, the new Bell 407 GT, which is an armed version of the 407GX, incorporates an integrated glass cockpit and a fully configurable weapon system. We believe the GT will be an effective and affordable platform for foreign military and paramilitary applications.","We also featured our new Relentless 525 flight simulator at HAI, demonstrating the steady progress we're making toward first flight next year. Overall, we had a very successful show, capped by the signing of 50 new commercial orders, including an agreement with Air Medical Group to deliver 30 helicopters over the next several years. During the quarter, the 429 model continued to add jurisdictions certifying a 500-pound increase in useful load. The most recent came from Indonesia, an important and growing helicopter market, making it the 17th country to approve the increased maximum gross weight.","In the military business, we delivered 9 V-22s and 6 H-1s in the quarter, consistent with our customers' quarterly delivery schedules but down slightly compared to 10 V-22s and 7 H-1s in last year's first quarter. We are on track to deliver 40 V-22s and 25 H-1s in total this year. We also delivered our 100th H-1, marking an important milestone toward fulfilling the total program record of 349 units. We also delivered the first HMX V-22 units, which will serve presidential and other special missions.","And finally, at last week's Army Aviation Association of America meeting in Fort Worth, we introduced the V280 Valor as our entry to the Army's request for joint multi-role future vertical lift aircraft. The Valor concept is a third-generation tiltrotor, featuring a fixed engine configuration with a target cruise speed of 280 knots and a combat range of up to 800 nautical miles. We believe this platform will prove to be the highest performance, most cost-effective solution to the Army's future mission requirements.","To wrap up, despite a challenging first quarter, most of our businesses were on track for a solid year, with the notable exception of Cessna, which necessitated a change in our operational plans and our overall outlook. On this basis, we're reducing our guidance for earnings per share from continuing operations to a range of $1.90 to $2.10. We're also lowering projected cash flow from continuing operations of the manufacturing group before pension contributions to about $400 million as a result of the lower expected Citation deliveries. We remain focused on continuing to improve our operational execution and cost productivity, while, at the same time, we're also committed to continue our investments in new products and sales capabilities to grow the business over the long term.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank.","Frank T. Connor","Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Segment profit in the quarter was $235 million, down $24 million from the first quarter of 2012 on approximately flat revenues. Let's look at how each of the segments contributed, starting with Cessna. At Cessna, revenues were up $39 million from this period last year, primarily the result of $81 million increase in preowned aircraft sales. We also had an $18 million or about 9% increase in aftermarket revenues. The segment had a loss of $8 million compared to a loss of $6 million a year ago. This reflected lower new jet deliveries and pricing, including the impact of selling our 5 remaining legacy Sovereigns and higher pension cost, partially offset by an improvement in mix. Looking to the second quarter, keep in mind that there will be no new Sovereign or X deliveries, and we expect to record costs of about $25 million for the workforce action that Scott discussed.","At Bell, revenues were down $45 million on decreased V-22 and H-1 deliveries and lower commercial aftermarket sales, partially offset by increased commercial unit sales. Segment profit decreased $16 million from the first quarter in 2012, primarily reflecting the lower overall volumes. At Textron Systems, revenues were up $52 million, reflecting higher UAS and weapons volumes. Segment profit increased $3 million.","Industrial revenues decreased $28 million, reflecting lower automotive volumes and a $4 million negative foreign exchange impact. Segment profit decreased $16 million, mainly due to lower volumes and unfavorable mix.","Moving to Finance. Revenues decreased $19 million from last year's first quarter, reflecting lower finance receivables, while segment profit was up $7 million. Credit performance remained relatively steady during the quarter with non-accruals of $147 million and 60-day delinquencies of $80 million.","Lastly, moving to corporate items. Corporate expenses were $55 million, and we remain on track for our full year forecast of about $160 million. Interest expense was $37 million, up $2 million from a year ago. On the tax line, our rate reflected benefits primarily related to the impact of the reenacted U.S. R&D tax credit. We're still on track for our original full year tax guidance of 29%.","Moving to our consolidated cash flows, which is the last schedule attached to our press release. We ended the quarter with $791 million in consolidated cash, down $622 million from the end of the fourth quarter. The drawdown in cash in the quarter reflected a net reduction in debt of $236 million; inventory increases, primarily at Bell; $140 million in contributions to our pension plans; slower payments on military contracts; and seasonal incentive compensation payments. During the second quarter, we will retire $250 million principal amount remaining on our convert at the Textron level, and we have $371 million scheduled debt repayments at TFC.","That concludes our prepared remarks. So Brad, we can open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go to our first question from Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Scott, I was wondering if you'd kick off with Cessna. Last quarter, you commented that there had been a pickup in used activity and also used pricing. Now it seems used activity has continued in Q1. I was wondering if you could clarify how the used pricing has progressed.","Scott C. Donnelly","Rob, I'd say the pricing has been pretty flat. I mean, the market is -- definitely continued to be strong in terms of the number of transactions. Obviously, you see that in our numbers this quarter, as we've sold a lot of aircraft. I think the market -- the used market in total continues to move. I think that's representative. We've seen a little bit of a tick-down again in terms of used available for sale. But I would say, we still see it as pretty challenged in terms of the pricing itself there in the used market.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, secondly, on Cessna, you said it's going to be down this year in terms of new deliveries. I was wondering if you could give us an idea of just about how much it's going to be down.","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, look, I mean, we try to stay away from exact numbers on this, Rob. But I think when you look at how we would guide, we're probably talking about a couple of hundred million dollars or so on the top line. It's mostly in the light jet markets. So I'd say from there, you can kind of probably make reasonable estimations in terms of the number of aircraft that we're talking about cutting back. And that's really kind of our revised forecast, as much as we hate doing this. And by the way, we're still out there selling hard. I mean, we're going to do everything we can do to sell aircraft. We're pretty happy, I think, with the effectiveness of what our sales teams are doing. I think our share feels good. But we just have to be open about the fact that, that light market just hasn't recovered at this point, contrary to our expectations. And so we're going to scale back some of the production and reduce the number of aircraft that are out there in that space because I think the demand just isn't there.","Operator","And our next question is going to come from Carter Copeland with Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a quick question on the reduction in the cash flow guidance, which you said was attributable to the lower Citation deliveries. Does that reflect a more sizable cut to your anticipated deliveries versus production? How should we think about the mismatch there and if that's really just inventory that will build up over the course of the year?","Scott C. Donnelly","Yes, it just really is inventory. The challenge, obviously, as we sit here at this time of the year, is to make a substantive change to the production schedule on those aircraft. An awful lot of that material is already in-house. Clearly, one of the things that we'll do as we go through the production change is we'll build things out to logical points in their build cycle so those aircraft are sort of in an appropriate stage of work in progress before we shut down various portions of the production line. And that just means we're going to have inventory, clearly, that's going to roll over to the end of the year as opposed to going out in sold aircraft.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And with respect to the Cessna margin in your previous guidance, it looks like the cost actions are worth about 1%, but you've lowered the guidance by $0.20. So if it's all related to Cessna, it sort of implies margins that are closer to breakeven. Is that correct?","Scott C. Donnelly","It's principally related -- almost all of the $0.20 is related to Cessna, that's correct.","Operator","And our next question is going to come from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Scott, I wondered if you could help me think about backlog. I know we've asked this before, and the discussion is that it's just not as important right now. But first, Cessna specifically. The Cessna backlog was actually more stable in the quarter than it's been in a while. I mean, implied dollar bookings and dollar book-to-bill was as high as it's been in a while. Can you just talk about what the moving pieces were in that backlog and how it's possible that you are kind of okay with production levels while backlog kept coming down and now that it's sort of finally seeing some stabilization that's driving the production level decrease?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, Noah, look, we've always -- first of all, if you look at backlog in the quarter, I mean, basically, what it reflects is that we're taking orders and delivering in the same quarter. So there's not a whole lot of stuff going in and out of backlog, right? You're taking an order for an aircraft and you deliver the aircraft, so there's not a whole lot of change going on in the backlog. In terms of...","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","But [indiscernible], right? And the degree to which that happened in the quarter was at least less than it's been over the past several quarters, right?","Scott C. Donnelly","I mean, that's been the mode that we've been in, right? So, I mean, we have been, obviously, building to a forecast as opposed to building a backlog for the last several years. Our initial intent as we went into this year is, given the dynamics that we saw in the marketplace, that we would start to see stronger demand than we saw in the second half of last year in terms of the lights, and we're just not seeing that manifest. So at this point, I think it's appropriate for us to say we're not seeing that volume, and we just don't see the number of customer discussions going on that we believe are going to come to closure that would justify continuing at that build rate.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I guess, I'm also wondering, is this very specifically Mustang? Because when I look at the deliveries in the quarter that was very light, whereas some of the bigger metal or a lot of the bigger metal was really kind of flat or even up year-over-year. But I know you don't make much money on those and you're lowering the margin outlook so that would imply it's not just Mustang. I know you don't to want to get specific on aircraft, but can you...","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, it's okay. I mean, when we talk about the light category, we're talking about Mustang through the CJ4. So -- and look, part of the dynamic is when you look at what's going on in the marketplace, there is obviously tighter pricing here as well, right? I mean, so I think that one of the things that we see that's becoming more and more difficult and sort of more and more difficult here in the first quarter is that in order for transactions to happen, there are expectations of lower and lower price. And I get to a point here where we're not going to play that game anymore, so we're going to take some of the capacity out of what's out there trying to transact because we're not going to do deals at price levels that people seem to think that our level is -- has to be for them to make the transaction happen.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Have some of the aircraft beyond Mustang through CJ4 been a little better than you expected or no?","Scott C. Donnelly","I don't know that they're better than we would've expected. The XLSs have been doing well. We did sell the last 5 Sovereigns that we had of the pre-block-point-change model. That, of course, is never a particularly strong pricing environment, when you're trying to get that lesser-grade aircraft. But it's -- people know they're buying the last of that model type. So I think that XLS activity was good. And obviously, there's a lot of discussion going on around the block point change for the Sovereign and some orders we're starting to take for that. So again, I -- we really do see -- the market behavior in that medium segment has been more consistent with our expectations, whereas the light side has been weaker. And again, it just seems for transactions to happen it's at a price point that I don't think we want to play.","Operator","And we'll go on to the next line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Scott, on Cessna, just one more there. What are your customers telling your sales force exactly as to why activity -- why does your sales team believe that activity did have a slower start to the year than you were expecting a couple of months ago?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, Joe, I mean, there's kind of noise all over the place, right? There's -- These are mostly small business guys, so their taxes have gone up. They read all the political nonsense, all this corporate jet loopholes, which, by the way, they mean depreciation, which I'm not sure why that's a loophole since it's actually in the tax code and always has been. You've got this new proposal on user fees, which, I think, is very unlikely that's actually going to go through. But again, it's get thrown on the table, to whack everybody $100 for every flight on top of all their existing operating costs. And people are still a little concerned about where the economy is. So -- and you also have the pressure. It ties back to commentary earlier on the used aircraft pricing. As long as the used aircraft pricing is pretty tough, that means the collateral value of their current aircraft is not as strong as they'd like it to be. So when you look at all those kind of moving pieces, it just -- it kind of leads guys to say, \"I'll wait a little while and\/or give me a lower price to help incent me to do it.\" And that's the part of the -- I think it's to say if that's really where the market is, then we'll back off on production and just accept that there's less demand out there in the marketplace.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. On the restructuring actions that you're taking, the $25 million, is that mostly labor or do you have an opportunity to take out other fixed costs besides just labor?","Scott C. Donnelly","No, the $25 million is virtually all related to severance of employee costs and obviously, as a result -- salary cost. And so as a result, that will obviously accrete back over the balance of this year into the beginning of next year in terms of lower payroll.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then...","Scott C. Donnelly","There aren't any -- there's no write-offs of equipment or things like that. It's just running at a lower rate.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. And then just finally, on the sequester, could you help size -- it doesn't look like you saw much impact in the quarter, if any. But could you help size, as we think about the Bell military aftermarket, what that business looks like for you right now in terms of size and profitability and what you think -- how you're looking at the rest of the year playing out? And if there's any thoughts on systems along the same lines.","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, sir, you're right. I mean, I think, at this point, we're seeing sequestration issues sort of on the margins, if you will. I would expect it in the aftermarket side of Bell. There will be some pressure in that area. And some of it's going to be OPTEMPO related as things continue to wind down and some of the conflicts. Although I don't see that as being a material number or something that would give us any pause in terms of either our guidance this year or frankly, our own -- our internal thoughts in terms of our long-range plans. So yes, some impact here and there, but nothing material. I think on the system side, as we talked before, the issues that -- or the areas I worry about is that we could see a little bit of impact probably around some of our UAS business and some of the programs associated with that because they are year-to-year funded. And I think it's quite conceivable that in some of those programs, there could be a slowdown of deliveries on some of the upgrade programs or refurbishment programs. There can be some things in some of our intelligence software-related businesses, where some of those agencies have taken a bit of a haircut on sequestration, and it wouldn't be surprising to see them scale back accordingly on some of their acquisitions of some of their intelligence software and upgrade products and things like that. So -- but again, I -- we don't have, at this point, any visibility whatsoever that would say that we have a major program that would be impacted by this or cancellation or anything of that nature, so I really do think that at least this year and what visibility we have in those programs as they go into the 2014 timeframe. Will there be some pressures? I think everybody will have some pressures, but they're all sort of on the margins, not a significant or major program cancellation.","Operator","And our next question is from Jason Gursky with Citi.","Jonathan Raviv","Actually, Jon Raviv in for Jason. A quick question on V-22. I was just wondering, given the recent budget of V-22 was in line, but going longer term, out to '15, what are you thinking in terms of international orders and how that impacts expected volumes when the multiyear resets in 2015.","Scott C. Donnelly","Okay. So obviously, the current multiyear is unaffected. The next, multiyear 2 [ph], which have been negotiated, it's now in the process, now the government has authority to go ahead and enter into that contract. That's working its way through the process and should be done here, I would guess, within the next 30 days or so. It goes through the normal congressional notification, and there's just timelines associated with that. But I think that will be signed here shortly. In terms of foreign opportunities, there has been no change in that regard. We have a couple of customers that are already in, I would say, detailed discussions with respect to buying V-22s. Those discussions continue to progress quite well. I wouldn't expect to see any kind of a formal announcement until you get to the point where this is something that's going to be notified to Congress. I mean, these will be FMS transactions, obviously, so they have to go through that process. But in terms of anything that's going on from a budgetary standpoint, we haven't seen any impact to bring in those deals to conclusion.","Jonathan Raviv","And then just in terms of volume in 2015, what are the sort of pluses and minuses in terms of where we might go to from like 40 [ph] this year?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, the 2015 number is unchanged and I wouldn't...","Frank T. Connor","24.","Scott C. Donnelly","Yes, it's 24, and I wouldn't expect that, frankly, at this stage, to be changed by one of these Foreign Military Sales opportunities. It's just we're getting too close to the timeline in terms of production volumes to make any kind of a material change to that. I do think it's possible in one or maybe even both cases of the deals that are sort of in the works that it's possible that our customer may allocate a couple of those aircraft to start the initial deliveries with a foreign customer. But it's too soon really to know. But I think that I would not expect to see much change to that number of 24 in 2015. So in the FMS volumes, once we get under contract, would really be added onto the volumes in the -- probably the '16, '17 timeframe.","Operator","And our next question is going to come from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro","Scott, I wanted to pursue one more with Cessna. When you announced on April 2 that you were going to have a reduction in indirect people at Cessna, you made a comment production rates are unchanged. And now 2 weeks later, they're coming down. I was just wondering if anything happened significantly in the last 2 weeks to have that change.","Scott C. Donnelly","Look, George, I would say that the conversations that Scott and I had, which, frankly, go back into March around what was going on in the business, what we were looking at in terms of market recovery and such that we really probably need to take another look at the underlying cost in the business, okay? Because even at that time, we're expecting 2012 -- '13 to be kind of flat to '12, okay? So it's not like there was an expectation of a big recovery, and we decided that we needed to take some cost out of the business to give ourselves some headroom. We don't like coming in to every quarter -- and at that time, we're trying to figure out, \"Okay, are we going to make money? Are we not going to make money?\" We decided to do some resizing of the business to make sure that even in the event of 38 jets, we made sure that we had a profitable business. And so the decision was taken at that time to do a voluntary reduction program. We have an awful lot of stuff going on at Cessna, as you guys know, right? We have a lot of new product programs. We have a lot of people working hard to do a lot of good things, and we are trying to balance getting some cost out of the business without, frankly, putting the business through a very traumatic time. And we've already gone through an awful lot of layoffs and reductions at Cessna over the last years. So we concluded to do the voluntary program, and we've put that into place, okay? So when you talk about that April 2, that's when we actually announced it to employees and kind of opened the window to the voluntary program. What happened with respect to production programs, George, is that we got to the end of the quarter, and frankly, all the way, coming up to the end of the quarter, we thought we had visibility to getting the 38 jets that we had in the plan. And we just had too much activity, particularly in the light side of the business, with customers who were talking about doing a deal, talking about doing a deal, who, again, are looking for more price at the end to close those deals. And as you can see, we ended up with 32 not 38. So we're not going to do that, and that's when we countered the decision. So look, guys, this is -- we're trying to put -- we're trying force transactions that just don't need to happen right now, and that's when we undertook the decision to go in on the light segment and make a material change to our production plans. And therefore, we need to tell you guys we made a material change to our production plans on the lights and have reset our sales targets and goals. And again, as I said earlier, it doesn't mean we're not going to be out there selling. We're continuing to grow our sales force. We're going to continue to do all those things, so we don't miss any deal. We've maintained our share. We'll continue to do that. But I think what we concluded by seeing the dynamic as we came into the end of the quarter is that the market really hasn't recovered or frankly, stayed as stable as we'd like to see and we ought to react to that by taking down on our production.","George Shapiro","Okay. And a couple more on gross book-to-bill, Scott, was that much different than slightly below 1 net book-to-bill? I mean, we've done with these older cancellations that we...","Scott C. Donnelly","Yes, there were only a couple of cancellations in there. So I mean, gross book-to-bill was actually just a bit above 1.","George Shapiro","Okay. And can you share what percentage of the deliveries for the rest of this year you might expect to come out of the current backlog versus how much yet you still need to get orders for?","Scott C. Donnelly","No, I don't think we'll...","Unknown Executive","[indiscernible]","Scott C. Donnelly","We've got the new products -- obviously, the M2s, which are in the third and fourth quarter, the Xs that are in the fourth quarter, I mean, these are orders that are already booked. So they're -- certainly, all the new models are coming out of backlog.","Douglas R. Wilburne","And we began to build some on the Sovereigns.","George Shapiro","Okay. And so we'll see no more Sovereign deliveries until the new ones because you basically stopped production and you're done with the inventory. Would the...","Scott C. Donnelly","Yes, that's correct, George. We had 5 Sovereigns that were the last 5 of that model type. All 5 of those aircraft sold in the first quarter, and so you'll start to see deliveries of block-point-changed Sovereigns in Q3.","George Shapiro","Okay. And one last point, if I might. Industrial, that was weaker than I thought. You mentioned mix. Do I assume then that, relatively speaking, China was worse than Europe? Because I thought you do better in China than you do in Europe?","Scott C. Donnelly","It was. The -- and the specific issue in China is that our strongest segment of our business in China is our manufacturing that's in China for the Japanese OEMs. And as we said at the end of last year, we saw -- well, in the last year, we saw a dramatic softening in that business as a result of some of the friction here between China and Japan. In essence, there was some boycotting of Japanese product even though it's manufactured in China, and that continued into the first quarter.","Frank T. Connor","Just to be clear, George, our results in the first quarter CapEx were not inconsistent with our expectations.","Scott C. Donnelly","We expected -- I mean, we knew, based on what was happening late last year, George, that, that -- it was very likely that the friction with respect to Japan and China would continue and affect the sales of those models in China, and it has.","Operator","And our next question is going to come from Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So a couple more questions on Cessna. Could you tell us what was the size of the preowned loss in the first quarter? Was R&D up? And give us some color on the pattern of the P&L for the year. I mean, is the second quarter likely to be in the red as a result of the $25 million charge?","Scott C. Donnelly","Oh, yes, I would absolutely say so, Cai. And again, recognizing that $25 million is something which will accrete back over the balance of the year. But absolutely, when we take the costs of making those severance payments in the second quarter, that will for sure push Cessna into the red. On top of that, we have no Sovereign sales in the quarter because we don't have any block point until the third quarter. And yes, we've had some R&D and SG&A growth. Again, we're putting more sales and resource out there on Cessna, which I think we'll need to continue to do.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then to the question of preowned losses. How large were they?","Frank T. Connor","Yes. The used, kind of net of any forfeitures, was mid-single digits, and there was a low-single digit headwind year-over-year.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And then update us -- I think you mentioned M2 in the third quarter. At one point, I thought that was going to be in the fourth. And [indiscernible]","Scott C. Donnelly","Yes, I think, Cai, you and I have communicated incorrectly multiple times on this. And I'm not sure whether you started it or I started it, but the M2 will start deliveries in the third quarter.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just the Sovereign is in Q3, early Q3. And when are we talking about the TEN?","Scott C. Donnelly","The X, by the way, we've gone back to just calling it the X because despite our best efforts, people just want to call it the X, so we've conceded that. The X will be the fourth quarter.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then you had a strong profit maybe as indicated, but the profit at TFC, how -- what was the reason there for that profit and the outlook for selling any additional markdown assets?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, there were a couple of relatively smaller transactions in the non-captive business, where we're still closing transactions, particularly in the Golf Mortgage portfolio where we have been able to close those at better values than were on the book, and so those resulted in some gains. In terms of the captive business, while there weren't a lot of originations in the quarter, the losses and provisioning and just general operation of the business was pretty solid.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then normally, you provided kind of updated sales and profit guidance for the year. I mean, can you offer any of that? You said Cessna is down a couple of hundred million in light jet sales. But any other color on any of these businesses? I mean...","Scott C. Donnelly","Yes, the only changes that we see in terms of our -- well, what led to our change in guidance, Cai, as I said, you're probably talking about a couple of hundred million dollars or so of revenue at Cessna, which will translate to a low, very low-single digit margin. And that really is the lion's share of the $0.20 reduction. So I mean, I think that math is easy to do. We probably will have and the revised guidance does reflect about a $10 million improvement in the knock that we would expect out of the Finance segment. The rest of the guidance in terms of revenue, margin rates are unchanged.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So really, the shortfall of Bell was related to the ERP issue and you expect to catch that up over the remainder of the year?","Scott C. Donnelly","Yes, absolutely. We were light on commercial spares. We shut the plant down for a week to make this transition so that put some pressure on us. But I'd actually say that the change has gone fairly well, considering big changes usually don't go well, but it's gone fairly well. But we got a little behind on a number of issues. Just kind of working our way through the bugs in the system that impacted spares, both military and commercial, but commercial probably most significantly. The demand in terms of orders on the commercial spares side actually was strong, and I would expect here, over the next couple of quarters, we will get those spares that are sort of in arrears, if you will, delivered.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And then, the last one, any change in the tax rate expectations? You mentioned corp expenses still the same. Any other changes to the P&L we should be aware of?","Scott C. Donnelly","No, we don't expect -- as Frank said, I think the year -- the total year tax rate should be in line with what we expected. Obviously, this quarter because of the full year last year of R&D tax credit, as well as this quarter of the 2013 year, it just resulted in an unusually low number. But we would expect on target for the total year.","Operator","And our next question will come from Peter Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","I guess no Cessna questions left at this point, but let me just ask another one on Bell. Could you just remind us the expected year-over-year decline in margin rate at Bell? Outside of this Q1 issue, what's driving the expected margin rate decline?","Scott C. Donnelly","Sure, it's mix largely driven by growth in commercial original equipment sales. So we expect to see a significant growth, as we saw this quarter, right, with 40 commercial aircraft versus 30. We expect to continue that sort of trend through the balance of the year. And as we've also talked about in the past, we have pretty significant increases in R&D, largely attributable to the 525, also a fair bit attributable now, as you see, on the V-280 Valor for the future Army program. And we see some increases, obviously, in SG&A as, again, we continue to expand and drive sales to keep growing in the commercial sector.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So no real change to military OE this year?","Scott C. Donnelly","No. As we've said before, there's always a pressure point on that as we renegotiate contracts around the next multiyear on V-22, which will really be a 2015 impact. Every year we go through renegotiation on rates on the H-1s. But at the same time, we're also trying to drive productivity and figure out how to recoup some of those costs, so there's always some pressure on the military side. But really, what's driving the margin here in 2013 is just disproportional growth on the commercial original equipment side, combined in particular with the R&D growth for 525 and the V-280.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of David Strauss with UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","On the delivery guidance at Cessna, are deliveries -- non-Mustang deliveries going to be actually lower year-over-year? Or are we -- just most of the year-over-year decline is related to the Mustang?","Scott C. Donnelly","No, this includes Mustang, but also the CJ2, 3 and 4.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then, Scott, I think, from what I've gathered, you've had some fairly high-level departures, sales force departures at Cessna. Can you just talk about maybe what's going on there, how you're restructuring the sales force at Cessna?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, we've had a lot of changes in the sales force at Cessna over the last few years, and I would say probably the most challenging for some of our people has been the fact that we're adding a lot of sales people. So we've taken regions and we've broken them into considerably smaller regions because we feel we need to do that to get better coverage. I think most of our sales people understand that, and they recognize that having a smaller region and getting better coverage will ultimately lead to more overall sales for the company. But obviously, it puts pressure on individual guys because they don't have as big an area to work with. And most of our folks have been good with that. We've made it a good transition for them, and we've added some real talent in terms of the sales team and the number of people that we have in the sales team. But frankly, we've had some people that have a hard time getting their head around that, right? They say, \"Well, jeez, I used to have 10 states, now I only have 3 states.\" And that's hard for some of them to accept that. And obviously, we try to work with them and say, \"Guys, this is not about you. It's not that you're not doing a good job. It's that we've asked you to cover a sales territory that's just bigger than one human being could reasonably cover and really talk to customers and know what's going on and find new opportunities.\" And as I said, most have been great about that. And we've made adjustments, and I think it's working, if you look at our share for what market is out there. But in some cases, it's just too much for somebody to get their head around and so be it.","Operator","And next we'll come to Julian Mitchell with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just on Cessna, I just wanted to follow up on the delivery sort of outlook commentary in that business. I mean, your deliveries were down sort of double digits in Q1. Revenues were up slightly, so I'm just looking at the rest of the 9 months. I mean, what kind of slope of year-on-year change in Cessna deliveries are you embedding? Are you embedding the fact that the year-on-year trend should be fairly similar to what you had in Q1 or with the new jets, with the easy comps, you'll actually get a decent recovery in the second half?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, I think given our revised guidance and expectations around the light segment of the market that you would expect to see, given that we'll be down in total year-over-year, that we'll continue to see fewer jet sales per quarter. Now one thing to keep in mind is I think it will be particularly low in the second quarter because you don't have any Sovereigns in that quarter. As you get to the third and fourth quarter, it's likely to be closer. Keep in mind, there's always variability here from quarter-to-quarter. So I mean, this is all sort of rough numbers for you, but clearly, given the revised guidance in total for the year, you'll expect to see a smaller number of jet deliveries for the total year.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Sure. But the guidance, I guess, does it therefore embed, based on what you just said, that in Q3 and Q4, it's down somewhat as well year-on-year?","Scott C. Donnelly","I don't -- I have not -- we don't have that quite that refined a process. But I mean, certainly, it was down in the first quarter. I would expect it to be down more so in the second quarter, particularly with the Sovereigns not being in there. And so third and fourth quarter will probably be close in terms of number of actual deliveries. But it's just hard to estimate that at this point.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Sure, okay. And then just on capital allocation, and so on, I mean, the manufacturing cash flow guidance has obviously been adjusted. I just wondered what the updated thoughts were on things like the dividend outlook and so on in light of that, the weak cash flow you had Q1.","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, the dividend outlook, I think, remains. Our position is, right now, our capital requirements are to continue to pay down debt. We did that in the first quarter. We have some fairly significant paydowns that happened here in the second quarter, and we have not published or decided on any revised dividend strategy at this point.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, just thinking about the cost base for businesses beyond just Cessna. Obviously, the South Korean contract has been somewhere else in the last day or 2. The Industrial profits are down 20%. I mean, it sounds like the trends in things like Bell and in Industrial are in line with what you had thought at the end of January. But I wondered if there was any sense of sort of preparation of plans for other segments in terms of cost reduction beyond just Cessna at this point.","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, so I mean, I think, if you look at all the businesses, at Bell, in fact, there are some cost-reduction programs that are already underway in anticipation of some of the lower military volumes that we see as we go out into that '15 and on timeframe. This thing you mentioned with South Korea is certainly not something we've had in our plans, either near or long term. That's very much -- the product that was ultimately selected there is already very, very embedded in the country and utilized there. So it wouldn't have been a huge transition, frankly, I think to have gone a different direction and going with the Apache in South Korea, so that was never in our plans. And so there's no action we would take as a result of that. There are a number of other FMS opportunities. They're obviously in awards that we think will be things that we have a very real shot at winning on one front. But anyway, we have cost takeout plans and programs that are already underway at Bell, to cite that business, consistent with the military ramp-down, somewhat obviously offset by the fact that we have a growing commercial business. On the Industrial businesses, we're always looking very hard at the costs of that . We did have a much lower margin rate than we would like to have had on a normal basis in the quarter, although we sort of expected that given the dynamics of what was going on, particularly with automotive business in Europe and even more so in Asia, but again, consistent with our plans. So I don't think -- there's not a need or plan at this point that we'd announce any kind of a major restructuring in any of those areas. I think we're just going through some unusual market dynamics, and we'll work our way through that.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then just lastly, on Bell, the margins there. You mentioned sort of specific issues around commercial aftermarket. And so -- I mean, is the assumption that those are now sort of finished and so Q2, you should see a decent margin ramp off the Q1 margin level that you saw? Or are they going to be similar?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, the issue, with respect to the systems transition in the first quarter, was around commercial and to some degree, military spares. And certainly, over the next couple of quarters, those things will catch up. There will continue, however, to be pressure on Bell in terms of margins. And that's factored by the fact that, I think, we'll continue to see growth in the commercial original equipment market, and we'll continue to have the same pressures that we saw in this quarter in terms of increased R&D spending associated with our new product programs. So I don't think there's anything -- there's nothing to happen in the first quarter or any dynamics or changes that we see that are inconsistent with the guidance that we provided for Bell Helicopter for the year.","Operator","And our next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Scott, so not to beat a dead horse, but kind of back to Cessna, what kind of indicators would you need to see to -- you take the cost out of the business through the voluntary stuff, to start going the other way? I mean, what would give you the confidence to say, \"Hey, you know what, actually things are getting better?\" What would you need to see?","Scott C. Donnelly","More customers signing the bottom line on the deal.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Right. And the whole...","Scott C. Donnelly","I mean, I don't mean to be trite, Ron. I mean, you know this is a tough situation, right? But this is -- I just want to be very clear. This is just our view of the market. And as we went through the quarter, despite -- Ron, you've been in this game a long time as well, right? You look at what's going on with used aircraft sales, you look at used available for sale. I mean, all of the corporate profits. You look at all of the sort of what would be the leading indicators, and all those leading indicators would tell you this market's turning. And yet, we didn't see it turning. And so I think that we have just to sort of face the facts and say, \"Guys, it hasn't turned yet.\" Now I don't know, in 3 months, 6 months, it's -- we can't guess. The good news for us, if you want to look at it as the good news, is we have the inventory. So the material is there. If in the next 3 months or 6 months or 9 months, we start to see more demand where those customers, particularly in that light side of the market, are saying, \"Okay, it's time for me to trade my aircraft.\" And again, most of these guys now have had aircraft much longer than they usually have aircraft. But once we start to see that, we have the ability to react to that. We have material in-house. We have the ability to do final assembly. We can put these things together. We can sell these aircraft. So we won't change our strategy in terms of increasing our sales resource out there. So we're talking to these customers, we know what's going on, we know where they're at. The only difference here is we're not going to try to grow forced deals. We're going to let the market recover and want the deals to take place.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Yes, that makes sense. So just another quick question, so in the quarter, I mean, the cash flow, you talked about it a little bit, I just want to see if I really understand what's going on. So inventory went up, so a lot of that cash that was used in the quarter was just inventory at Cessna. Is that right?","Scott C. Donnelly","Actually, some at Cessna. Really, the big inventory build in the quarter was at Bell, and that's really because of the original equipment. Obviously, we had a fair number of dollars here of spare parts that didn't get shipped, okay. So there's a chunk of it that's just -- stuff that's sitting there. As we put the new system and just getting stuff shipped, build and moved is an issue. So that stuff, sitting inventory, which should have translated into revenue, and that will happen here over the next couple of quarters. But also, the fact that we're ramping the number of commercial helicopters. And again, the market on the commercial side, I think, is strong. I think we're going to continue to see good order and sales flow through the balance of the year. And we had what is unusually high amount of inventory build going into Bell, but it's mostly driven by -- again, some of it is sales that should have happened on the spare parts. But a fair chunk of it is just stuff now going to the work in process that will sell out through commercial helicopters in the balance of the year.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, okay. And then maybe one more, if I can. Maybe a much bigger-picture question, and I'm not asking you for guidance for future years. I know you can't do that. But when you think about your plan for the company, what if the business jets stayed slow for a while, I mean, longer than anybody hoped and you do get into an environment where V-22 numbers start coming down? This next multiyear is smaller, right? Probably the same thing happens to H-1. What do you do then? I mean how do you think about growing the business in that backdrop?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, obviously that's a challenge, right? I mean, I think, look, if you look at Bell, '13 is quite solid, '14 is quite solid. It's really when you get into 2015 that we have this transition where you see the V-22 numbers coming down. There's not a big transition at H-1 at that point. But part of it, obviously, is Bell on its own, what are we doing in terms of driving growth on the commercial side. The 525 program really kicks in, I think, and we'll start to see revenue generation and margin in the '16, '17 timeframe. So I think Bell on its own continue to be -- can continue to be a company, a business that grows. But there's no question that '15 will be a challenging year for them because you're really transitioning out of the V-22 volumes and you're not yet into the 525 volumes. Now obviously, we're working hard on 412s, and you're looking at the 407s. A lot of things we just announced is designed to drive commercial helicopter growth even before we get to the 525. But there's no question that 2015 is a bit of a swing year in there for Bell. On the Cessna front, I think we're in the fifth year -- it seems like about 20, but I think we're in the fifth year of sort of no growth in the business jet business. We still sort of have to believe this thing. It is a real market. It's a place that, at some point, needed to get back to growth, and I think every market forecast would tell you that. So does that not happen? I mean, we thought, surely, that happens in '13. If it doesn't happen by '15, I think that's -- again, that's way too far out for me to figure that out. Obviously, with the block point stuff coming in here at the end of the year, we think we've done some revamps to the product line that will help us. Also, by the way, when you get out to 2015, you've got the Latitude coming in, which is a fantastic new product. And this is an industry where new products do tend to drive growth, so I think we'll see that. So I think, as you say, it's too early, certainly, for us to even think about any kind of guidance in that range. But there are things that we're doing to try to drive growth through that 2015 around not just hoping the market does things, but also trying to do things in terms of new product. That's probably all I can say about it at this point.","Operator","And our next question will come from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a clarification first, the couple of hundred million, that's relatively isolated to the light market, it sounds like, which, just back of the envelope, would look like a pretty significant, kind of a 25%, 30% reduction year-on-year in your light market deliveries. Is that about what you're looking at x M2?","Scott C. Donnelly","Yes, that's probably about right. Correct, x M2.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So I guess at a high level, Scott, I'm sure you're getting tired of transition years in Cessna, so I'm curious, is this new look at production kind of a different approach, a way to purposely undershoot the demand curve, maybe claw back some pricing. And is the market now rational enough, without Hawker out there, that you could do that and this is actually maybe a positive?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, I mean, I am a believer in supply, demand. And I think we are at a point here where we're going to try to have to rationalize that and make a better estimate of trying to match supply and demand. I would say there's no question in my mind that as we look at the first quarter, our expectations for demand were nowhere near as strong as we thought they would be, and we had too much supply. And when you have that situation, I don't think that's particularly healthy from a pricing perspective. So there's no question that this is an effort on our part to do a better job of matching up supply and demand.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess, the question is more about, are you trying to purposely undershoot demand so that you can effectively take some medicine now, allow the absorption to happen and then have a better profile going forward, hopefully, as the market rationalizes.","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, look, I think we're trying to match it. If we go under it a little bit, I'm not sure that's all bad.","Operator","And we'll move on to the next line, coming from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Just a couple of quick follow-ups to all this. One of my questions is kind of analogous to the prior question. If you look at kind of 3 years here in a row of kind of 180 units, plus or minus, and now we're going down, I mean, to what extent do you think the market actually was not allowed to clear, over this timeframe, through the actions of yourself and others on creative trade-ins and other things? And can you actually -- I'm sure you understand the gist of the question. Can you judge really the magnitude or if that is in fact an issue when there's a period of kind of further burning off kind of maybe the overproduction -- although it seems crazy to think 180 was overproduction, but burning off the overproduction of the last few years?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, Jeff, I mean, obviously, it's very hard to gauge that. I don't think there's any question that the market was quite soft. As you say, it's hard to believe that 180 is too much, right, from our standpoint. And keep in mind, people don't push somebody's arm to buy a jet, right? I mean, this is a significant capital outlay, so it's not like you're going to force somebody to do it. But I do think that as a result of trying to sell aircraft when you do have a little too much supply, you're going to do things, from a pricing standpoint, that probably you should not do. And I think if you look at -- shares and whatnot have largely held steady through these phases. And I think we're just at a point right now where, from my view, clearly, we were going to have too much supply and that was going to create a lot of downward pressure on pricing in an industry that's already been a tough spot on pricing. So I'll just, to some degree, say, \"Okay, guys, look we just -- we don't have this lined up right this year and we're going to make an adjustment.\" So look, I don't want to be in a situation necessarily where if you have a customer that really wants to buy an aircraft that we don't have an aircraft available. But on the other hand, I think, we have to balance that with not having to go out and try to incent deals to happen that would not otherwise happen. So I mean, it's very -- there's no facts in this, right, Jeff? I mean, I do think we -- supply, demand is a very real thing. And I would probably say, yes, there has been too much supply, not enormously too much supply probably, I mean, as these transactions happen. But it looked to me like we're in a situation here where if we maintain the rates we have, we clearly are going to have too much supply.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Is the overhang from kind of plummeting Hawker used aircraft prices a big part of what's going on with your outlook for the year? Or is that more just kind of a headwind, an issue around the edges?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, I think the challenge for customers, okay, for guys that are operating Hawker aircraft, obviously, at some point, these guys are going to trade those aircraft in and buy new aircraft, just like any model of aircraft. There's nothing specific or unique going on there. But there's no question, as I said earlier, if you look at what's happened to the residual values of some of those aircraft, that is creating a challenge for some of those customers. Because that spread between what they can get for that used aircraft and what a new replacement is, is greater. So yes, I think that, that -- what we've seen in terms of those residual values is going to be, frankly, a long-term challenge for a lot of those customers because their collateral is just worth less. They're still going to want to upgrade. They're still going to do that over time, but it is going to put some financial pressure on them.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Right. And then, finally just on FMS for V-22. Obviously, on the second multiyear, the margins to the U.S. DOD come down, should we assume FMS margins come down similar -- obviously, they're ahead of that from the sale, yes, but will FMS margins be similar to the new lower DOD margins? Or will they be somewhere in between the new margins and maybe where you're running today?","Scott C. Donnelly","Jeff, obviously, not having done one yet, we don't know for sure. But my expectations is that these FMS deals would effectively look like options exercised on top of the multiyear. So you would expect price and margin to be consistent with the current sales under the multiyear 2 [ph] program.","Douglas R.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","At this time I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Doug Wilburne. Please go ahead.","Doug Wilburne","Thanks Stan, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release.","On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer.","Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. Textron's revenues in the quarter were $3.1 billion, up $226 million from last year's first quarter. Income from continuing operations was $0.46 per share up $0.31 from the first quarter of 2014.","Textron Aviation operating results included a $5 million reduction to segment profit from fair value step-up adjustments to acquire Beechcraft inventories sold during the quarter.","Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions of $20 million was a $125 million use of cash compared to $111 million use of cash in last year's first quarter.","With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Donnelly","Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everybody. Revenues were up nearly 8% in the quarter reflecting the success of our strategy of investing in new products and acquisitions. We achieved this increase in topline of Textron despite an expected decrease in revenues at Bell.","Decline in revenues at Bell was primarily due to lower volumes in our V-22 program where we delivered 6 V-22s down from 8 aircraft a year ago. We also delivered 4 H-1 aircraft down from 5 units in last year's first quarter. So it was just timing on the H-1s as we still expect to deliver about 25 units for the full year.","On the commercial side we delivered 35 aircraft up from 34 a year ago, where our mix was unfavorable as strength in the wide end of the market was offset by softness in the medium segment with no 412 deliveries in the quarter.","Based on the continued softness in the medium segment of the market, we are adjusting production levels and taking additional cost actions to allow Bell to perform within its targeted 2015 segment margin range of 11% to 12%.","We still expect the commercial deliveries will be up this year but probably only modestly so given the current demand environment. While the medium segment remains challenging, our win rate continues to be favorable and we had an especially good success at Heli-Expo where we signed 238 orders in production aircraft including a 200 deal order from Air Methods for our new 407 GXP model.","At the show we also signed 29 letters of intent for the 525 Relentless and 24 for the 505 Jet Ranger X. In addition to HAI orders, we received an order for seven 412s from the Canadian Coast Guard which we expect begin delivering in 2016 and announced two orders totaling 31 407s from customers in the Middle East and Mexico reflecting success in international markets.","We also celebrated opening of two new regional sales and service offices in Tokyo and Abu Dhabi to better serve our customers in those regions.","On the new product front, we continue to make progress on our safety of flight testing with the 525 Relentless test aircraft and are expecting first flight soon. Development of our 505 Jet Ranger X program is also proceeding well with the second flight test aircraft now in the air.","We are also in our promising developments on the military side of Bell in the quarter. First the V-22 was included in the U.S. presidential budget for the Navy carrier on-board delivery mission which calls for 44 aircraft. This will provide a solid basis for a third multi-year contract beginning in the 2020 time frame.","The Japanese V-22 program continues to move forward as we were in country last month meeting with the customer and expect contract signature this summer. Deliveries could begin in late 2018.","We are also seeing foreign opportunities take form for the H-1s as the U.S. State Department announced its approval of potential sale of 15 AH-1Z Vipers to Pakistan.","So while we continue to see lingering weakness in the medium helicopter segment, we believe the growth outlook at Bell over the next several years remains strong driven by our expanded global commercial sales efforts, recent commercial product upgrades, new commercial products on the way and foreign military opportunities for both the V-22 and the H-1.","Moving to systems, as expected revenues were also down in the quarter primarily driven by lower vehicle deliveries. However we are making good progress in our Canadian TAPV program and believe we are still on track for initial deliveries in the fourth quarter. We are also working on a number of additional foreign opportunities as we contribute to fourth quarter vehicle delivers.","At Textron's Marine and Land Systems we were awarded an $84 million contract for two additional Ship-to-Shore Connector units to be delivered in 2019 with the original two units scheduled to go offline in 2017 and 2018.","Moving down to Land Systems we were awarded a contract for 10 additional TCDL V2 Shadow retrofit system as well as a number of additional contract for our fee per service platform.","At TRU Simulation and Training last month, we unveiled our Bell V-280 simulator at the Army Aviation Mission Solutions Summit giving you army leadership and users tangible hands on experience of this revolutionary capabilities of the new platform.","Moving to industrial, we saw a 9.4% increase in revenues after a 7.7% negative impact from foreign exchange reflecting increase volume in our automotive markets, the success of new product programs, and the impact of the TUG, Douglas Equipment, and Dixie Chopper acquisitions.","At Jacobsen, we introduced our new trucks to HD heavy duty utility vehicle for the choice of gas or diesel engine and over 3500 pounds of payload for most powerful utility vehicle available in this class and provides compelling new product in the Jacob portfolio.","In the Tools & Test business, Sherman + Reilly introduced a number of new products including a revolution series P-1400, the first of its kind in 14,000 pound electric power for lines and a new line of termination tools for the power line industry.","Operating results were also by as far industrial in the quarter as the higher volumes contributed to a year-over-year margin increase of 110 basis points.","Moving to Textron Aviation, in the quarter we delivered 30 free jets compared to 35 last year, as well as 25 King Air. Margins in the aviation segment continue to improve reflecting our expanded scale and efficiency improvements.","On the service front aviation during the quarter we extended our ProAdvantage Jet aftermarket support programs to Hawker customers, plus added to our King Air service footprint with certifications in Sacramento and Paris.","Development on our new Latitude remains on pace for FA certification in the second quarter, as the flight test program is now complete and we should be on track for Latitude deliveries in the third quarter.","The availability of used Citations continues to come down, with used aircraft under 10 years old declining to 1.6% of the active fleet. Used aircraft are continuing to move fairly quickly and we've also seen evidence of improving residual values especially for aircraft at low hours.","New jet demand is usually seasonally lighter in the first quarter, the customer interest and inquiry activity was relatively healthy and consistent with our outlook for the year. To sum up at this point in the year we\u2019re confirming our full year Textron guidance for both earnings and cash flow as we expected stronger results at Textron aviation and industrial will offset the lower volume at Bell.","With that, I will turn the call over to Frank.","Frank Connor","Thank you, Scott, and good morning everyone. Segment profit in the quarter was $259 million, up $40 million from the first quarter 2014 on a $226 million increase in revenues.","Let's look at how each of the segments contributed starting with Textron Aviation. At Textron Aviations, revenues were up $266 million from this period last year, primarily reflecting the impact from the Beechcraft acquisition.","The segment had a profit of $67 million compared to $14 million a year ago. This was driven by improved performance reflecting the impact of the Beechcraft acquisition and higher overall volumes. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1.3 billion, $99 million lower than at the end of the fourth quarter.","Moving to Bell, revenues were down $60 million primarily reflecting lower V-22 deliveries. Segment profit decreased $20 million from the first quarter in 2014, primarily reflecting lower military volume and an unfavorable mix of commercial aircraft deliveries in the quarter.","At Textron Systems, revenues were down $48 million primarily due to lower Marine and Land Systems volumes. Segment profit was down $11 million, reflecting the lower volumes.","Industrial revenues increased $75 million due to higher overall volumes and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by a $62 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Segment profit increased $16 million, reflecting the higher volumes.","Finance segment revenues decreased $7 million and profit increased $2 million. Moving below the segment profit line, corporate expenses were $42 million and our tax rate was 30.4%. Interest expense was $33 million, down $2 million from the first quarter of 2014.","To wrap up with guidance, we estimate that our announced cost reduction activities at Bell will result in pre-tax charges in the range of $40 million to $50 million which will be recorded as part of segment expenses.","Inclusive of the charges related cost savings and lower expected revenues, we still expect full year margins at Bell will be in the 11% to 12% range.","From a total Textron perspective, stronger results at Textron Aviation and industrial are expected to offset lower volume at Bell. Therefore we are confirming expected full year EPS from continuing operations of $2.30 to $2.50 of share and cash flow from continuing operations of the manufacturing group before pension contributions of 550 million to 650 million.","That concludes our prepared remarks. So, Dan we can open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland","Hi, good morning gentlemen.","Scott Donnelly","Good morning.","Carter Copeland","Frank, just a clarification or, maybe, if you could give us a little more detail, on the charges for the cost actions at Bell, obviously $40 million, $50 million, if you still think you're going to come in within the prior range, I was just wondering if there was something other than run rate savings there would apply a lot of savings? Is there something else as an upper that's helping you overcome that $40 million, $50 million or am I missing something?","Frank Connor","No, its really run rate savings in the way that then gets rolled through the EAC's from a cost reduction standpoint. So obviously, we will have headcount savings, we will have rate savings, we are doing other things on the discretionary side as well.","And, when you look at those savings from a program accounting standpoint, as well as the cost, it will roll through such that we don\u2019t expect any big, kind of impact in any particular quarter and what we should see is the generally kind of the same type of seasonality from a quarterly standpoint as we've seen Bell over the past couple of years with improving margins as we go through the year in a higher volumes but it will get spread out over that period of time.","Carter Copeland","Can you quantify how much of that is the EAC keum catches that is you'll get out of that for this year?","Frank Connor","Well, its not really kind of keum catch its just, as we - there will be a little bit of keum catch but it's mostly as we deliver, product will have lower cost, embedded in those products. We\u2019re on a unit to delivery basis and so it rolls through as we deliver units.","Carter Copeland","Okay, great. Then just one other one. With respect to the market softness, you talked about, Scott, the -- I wondered if there is any after-market service support impact in Bell related to the weakness -- it's probably related to lower usage, that you might be seeing in Bell as well?","Scott Donnelly","We\u2019re trying to keep an eye on that and have some concern about but in the quarter our aftermarket activity was fine and we continue to see order activity. So, utilization still seems to be okay, I think we really seen is, more people just being a little nervous about investing the new CapEx and putting a new aircraft and to replace a older aircraft but at least today utilization and aftermarket seems to be fine.","Carter Copeland","All right. Thank you, gentlemen.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyauglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Sheila Kahyauglu","Hey, good morning, everyone. Scott, how should we think about the progression of the backlog within Aviation? When can we start to see that move up a bit?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I think Sheila the thing is most likely to start impact our backlog here in the balance of the year is, getting through certification on Latitude, which as I said I think we\u2019re getting pretty close, we done the flight test, we're done with all the ground test activities or at this point we\u2019re really just into the paperwork exercises getting through that.","So as a result, we now have a couple of aircraft that we've recently been able to put out, we really dedicated to customer demo activities those aircraft are pretty booked up. So we think there is a lot demand up there for the aircraft, a lot of customer interest and now that we can really dedicate those assets to getting out there and doing customer demos and we would expect to see those orders start to finalize.","Sheila Kahyauglu","Okay. Are you sold out for any particular models throughout this year?","Scott Donnelly","It's pretty tight on a couple but if you really want to one we could probably work with you somewhere.","Sheila Kahyauglu","I'll ask Doug for a favor. Then, I guess on underlying margins within Aviation, if we compare the first half of last year versus the quarter, about 200 basis points of underlying improvement excluding the PP&A. Should we expect that kind of improvement as we progress throughout the year, or could you attribute that to pricing? Was it Beech? Was it productivity? Maybe if you could just elaborate a bit there? ","Scott Donnelly","I think that\u2019s probably going to be typical for the year. I think the volumes, we expect to be online with what we\u2019re expecting from the beginning of the year, we got a slide uptick, we think on a year-over-year basis on the King Air which we are doing well. So I think the trajectory on is, going to track a couple hundred basis points better.","Sheila Kahyauglu","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.","George Shapiro","Yes. Good morning. Scott, I was wondering on the orders, if you could just go out and talk a little bit about where the strength is? US versus international, are you seeing any impact negatively internationally because of the dollar, so a little more color on that, if you could?","Scott Donnelly","I think the dollar is a problem George and in some parts of world obviously because of the - I mean the dollars has strengthened so much and obviously in some markets, particularly Eastern Europe and Russia where you had a lot of devaluation and similarly in South America there is just great a lot of problem.","But I would say in general right now on the jet side of things, the market is very driven by the North American marketplace, probably something around two-thirds to 80, 20 and interestingly enough its almost exactly inverted if you looked at King Air's.","So the strength of the turboprop market has been more international, the U.S. market still good, there has been more demand internationally. So, total portfolio it's going to balancing out a bit but definitely on the jet business its much more North American centric and King Air more international.","George Shapiro","Then, in Bell on the commercial, is the weakness, would you say, totally due to the oil and gas market or is there something else going on?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I think its mostly related to that George and certainly part of its is direct, right. So I mean if you\u2019re talking about customers whose mission is flying specifically oil and gas missions out the rigs, clearly that market is very soft right now given the price of oil.","But I think for us a bigger knock on effect of that is that historically we see a lot of sales, a lot of our aircraft particularly 412s in emergency medical services, and CSAR and a lot of sort of quasi-military, government operations and a lot of those countries that have very strong oil economies are seeing a lot of CapEx in their budget.","So I think, there is a piece of it that is absolutely directly oil and gas but I think part its \u2013 been a bigger issue for us is just a lot of our customer, our oil and gas natural resource driven economies and they're soft right now.","George Shapiro","Okay. One quick last one for Frank, what was the aftermarket growth at Aviation?","Frank Connor","It was mid single digits and kind of consistent with what we\u2019ve been seeing and expect to continue to see.","George Shapiro","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Sam Pearlstein","Good morning. Can you talk a little bit more about industrial. Just, it looks like sales and margins are certainly running ahead. I know you mentioned auto strength, but where is the higher volume? Is it the specialty vehicles business, like what is it that's driving things this year?","Frank Connor","Probably on a absolute dollar basis, the biggest increase is in the automotive side. We certainly seeing good auto demand, but we've also seen very strong earns from the vehicle business, that's such organically the business is growing nicely, but then of course we also have technologies and the acquisition side for ground support equipment that acquisition is performing extremely well for us. We're seeing great topline and great margin delivery out of that as well.","So it\u2019s kind of - I\u2019d say the good news is, it's pretty broad. The organic growth of the businesses in product lines that we were in has been very solid and the acquisitions we've done on that base are also performing very well.","Sam Pearlstein","Okay. Then just a question on the finance slide, the 60-plus-day delinquencies, why did those increase sequentially? I know it's not large dollars, but it's certainly a large percentage change?","Frank Connor","Yes, that's true. And look we had a couple of customer accounts that moved into that 60 day window and we have a little bit of loss small numbers now right. So if 412 aircrafts become a problem, we can swing that percentage by a pretty good chunk even though it might be two airplanes and $20 million makes a big difference from a percent basis.","So, I don\u2019t think there is any fundamental underlying change there. I mean clearly some customers internationally, because of some of the issues around U.S. dollar and currency and what not, those payments have got little expensive. And so obviously we\u2019ll work through that and in general I think we\u2019ll be fine.","Sam Pearlstein","Okay. Last question, just on the $600 million in free cash this year, I know you've talked about at a minimum buying back enough stock to offset the employee programs. One is, how much buyback is required to do that? Then, what would it take for you to do more? You don't really have any other debt maturing, so I'm just trying to think about where else does it go?","Scott Donnelly","Yes. We will buyback to offset the programs it's about 3 million shares or so. And as we talked about, we will - obviously we continue to look at acquisition opportunities and we have kind of - have had a steady stream with those.","And we have expected we will pay down a little bit more of the bank debt that we took on as it related to the Beechcraft acquisition, and then we\u2019ve said kind of any excess capital after that we would look to continue again to return to shareholders through share repurchase activity. But the target from the share repurchase standpoint is to offset the employee dilution number.","Sam Pearlstein","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, thank you. Just a question around any change in the competitive landscape. In Aviation and in Sikorsky, you obviously have some competitors based in countries where the dollar has strengthened considerably against their local base, so how does -- has that changed anything yet you're seeing commercially? Also, there are obviously some idiosyncratic issues at a couple of rivals of yours right now. I just wondered if you'd seen any change from that as well?","Frank Connor","I mean the dollar is not helpful for sure from a competitiveness standpoint and I think that some of our European competitors do get an advantage out of that. Of course they also have a fair bit of those supply chain that is dollar denominated so it\u2019s not of a disadvantage as it could be.","But when we look at deals in Europe for instance right now, it does make it more challenging, but again that's just the nature of a competitive market these things swing around. I think if you look at Latin America and Eastern Europe, Russia, the currency devaluation makes it a challenge for both dollar and euro denominated business, just because of the currency devaluation.","But either anyway I think, I would not say that it has markedly changed what\u2019s going on it makes it certainly tougher in Europe, but I mean I think we\u2019re still winning and feel really good about where we are from a share perspective.","When you look at deals in Asia, we\u2019re competitive and we are winning. So I think even though the helicopter market in particular, we see as being pretty soft I\u2019d say that we feel very good about our order rate this year in terms of share I think we\u2019re doing quite well.","Julian Mitchell","That's very helpful. Then, my second question is just on the Systems, the revenues were weak, but it sounded like very much in line with your planning assumption. It doesn't sound like your full-year view has changed on that segment, so I just wondered if you could confirm that? Also any color at all on the linearity of the sales progression? Is it going to be a very, very Q4-loaded year at Systems because of the TAP 3 delivery schedule, or do we start to see things improve a bit by mid year?","Frank Connor","Well I think you will see things improve a bit by mid-year Julian but absolutely our expectations and where we think it\u2019s going will be very back end loaded and that really primarily is driven by the vehicle program.","So we clearly expect and we think we're on track to have a pretty big fourth quarter on the vehicle side of the business.","Julian Mitchell","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr","Yes. Thank you very much. Give us a little more color on demand at Aviation? You say customer demand is quote\/unquote healthy, and yet 0.85 book-to-bill hardly looks like healthy. How was it at Cessna versus legacy Beech? How did it roll out sequentially, since we've heard that January and February were very weak and March improved?","Scott Donnelly","Well I think the normal seasonality is sort of demand is inline with our expectations I guess what I would say Cai. The early first quarter is always very soft from an order intake perspective.","And I think that's what we saw for the most part this year. On a seasonal basis, it's performing exactly as we would have expected I think we probably said in terms of customer activity and what not as strong as we've seen in a while in Q1.","And we're pretty happy with how things were progressing. Obviously as I said earlier, I think the real demand driver for us in terms of any kind of backlog filled would be around Latitude as that thing goes through it\u2019s certification process.","So even though the customer environment is considerably better than it has been, it is still sort of a full business people are in conversations, and as they get close to when they want to take deliveries that's when they put their deposit down and sign up.","So as we said we\u2019d love to be out in three to six months and we certainly have a couple of models where it's out in more in that range, but generally speaking it\u2019s still more of a full business.","But with a lot more customers are sort of in the queue and a lot more conversations going around to yield, what we need to see in terms of deliveries and so frankly we feel pretty comfortable with that.","Cai von Rumohr","Given that Cessna depends on the US, where the economy is improving somewhat, and Beech depends on the foreign market, where there's less evidence of that, could you contrast demand between those two sectors?","Scott Donnelly","Cai, they really been pretty similar. I think if you look at how deals progress the number of customers that we are in conversations, when they actually placed their orders and take deliveries as you point out it is more international on the King Air side and domestic on the Jet side but still a very similar prospecting, selling order taking selling process for both platforms.","Cai von Rumohr","Okay. Then, two quick ones on Bell. You said commercial up a bit. Would that include the 412? Secondly, if you're going to have $40 million to $50 million of pretax charges, how much would the run rate savings be against that?","Scott Donnelly","So in terms of the unit deliveries, we still think that will be up slightly over a year ago primarily driven by higher volumes on 407s and 429s, offset by probably slightly lower volumes on 412 versus last year, which is why we come back to the mix issues what prefers the margins out of the spring. So, we're still feeling reasonably good about volumes on the lights but clearly not so on the mediums.","In terms of the cost and that roll through, I mean I would say most of the cost is related to severances and reductions of people and so generally speaking if you forget program accounting and inventory and all that sort of stuff, you generally expect that those costs will be covered in sort of a 9-month window obviously how you recognize that see through the P&L is going to be more function of the program accounting and EACs and how that comes.","So Frank said, you will see not a whole lot of impact on a quarter-to-quarter basis through the balance of the year because while we will take the cost source of restructuring, that will manifest itself in program accounting where you won\u2019t see much difference in terms of the net impact through the balance of this year and obviously as you go out in time, you would start to see positive benefit there.","Cai von Rumohr","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.","Peter Skibitski","Scott, I think you mentioned secondhand pricing in used jets, in your opening remarks, being maybe modestly improved. Can you tell us, is the improvement rolling through to meet pricing on some of the legacy models, or is that some kind of a flash environment and you just get a pricing power on the brand-new models?","Scott Donnelly","Both we\u2019ve seen pricing fairly stable on the new models, we\u2019ve seen beginning of some uptick of residual values in the used aircraft, as you see in Vrefs and the blue books which is encouraging.","I don\u2019t know that there is a direct correlation frankly to saying okay the prices up on the used and therefore it translates directly to price on the new. It does help us in terms of customer's that wants to trade in their old aircraft or sell their old aircraft and step up into new aircraft.","In terms of that gap and value between what they know that they can get for their used aircrafts and how much additional capital they would want to put into buy new airplanes. So as we see those residual values starting to rebound, I think it definitely bodes well for demand on the new aircraft side.","Peter Skibitski","Okay. Understood. Then, just wanted to follow up. I don't know how widespread this was, but I saw at least one article during the quarter that talks about a lot of nervousness on the TAPV program in Canada, just on the redesign. Can you tell us when is the redesign going to be done and fully tested? How thorough is this, such that it could eliminate the risk in the program?","Scott Donnelly","The redesign is complete and we have had initial vehicles with the redesign fully incorporated into them and all going through the test environment, so we\u2019re as we were doing the redesign, these things were all fairly well isolated to during suspension system which basically just we said to beef it up the severity of the conditions of the test were frankly beyond anything that we\u2019ve experienced before.","We have a lot of these vehicles out there obviously of various different types and we\u2019ve never had issues or problems with any of those components. But the severity of the testing frankly pushed some of these things literally break some of these steering numbers.","So the redesign was in essence just beefing up those individual components, most of which are available and used in some larger vehicles interestingly enough, and in some cases there were actually cheaper than the lighter version because they are manufactured in high volumes.","And so we have been sort of testing each of these new components as we could get our hands on them and those have gone well as I said we now have couple of vehicles out there that are completely the new design configuration with all of the new configuration components.","And the testing so far is going great, so it is an endurance test, right so you have to get through that phase which will take us another couple of months before we\u2019re comfortable enough to say we are ready to go into the formal customer testing, but so far the design is complete and initial testing results are very promising.","Frank Connor","Okay. That feedback I would add that article fits that one that I am thinking of I think if you read it closely lot of the information and quotes in that article are really from last year, it\u2019s really not current data.","Scott Donnelly","It was quite dated and this customer has been terrific to work with I think everybody has had their head around same thing and want to make sure we went back to the process so it\u2019s test was successful and the sort of the tone in the article is pretty dated.","Peter Skibitski","Okay. I appreciate you guys.","Scott Donnelly","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Noah Poponak","Hi, good morning everyone. Scott, are you surprised that the legacy, not new products Cessna demand environment is not getting better faster. Because, I guess it's been a few quarters since you first cited stabilization, you keep giving us the inventory as a percentage of fleet number for you, and it's improved a lot, and I don't even know if that could go any lower. Is there just too much total market used inventory, so you're still competing with everyone else's used inventory? Or is it just a long-cycle business and it takes time to get escape velocity, or is this market just at a structurally new lower demand level for a while?","Scott Donnelly","No I think that I mean the numbers I should say are down in terms of the used available, it\u2019s kind of hard to imagine they could go much lower frankly they are certain well below historical norms. The only thing I would say is that they still have probably a relatively higher spread between what the values are for those used aircraft as opposed to new aircraft and I think that\u2019s still is a drag on some of our customers because trade in premium right to say if I go from the used to the new, how much cash flow I have to kick in to do that is higher than it\u2019s historically been.","And so I still think the every placement cycle people will drag that out just given that that value gap if you were but the aircraft still keep getting older and they\u2019re using more and I think have this longer timeline in terms of how many years older aircraft before they trade in.","And I think that is the primary dynamics still driving the marketplace, that\u2019s what I think we have been talking out for couple of years really about the percentage coming down and coming down and coming down, the past quarter so is really the first time we are starting to see that residual value come up.","So I think that actually is more important and just that percentage and frankly we\u2019ve been surprised that with such a low inventory used aircraft you think from a supply demand standpoint you would start to see pricing come up.","And at least for final you will see that okay we have been surprised frankly probably the last year as that number really started to drop that you didn\u2019t see a corresponding residual value increase and like you said finally we\u2019re starting to see that which is encouraging. And I think that\u2019s what is driving that kind of demand environment.","Noah Poponak","On the upgrading topic, is there also an issue with length of time the jet is with the first owner, where in prior cycles because of the maintenance warranty being five years you were getting a ton of upgrading in years four and five? Now folks are extending that because, obviously, a plane can be used substantially longer, and once you go past the roll off of the maintenance warranty and you do that first major check, you then have signed up for keeping the airplane for a lot longer until you get to the next major check. Is that overall time an issue?","Scott Donnelly","Well I think the time is clearly being extended and what you\u2019re seeing is more customers get to the end of that warranty period were historically would have said okay, I am going to go ahead and trade in but again you back to that what the step up cost, what is that premium to go from that five rolled aircraft to brand new aircraft and instead you\u2019re seeing people that are sticking with it, putting part programs and we do provide obviously for customers and always have for second customers the ability to in essence extend warranties and pay to sort of protect themselves from those cost which is a good business for us.","So this is I think this all comes back in order to basic dynamic of all right five years whether it would be coming of warranty, whether it is how many hours, whether it is just going to larger lift it\u2019s extending that period because that residual value is just substantially lower than it historically has been.","Noah Poponak","Got it. Then, just lastly, on the margin for the overall aviation segment, I mean, you have an outstanding margin forecast for the year, could you possibly update us on that? Just because it looks like with the very good first-quarter performance, one can get substantially higher than that range you have there, just even simply using a 20% sequential incremental margin through the rest of the year. Any more color on where you expect the full year to land?","Scott Donnelly","No formal update, all as I said and as I think Frank referenced I think will at least feel like given the demand environment and the performance in the business in total and I mean we\u2019re still early in the year obviously right but I mean our perspective on the market and certainly our perspective on how the team is executing and delivering on cost and product programs will probably be towards the high side of that number.","Noah Poponak","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Myles Walton","Thanks. Good morning. Frank or Scott, I think you alluded to the service extension to offer customers. I was curious if you'd talk about the level of uptick you're seeing on that extension of your service program? Also, one year post the Hawker acquisition, can you comment on the level of cross totalization you've had in bringing customers over to the Cessna lineup? Any metrics you have against that to support it?","Frank Connor","Well, we have a dedicated team frankly that this is what they do for living is reaching out to our Hawker customers, part of what we just talked about around our ProAdvantage system being able to go out to those customers and be able to put them on the same kind of maintenance and service programs that we currently have today for our citation customers.","And that program and the needs of those customers, is what kind of droves that, creation of that program based on interactions that our dedicated Hawker team has had with those customers.","In terms of conversion that\u2019s also something we look at and are working on and we certainly have had. Some of those and I would expect frankly, when you talk to a lot of Hawker customers many of whom are in Hawker 900s and 850 things like that, these are cabin sizes and mission that did quite well to where we are talking about going with Latitude and ultimately longitude.","So I think most of that conversion will start becoming more material as we have a Latitude and then eventually launched at the marketplace.","Myles Walton","Okay. Then a clarification. From a sales perspective, it sounds like Bell may be looking for $4 billion roughly at the start of the year and maybe it's a few hundred million lighter than that, is that about the right thinking?","Frank Connor","That's probably right.","Myles Walton","Okay. All right, great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Johnny Wright from Nomura. Please go ahead.","Johnny Wright","Hi, guys. About the restructuring points again, you guys saw a lot of money there in the last 12 to 18 months taking costs out. How confident are you that there's another $40 million to $50 million to keep you in that guidance range? Where are the new areas you're focusing on that you haven't looked before?","Scott Donnelly","You're right, we\u2019ve gone through a number restructuring as frankly over the last couple of years in anticipation of the V-22 volumes coming down. I think all this really changed here is that while we were undertaking to try to make sure we had a cost structure that supported that, we have seen the soft on the commercial side.","So I don\u2019t know if there is any particularly different strategy here obviously, we\u2019re looking very much at structure and looking at organization structure to try in more efficient ways to operate given that it\u2019s a small business in terms of its revenue in topline,.","So it's primarily around, structure and layers overhead. We are not impacting our critical programs, so the investments in 525 and 505 and V-280 which are significant, those are continuing full speed ahead.","So it\u2019s never an easy go process to go through obviously but we\u2019re working very hard to make sure that the cost come out in places that are discretionary or other overhead and indirect burden as oppose to effecting how we manufacture and deliver what we need to and make sure that we continue to make kind of progress on our new product programs.","Johnny Wright","Okay. Thanks. Can you just provide an update on the Scorpion? Where we are at terms of timing for first orders, maybe just a number of customers you're in conversation with at this point?","Scott Donnelly","Well, there is a number of customers in conversation right now. I would say that the number of customers who we are talking to is probably increasing at this point. I wouldn\u2019t hassle to guess a first order date at this stage of the game but I think we have a lot of good customer conversations going on, like program is continuing, we\u2019re in the process of completing the design modifications that we wanted to make coming out of the original flight test demo program and are in the process of the build cycle for what will lead to the first confirming aircraft. So that\u2019s kind of where we are in the program.","Johnny Wright","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.","Scott Donnelly","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey Sprague","I think you've covered a lot of ground here. I guess a couple things. On Latitude, can you give us the sense of to what degree you do have some orders in hand? Obviously, you're indicating that once you think you've got final cert it picks up, but any color you can provide there?","Scott Donnelly","So we do have a number of orders for the Latitude Jeff. I think we\u2019re in pretty good place, in terms of initial delivery commitments, customers that are waiting for us to get through certainly begin the delivery process.","But there are still some slots obviously to go for the year but as I said, I think we have a very robust level of customer interest and a bunch of folks that are waiting the demo and fly the aircraft at that point make there decision on order.","So having now finish the flight test program or have a couple aircraft flying around the country, fully configured for customer interiors, its pretty booked up. So I think there is a lot of interest, a lot of customers, but they all want to, they want to fly the aircraft, we obviously done a number of customer demos, we had in aircraft, that we have there for while doing demos and that generated more activity and I think we are at that point now in the program where that pace will increase.","Jeffrey Sprague","Then, just taking that a step further, you had this mix down in Q1 and it's obviously a low-volume quarter. I understand the Latitude mission is obviously different Sovereign and XLS the capabilities are different, but is there some peripheral cannibalization of those product lines, you think, on anticipation of Latitude?","Scott Donnelly","The only thing I can figure out Jeff is that from a mix standpoint, last year in Q1, we've just gotten the Sovereign plus certification in the very, very end of 2013. So we had a lot of Sovereign deliveries in first quarter of 2014.","So I think we had good Sovereign deliveries in the first quarter of this year but not something that would reflected - sort so that pent-up demand given the late certification of Sovereign a year ago.","Jeffrey Sprague","Sure, that makes sense. One last one. Just back on Bell, you hit it a couple times here in the Q& A. It sounds like on the restructuring you're telling us that effectively all or most of that $40 million to $50 million gets recovered, so you're close to net-net neutral on cost versus benefit on restructuring. A, is that correct? Then B, if I just think about that being a wash, I'm still struggling a little bit with getting from 9% and change in Q1 to 11% to 12% for the year. Obviously there's some seasonal volume lift, but is there anything else in the mix or anything that really supports your confidence in that range?","Scott Donnelly","There is. So first of all your assumption is correct with respect to the discussion around, the incurring of the restructuring charges and what that does on sort of a net basis through the balance of the year. Okay, so that\u2019s more or less a wash.","In terms of, sort of how we think about quarterly progression of margins, generally speaking as we work through the year at Bell, we do see increased volumes and we do see more favorable mix.","So in the first quarter is that we had zero 412s. So we would expect the quarterly progression of margin rate, given that the restructuring and the balance sort of that net out, you will sort of the normal incremental improvements in margin rate through the course of the year.","Jeffrey Sprague","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question does come from the line of David Strauss from UBS. Please go ahead.","David Strauss","Good morning.","Scott Donnelly","Good morning, David.","David Strauss","Scott, could you talk about what you're seeing in terms of utilization on your own fleet that's out there in service? Obviously, we can see the FAA data, but I just wanted to get a sense of what you're seeing in terms of the utilization on your own fleet as it comes in for service? Does that -- are you seeing a pickup there? It looks like the FAA did. It picked up earlier in the year, but now has fallen back. Thanks.","Scott Donnelly","David, I guess, I don't have that around the supplementary forms here. We usually keep track of the average flight hours and then I don\u2019t know if I have that in front of me. Usually what the FA is reporting is take-off and landings and we usually look at the average daily utilization. So there hasn't been a huge change in that frankly, I mean it's sort of in the realms.","David Strauss","Do you think that's the missing piece in all of this? I know we've talked about used inventories and used pricing, but do you think it's really possible that we can have much of a recovery before we see a pick up in average daily utilization?","Frank Connor","I don't know that there's a huge correlation from the ADU to the new aircraft sale. I really think that is more a basis of residual values versus new aircraft sale. We look at the ADUs more as a function of service activity and how much activity we\u2019re going to through see to the service centers.","And again that\u2019s been relatively stable with sort of its get older and it\u2019s all base get bigger that's what's been driving our guidance around sort of that mid single-digit growth and that's where we continue to see even though we had relatively stable ADU now for quite sometime.","David Strauss","Is that ADU number still well below what you guys were seeing prior to the financial crisis?","Frank Connor","Sure, yes, if you went back and you looked at, it dropped off, at the end of the 2008 beginning of 2009 in the sort of the 0.67, 0.65, 0.64 I mean it's been pretty flat for several years now.","David Strauss","Right. Okay, thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi. Please go ahead.","Jon Raviv","Hi, good morning. It's Jon Raviv on for Jason. Question back on Bell. I was just wondering, is there more to cut, perhaps, if this oil market weakness continues? Related to that is, do you have any visibility on 412 deliveries this year? My understanding is that this is usually a spot market for helicopters, that is. Then if the market does come back, do you have to hire back up or does this restructuring suggest higher structural margins going forward when things improve maybe next year or the year after?","Scott Donnelly","So look our intent you never like to go through this with the organization our intent here is that we would do this and that positions us to go through what we think is a fairly lean this year around that segment of the market and then well in the next year.","And then of course we have things like 505 by 525, new things that are kicking in and look we've also taken some orders some of the 412s can be a bit of a spot market aircraft here there, but often there are also fleet buys right. So when you look at the Canadian deal for instance that's seven 412s.","But those deliveries won\u2019t start until sometime next year into 2017. I think there is some other opportunities out there around 412s that are going to be similar. So there is customer activity going on and some of them are fleet buys but they\u2019re going to be from a timing perspective they will be out there.","Now in terms of the ability to hire back, if we something on the production line obviously we know how to modulate their production line and those folks tend to be on recall and we can bring people back even if we need to do that to increase the production volumes. Clearly on the salary side we are trying to try to make it a restructuring of just how we organize and run the business.","So that wouldn't necessarily be a volume related action later on. But certainly on the production side we have the ability to stay our production capacity up and down based on future volumes.","Jon Raviv","Great. Thanks. Then, just following up on cash deployment. How would you characterize your M&A appetite at this point given where things are and especially as a relatively sizeable potential helicopter asset could come to market?","Scott Donnelly","I would say that on - generally speaking on the M&A side, the way we think about it is more along the lines of a lot of the deals we\u2019ve done with TUG and ground support equipment, with our simulation businesses, with the Sherman and Reilly's, that sort of the general scope of what we look at transactions that are kind of in that size that are very complementary or bolt-on to our existing businesses.","With respect to sort of the reference you're making in helicopter industry, I mean I think there is probably too much to say about that, I mean it\u2019s a process that\u2019s largely driven by that company who is been pretty public about type that they\u2019re doing something and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll all see what they\u2019re going to do on their timeline, which I think they'll describe as being sometime mid-year.","Jon Raviv","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ron Epstein","Good morning guys. Scott, just maybe backing up on the end of that last question, it seems like there's potential to do all kinds of M&A going forward. I mean, there might be some other properties in the market, even one in Wichita. Can you just remind us broadly what your thinking is about doing M&A at this point given the asset base that you already have?","Scott Donnelly","Well Ron, we're quite open to M&A. I mean we\u2019ve done a fair bit of activity here over the last few years. We\u2019ve been generally speaking very happy with the results I mean they\u2019ve been very accretive to the company.","We\u2019ve been happy with what they\u2019ve done in terms of strengthening us in the marketplace. And clearly that range is from the Beechcraft's or the world which for us is a very large deal.","But we\u2019re really happy with how that\u2019s going both tactically and around cost and strategically where it positions the company going forward. And as I said we had a bunch of significantly smaller deals that we think have done really good things for our portfolio, they have helped to strengthen the businesses that we have, they have put us into some exciting new spaces that are very complementary like the simulation side of things, we strengthened our utility side of our Tool & Test business.","The TUG stuff and ground support as I said earlier has gone really, really well. We think that\u2019s a great space for us to be in. And it\u2019s performed very well. So we\u2019re sort of open for business for that respect but there are things obviously that have to make a lot of sense for us, we\u2019re not just going out to try to do M&A for the sake of doing M&A, there have to be things that in our view fit with portfolio and the strategy of the company and as a result I mean things I think our investors would agree are the right places for us to deploy capital.","Ron Epstein","Sure. Maybe just following up on one of those, the Mechtronix acquisition in the sims space, I mean, how is that going? Are you picking up share? How could you -- if you can give us color around that?","Scott Donnelly","Yes, it\u2019s going really well, we\u2019re very happy with it. The strength of that business so the foundation of it was more near transport side and as we said at the time we did the deals, we wanted to increase sort of our exposure in Aviation from just GA into the commercial civil aerospace side of things.","We're really happy with it. We had some big strategic wins particularly with Boeing on the 737MAX and so we continue to execute well, I think on that contract and pick up more simulators as they progress down in their program, we have some other new platforms that we\u2019re investing in where we had some wins that haven\u2019t been announced particularly yet but I think we\u2019ll continue to help position us as a very serious player in the air transport market.","And of course we\u2019re leveraging those assets to help things like the V-280 we talked about. One of the issues around the V-280 with our army customer is, do you have the maneuverability and the capability that they\u2019re used to today with the more conventional helicopter.","And by taking the technology and the capability we have in the company now and very quickly going out and building a very realistic well modeled simulator, a lot of customers get in there and go out this thing, does perform like a conventional rotorcraft and also it\u2019s - I think it's helping us performing well tactically and strategically I think it\u2019s doing all the things that we hope that would do.","Ron Epstein","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.","Robert Stallard","Thanks so much good morning.","Scott Donnelly","Good morning.","Robert Stallard","To follow onto Ron's question, but from the other direction. It looks how we've seen a bit of M&A picking up in defense sector with people looking to put assets onto the market. I was wondering if you had any expressions of interest in some of your systems assets and what your criteria might be if you were looking to sell some things there?","Scott Donnelly","I guess I would say not we have not and whatever it might be or would be, we have to be something that we thought was in the best interest of our long-term shareholders and generate a lot of value.","Robert Stallard","Okay. Have you got any specific financial metrics, maybe, you might have in mind then?","Scott Donnelly","No.","Robert Stallard","Okay. Maybe on the aviation side, Scott, you mentioned the US market for Cessnas being pretty good. I was wondering if you could maybe give us some an idea of what end markets have been better or maybe worse? Have you seen any impact in the slowdown in energy, for example?","Scott Donnelly","I\u2019m sorry, slowdown in what Robert?","Frank Connor","Energy.","Scott Donnelly","No, I don\u2019t know how much color I give you on that. It\u2019s been pretty broad based obviously our citation customer base is for the most part small to mid-size businesses, lot's of privately held companies and it's pretty well across that whole normal spectrum of our kind of customers.","And we always see rotations in the industry, whether energy is doing something real estate right now is pretty strong, construction these are \u2013 it\u2019s a pretty broad base of industries. And I don\u2019t know that I can really give you any color specifically this quarter as to which ones are more active than others.","Robert Stallard","What about maybe on the charts or the fractional side, has there been any improvement there?","Scott Donnelly","We haven't had a fractional aircraft sale in the seven years I\u2019ve been here. So, yes it\u2019s been since 2008, so there\u2019s - in terms of new aircraft into a fractional obviously some of our current fractional customers are selling aircraft as they roll-off the deals for previous customers. So there\u2019s an aftermarket out there, but there\u2019s nothing new that we\u2019re selling into fractional right now.","We have had a fair bit of closed charter operation obviously goes up has been a big customer, King Air has put some used XLSs into it but that's probably the some total what I see going on - in terms of our sales directly into the fractional charter market.","Now we hope to see that change obviously. The NetJet guys has selected a Latitude is their mid-sized platform and with that product now getting the certification there\u2019s an awful lot of activity between ourselves and NetJets on how we help market and take that product into the fractional market.","So I think we have some significant upside in terms of fractional NetJet is obviously is a very powerful player in that in market and the fact that they chose Latitude is their mid-sized platform, I think it will be big boost to us.","Robert Stallard","Thanks Scott.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Levenson from Stifel. Please go ahead.","Steve Levenson","Thanks good morning everybody. Could you give us an update, please, on Scorpion and maybe a little bit more on international interest for that plane as well as V-22?","Scott Donnelly","First the Scorpion program is progressing very, very well. We got a ton of flight hours, it's been a very busy test and demonstration program. The aircraft is performing extremely well. As I think we mentioned before, there\u2019s a couple of things as we went through the test program that we felt would modify when we went into full-grade production.","So we had an engineering team that's been incorporating all those changes. And we\u2019re getting to ready to undertake build of what would be the conforming aircraft ready to go into certification testing in production.","So in terms of the technical side of the program, I\u2019d say it\u2019s going very well. In terms of the business developments side we have a number of customers that are ongoing conversations around the aircraft and have seen the aircraft and there's sort of what I would call a normal business development activity.","Those processes tend to take a while, because as you can imagine they are government sales and so budgeting and evaluation and what not is a - they take their normal course but there's number of conversations going on.","In terms of things like V-22, we\u2019ve seen the Japanese deal has been announced, it\u2019s been budgeted. There is detailed negotiations and we're hopeful that sometime this summer that will actually be under contract. They\u2019ve already budgeted I think the first five aircraft though the total I believe 19 is they are talking about.","So I think that program is progressing well. There is a number of other customers to which there are active discussions underway. So I think combined with the COD announcement, and as well as those activities I think we got a very, very strong future on V-22.","At the time the only issue for us is just the timing of getting these things through the - getting them on the contract and getting them into the production process. So the \u2013 the unfortunate side is it's probably not a material impact to us until the late teens as opposed ","to some would help us out next year just given how long it takes to get them under contract and get it going.","Steve Levenson","Got it. Thank you very much for the color.","Doug Wilburne","Dan I think that we're little bit over time here, so we\u2019ll take one last call here that\u2019s still in queue and then call it a day.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our last question for today comes from the line of Justin Bergner from Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.","Justin Bergner","My one question which remains after all the other questions have been answered is with respect to Bell and commercial mix, will that weigh on margins even after the cost reductions that are being taken are completed? Or do you expect you'll be able to offset the mix headwinds as well?","Scott Donnelly","I would say that on the \u2013 as you look through the course of the year, again what's typical for us is that we\u2019ll see not only overall higher volume through the balance of the year but we\u2019ll see a higher mix of 412s as we move through the year. And that\u2019s what really drives that quarterly progression of margins late through the balance of the year.","And that would be true across all of our platforms frankly, as you look at the cost savings associated with the restructuring that we\u2019re doing, that really manifest itself in overall manufacturing rates and overhead rates and so the cost and\/or benefits associated with that are spread across all of our commercial and military product lines.","So the underlying mix and volume which will increase the course of the year is really what drives that incremental margin rate.","Justin Bergner","Okay. But you don't expect an ongoing mix headwinds as we look out to next year and the following years?","Scott Donnelly","No, not at this time, I would expect it will just see our normal progression where we have higher volumes for 412 through the balance of the year.","Justin Bergner","Thank you.","Scott Donnelly","Great.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session later. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Doug Wilburne. Please go ahead, sir.","Douglas R. Wilburne - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release.","On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.","Textron's revenues in the quarter were $3.2 billion, down 7.3% from $3.4 billion in last year's third quarter. However, income from continuing operations was $0.63 per share, up 10.5% from $0.57 per share in the third quarter of 2014. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions of $16 million was $116 million compared to $144 million in last year's third quarter.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everybody.","Revenues were up at Textron Aviation, Systems and Industrial but down at Bell, which led to an overall decrease in revenue in the quarter. Segment profit was up 6.5%, reflecting improved margin results in each of our business segments.","At Bell, the decline in revenues was primarily due to lower deliveries in our V-22 program, as we delivered four V-22s, down from 12 a year ago. This decline was partially offset by an increase in H-1 deliveries, as we delivered five units this year compared to four in last year's third quarter.","On the commercial side, shipments were also up, with 45 aircraft delivered in the quarter compared to 41 a year ago. While commercial helicopter markets remain challenging, Bell continues to show a favorable win rate, so we still believe the commercial deliveries will be up modestly this year.","On the new product front, we've completed over 45 hours of ground testing and 35 hours of flight testing on our 525 Relentless program since the program's first flight on July 1. During that time, we've successfully conducted numerous tests, including ground resonance testing, gross weight and envelope expansion, maximum continuous power climbs, minimum power descents and initial autorotation testing. We've also successfully engaged a full fly-by-wire system to a speed of 150 knots and an altitude of 13,000 feet.","Overall, the aircraft has performed very well, proving to be a very stable platform that is meeting or exceeding all of our initial performance expectations. We've completed structural assembly of our second 525 test aircraft and expect it to enter the flight test program by the end of the year, with a third test aircraft expected to follow close behind. We are currently targeting certification and first delivery of the 525 during the first half of 2017.","Our 505 Jet Ranger X program is also making good progress, as we've now accumulated over 470 flight test hours. We are targeting certification and entry into service during the first half of next year.","We also continue to have success on both the U.S. and foreign military front at Bell. As discussed during our last earnings call, we received our first international order for V-22s in July with the signing of a contract with Japan to deliver the first five of 17 expected total units.","On the H-1 front, we were awarded a DoD contract in August for an additional 35 H-1 units, consisting of 32 aircraft for the U.S. Marine Corps and the first three of 12 planned deliveries for Pakistan. Based on the existing U.S. Marine and Pakistan requirements, we expect a gradual increase in H-1 deliveries from the mid-20 this year to the mid-30s in 2017 and 2018.","Moving to Systems, both revenues and margins were up, reflecting higher weapons and unmanned systems deliveries. At Marine & Land Systems last month, we were awarded a contract to supply 55 COMMANDO Select armored vehicles to the Afghan National Army. We expect to deliver most of those units during the fourth quarter, and we're pursuing a number of other promising foreign military opportunities for our COMMANDO line.","Elsewhere at TMLS, we continue to make good progress on the Ship-to-Shore development program, with the first two landing aircraft now in production. The initial craft remains on track for delivery in 2017.","Moving to Industrial, we achieved a 5.5% increase in revenue after a 7.5% negative impact from foreign exchange, reflecting strong organic growth in each of our businesses. Kautex had the highest increase in revenue with volumes up in Europe, North America and Asia. Textron Specialized Vehicles also had solid growth across all business lines, reflecting our focus on new products and the success of recent acquisitions. At Jacobsen, we launched our new Professional Series commercial grade lineup of mowers and utility vehicles aimed at the North American missile market at last week's GIE+EXPO industry show in Louisville, Kentucky.","Overall, our Industrial segment is performing well, both on the top line and in terms of cost productivity in what has otherwise been a difficult industrial environment.","Wrapping up with Textron Aviation, we delivered 37 jets and 29 King Airs compared to 33 jets and 30 King Airs last year. Margins in the Aviation segment improved significantly on the higher revenues and improved performance, which included lower amortization related to fair value step-up adjustments.","Our strategy of investing in new products continues to pay off, as we delivered our first four Latitudes in the quarter. We expect to see a ramp of Latitude deliveries, reflecting both retail demand and deliveries to NetJets. The Latitude opens the door to our new generation of larger cabin Citations, including the new Longitude, which will make its public debut next month at the annual NBAA show. We believe the Longitude will be a significant game changer in the business jet world when we reveal its superior performance, design characteristics and best-in-class operating cost. We will have a broad array of Citation and King Air products on display, as well as product-related developments to share. So we expect NBAA to be a positive catalyst for Textron Aviation as we look to 2016 and beyond.","To sum up the third quarter, good margin results across our businesses contributed to a solid overall financial performance. With only a quarter to go, we're adjusting our full-year guidance for earnings by bringing up the bottom of the range by $0.10 and maintaining our outlook for cash flow.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank.","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone.","Segment profit in the quarter was $312 million, up $19 million from the third quarter of 2014 on a $250 million decrease in revenues. Let's review how each of the segments contributed starting with Textron Aviation.","Revenues were up $79 million from this period last year, reflecting higher jet and military deliveries. Aviation had a profit of $107 million compared to $62 million a year ago. This increase reflected the higher volumes, as well as improved performance, which included a lower amortization of $9 million related to fair value step-up adjustments. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1.4 billion, approximately flat with the end of the second quarter.","Moving to Bell, revenues were down $426 million, reflecting lower V-22 deliveries and lower commercial revenues largely related to lower aftermarket volume and a change in the mix of commercial aircraft. Segment profit decreased $47 million from the third quarter of 2014, reflecting the lower volumes partially offset by favorable performance largely related to our cost-reduction activities.","At Textron Systems, revenues were up $62 million primarily due to higher weapons and sensors and unmanned systems volumes. Segment profit was up $12 million, reflecting the impact of the higher volumes.","Industrial revenues increased $43 million due to higher overall volumes partially offset by $59 million of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Segment profit increased $8 million, reflecting the impact of the higher volumes.","Finance segment revenues decreased $8 million and profit increased $1 million.","Moving below the segment profit line, corporate expenses were $27 million, down sequentially from the second quarter, primarily from the impact of lower ending share price. Our tax rate in the quarter was 30.2%. Interest expense was $33 million, down $4 million from last year.","During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 3.1 million of our shares at an overall cost of about $124 million. Year-to-date, we've repurchased approximately 5 million of our shares at an overall cost of about $211 million.","To wrap up with guidance, we are estimating full-year EPS from continuing operations of $2.40 to $2.50 a share and cash flow from continuing operations of the Manufacturing Group before pension contributions of $550 million to $650 million.","That concludes our prepared remarks. So, Brad, we can open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","All right, thank you. And our first question comes from Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks so much. Good morning.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Scott, maybe we'll start off with Aviation. There's been some concern about emerging market weakness in business jet and FAA flight data still being fairly static. I was wondering if you can give us your perspective on what you're seeing out there in terms of customer demand and maybe pricing.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think, Robert, the market in North America, the U.S, has been reasonably strong. I think we're pretty happy with the market in the U.S. There's no question that the markets in Europe and Asia are challenged. I think part of that is just the economies are in a pretty difficult spot and, of course, the U.S. dollar being quite strong puts some additional pressure on that in terms of all the product lines. So there's no question right now our recovery and the strength of the business is largely North American.","In terms of pricing, it mixes by model but, overall, the impact of pricing has been not really material on a quarter-to-quarter basis.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. And then maybe secondly, on Bell, a very good margin performance in the quarter. You think this is sustainable going forward?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Robert, we've been trying to target the business in that 11% to 12% range. Obviously, we took a lot of cost actions earlier this year when we realized the commercial market would be lighter than we expected, so I think we're comfortable with our guidance this year on that 11% to 12% range based on those actions. I think there's always risk on the volume line, I think, but I think we're in a spot right now where we feel pretty good about that 11%, 12% guidance.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And just a quick follow-up on that. The V-22 -- it seems to be a bit volatile from quarter to quarter, is it?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean, it's obviously been stepping down through the year, Robert, on the new contract but, frankly, this quarter was probably a little lighter than it normally would be just in terms of some of the timing of completions of aircraft and acceptances. So it's probably more volatile this quarter than it would normally be. We would have actually planned probably six aircraft sell, there were a couple aircraft that sold right at the very beginning of the next quarter so they just missed the revenue in this quarter.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks so much.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","And the next question will come from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thank you. I just wondered on the Latitude, when we're thinking about the effect of that on Aviation margins from here, as you see deliveries ramp up, do you think there'll be a big negative margin hit, or you can kind of manage it across the fixed cost base?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think we'll manage it within the context of the overall business. So the margin rates, the costs have come in about where we expected on the product. We will as we go into next year in particular because we'll have a number of deliveries into NetJets which typically are a level below our typical retail sales since they are effectively a reseller of those aircraft in a fractional sense. We'll have some lower margin deals in there, but I think it's something we'll be able to manage in the context of the overall business.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. And then on Bell, you talked about commercial deliveries still be up potentially. Maybe just home in on 412s. I think you've delivered nine to-date after 26 in the whole of last year. How are the orders trending there and how do you think about those deliveries looking out?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, there's a fair bit of activity in both late this year and through next year. I think certainly we'll be down in terms of the total number of 412s for the year, but that's kind of what we've been expecting as we've been going through all of our restructuring and production planning.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. And lastly, buyback, a step up to a degree in Q3 as you'd mentioned. Is that just kind of opportunistic around the share price, or is there anything more fundamental there?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, I think it's consistent with what we've been saying, so we'll continue to retire the \u2013 to make sure we're not diluting, and opportunistically we do some additional share buyback and we certainly had some of that activity in the quarter.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Very helpful. Thank you.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","And our next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Yes. What I wanted to ask on the guidance for the year, and this is probably more for Frank. If you look at the high end, Frank, it implies $0.81 in the first quarter. You did $0.76 last year but you had $13 million in special charges, $8 million of beat step-up, interest expense probably $7 million lower, so I net that out as a benefit to this year of $0.07 a share. So if I put it together, you're actually forecasting a couple cents below last year. I figured Bell's going to be down, but Aviation ought to be up by more than what Bell's down and the other sectors probably not much to split. So I just wondering what's wrong with the arithmetic, or are you just kind of being on the conservative side for the guidance?","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, look, I think obviously we've talked a lot about we've got a difficult environment for Bell. We've got kind of we've done a lot on the cost side. But kind of as volumes have come down there, that puts kind of pressure on just the cost structure and cost base at Bell. So, no, I don't \u2013 I think we're being appropriate given the market environment that we're seeing out there and, obviously, we're working hard to achieve those results.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay. And one for Scott. Latitude deliveries, four in the quarter, Scott, I mean, I would have thought maybe there's a little bit more. I mean, is this just timing and could you give us a kind of a ballpark as to what we might see in the fourth quarter?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think it is largely timing, George. We've got the first four aircraft, we've got the certification done obviously and got the first four aircraft out there into the market. We certainly expect to see that ramp as we go through the fourth quarter.","Aircraft is still doing great with customers. I think it's showing very well. We'll have it obviously at NBAA. It's been doing a lot of flying in both the U.S. and Europe. We expect to get the OSIS certification here in the quarter as well, probably late in the quarter going through that process which could have some effect on where we land in terms of total deliveries, but we still feel great about the aircraft. It's flying great. The customers seem to love it, and as I said, we expect to see that ramp as we go through the fourth quarter and obviously into 2016.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","You don't want to put a number on it, though?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I probably wouldn't put a number on a particular model, number of deliveries in a quarter, no.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay. Thanks very much. Good execution.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thanks, George.","Operator","And our next question will come from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Sheila K. Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning, guys.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Sheila.","Sheila K. Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","It looks like we'll see the Longitude at NBAA. Could you maybe just give us an idea how you're thinking about the magnitude of the investment in Cessna overall and further refining the portfolio?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Oh, the investment kind of continues obviously at Cessna. I don't know if the fixed wing aviation has ever had more programs going on at the same time than we have right now but, obviously, the Longitude has been a significant investment and one that we'll continue to make. We're holding our late 2017 entry into service on the aircraft. I think it's going to show beautifully at NBAA. And we'll have some additional announcements, frankly, beyond that in terms of what we're doing with the product portfolio.","So the pace of the investment I certainly expect will continue. We tend not to give a specific number for each of the aircraft or anything, but the R&D is continuing as we've committed and I think that's paying off for us. You've seen what's happened over the last couple years with a lot of the upgrades, the Latitude, obviously, we're very happy with. Longitude, we talk in terms of our single engine turboprop as well as what we're doing to continue to expand our jet portfolio.","Sheila K. Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Okay, thank you. And then just a follow-up on Bell margins. As we look out on the commercial side, how do we think about the impact of the 505 and the 525?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sheila, the 505, given where that part of the market is, is usually dilutive to margin rates. Those aircraft tend to be at a pretty low price point, so there's not a whole lot of margin dollars in them. It tends to make up for that as you look long term in the service business. We still have a huge portion of our service business today at Bell that's driven by jet rangers and 206s, 407, the light single end of the market. But it won't have a material impact in the margin rate.","And, of course, the 525 we expect will certainly be a profitable product, as those tend to be in the larger end, are more profitable in the initial sale. But again, that's something we're talking about entering the service in the latter half of 2017, so it wouldn't affect anything that we would talk about when we get into 2016.","Sheila K. Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Okay. So overall, the commercial business is net neutral to profitability next year. There's no significant impact from the 505 or certification on the 525s?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, there shouldn't be. I mean, the number of 505s in the year next year I don't think will create a material impact in terms of the margin rate.","Sheila K. Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Perfect. Thank you.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","And the next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes, thank you very much. So it looks like both the 412 and the 429 kind of are running light and the smaller helicopters are doing well. What does that imply for Bell revenues for the year? Can you still get \u2013 can you get to $3.5 billion and kind of a flattish fourth quarter in terms of revenues?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Cai, I mean \u2013 it's a good question. If there's any risk to where we're going, it's in that volume and then particularly on the commercial side of the business. But you're right, the volumes have been stronger in the lights than they have been in the light twins or the heavier twins in the 412 side. But I think we're going to be close to the revenue guidance numbers that we've given you guys. There's probably $100 million of risk in it or something like that, but that's \u2013 for the total year, that's probably where we're going to head in terms of the Bell revenue.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, given kind of the ambitious new product kind of plan you've got, as I recall, last year you did about $565 million in R&D and I think you were kind of talking about $600 million for this year. What can you get \u2013 can you update us where is the R&D for this year and how should we think about it going forward?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think we're going to continue to see increases. And so, in the third quarter, we were up slightly in terms of overall R&D spending for the total company. And I think that's a trend that will continue, Cai, and that's largely driven by the investments that we've made in the Latitude, what we're doing in the Longitude and other stuff we'll talk at NBAA in terms of our fixed wing aviation business. And obviously, we're getting close on certification here of the 505, but we have the 525 now in full certification testing, we have a huge investment in the V-280 program and, obviously, a lot of investments across our Industrial and Systems businesses as well. So I think the level of R&D is tracking with kind of what we told you guys to expect.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Well, I think everyone expects the R&D will go up and the revenues generally also are going up. Should we think of the R&D to sales holding approximately flat or is it likely to be up with this ambitious Longitude program?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, I think it's probably flattish, Cai. Obviously, this year we've had some additional headwind in total, but that's largely driven by the fact that we've been seeing this contraction at Bell, principally on the military side, to some degree on the commercial side. But I think our expectations going forward is that it will hold about flattish in terms of percent of sales.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you very much.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","And our next question will come from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much and good morning. I was wondering if I could ask a quick question about Kautex and the exposure to Volkswagen that you have there and whether you expect to see any impact from what's going on there.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, that's very hard to say at this point. VW's obviously an important customer for us, but we're a supplier to the industry in total. At this point, I think it's hard to predict exactly how that's all going to play out. Clearly here in the near term, we've seen a movement from a lot of the small diesel to the petro-based models just because of the situation with sales in that product line.","But I'd say at this point, it's too early to know what's going to happen, how customers are going to react and do they choose other VW models, do they choose models from other manufacturers. I think it's very much still to be determined. And so for us, it becomes a model mix question, both within VW or outside of VW. And at this point, we just don't have a whole lot of data as an industry on what that shift is going to look like. But I, frankly, don't expect it to be a material impact to us one way or the other. The automotive markets have been fairly strong, and I would expect to see them kind of continue on the trajectory. This is really just a question of model mix.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Would you be able to size your \u2013 the percentage of Kautex revenue that comes from VW?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, we wouldn't \u2013 I don't think we would ever publish those numbers. As I say, they're a significant customer, but across a very, very broad range of VW product. And that's why the question in terms of what the mix does, I think a lot of the mix shift, frankly, will be within VW, so it's...","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Okay, thank you.","Operator","And the next question will come from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Scott, if I'm thinking about scenarios for Cessna production in 2016, is a production decline in the scenario analysis or is that off the table, and could you answer that both including and excluding the Latitude?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I won't do it including or excluding certain model types. I would say, Noah, and we want to \u2013 we're not probably ready to get into 2016 guidance just yet, but, clearly, as we have production running today, no, I would not expect to see a decline in volume across any of our product lines.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Jet turboprop single-engine, I think where we're tracking right now in the market, I think we're still running production with expectations that we'll not see declines next year.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And on the margins at Aviation, the incremental both sequentially and year-over-year, stripping out the inventory step-up looks quite nicely ahead of how you guys talk about how that should trend over the long run. Can you parse out what drove the upside in the quarter and how that should trend over the next few quarters?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Noah, it's always \u2013 when we talk about incrementals, it's sort of how to think long term. We kind of talk about this 20% or so kind of number. Obviously, that's a little bit lumpy. We're going to have quarters where we do quite a bit higher than that. This is a good example of such a quarter. But we're going to have quarters where it's going to trend below that. And it largely has to do with how R&D costs are coming in, SG&A shows \u2013 I mean, there's always noise in that number. So I think the guys did a great job of converting on the volume that came through this quarter and it's a very solid performance, so I still think that kind of 20% numbers on an incremental basis are good numbers to use, but there is going to be lumpiness to that.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then just one last one. In Bell commercial, has the oil and gas customer at least stopped getting worse, or is it hard to tell? And where will you exit the year with that customer as a percentage of Bell revenue versus where it started the year?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Noah, I honestly don't have that number. I think we've talked before about the oil and gas segment historically being sort of around that 10%-15% kind of a percent of our sales directly into that oil and gas market. I think our visibility, obviously, that's down this year, so you're not seeing a whole lot of new equipment sales. Utilization is clearly down in those markets, so that's impacting our aftermarket, obviously. I can't tell you that I see the data on enough of a daily basis to say, hey, has it flattened? Is it moving around? I don't really know. I think the trend of utilization being down continues. And in terms of what that means, I don't have the exact number this year to compare it to tell you last year and what that stabilized.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I know that's not much of an answer. Unfortunately, that's one bit of data I don't have, so...","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","It sounds like, I mean, without \u2013 so you don't have the data, but it also sounds like it is not clear that it has actually stopped getting worse, necessarily.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I don't \u2013 I certainly have not anecdotally had any feedback or input from the guys saying, hey, good news as the oil and gas guys are starting to fly more or back looking for new aircraft.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. Okay. Thank you.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","And our next question will come from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sam.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Can you talk a little bit about \u2013 I know you're going to show more on the Longitude, but there were discussions last week about delays on the whole Silvercrest engine line, and can you just talk about how that's impacting the timeline for that plane?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. I mean, I want to sort of stop short of doing product announcements at this point, but I would say that we're certainly aware of what's going on with the Silvercrest. That does not have an impact in terms of the Longitude and its launch date in late 2017. There's a lot of work that's been going on in terms of our portfolio in the jets business, particularly the higher end of our jet business, and I think it will all start to make more sense once you see what happens at NBAA. So we'll talk about our whole product line and portfolio and what's going on there in the large cabin segment for us, and I think it will all make sense in the fact that we have a clear line of sight to Longitude in 2017 and the product portfolio beyond that.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then just to go back, can you talk a little bit about some of the demand in the non-jet programs? Just because we saw both Collins and Garmin talk about some weakness, it seems like that would imply King Airs and some of the Beech products might be having some pressure. Can you just talk about some of the demand in that area?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So if you look at the King Air, the numbers we give you guys, we had 29 in the quarter versus 30 a year ago. We've been a few aircraft lighter in each of the previous quarters as well, so the volume would be down, but only a couple, two, three aircraft on a year-over-year basis. So the King Air, I think, is continuing to do fine.","Caravan deliveries will be, in my view, roughly, probably flat on a year-over-year basis. We've had a little bit of softness in China. We've had some good-sized orders in China as well, so Caravans will be kind of flattish on a year-over-year basis. And, frankly, I think we'll be up and we're already up on a year-over-year basis in our piston product line, which are all Garmin as well. So I think if you looked at our year-to-date performance in aircraft at our Garmin base relative to their comments (31:27) marketplace, we're actually up and expect to be up for the total year.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, great. And one last question is can you just talk a little bit about the Canadian TAPV program? I know it's somewhat unrelated, but the election seems like it might have some impact on what Canada does in the aircraft programs. Has there been anything that would affect the demand or the timing or schedule for TAPV at this point?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Nothing political, certainly. I mean, we've had no indications that there's any change in their strategy with respect to this program. We are in the test phase of the program. And as we talked, this is kind of a race to the end of the fourth quarter, whether we get deliveries this year or we get them in the next year. So the test program continues. Guys are working it. But in terms of any jeopardy or risk from the change politically, we're certainly not aware of any.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","But now sitting at the end of October, you haven't really started the delivery ramp yet in the fourth quarter?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. No, that's correct.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning, guys.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So quick question, I guess, for Frank. What's going on with the balance sheet? Inventories are up $600 million in the quarter, and it just seems like the balance sheet's getting a little bloated. And just curious what's going on?","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, so we've had \u2013 we've seen a little bit of inventory build. Obviously, we're very seasonal in terms of kind of what happens with inventories. We had planned the year a little stronger at Bell commercial and we've seen kind of less volume there, as we've indicated, than we would have thought, and the year has been a little bit more backend-loaded than we would have thought. So kind of nothing that is troubling in any perspective, but it is kind of something that we continue to watch. We, obviously, also have been building inventory as we've ramped the Latitude program, and so kind of just in terms of how those kind of the Latitude program will grow from a volume standpoint, we need to begin to flow that inventory through the system. So that has a bit of an impact as well.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Do you have any white tail helicopters sitting in inventory?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We don't talk about kind of white tails in any of this, right? We have production plans. We have delivery forecasts and we try and match those up as best we can. And on the helicopter side, kind of unlike the jet side, you also have long completion activity at times. So kind of how long it takes from kind of beginning to fabricate to actually delivering a helicopter can vary dramatically, depending on the configuration of that helicopter. So there's a fair amount of volatility to that.","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Keep in mind we took our production cut in the second quarter of this year. It's now just the third quarter, so it takes some time to catch up with that flow through the...","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think what Doug said, Ron, is when we start these things down the line, we're not going to stop them, so we did cut production schedules. But for the stuff that was in the pipeline, obviously, we can continue that stuff and build it out.","In terms of the white tail, remember, there's nobody \u2013 you have to flow production, right? So there are certainly orders for all those models of aircraft that go out into 2016. The question's going to be whether \u2013 how many of those you do get completed and finished and able to deliver in 2015, but any that are not are already spoken for in orders that you look at in 2016. So there's not aircraft that we don't know what's ever going to happen to that aircraft.","But we were running production lines at a higher pace, we cut that back in the second quarter. We are going to finish \u2013 go through the final assembly up to the green stage of an aircraft. And then in the helicopter market, the level of customization usually is pretty significant, so those things will then go into the completion process prior to delivery. They're not sitting on a ramp, typically, in a deliverable form.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got you.","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I ought to mention, we had a couple V-22s that delivered a week later. So had we measured the balance sheet a week later, it would have had a significant improvement. So it's mostly timing, Ron.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, okay. Fair enough. And then just completely changing gears, what's going on in the golf cart market? How are you guys doing with share and are you seeing any pickup there? Your primary competitor in that market said they've seen some growth in that market. Just curious about what's going on. Nobody ever talks about golf carts.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We talk about golf carts all the time, you guys just never ask about them. No, our golf business is doing great. I'm really happy with it. Our product lineup is in good shape. We've had some nice additions to the family this year in terms of some of the \u2013 more on the utility side of the product line in addition to just the basic golf cart. And the business is doing really well.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So are you seeing growth, do you think?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We certainly see some growth, sure.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. Cool. Thanks, guys.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","And our next question will come from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning, gents. Just a couple of follow-ups, I guess, covered a lot of ground here. Just back to Cessna margins, I mean, to one of the earlier questions, sequentially, they were actually quite strong and, Scott, you kind of just suggested that's kind of the normal lumpiness and everything going on in the business. But given that lumpiness and our inability to kind of forecast that sort of thing, can you triangulate us a little bit on actually what you're expecting for Cessna margins in the fourth quarter as part of this guidance construct?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Probably not, Jeff. I mean, look, this is why we do the annual guidance because we do get lumps through the quarters in all of our businesses, right? So I think the margin performance \u2013 look, we're not going to be able to sustain 40%-plus incrementals on volume, obviously, so I think we will expect to see a considerably lower margin conversion on what growth there is in the fourth quarter.","But we'll be probably \u2013 look, I think we'll end up a little bit north of our yearly guidance range that we gave you back in the beginning of the year. The performance in the business has been quite good in items of its conversion, so I think the \u2013 frankly, compared to the annual guidance number we gave you, we're likely to be light on the revenue side. We've been sort of struggling through that all year. I mean, I think we're doing okay. As I said, I think the U.S. market, the North American market is good. The international markets have been tougher probably than we expected, which means we're, probably from an overall annual guidance, going to be lower on revenue but probably up a little bit in terms of the margin rate from the full year range.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. And then just on Latitude, has there been any meaningful change in order intake on that aircraft now that it's flying and available? Can you provide any color there and any impact that it may have had on other products in the product line?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I mean, we're selling them which is good, right? So I think it's been well-received in the marketplace. So we are booking orders. And we've always \u2013 look, there could be some cannibalization within the family, obviously, as you add more products, but we're also up a little bit on Sovereign sales in the quarter as well. So the Sovereign Plus continues to sell as well. Really, those two aircraft are similar, but it's a question whether you want a larger cabin and give up a little bit of range, and single club plus two or you want to go with the big double club and a little bit more range on the Sovereign side. So both aircraft right now are doing well in the market.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","All right. And then just one last one for Frank. It's the time of the year to be thinking about pensions again. Can you give us any color, Frank, on kind of snap the line today on the various metrics, what we might expect in the next year on headwinds or cash funding?","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Jeff, as I always say, there's still a lot of moving pieces. But I think from a cash funding standpoint, we don't expect kind of a need to make any contributions into the defined benefit plan, sort of our defined contribution plan sort of be similar to this year's levels.","And from an expense standpoint, a lot of moving parts will not be a headwind unless something were to change dramatically and should be a little bit of a tailwind and, again, it depends on where things come out in terms of returns and discount rates and stuff like that.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. I think last quarter at Cessna, the aftermarket was a shade lower year-on-year. I'm just curious, can you give us some spot on the Aviation aftermarket trends as well as the Bell aftermarket trends?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Look, I think the fixed wing aviation market this year on the aftermarket is going to be pretty flattish. And I think that just reflects sort of utilization, what utilization numbers that we see in the U.S. around takeoff cycles and such is up a little bit. I think the data is not as good internationally, but it feels like it's probably down a little bit. So kind of netting out the two, I think ex-the incrementals obviously that we're going to see from the first quarter numbers of the additional Beech and (41:25) aftermarket, I think the overall organic number is going to be pretty flattish. On the Bell side, it's going to be down and that's just, I think, not to be unexpected given what's going on in utilization in the helicopter business.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","In the Bell side, is that a deceleration or is that kind of consistent quarter-on-quarter?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Quarter-on-quarter.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I'm just curious if you're seeing aftermarket deterioration.","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It was a little stronger in the beginning of the year.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And the only other follow-up for me was on cash flow. So just for the year, and I guess following up on Ron's question, it looks like you'd be probably at the lower end of the range for this year, maybe given kind of performance year-to-date, but maybe in 2016 given the inventory build, you might have a cleaner trajectory to have a little bit better cash conversions. Is that the right way to think about it?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think it's all dependent on how volume plays out here in the balance of the year, right? I mean, you get down to the end of the year, every dollar of revenue translates into a dollar of cash. But I think the way you've categorized it, obviously, we think if things go the way we'd like to see them go, we'll be in fine shape in terms of the cash guidance number that we've given you. Obviously, I think this rolls over into 2016, but our current plans would have us solidly in the guidance that we've given you.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","And the next question comes from Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Yeah, good morning, guys. I just had a question about the TRU simulator business, just because you guys have called out the 737 MAX opportunity as being fairly sizeable, and I'm just wondering when the first simulator delivery would be and kind of how fast the ramp is.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, the initial \u2013 the contract that we talked about before is with Boeing to provide their 737 MAX for their flight test programs and their training centers. They've already exercised the first few incremental units to go into their training centers, and there's a number of options left to be exercised on that.","I think beyond that the ramp is really going to be driven by individual airlines, as they get closer to taking deliveries of their 737 MAXes, so that's probably still a ways downstream just given the schedule of the 737 MAX coming into the market.","But the development program, which is what it is at this stage of the game working with Boeing to bring that to the market, is going very well. I think we're happy with how the product's coming along and have a lot of engagement with them and are in the process of assembling and building that first unit for their use.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Scott, (44:11) thank you.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, good morning, everyone. Frank, can you talk a little bit about Systems backlog and what you expect seasonally as we move into the fourth quarter and how quickly you'd expect the backlog that you have there to convert into revenues?","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Oh, there's so many pieces to a Systems backlog and it's lumpy. So, no, I don't know that I can give you great guidance in terms of kind of how that backlog rolls out.","I think we feel good about our kind of sold position, if you will, for Systems for kind of near-term revenue realization, so Systems is a lot more about execution. Obviously, we need to continue to take orders and execute on foreign military sales and all the things that we've talked about on the Systems side, but that backlog does provide a path towards near-term revenue performance as long as we execute on those programs.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay; great. And then you talked a little bit about the H-1 ramp. Can you talk about the impact on margins in the out years as the H-1 ramps?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think it's only goodness for us, right? I mean, it's a very solid program, the incremental volume which we've just received that order which includes the next lots of the Marine Corps, as well as starting now the Pakistan deal. So those incrementals, as we \u2013 they'll probably have a little bit of benefit in 2016 as we start \u2013 stuff goes into the production cycle, obviously, but the revenue recognition and margin deliveries will be 2017 and 2018, but certainly any additional volume is good for us incrementally. So probably not a material impact in 2016 but beneficial to us in 2017, 2018 as we see that increased number of deliveries. You add six to 10 H-1s a year, that's good business.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Right. Okay, great. And then, Scott, what do you think the earliest timeframe is for volume increase in the V-22s, given the international demand that's come in?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it's probably pretty similar actually. We now have the options that have been exercised to support the first five for Japan, and it's a similar kind of story, right? We'll start -- the long lead activity in production will start to ramp a little bit in 2016, but those deliveries technically are slated to 2018. I think there's possibility that we can try to get a couple of those pulled back to 2017, but we'll have to work on the customer as we go forward but \u2013 so not a lot of impact in 2016; beneficial certainly in 2017 and 2018.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then last one. Frank, what are you assuming for corporate expenses end of (47:19) year, end of the fourth quarter that's baked into your guidance?","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, we had been in the $175 million from a guidance standpoint. It should be lighter than that. Some of that is share price performance year-to-date. But we've got pretty good cost control going on, so we'll be less than that $175 million number.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, great. Thanks, everyone.","Operator","And the next question will come from Johnny Wright with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Good morning, guys. So just sticking on the V-22 and the H-1 kind of the international side, how do you kind of size the opportunity there from an order perspective in terms of where are you looking at, where's the best opportunities on the H-1 and the V-22 and how should we expect that to play out over the next few years?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, look, we always struggle with predicting foreign military sales. And there's a number of customers that are, I would say, in active discussions on both V-22 and H-1. The difficulty on these things is just the timing of how long does it take to come to closure on. And I think it took a lot longer, frankly, than we would have expected on V-22 for the first deal to come in, but it did come in which is good, so I think that generates some momentum for us. We are in discussions. We collectively, ourselves and the U.S. government, with several other V-22 potential customers and several H-1 customers as well.","And so I've only been wrong 100% of the time when it comes to trying to predict the timing from those deals transitioning from discussions to under contract. So I would say I have a high degree of confidence that they will come to contract. The timing is hard to predict.","Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay, well, appropriate. I have another question for you --","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's probably not a very fulfilling answer but, look, it's the reality. FMS deals are just difficult to come all the way to closure.","Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Well, this is going to be appropriate then. So, Scorpion -- where are we at from an FMS standpoint? How do you kind of see the demand playing out there and, timing-wise, where do you think it's most likely to fall now in terms of first order?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the criticality for us on Scorpion right now is really around certification. The aircraft has been seen and flown by a lot of prospective customers. They're very excited about the aircraft. They love the performance. They love the price point. We need to get a certification program going. I think we're very close to doing that.","Obviously from our internal perspective, the production of the conforming aircraft to go into flight test cert is coming along very well. We expect that conforming aircraft to be flying in probably the first into the second quarter next year.","And I think that as a result of a lot of work over the past year, we are getting pretty close to having a clean path to an airworthiness certification, which is critical to be able to close deals with customers. I think there's a lot of interest. But the certification box is one we need to be able to check, so we're doing everything we need to do to take care of all the design and manufacturing side of it, and I think here pretty shortly we'll have a clear path to be able to talk to customers about the certification process, which is going to be good and critical to closing on first orders.","Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","So is it fair to assume something like second half 2016 first order, so shipment in 2017 maybe, is that a best-case assumption?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Something along those timelines, that's...","Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Yeah. Okay, great. Thanks, guys.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","And our next question is going to come from Justin Bergner with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead, sir.","Justin Laurence Bergner - Gabelli & Company","Good morning, Scott. Good morning, Frank.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Justin.","Justin Laurence Bergner - Gabelli & Company","Most of my questions have been answered. I was going to ask in regards to Textron Aviation margins, is there anything in the 2015 margin performance that will stand out as a positive that creates headwinds as we look into sort of the potential for 2016 Aviation margins?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, I don't think so. There's no unusual or no onetime kind of stuff in there. I mean, that's \u2013 as reported, it's pretty clean.","Justin Laurence Bergner - Gabelli & Company","Okay, great. And second question, as you sort of move on from \u2013 or I guess as the Sikorsky deal moves toward completion and as you hopefully work down your inventory and have a lighter balance sheet, have free cash flow priorities changed at all in the organization or perhaps just give us an update as to where they stand today?","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's exactly the same which is, obviously, we're continuing to invest heavily back into organic growth of the business, but kind of that's not a \u2013 necessarily flows through the cash flow statement item, but it's to focus on some of our free cash flow and acquisitions to the extent available and we continue to do that. And then otherwise to the extent there's excess cash, to return that through opportunistic share repurchase activities. So it all remains the same level of priorities.","Justin Laurence Bergner - Gabelli & Company","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","And our next question will come from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Yeah, just a couple of follow-ups. Could you give us, Scott, what percent of the orders in the quarter were from North America in Aviation?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Aviation, it's roughly around 80%\/20% right now, George.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay. And the percentage of commercial helicopters that you see to the oil and service business?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Quite low.","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's what we were saying earlier, George, we don't really have good data on that. It's kind of hard, for one thing, sometimes you sell a helicopter to a utility operator and what the end use of that is sometimes a little difficult to discern.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we have \u2013 I mean, we have a number of \u2013 there's a number of big helicopter operators out there, George, and they put those helicopters into use for \u2013 remember, they're \u2013 we don't usually sell directly to an oil and gas guy. We sell to these helicopter operators who are then under contract, but they have contracts with oil and gas operators, they have contracts with emergency medical services operators, they have contracts with utility operators.","So, we have to be careful. I can't just say, hey, I sold a helicopter to that firm. What's their end use? And, frankly, they could repurpose the flight, and you see that, right? So there's guys out there right now that probably have fewer contract hours with oil and gas guys but they've repurposed that aircraft to go execute either utility or emergency medical services or things like that.","So it's kind of not really a number I have specifically that we can track exactly directly through it. Obviously, there's some guys out there that almost all they do is oil and gas and we know that, but I think that the number \u2013 and the reason I say it's quite low I really think most of these guys right now are repurposing aircraft into other markets other than oil and gas, and the aircraft that they are taking from us are primarily going into service in emergency medical and applications like that.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Yeah, okay. So you're kind of making a guesstimate and figuring it's a pretty low number?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I mean, we work with these customers, we know them, but it's not something that \u2013 there's no system tracking this. It's really just our knowledge of what are their flight hours, what are they repurposing. And, again, it's more anecdotal, right? It's not, okay, I can tell you it's 17 helicopters this year got switched over from oil and gas. We don't have that kind of a hard number for you, so it's more of a color discussion.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay. And then just a last quick one. Aftermarket growth in the Aviation business, I assume it was kind of flat to down a little bit consistent with what you've been saying for the year.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Correct. It was pretty flat.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay. Thanks very much again.","Operator","And no further questions in queue at this time.","Douglas R. Wilburne - Vice President-Investor Relations","Okay.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Doug Wilburne, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Douglas R. Wilburne - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Stacy, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release.","On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO, and; Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.","Textron's revenues in the quarter were $3.5 billion, up $264 million from last year's second quarter. Income from continuing operations was $0.66 per share, up 10% from $0.60 reported in last year's second quarter. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was a $26 million use of cash compared to a positive $106 million cash flow in last year's second quarter.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everybody. Before I discuss our results, I would like to comment on the Bell 525 accident, which occurred on July 6 during developmental test flight and tragically claiming the lives of two Bell pilots. Both pilots were highly regarded individuals, well-respected members of Bell's team and very experienced test pilots. We will miss them greatly and keep them and their families in our thoughts and prayers.","We're currently providing assistance to the NTSB in support of the investigation to understand exactly what caused the accident. We've suspended flight test activities on the program until we determine the cause of the accident. In the meantime, we're proceeding with all non-flight related certification and program activities. At this time, we do not have an estimate as to when flight testing might resume or the length of delay in certification or first deliveries. We do remain committed to the Bell 525 program and we'll work to ensure the aircraft will be a safe, reliable and high-performance helicopter.","Moving to the quarter, revenues were up 8.1%, reflecting our ongoing investments in both new products and acquisitions. Segment revenue was up at Systems, Industrial, and Aviation, while down at Bell consistent with our expectations. At Bell, we delivered 6 V-22s, flat with last year's second quarter, 9 H-1s, up from six units last year, and 24 commercial helicopters, down from 39 a year ago.","On the commercial side, our new 505 Jet Ranger X continues to generate strong interest in the marketplace and certification activities remain on track to support initial deliveries at the end of this year.","On the customer service front, during the quarter, we opened a new paint and delivery center in Prague to provide full aircraft completion and delivery capabilities to customers in the region.","Moving to the military side of the business, during the second quarter, we received an order for an additional V-22 under the current multi-year contract for delivery to the U.S. Air Force, and earlier this week, we also received an order for four additional V-22s for delivery to Japan and we continue to work with the DoD to identify sufficient quantities, both domestically and internationally, to support a third multi-year contract.","We also continue to make progress on assembling our first V-280 aircraft as we reached an important milestone of mating the wing and nacelles to the aircraft fuselage in late April, bringing us one step closer to our scheduled first flight next year. We displayed our full-scale mockup at Farnborough last week and had significant interest from a large number of international customers.","Moving to Systems, revenues were up significantly from the first quarter and last year, reflecting international weapons deliveries and higher unmanned aircraft volumes.","On the TAPV program at TMLS, we're making final preparations with our Canadian customer to begin deliveries next month.","At our Unmanned Systems business, we received a contract for upgrading an additional 24 Shadow systems, which takes us through the end of 2018 for this program. The Shadow system also reached a major milestone during the quarter achieving 1 million hours of in-service operation.","Finally, at Systems, earlier this year we acquired a small business located in Newport News, Virginia called Airborne Tactical Advantage Company or ATAC. This business provides tactical flight training and air adversary services to the U.S. Navy, Airforce and Marine Corps using a fleet of 27 fighter and tactical aircraft flown by former U.S. military fighter pilots.","During the quarter, ATAC was awarded a new contract with U.S. Navy worth up to $43 million over the next year. ATAC is a great fit for the company as it has significant synergies with a number of our businesses and a good growth outlook as we believe the U.S. DoD and foreign militaries will increasingly rely on third parties to provide live airborne threat training services.","Moving to Industrial, we saw an 8.3% increase in revenues, reflecting growth at Kautex and Specialized Vehicles. At Specialized Vehicles, we began shipping our newest Bad Boy Off Road product, the Stampede 900, a recreational 4 x 4 utility vehicle with unmatched power and unrivaled hauling and storage capacity. We expect the Stampede will contribute to top line growth as this product taps into an entirely new market for this business.","During the quarter, we also acquired Premier Engineering & Manufacturing, a producer of deicing vehicles for the aviation industry. Premier will be part of our ground and support business, which continues to grow nicely as airlines and airports invest in our infrastructure.","At Kautex, we continue to see good volume growth, reflecting ongoing adoption of our Selective Catalytic Reduction product lines.","Moving to Textron Aviation, revenues were up $72 million, while profits were down $7 million. The increase in revenues reflected delivery of 45 jets in the quarter compared to 36 last year and 23 King Airs compared to 30 last year. The increase in jets reflected nine Latitudes, including our first delivery to NetJets. The Latitude continues to do well in the market with superior performance, range, comfort, and operating costs, and customer acceptance has been strong, including sales of fractions by NetJets to their own customers. As a result, NetJets increased their total expected contract requirement from 150 units to 200 units and accelerated their delivery schedule. However, launch pricing for the Latitude has been less than what we had hoped for due to competitive dynamics in this segment of the market, resulting in a lower per plane margin contribution.","Looking forward, while a large portion of our capacity is currently allocated to NetJets, we continue to see strong end-customer demand, which has translated to improved pricing for second half and next year deliveries. Overall, we believe we're still on track for our Aviation segment profit outlook, although our margins will likely be at the lower end of the range with slightly higher volumes of expected Latitudes.","Longitude development continues to progress as we mated the wing and nacelles to the aircraft fuselage on our first aircraft in May and powered the electrical distribution systems three weeks later. We're on track for first flight later this summer and the aircraft continues to generate significant interest as customers anticipate its entry into service late next year.","On the Service front, we opened our newest line maintenance station in Bremen, expanding our support offerings in Germany and throughout Europe.","Moving to the Scorpion, the program is gaining momentum as we have begun the U.S. DoD accreditation process with this week's signing of a cooperative research and development agreement with United States Air Force. Also, production of the conforming aircraft is nearly complete with first flight expected next month. We believe having the accreditation process underway and the conforming aircraft available for demo flights will help facilitate initial sales of the aircraft.","Last week at Farnborough, we also announced that we were selected by the team of QinetiQ and Thales to supply Scorpion jets for their bid on the UK's Air Support to Defense Operational Training program should they win the competition.","To sum up, demand in our end markets has been challenging, but we continue to believe that our new products and recent acquisitions will continue to contribute to overall growth in revenue, earnings and cash for the year.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank.","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Scott and good morning, everyone. Segment profit in the quarter was $328 million, up $22 million from the second quarter of 2015 on a $264 million increase in revenues.","Let's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation. At Textron Aviation, revenues were up $72 million from this period last year, primarily due to volume and mix. Segment profit was $81 million, down from $88 million a year ago, primarily reflecting an unfavorable impact from the mix of products sold in the period. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1.1 billion, $122 million higher than at the end of the first quarter.","Moving to Bell, revenues were down $46 million, primarily due to volume and mix. Segment profit decreased $20 million from the second quarter of 2015 reflecting the lower volume and mix.","At Textron Systems, revenues were up $165 million, primarily due to higher volumes in our Weapons and Sensors and Unmanned product lines. Segment profit was up $39 million, reflecting the higher volumes and mix.","Industrial revenues increased $77 million due to higher overall volumes and the impact of acquisitions. Segment profit increased $13 million, reflecting the higher volumes. Finance segment revenues decreased $4 million and profit decreased $3 million.","Moving below the segment line, corporate expenses were $31 million compared to $33 million last year. Interest expense was $37 million, up $5 million from last year.","On the tax front, the Internal Revenue Service approved a settlement on July 11 of our 1998 to 2008 tax years. As a result, in the third quarter we expect to record an income tax benefit including the reversal of accrued interest of approximately $315 million, of which approximately $200 million, or $0.74 per share, is attributable to continuing operations. The settlement results in an immaterial net benefit to consolidated cash during the year.","To wrap up with guidance, we are reiterating our expected full-year EPS from continuing operations of $2.60 to $2.80 per share exclusive of the tax settlement. We also continue to expect cash flow from continuing operations of the manufacturing group before pension contributions of $600 million to $700 million.","That concludes our prepared remarks. So, Stacy, we can open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. And our first question will go to Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Carter.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Scott, I wondered if you could speak to the Aviation margin. I know you talked about last quarter when we did the incremental math, the Longitude R&D being elevated ahead of that first flight. Can you quantify how much of an impact that would have had on the incremental this quarter?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Carter, it did have incremental impact for sure. It wasn't probably quite as significant as it was in the first quarter. I would say probably most importantly from an R&D standpoint, in the first half Aviation had pretty high levels of spending, and that really was largely around getting ready for the Longitude first flights and flight test programs. So we've incurred an awful lot of R&D. So our total year number is still going to be about what we thought it was, but there will be a significant reduction in the second half, just associated with the fact that we're just about complete with the high spending load on the Longitude program.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And on the pricing impact you talked about on Latitude, what gives you the confidence that the pricing improves as you exit this year and into next year?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the fact that we already have a lot of aircraft sold, and so we're looking at actuals in terms of the realized pricing that we're seeing in the second half of the year and going into 2017 versus the pricing that we had realized on the aircraft that were already shipped in the first and second quarter. So there's no change in the NetJet pricing. That's a fixed number through the period. But when you look at retail aircraft sales, whole (12:31) aircraft sales to end customers, what's already in our book is higher in the back half of the year and into 2017 than what we've experienced in the first half of the year.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Just wanted to make sure it was in the backlog. Thanks. I'll let somebody else ask.","Operator","And we'll go to Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Just wondered on the Aviation side of things. So, I guess, if you look classically, you do have a very healthy second half versus first-half margin ramp. Should we take from your prepared comments that the margins in the back half are flattish year-on-year with the second half of last year in that segment?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Oh, I'm sorry, Julian. I haven't looked, I guess, in the numbers in front of me just in terms of the comparable from 2015 to 2016 on the second half. But, certainly incrementally as we usually see, you can certainly expect better margin rates as we go through the second half of the year versus the first, in part driven by the fact that we normally have higher volumes and we would certainly expect to see that. But, also as I mentioned, we'll have lower R&D spending as well within that segment.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. But you still think you can get to about 8.5% for the year as a whole in Aviation?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's correct.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you. And then on Bell, just very quickly, any color you could provide there on the trends in the commercial side, particularly after market, and I guess there as well, the margins year-to-date running at sort of the low-end of the original full year guide. Should we expect a sort of second half pick up in that?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think we will have a second half pick up. Look, the end markets in the commercial helicopter business remain very challenging. What's most critical for us, obviously, is around our 412s. I think we still have a reasonable line of sight on meeting where we need to be this year on 412s. As I kind of mentioned on the last quarter, we think there's some \u2013 a number of opportunities out there that we're working on, which hopefully will give us some better visibility into the future. But at least in terms of how we think the year will close out at Bell for 2016, I think it'll be consistent with our expectations.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","And we'll go to the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, Scott. Good morning. Just wondering if you could just walk us around the world and talk about demands, generally speaking, across your varied segments in North America and Europe, and then maybe over into the Middle East and Asia?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think if you look to the Aviation business Jason, the U.S. remains, probably, the strongest market. We've seen, particularly, earlier in the year a little bit of an uptick in Europe, which has been encouraging. Obviously, we saw a fair bit of dislocation here everywhere in the world in the last few weeks of the quarter with the whole reaction to Brexit. I don't think any of that is actually fundamental at a macro level with Brexit, but just the upset in the financial markets create a lot of uncertainty which kind of froze things up. But, I think other than that we've seen a bit of a strengthening in Europe. South America is still very difficult. I think there's some opportunities that are starting to show in some places, like Argentina, that are starting to improve modestly, but Brazil, most of the economies down there are still very, very challenged.","Middle East, there's activity certainly across most of our businesses, but again, it's a challenging environment. The conflict or wars that are going on down there have a lot of the governments fairly distracted and focused on pretty immediate needs as opposed to much in the way of long-term work. But there certainly are opportunities that are in the works.","That Southeast Asia, frankly, is probably one of the healthiest on the international markets in terms of opportunity. There's \u2013 economies are a little more diversified and are doing okay. China continues to be okay for us. It's not the strength of the growth maybe that it was the past, but it's certainly, generally speaking, solid particularly in the Aviation segment.","So, automotive, I think our numbers fairly well match what you see going on in the world. The European market actually has been kind of stronger. North America has had general strength, but there's more strength in the larger vehicles, in the trucks and the high end than there are in some of the smaller models, just, I think, reflecting the price of gas. So, I don't think that you were seeing anything, probably, that would surprise you a lot versus just what's going on in general in terms of what GDP looks like in these various regions.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. And then, Scott, you made some comments about conversations with customers on the Longitude. I'm just wondering if you could give us a little flavor for how you think pricing is going to shape up in that, given the fact that we had goalposts moved on us a little bit here on the Latitude? And what kind of customer mix are you expecting here out of the gate on the Longitude? Are we going to be selling into the fractional advantage or is this more directly into customers on a one-off basis?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think at this point we expect it to be primarily just end-use customers on the Longitude. We've had, kind of, our normal customers have been in to Wichita pretty extensively looking at the aircraft. As you may recall, we had a full, not just a mockup, but a full aircraft that we displayed last year, and we kept that aircraft at the plant. We've had lots of people coming in to look at it.","And with respect to pricing, I think our challenge on Latitude is that our competitor in that space has two aircraft, right. One which is a little bit of the smaller aircraft, which is really what we thought we would end up competing with, with the Latitude. That was sort of our intention. And then they've got a larger aircraft, and those two aircraft have created a pricing problem. And I think our performance and our range, were far superior to the smaller aircraft, which is where we wanted to be, but they're just kind of using the larger aircraft to try to compete with us. And that's really what's generated a lot of the pricing problem.","When you look at Longitude, that's kind of a combination now where you have the much larger aircraft and, frankly, performance and range that I think will distinguish us very nicely from where the competition is. And so, certainly our expectation is that we have a much better pricing position because we can distance ourselves in terms of the performance and capability of that aircraft, and there's not another aircraft the competitor has sitting on top of that to try to bring down on price to compete with it.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go to the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Sam.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey. I was surprised that you guys didn't buy any stock in this quarter. And I know at the end of the last quarter you only had about 4.5 million shares left in your authorization. So, can you talk a little bit about, philosophically, how you're dealing with that? And then typically when does the board look at that as to whether you need to expand the buyback?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Sam, we did an awful lot of buying in the first quarter, so we did back off a little bit on the second quarter. But I wouldn't attribute it to the share shelf that's sitting there. We still do have 4.5 or so million available under that. But if we thought it was the right thing to do, we've had these discussions with the board, and there'd be no problem going back and extending that authorization. So it's just \u2013 we haven't officially taken that action because we still have enough that's available to exercise under the previous authorizations that we haven't taken up formal board action. But, obviously, there would have to be a discussion with the board. We have had preliminary discussions, and I wouldn't expect that that would be an issue.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then on the Aviation side, the $120 million or so increase in the backlog, is that driven by any particular products or any way to look into that and say, there's a trend there?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we're trying, Sam, not to go model by model in terms of backlog. But it would be a pretty safe assumption that Latitude is driving the bulk of that.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","And we'll go to the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Noah.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Scott, I don't know how far or deep you'll go, but I just wanted to stay on that last question, if possible. It would be really helpful to be able to understand. We see the headline backlog in the headline book-to-bill being better in the quarter. It'd be great to understand how much of that is NetJets Latitude aircraft folding into the backlog, as you've said, you'll do it carefully, versus something at Beech versus just pure underlying regular old business jet?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, no. Again, I don't think we want to get into the specifics on a model by model basis when we haven't done that in quite some time. But, look, I think it's not just NetJet. I think we've been pretty open about the fact that Latitude is selling well. And our expectations for the year was that the overall market would be generally fairly flattish from last year in terms of most of the model types, and most of the growth would be driven by the big new product introduction, which in this case this year is Latitude. And so I think that expectation is kind of what we're seeing.","We are seeing good demand on the Latitude, both on the NetJet as well as on the retail side. And other models are selling fine; they're selling consistent with how we expected. Some models are stronger than others, but in general, the volume on the jet side is what we expected and the thing that's driving the upside in terms of growth on a year-over-year basis. And then we would continue to expect to see that as we roll into next year is based on Latitude. And so the bulk of that increase in backlog, I would say, is going to be attributed to that, both NetJet and retail sales.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. I understand the desire to not get into specific aircraft, but just the NetJet situation alone is pretty unique. And if there were zero NetJets brought into backlog versus if there were 15 to 20, it's a difference between a book-to-bill of 1.1 and of 0.8. It just kind of makes a big difference. I don't know if you guys would consider breaking that out today or in the future or whatever. But...","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Look, Noah, we're not trying to do this on purpose. This is (23:23) competitively very important, I think. I think our competitors and whatnot would love to know which aircraft have what kind of backlog. And I, we can give you guys the absolute number. We can give you the color around sort of where it's going, but I don't think I need to damage the business by providing my competitors a lot of information on where we stand on sales of which aircraft.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. I understand. What's your sense, Scott, of why market-wide used inventory is now back on an upward trend in business jet?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, on a personal note, in total, it is. For the numbers, I'm sure I read all the stuff that you guys read, but there's an awful lot of mix down within that, right? I would say that if you look at our aircraft and, particularly, in that light mid-size, it's been relatively stable. And, frankly, the market's healthy. So the amount of turn, the number of sales that are going on has been fine. So when we look at the amount of used aircraft sales that we had in a quarter versus the previous quarter, it's up. We see the number of transactions that are in our space, involving our aircraft seem to be doing fine. And we see relatively stable residual values. So there's different dynamics, obviously, in terms of what sizes of aircraft and there are different markets. Right? I mean, the heavy iron market behaves differently than the light jet market. So actually for us and for our customers that are looking to sell used aircraft, buy used aircraft, it's been pretty stable, both pricing and volume.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay.","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And, Noah, just to be clear, the availability of used Citations is not up on a percentage basis. It's down slightly from where it was at the first quarter.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Right. And that's kind of what I'm saying. There's just a lot of variability from aircraft model by model, sizes of aircraft, that you really have to go through all the details. But I think in the Citation side, we haven't seen much change. It looks fine.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Just finally, then, with all of that and everything today, and it being a little more than halfway through this year, where would you pin the likelihood of up versus flat versus down Cessna production next year?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Oh, I'm probably not quite ready to do 2017 yet, Noah. But, we certainly feel like, our view has been generally that markets are fairly flat, but new products matter. And that's what we saw last year, that's what we're seeing this year. We're not ready to do 2017 guidance. Obviously, we still feel very good about where the Latitude is in the market and its trend in terms of its demand. And obviously as we get into next year, we'll hit Longitude towards the latter part of the year. So I think that'll help us as well. But, again, I think that'll be positive. Longitude will be positive. Latitude will be positive. It's too early to make a call on just the base market, I guess.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","And we'll go to the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.","Douglas R. Wilburne - Vice President-Investor Relations","Are you on mute, George?","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Good morning.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, George.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Scott, I wanted to try and pin you down a little bit more on R&D. It was up $11 million, I think, in the first quarter. You said it was up less this quarter, though I kind of figured maybe $5 million. And then do we get a $5 million or $10 million drop in each of the subsequent quarters for the rest of the year?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's about right, George.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Pardon?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's about right.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay. And then, Frank, what was the aftermarket growth in the Aviation sector?","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It was good. It was kind of high single digits type year-over-year.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","So that's a step up from what we've been seeing as more mid-single digits in the prior quarters?","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, we also had \u2013 I think we were healthy on our historic organic side of the business, and of course we also have Able, which is in the Aviation Services business, which is still coming in as an M&A transaction on a year-over-year basis. And that business is doing well.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay. And the weaker King Airs in the quarter, Scott, is that just how it fell in the quarter? Or are you seeing impact from oil affecting King Air demand?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean, there's a little bit of that, George. I'm not sure that it's just specifically oil and gas. But the King Air has had a strong international marketplace, is a big part of that business, and it's a good part of the business. And it has certainly been a little bit weaker in the first half of the year. And we've, obviously, made some accommodation for that and think it'll be a little bit weaker than we'd like it to be. But again, I think that's mostly driven by a lot of international markets that are just a little softer right now.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","And lastly, you mentioned talking about pricing up across the product line. Is that pretty much across all the products? Is it more the lower end products versus the higher end? Wonder if you can expand a little bit more on that.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Our product pricing in general, George, has been pretty flat. There's been a couple of models where we've seen a little bit of price. There are a couple of models that are a little bit \u2013 at any rate, they're really very small variances on a year-over-year basis or quarter-to-quarter basis. So I would say right now pricing by and large is fairly stable on most of the models.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay. But you commented that pricing's better in the second half of the year...","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, specifically the Latitude. Yeah, the Latitude is the one that as we work into the second half of the year we're seeing increased price that's already largely booked on that product line. So there has definitely been a positive pricing trend on Latitude.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Doug, you're sounding awfully happy this morning. It must be because you're retiring. So congratulations on that.","Douglas R. Wilburne - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Myles, and that would be one factor.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So could you touch on the pricing comment you made, Scott, with respect to the second half of this year and into next year? You're not carrying much of a backlog. So how much visibility do you actually have on pricing into 2017?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think, obviously, it's mixed across the model. The one that we're largely commenting around where we feel like we've seen some nice positive momentum on the pricing side is specific around Latitude. And that product is pretty well spoken for at this point.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Outside of the NetJet. So from individual buyers, you have pretty good visibility into 2017?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Correct. Certainly through the balance of this year and just starting now as we're selling into 2017.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then as we look at the Systems margins, obviously, really good performance there. Were there any positive adjustments outside of just pure mix?","Douglas R. Wilburne - Vice President-Investor Relations","We had a small EAC (30:50), but it wasn't major.","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Not material relative to what we normally see.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Right. No. It's primarily driven by the fact that, as you guys know, the Weapons and Sensors business has a tendency to be sort of lumpy, right, because we build at a relatively stable level. But lot acceptance is typical with a lot of international customers. So a lot of the positive margins are the fact that we had significant uptick in volume in the quarter.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And good execution performance by the team in terms of getting it done and doing it productively.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And the only other one. So just a run rate cleanup on interest expense, the tick there up. Is that the new run rate? Or is $133 million still a good planning number for the year?","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","$135 million-ish type number for the year.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Sounds good. Thanks.","Operator","And we'll go to the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much, and good morning. Just to follow up on Systems with the small acquisition that you mentioned there, the strong margin in the quarter. Can you quantify what the acquisition contributed? And would you say that your expectation for sales and EBIT there is higher than it was at the beginning of the year?","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The acquisition didn't play a whole lot into this thing. As you would expect in the initial year of a deal like that, there's step-up. There's the normal accounting for shares. So I would say it's relatively neutral impact on 2016. And we certainly expect it to be a nice accretive contributor in 2017 and on.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Okay. And then with regard to cash flow, you told us in the past to expect the cash flow to be fairly back half weighted. Could you, is there any way to calibrate our expectations? There's a lot of cash coming in in the second half to calibrate our expectations for Q3 versus Q4?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'm not sure we want to get into a quarter-by-quarter, but we certainly still feel confident with the numbers that we provided in terms of the overall year guidance. We've talked in the past. We know we have a headwind associated with customer deposits, largely the military payments that are unwinding through the course of the year. So those have been unwinding as we've gone through the first half of the year, and generally speaking for us, will serve to offset an awful lot of that in Q3 and Q4 as we see working capital reductions and a loss of inventory through volume, largely in Aviation and Bell as we go through the balance of the year. And TAPV, of course, which remember, we don't start deliveries of those units here until August. So that's a fair bit of inventory that we've been carrying that we'll see a significant reduction in Q3 and Q4.","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And we're obviously always seasonally stronger in Q4, if you just look historically given the volumes that we see in Q4.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. Thank you very much.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go now to Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Sheila K. Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Good morning, guys.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Sheila K. Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Just on Bell profitability in terms of margins going forward, does it remain at about a 10% rate if we assume commercial helicopters doesn't recover for some time?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Sheila, that's what we've talked about is probably being in that 10% to 11% range. And an awful lot of that will have to do with where we are as usual on the commercial side on 412s. Again, I think we feel pretty good about where we are for 2016. And we'll have a lot more visibility as we get to the end of the year to be able to provide guidance on where we think that will be in 2017. But at least so far, for this year, we'll finish where we expect to be.","Sheila K. Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Got it. And then just one on the broader military opportunity set, if you could talk about that a little bit, whether it's the V-22 or the Scorpion both domestically and internationally, and how you think about the programs and opportunities there?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the V-22, obviously, has made some progress with the Japanese deal. And those orders now are firming up and coming in, being exercised either under the multi-year two contract or as some of the potential volume in a multi-year three deal. There continue to be a number of conversations with international customers that are going on. I certainly still think that Israel is a potential. That was talked about for quite a while and sort of moved out. And there's still uncertainty around that, but I think there are still conversations going on which are, at this point, very much government to government. The same is true with a couple of other countries, and so those are things, however, that would all be talked about in the context of a multi-year three. So it's not something that's going to hit here in the next couple of years. The only ones we'll see really will probably be Japan in that near term. So there's certainly a lot of other discussion and opportunities, dialogue, going on, some which is public, some which is not, around H-1s.","The H-1 is performing fabulously for the Marine Corps. It's both the utility and the attack versions of that are in the quote process and proposal processes for several potential international applications. So we'll be following that pretty closely.","Scorpion is still very much a wild card. It was a huge milestone for us to have the Air Force sign up to do the accreditation program. That just happened this past week. We've had, as you know, a number of international customers that have been looking at the aircraft. And there really have been two issues for them. One is, how are you going to get this thing certified so that they can provide their certification on top of it. And not unreasonably, customers want to fly the production fully conforming aircraft. We have the accreditation path checked off, and here in the next month or so, we'll be flying the first production configured aircraft. So, our customers are already talking about when they're going to be able to come in and get a chance to fly the aircraft. So two big milestones, boxes that we needed to check to get done before we can proceed with final sales of the aircraft.","Sheila K. Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","And just on the Scorpion, do you think international or domestic order is more likely?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, international has always been the focus of the aircraft for sure. And so those are the deals that we've been pursuing and working and staying close to those customers for a while. Look, I think there is U.S. opportunity at some point. I think, and there's been some papers here written recently. The Air Force is sort of facing into the reality in the U.S. that cost matters and they need more aircraft that guys can fly and build hours. And frankly, a lot of missions that can be executed that don't need to have very, very, very high end fighter capability. But those requirements I think are still in early formative stages within the U.S. And so I think we'll see how that plays out here over the next year or two.","Sheila K. Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Ok. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go to the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Good morning, guys. A couple quick program questions. Scott, on the T-6, you guys have delivered about 22 year-to-date. I'm wondering if you're thinking you'll hit 40 for the full year, because that would make it kind of flat year-over-year. And I was actually thinking it would trend down, because I think U.S. deliveries are over. So just wondering what your thoughts are on that program going forward.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Pete, I think it will be fairly flat for the year. The U.S. program is winding down. But we've had a couple of international programs that we won which will fill out the year. So I think 2016 feels fairly solid, and deliveries will be exactly where we expected them to be.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Okay. And then just last one for me. Sensor Fuzed Weapon, I think there was some news in the quarter that the State Department was actually considering blocking a sale to Saudi. I was wondering if you heard the same thing, what your thoughts were, if that's real or not. And I know this is a lumpy program, but I think Saudi was one of the meaningful customers. So just to raise a question in my mind there.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, they're not a current customer. They're a prospective customer for sure. They have been a customer in the past. But basically, Pete, you're right. There's a lot of issues going on between the State Department, NSC, and what's going on over the Middle East, and that is certainly, as a minimum, delaying getting approvals. Whether that breaks loose and ultimately is approved or whether it's not is still to be determined. But there's certainly an interest on their part. It's been notified to Congress in the past. It was approved through that notification process, but now going back through and getting the approvals through State, it is hung up at this point.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Okay. Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, guys.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Justin Bergner with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead. Mr. Bergner, your line is open. And we'll go to Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you very much. And, Doug, too young a man to retire. So you guys had very nice results at Systems, and that's even without any shipments of TAPV that come here, in here in the second half. On paper, it looks like Systems might have some upside. Is that a potential?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I don't know, Cai. It's probably too early to say one or the other. You know that the SFW side, in particular, can be kind of lumpy just because of the way those deliveries happen. It was a very strong quarter for that business. TAPV will certainly kick in here in Q3 and Q4 as we expected that it would. But, again, it is built into our plan. Right? We did expect the TAPVs to be Q3 and Q4. So it was a very good quarter for that team. I think they're going to deliver a very solid year. But right now, my expectation is it'll be consistent with what we guided.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then alternatively, when you look at Bell, you had a very strong military shipment in the first half, and that looks like it's going to be weaker in the second half. And commercial, again, was weak in the first half. Has to get better in the second half to kind of get you home. My understanding was that commercial margins were lower than military margins, so is there much risk at Bell that, that mix that you come in at the low-end or a little below it?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean, the mix is different even in the commercial world, model by model, Cai. I think that our military margins are solid and will stay that way through the balance of the year. I mean, we're delivering the same V-22s and H-1s that we delivered in the first half. So I think that business is in good shape and they'll deliver to our expectations. I do think we'll be lighter on some of the commercial volume and total number than we would've expected at the beginning of the year. But it's largely in a lot of the lighter helicopters, which on the initial equipment sale is not as material to the business as others.","Now those aircraft, of course, turn into a lot of service opportunities. So I mean, net, the margins in the commercial side are still good because of all the service that those aircraft pull through with them. But to be light in terms of volume on some of the lighter aircraft will not have a meaningful impact within the year. In the end it all comes down, largely, to the larger aircraft, and particularly the 412s, and I think we're on track to do that. And those are more heavily laid into the back half of the year.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Got it. And then switching to Aviation, so you mentioned the better pricing for Latitude in the second half. Talk to us a bit about the productivity. Does the profitability improve? Because presumably you're coming down the learning curve as time goes by. So should we expect the profitability of Latitude to improve going forward?","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I mean, I...","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. I think that in general it will. There's always a little bit of startup cost and variances and whatnot in the early model years. The team has done a nice job on cost, frankly. The aircraft is coming in around the cost where we expected it to be. Is there still some benefit to be had? Certainly. And especially since we have, for the first time in a long time, a fairly significant volume of aircraft, which are to the same configuration, that being NetJets, obviously, which will help. So obviously the guys in the factory are focused on that and trying to drive some incremental productivity and efficiency around that. So we'll see some benefit from that. And I think in part, that'll help us with some of our margin rates as we go into the back half of the year.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Got it. And then could you conjecture, when you look at the Longitude, when in the second half it might deliver? Does it look like it's very late in the year or could really have any sort of meaningful impact in terms of next year?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it's largely going to be a fourth quarter issue, Cai. I don't know that we really want to guide too much on it, yet. We're still \u2013 we haven't started the flight test program yet. We still have to go through the certification progress with the FAA. So having not yet started flight test, it's probably a little bit early to get a sense of where we are in that process and what the exact schedule will come out to be, but it's easily a year flight test program, right? So you're talking about something that would probably be, best case, late third quarter, probably into fourth quarter.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Well, that's why I ask, because when do you expect to fly? Because usually I would expect to take at least a year to kind of get the thing certified. So there would be some risk that it might slip out of 2017?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","There is some risk to that, of course. But, again, Cai, we're thinking we're going to be flying here in the next couple of months. So a year flight test program, that kind of puts you at the end of third quarter, beginning of fourth quarter, and as you know, we've been able on other models and programs to get certifications done in that kind of a timeframe and make some deliveries shortly thereafter.","So there is still \u2013 there's certainly a reasonable probability that we'll see fourth quarter sales of Longitude next year. Worst case, there's a few month delay, then for sure it could roll into the beginning of 2018, but again, we'll know an awful lot more when we get around to really doing 2017 guidance because we'll be months into flight test and have a better feeling for where we are.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Terrific. Thank you very much.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Justin Bergner with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.","Justin Laurence Bergner - Gabelli & Company","Good morning, guys. I'm sorry about not being there when I was first in the queue earlier.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No problem.","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Justin Laurence Bergner - Gabelli & Company","Two quick questions. First, on this tax impact, will there ultimately be a benefit to Textron from a cash point of view related to this $315 million, and $0.74 from continuing operations?","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","There will be a little bit of cash inflow associated with it, but it's not material, as we said in the comments. I think obviously the big cash impact is that the avoidance of kind of paying what we had accrued on the books here, obviously, which we always expected, but had the reserves for over a substantial period of time. But there will be some cash inflow associated with it, but it's not material.","Justin Laurence Bergner - Gabelli & Company","Okay. Great. And I know the call hasn't focused as much on Bell, but are you seeing a bottoming in the commercial rotorcraft market, or are you still seeing incremental weakness as you look out to the second half of the year?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't know. It's very hard to say, I certainly hope it's a bottom. It's pretty tough out there.","Justin Laurence Bergner - Gabelli & Company","Okay. What sort of are you looking for on the Bell side to get more confident that you've reached a bottom on the commercial side?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, obviously, not to be too simplistic about it, but orders, right? We're talking to a lot of our customers, obviously, and we have a sense of where they are. Oil and gas obviously remains very difficult, right? You've got, some of these guys are in bankruptcy. You've got a lot of their fleet that's sitting on the ground. They're just not being utilized. Now the oil and gas cycle is in all likelihood exactly that, a cycle, right?","So we've seen a rebounding of the price of oil, but not back to where it probably needs to be for them to feel better. It's starting to probably impact possibly in some regions of the world where $50 or so is \u2013 you can extract and be profitable at that. There's certainly other parts of the world where it needs to be significantly higher than that to make them feel like that end customers going to start getting stronger.","And of course a lot of these economies \u2013 they're just oil and gas petrodollar-based. So their economies will get healthier as that price per barrel rebounds, but we don't really have a great sense at this point what that lag is between where those rebounds and pricing and how quickly that'll flow through to having the ability to invest in their fleets or in general in those economies for people to feel comfortable to start laying out the funding for significant CapEx kind of projects.","But anyway, I wish I had a very prudent answer for you, but we talk to customers every day. Our team's out there working it. We kind of know pretty much every opportunity in the world that's out there. It's just a matter of seeing some of the stuff start to convert to orders. And it's been soft.","I mean, you see that in the volumes in the quarter, and I'd be misleading if I thought it was going to, all of a sudden, materially improve to affect the second half of this year, which is why I would say I would expect unit volumes to be down sort of from where we would've expected them to be, but not with significant financial impact for the year. Again, in terms of how we look out any further than that, that's something we'll have to work on and factor that into how we guide for 2017. And that will depend a lot on just sort of the general outlook of what those conversations are like for customers and, in particular, a number of opportunities out there that are fairly significant that will materialize or not between now and the end of the year.","Justin Laurence Bergner - Gabelli & Company","Great. Thanks for taking my questions and for that perspective on the helicopter market.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. No problem.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, guys. I wanted to get back onto congratulate Doug, publicly, on his retirement, first and foremost. And then secondly, Scott, just ask you to offer up some perspective on the M&A pipeline at this point in cash deployment going forward?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'd say on the M&A front, most of what we've done this year have been relatively small add-on transactions. And I think that's something that we continue to look at. There's a number there in the pipeline that are relatively small. We like doing those deals. In general, they've been attractive for us. They've played out very well in terms of returns and financials as they built into the business. And so our expectations is that's probably how things will continue to play out through the balance of the year. There's always stuff we're looking at, but at this point, there's nothing out there that's of any materiality that's something I would say, hey, guys, here's something we're looking at or doing. But we have a number of things that we're always looking at and whether one of those could happen in the balance of the year or not is still to be determined.","In general, our capital allocation strategy is, kind of, unchanged. We reserve and kind of target a certain amount of our allocation to M&A. But again, it's all totally opportunistic. Right? If it's the right kind of deals and we think it's good, we'll do them. If we don't, then obviously we don't do them. So...","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks.","Operator","We'll go to George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Yes, just a couple of quick ones. On the Sovereign, we've seen the deliveries get pretty low. I mean, is it really just getting cannibalized from the Latitude? And kind of what's your outlook for the Sovereign?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So there is certainly some cannibalization, George, between the Sovereign Plus and the Latitude. The aircrafts are similar in some respects. I mean, it's really a trade-off between the size of the cabin versus the number of passengers and range. So if you are looking and your requirement is to do a little bit of a longer haul and you need to put more packs on board, then the Sovereign's a great airplane, and that's why we still sell them. And we have a number of customers that still looking at acquiring the Sovereign because it's great for that mission and it continues to be a great aircraft in that area.","If you don't quite need the range and you don't quite need the number of passengers, but you want to go with that larger cabin, then the Latitude's a great choice. And I think what you're seeing is that we have a fair number of customers that will give up a few hundred nautical miles and don't need to have the higher passenger count, and they'll err on the side of the Latitude.","So from our perspective, they're both selling. Certainly, with the Latitude being new, it is generating a little bit more demand, which was exactly what we expected. And certainly some of those customers, if you went back two years ago, may have been people that would've bought a Latitude. But it's good having them both in the portfolio. It gives us the ability to work with the customer and say, what's your mission, and which one fits your mission better? And that's kind of where we're continuing to sell.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay. And on the A-10, Scott, you're still figuring that, that's kind of 6 to 10 a year in terms of the demand there?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think the A-10, with just the market dynamic out there, George, is just a relatively thin market. It's a great aircraft. We still have customers that absolutely love the airplane. So we still see some demand, but it's going to be a small number.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay. And then one quick one for you, Frank. Kautex, I don't think they have a huge amount of exposure to the UK. But with the devaluation of the pound happening towards the end of the quarter probably didn't have a big impact this quarter. How much of an impact do you look for in the third quarter?","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, there's a little bit of an impact, George, but it's not that material on an overall basis. It will be a little bit of headwind, but not that much.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay. Thanks very much again.","Douglas R.

Welcome to the Textron's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Doug Wilburne. Please go ahead.","Douglas R. Wilburne","Thanks, Tricia, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release.","On the call today we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.","Moving now to second quarter results, starting with Slide #3. Revenues in the quarter were $3 billion, up 10.7% from a year ago. Our income from continuing operations was $0.58 per share, which compares to earnings per share of $0.29 in the second quarter of 2011.","Moving to cash flow, second quarter manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $121 million and from that, we contributed $21 million to our pension plans.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott C. Donnelly","Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everybody. Our second quarter performance reflects continued growth in our commercial aircraft and industrial markets and improved operating execution across our businesses. We also continue to secure a number of key program wins and made strategic product announcements in the quarter that should further contribute to growth long term.","Starting with Textron Systems, our Marine & Land Systems business won the Canadian Tactical Armoured Patrol Vehicle program. This contract calls for delivery of 500 vehicles beginning in 2014 with an option for 100 more, as well as an initial 5-year support contract. This was an important win as it extends our production of armored vehicles through at least 2015. This win also establishes a new family of our proven Mine Resistant vehicles, and we can now market to other customers around the world.","Our TMLS business also won the Navy Ship-to-Shore Connector competition, which starts with detail design and construction of a test and training craft to be completed by early 2017. The contract also provides options for deliveries of up to 8 initial production units through 2020. So the total value of this contract could amount to $570 million over the remainder of the decade, with even more significant opportunity when the program enters full rate production.","And finally at our Unmanned Aircraft Systems business, we recently received a $358 million award for engineering support and upgrades to retrofit 45 Shadow Systems with deliveries of these units beginning in late 2013.","So despite a difficult DoD environment, over the past several months we've won several significant new programs that help solidify the long-term outlook and systems.","Moving to our Finance segment, we had another successful quarter of liquidations as we reduced noncap to financial receivables by another $160 million, including a $70 million reduction in our Golf Mortgage portfolio, representing 19 loans. Our noncap to finance receivable portfolio now stands at $619 million.","Shifting to our industrial business, operating performance was solid with revenues up 5%. Volumes in our Industrial businesses reflect strength in the North American and Asian auto markets offsetting European softness.","Moving over to Cessna, we delivered 49 jets in the quarter, up from last year's 38, reflecting modest recovery and our success in the current market. We also had a number of strategic developments over the past several months at Cessna. First, we announced our new long-range super midsize Longitude business jet during the eBay show in Geneva. With a 4,000-nautical mile range and a speed of Mach .86, the Longitude will be designed to make nonstop flight between city pairs like New York and Paris; London to Dubai; or Beijing, Moscow. At a price of just under $26 million, we believe the Longitude will be the best valued 4,000-nautical miles super midsized business jet available in the world. We also continue to make good progress during the quarter with flight testing on our new Citation M2 and Citation Ten.","Finally, our newly announced Latitude was selected by NetJets to become part of their fractional fleet offering, which should add significantly to the long-term demand for this aircraft.","And to wrap up with Bell, on the military side we delivered 9 V-22s and 6 H-1s versus 9 22s and 8 H-1s in last year's second quarter. We saw a significant increase in our commercial business with 47 units delivered in the second quarter, up to 25 from last year's 22 deliveries. This growth reflects the overall strength in global helicopter markets, as well as the ramp-up in our 429 program and the success of our new 407GX.","To wrap up the quarter, overall manufacturing revenues were up 10% with manufacturing net margins improving 120 basis points. We believe this validates the investments we've been making over the past couple of years in new product development, our sales capabilities and manufacturing productivity.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank.","Frank T. Connor","Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Manufacturing segment profit in the quarter was $288 million, up $59 million from the second quarter of 2011 on a $269 million increase in manufacturing revenue. Let's look at how each of the segments contributed, starting with Cessna.","Revenues at Cessna were up $111 million on a year-over-year basis, reflecting higher jet deliveries. Segment profit was up $30 million, primarily due to the higher volume. Excel revenues were up $184 million primarily due to higher commercial helicopter volume. Segment profit increased $32 million, reflecting the higher volume in a favorable mix in our commercial business.","At Textron Systems, revenues were down $63 million primarily due to lower volumes in our weapons and sensors and land and marine businesses. Segment profit decreased $9 million, reflecting the lower volumes and deliveries on lower-margin contracts. Industrial revenues increased $37 million, reflecting higher volumes across most of the businesses, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. Segment profit increased $6 million, primarily due to higher volume.","Moving to finance, total finance receivables ended the quarter down $256 million from the prior quarter. Nonaccruals ended the quarter at $252 million, a decrease of $38 million from the prior quarter, and 60-day plus delinquencies were $169 million, up $26 million from the first quarter, primarily reflecting a few aircraft accounts.","Moving to corporate items. Corporate expenses were $20 million, down significantly from the first quarter, primarily the result of lower propelling share price, which reduced compensation-related expenses. Interest expense was $35 million, even with the first quarter. Our average share count during the quarter was 295.5 million shares, which was 19.7 million shares lower than last year's second quarter, primarily reflecting the benefit of having repurchased a large portion of the company's outstanding convertible notes.","To conclude, we are maintaining our full year EPS guidance of $1.80 to $2 a share, with cash flow from manufacturing operations before pension contributions of $700 million to $750 million.","That concludes our prepared remarks. So Tricia, we can open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will go to the line of Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley.","Heidi Rolande Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Can you walk us through the strong improvements we're seeing in this quarter in Cessna? I think -- I can't recollect precisely, but I think Scott Ernest has now been there for 1 year. Can you tell us what has been changing with him and his team that's been most effective in these results?","Scott C. Donnelly","You're right. Scott's been in place for just over 1 year. And I think some of the changes that he's made in establishing real business segments, or P&Ls within the jets and propeller, military and service sector and the teams, the people we put into those leadership jobs are doing a great job on focusing both on where we're going in the future, product development, plans, kind of marketing strategy, but also sort of a stronger focus on their P&L and understanding their costs, understanding conversion costs and prior costs, warranty, really looking at the products a little more holistically along each one of those product lines. And I think the focus on that and trying to draw profitability back in the business is something that they're doing very well. And I think that's what we're seeing in the results.","Heidi Rolande Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Didn't we expect then, Scott, in the second half a steady climb in profits then as he gains, and he and his team gain greater traction?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well I think that you're going to see, obviously, the continued focus on the cost, but I do think we'll start to see a little more pressure on R&D spending as we continue to ramp up all the exciting stuff that we've announced. We actually have to go spend the money to make those things happen. And there's a couple of other headwinds. But there's going to be things that push back and forth through the quarter. But I would say I don't think there's any change in their focus around cost, and that will continue to support our margins. But we are going to have some headwinds around some of our R&D spending.","Heidi Rolande Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And last question, obviously given the conservatism in your guidance, you're baking in and implying deceleration in the back half of the year. Can you walk us through some of the puts and takes that kind of drives that conclusion?","Douglas R. Wilburne","Heidi, I mean obviously coming through the first half of the year, we feel pretty good about where we are relative to how we expected the year to progress. But I have to say that we still look at the back half of the year in terms of what's going on with economies around the world in a lot of uncertainty. I have to factor in that, that will cause concern with a lot of our customers as well. And so we still have, as we have had now for the last few years, an awful lot of activity, particularly at Cessna, which requires sales, orders that then convert to sales in a relatively short period of time. And I think there's enough uncertainty out there in the economy, in the markets around the world, that it's best to still anticipate it's going to be a tough back half.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Scott, I was wondering if you could give us your views on revenues for the full year and whether there's been any changes in the allocation by division?","Scott C. Donnelly","No, there really isn't, Robert. I think things are really -- there's no reason to change the kind of guide that we've given you guys the beginning of the year around each one of the businesses. Bell, obviously, I think is on track. Cessna is certainly on track. Systems, as we sit here today, is probably a little behind. We guided the revenue around that business to be flattish for the year. We're a little behind where we were obviously at this time 1 year ago. I think that's reflective of just the general slowdown of getting things through the DoD process. But obviously with some of the wins that we've had here in the past few months and some FMS activities, I think we have reasonable line of sight to expect the revenue to catch up on that business and finish the year about flattish as we originally guided.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And as a follow-up on Cessna, you've given us the backlog number for the quarter. I was wondering if you could give us an idea of maybe how orders and cancellations might have panned out this quarter.","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, there were some -- certainly, still some cancellations in the quarter. I would say gross orders were pretty good. We still have some cancellations, and if you will just -- frequent of why we could still see cancellations at this point. And frankly, it's still driven by some orders that were in the backlog that date all the way back to sort of the 2007 MBAAs and CJ4 launches. And as you know, the backlog was way out for that model at that time and so as deposits come due, there still are some that are dropping out of that area. So I would say principally when you look at cancellations, that's what's driving it. The rest of the cancellation numbers are sort of immaterial.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro","Just follow-up on that, Scott. Was the gross book-to-bill at 1 or above 1 in the quarter then?","Scott C. Donnelly","I think if you look at gross, it was just barely above 1.","George Shapiro","Okay. And what happened to the aftermarket at Cessna? I mean, how much did that grow in the quarter?","Scott C. Donnelly","The aftermarket was up sort of in mid-single digits. On a comparable basis, it wasn't as strong as we've been seeing, but we had a very strong comp from the second quarter of '11 because a lot of fleet refurbishment activity was going on. But it was still up a healthy, healthy mid-single digits.","George Shapiro","And you had very strong incremental margins. I mean is that just a volume, or did the large number of XLS deliveries help that? And why shouldn't we expect that incremental to continue if you adjusted for the higher R&D?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, I think if you look -- I mean for sure, gross margins continue to be good. I don't see a change in that going forward. But as I said, we are going to see more R&D coming into this thing, and we're still at a point here where the numbers are relatively small. And plus or minuses, whether it's inventory adjustments, that will have an influence. It's bigger than we would like just because the number's relatively small at this point. So at this stage of the game, I mean, I certainly feel good about what the guys delivered on the quarter. We'll continue to drive hard but at this point, I would say I don't see a reason to guide outside of the margin range that we gave you for the total year.","Frank T. Connor","And George, the comps going forward at Cessna are going to be a little tougher, too. As Heidi pointed out, the new management team got underway a little over 1 year ago, and so some of that immediate impact started to flow in the third, fourth quarters of last year.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a couple of quick clarification questions. First, on TFC and the outlook for the rest of the year and moving into 2013. Obviously, we've had some better-than-expected performance relative to your initial guidance of breakeven for the year. Can you just give us some updated thoughts on -- yes, look, not just for this year, but as we kind of move into next year given what you know today?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, I think that most of what we're seeing that has been upside to what we would have guided, Jason, has to do with our successful liquidation in the Golf Mortgage portfolio and the fact that we've been able to liquidate those notes at better than where we mark them when we took the mark last year. And so obviously, those come through as a gain. Now eventually, obviously that's going to stop. I mean, we've had 2 good quarters of those liquidations. I think we'll continue to see good liquidations of that through the balance of the year but obviously as we start to think about 2013, we have a better sense of how those are liquidating now. So when we get around to kind of guiding you toward 2013, we'll consider that but that is going to end, right? I mean those receivables are dropping fairly quickly, which is good news. But as you look out, I'm going from -- starting the year with 381, we're already down to 244. These things are going to run through the book. I hope we'll continue to run through the book pretty quickly. I would hope that we will continue to see some positive numbers come out of that as we liquidate them better than their mark, but that will end.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And as far as the timing on the ending, do you have a sense of that? Is it in calendar '13 or we see that this year?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, I mean our -- it's hard to tell, right? But our pace right now has been sort of in that $60 million, $70 million over the last couple of quarters. So even if we continue that kind of run rate, then you're going to be -- the portfolio we have, what it was as we get to the end of the year, which means it'll...","Frank T. Connor","We'll still in number -- in '13. We still expect, obviously, liquidation activities in '13. As Scott said, it's going to depend on the pace of liquidations for the second half of this year and where those liquidations take place relative to where we have, at least, the Golf portion marked and then we have other liquidations coming out of other pieces of the portfolio. It will continue.","Scott C. Donnelly","I guess what we're saying, Jason, is you can't assume that level on a go-forward basis. I mean, that's not something we can bake into the TFC model on a go-forward basis, because it is really driven by a particular asset class and how that's liquidating. And as you know, that will come to completion as we finish that liquidation.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. Just 2 quick follow-ups then. On the Cessna cancellations, can you give us a sense of how much that might have contributed to operating profit during the quarter? And then Scott, can you just give us an update on V-22 international sales?","Scott C. Donnelly","On the former, Jason, the cancellation foreclosure numbers is de minimis. I mean, it's $1 million or something. There was not an impact on the quarter in terms of the margin rates really. In terms of V-22, on foreign military sales opportunities, we just came out of Farnborough. I would say we had a great show. The Marine Corps had 4 V-22s. Over at the show, they were providing demonstration rides for a lot of Foreign Military customers. It was a packed few days. They were terrific, in terms of supporting us. We had a lot of folks flying the aircraft, a lot of fabulous feedback. I would say we are in serious discussions with several different countries around the V-22 sales opportunity, and we remain pretty bullish that several of those deals are going to close. We'd obviously would love to see one happen this year. I think there's a possibility for that to happen. Remember, we're really trying to look at production slot availability out in that 2015 time frame as you start the second multiyear. So I would say right now, there is not a complete signed contract on any of those, but there are several there and -- that I think are real opportunities, and they're going to start to happen.","Operator","Our next question is from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just want to go back to the full year earnings outlook question from the first questioner. And I just want to make sure I'm interpreting you correctly in that, I think you were saying the reason for just keeping the range and not raising it despite the large beat, at least versus our expectations, is simply because of the broader, higher-level macro and not because of an expectation for specific segments to get worse in the back half. Because you earned $1 in the first half, so you have to earn less in the second versus the first to get to the midpoint of your range, which in any normalized year historically has never happened. So just wanted to make that clarification, and if it is the businesses, which ones are the drivers?","Scott C. Donnelly","No, it is exactly as I said. We're -- I think if you looked at where Bell is today and where the industrial business is, the systems business I talked a little about, I think I have a reasonable degree of confidence in forecasting what their performance will look like through the balance of the year. But at Cessna, we are in the same mode that we've been in for a few years here, where we're taking orders and selling in sort of a 3- to 6-month window for the most part. And I still worry about the back half of the year in terms of what the market's going to look like. And that's just driven by, I believe, a lot of uncertainty in economies. I think there's a lot of concern about heading toward November, a lot of small midsized business guys who are our customers are very concerned about the balance of the year and where things are going in terms of election and politics. You've got debt ceilings, you've got sequestrations. You've got massive changes to tax policy. So I remain concerned that we'll have too many people sitting on the sideline as opposed to guys that are willing to make significant capital investments and hiring people and things like that. So I think it's proven at this point, given the uncertain nature of the economic and political situation particularly in the U.S., that we'd be a little bit cautious about the second half of the year.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, understood. And then as a follow-up to the Cessna order topic, orders weren't through the roof, but they were certainly -- they kind of held in there relative to how bad the macro was in the quarter. Can you talk about whether or not part of that is share gain? And you have new management and new product strategy and the degree to which you think you're taking share back from competitors that maybe had some inroads versus you. And then as a second question, when you mentioned gross book-to-bill being above 1, I think that's been the case for a few quarters. So what's the timing at which you think the cancellations finally end, such that even without core gross order improvement, you'd automatically have book-to-bill above 1?","Scott C. Donnelly","Noah, I've been trying to stay out of the guessing game on the order book, but like, let me just say it. I think we feel good about what gross orders were in the second quarter. I think that it feels like we're taking some share. I haven't seen the MBAA numbers yet. Embraer's put their numbers out, but I haven't seen numbers from any of the other businesses. We'll obviously, we'll see that here in the pretty near future. But I would say that I think our sales teams are doing a great job in terms of coverage. Certainly a lot of new products that we've announced. This generated a lot of interest in our brand, and our product continues to be very well received in the marketplace. So I think we're continuing to do well, and I would guess that we have seen some share pickup in the quarter and I would expect that to continue. So it's not like I feel bad about where we are in terms of orders. Our order rate has been pretty good. I think the guys are doing a nice job out there. It's just caution in the macro environment that would cause us to feel strong enough at this point to take our overall guidance number up.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Just a couple of questions, just back to R&D. Obviously, you do have a lot going on and R&D has to go up. I think in some of your prior conversations though, the thought was yes R&D goes up, but it doesn't outpace sales growth once we get beyond this year. Is that view changing?","Scott C. Donnelly","No, I don't think so.","Frank T. Connor","No, I think the comment, Jeff, was just that it's more back-end loaded than front-half loaded this year, but the longer-term look at R&D is still the same.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Right. And Scott, can you just share some thoughts on sequestration? You've taken the view that it won't happen. Unfortunately, you're taking that view because you're a logical businessman, right, and we're operating in a world where maybe things aren't so logical. So whether you think it's going to happen or not, what does Textron do if it does happen? I mean, how do you posture? Can you do things in advance? Do you even know what sequestration would mean for your businesses at this point?","Scott C. Donnelly","Yes, Jeff, I mean it really is something at this point that you can't plan for, because the fundamental flaw, in my view of sequestration, is it's just bad policy. If people decide that there needs to be a further reduction in the defense budget and obviously, the defense community doesn't like that idea. But even if you are going to take it down, the issue is you surely would never do it in the fashion it's laid out in the sequestration law, right, where you do a -- spread it across everything, every program, every spending item, everything gets hit by a common percent. I mean first of all, it would be a disaster for the government because that means every contract, every worker, everything out there gets impacted, which is going to result in a massive deluge of contract changes, requests for equitable adjustments. I mean it would cost the government more money than they would ever say. I mean there's actually contracts. You can't just go out there and arbitrarily change contracts without having ramifications of that. Just from a pure administration standpoint, you would never do that. The other course is if you're going to take more money out, and I'm not betting against, by the way, that they're going to take more money out. I think that there still could be, when they work their way through, I'd be very surprised if it's a lame-duck process -- session. But when you get into a new Congress and they actually start to figure out what they got to cut and what they're going to do about the deficits, that there could still be a further allocation of cuts to defense. But I think you have to let that go work the way it normally does, just like the first $0.5 billion of defense is already taken, where you go to the Pentagon, you go to Congress, okay, we're going to take up this much money. And there's actually a thoughtful rational way about what programs get hit, what programs don't get hit and you proceed down that path. So I think I wouldn't be very surprised if sequestration gets invoked just because of inaction in our political process. That wouldn't surprise me a whole lot at this stage of the game. But I think once that hits, there will be some emergency sessions and people will actually say, \"Okay, if we're going to cut money, here's how we have to do it.\" And the problem with planning for that is you don't know what programs they're going to go try to take money out. So I don't think it's going to be an across-the-board deal. I think that's an administrative -- it's bad policy. Administratively it's bad. It's bad for defense. But knowing where the cuts ultimately will come at this point would be absolute guesswork, and I just don't think we can -- we're wasting our time to even try and to do so -- a plan for that.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a quick question on sort of big picture on Cessna, Scott, if you -- I wondered if you might compare and contrast the demand environment to the sort of summer slowdown periods we've seen in the past couple of years, and whether it's any different than what we saw last year, better or worse? And then a point of clarification with respect to the order book and the NetJets order and whether there's any portion of that that's included in the backlog?","Scott C. Donnelly","Okay, in terms of the macro view of Cessna, I mean we certainly are not where we were 2 summers ago where when the euro, sort of crisis first hit, it sort of froze the market. We have not seen that level of reaction. Frankly, even with what's going on in Europe right now, we still continue to see order flow in Europe. Obviously, it's in -- mostly around countries that are still economically doing better than some others. So we haven't seen that sort of falling off a cliff where everybody just stops. So I guess in that regard, it's more like it was last summer, right? I mean we went through it and we kind of -- we muddled along, we continue to get orders. And I think there is still demand out there, obviously, for the product. There are still people who want to do upgrades, and they want to put new aircraft, and that's the flow that we're seeing. And so our belief is that's why we think we're going to continue to have a solid year. But there's still the macro overhang of it. So the macro level is certainly not like it was 2 summers ago when the market just absolutely stopped. It is much more like last year, and I would hope it will continue like that. That's what we seem to see in the demand right now. In terms of the NetJets order, no. None of the NetJets order is into our backlog. The process of how we're proceeding is that we will put aircraft into the backlog as we identify a specific serial number to be delivered to NetJets to fulfill their customer demand. And obviously with this aircraft coming into market in 2015 in the -- just really getting into the marketing and the selling process on the NetJets side, I wouldn't expect to see those aircraft going into the backlog for some time because again, we won't put them into the backlog until we see assigned specific serial numbers. And we'll do that on an aircraft-by-aircraft basis. We will not put that entire order into the backlog at any point in time. It will come in on a aircraft-by-aircraft basis.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And one other just sort of brief follow-up. You mentioned the aftermarket performance at Cessna. I wonder if you might comment on what you're seeing on that front at Bell?","Scott C. Donnelly","Bell aftermarket performance was good as well.","Frank T. Connor","Yes, kind of still good growth there.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Similar to the mid-single digit at Cessna?","Scott C. Donnelly","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Scott, last quarter you talked about the price environment being tough, being a headwind last quarter. Could you address pricing year-over-year and sequentially at Cessna?","Scott C. Donnelly","I would say still a difficult pricing environment. As I indicated on the call in the last quarter, we saw tougher pricing on a year-over-year basis than we would like to have seen as we're kind of battling our way through things. In terms of sequential, we actually saw some modest improvements. We actually put a couple of those price increases out there in the market and then pull back on some of the allowances. And I think our sales team has done a nice job of closing a lot of orders and getting a little bit of price back.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","In terms of the Cessna, you noted your conservatism obviously with all the macro issues. But could you maybe talk about where you are in terms of being sold on the rest of the year relative to whatever delivery number you have baked into the revenue guidance, and how that would compare to the last couple of years when you were midway through the year?","Scott C. Donnelly","No, we're not talking about unsold positions at this point, David. But as I've said, I mean I think the reality of the market where we are and have been now for some time is that it's safe to assume a lot of the aircraft are going from an order sales process that's in the 3- to 6-month kind of time frame typically.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Last one, Frank, on the pension side, will you guys benefit at all from the recent change in the pension legislation smoothing the discount rate? From a funding standpoint, I think you were looking at pretty meaningful contributions on a go-forward basis.","Frank T. Connor","Yes. No, it won't have a big impact from a minimum-required pension contribution. It helps us to the tune of $30-ish million or so, so it's not a big number. And we've been making contributions just because of our funded status at levels, as you know, well above our minimum contribution levels and kind of we anticipate and continuing to do that for a bit longer. So it doesn't have really any impact on how we think about that.","Operator","And our next question is from Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen & Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Scott, could you give us some color on the demand at Cessna, both by product, by geography and kind of the pace going through the quarter? Did it sort of slow down, as I would assume, kind of in the last part of the quarter, early July?","Scott C. Donnelly","You know, Cai, we didn't see much of a slowdown. I would say in terms of geography, both our orders and our deliveries at this stage of the game are kind of sitting in the 60-40, 60%, domestic, 40% international kind of market. And I would say it was pretty steady through the quarter.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And by product, I mean we've been hearing that maybe the mids and super mids are firming a little bit. You seeing any sort of areas stronger or weaker?","Scott C. Donnelly","It's relatively balanced. I mean the XLS plus had a very good quarter. We continue to see strong position in the CJ4s. There were some CJ2s, 3s. Mustangs were about flat, so it's pretty well across the portfolio.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then help me understand your comment, the guidance is the same, and yet your corporate expense is way down. And unless you're assuming your stock price surges, it looks like that's going to come in a fair bit lower than you expected. And you indicated expecting some more favorable adjustments on liquidation. So it looks like TFC is going to do better than expected even if it about breaks even for the year. So is this really conservatism, or help us understand why that guidance didn't change.","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, I think that if you would accuse me of conservatism, Cai, I would say that it probably is conservative on our view of how we will do on Cessna for the balance of the year.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Got it, got it.","Scott C. Donnelly","You're right that there's obviously some of the upside we've seen at TFC, associated with the Golf Mortgage liquidations. Kind of when you look at our overall guidance, I mean that will tend to push us towards the high side of the guidance based on that number being a number that is stronger than guidance. And I would -- I'd say that's going to be true, but I still think we're going to be a little conservative if you're on the total of your Cessna number.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Understood. Now you mentioned that R&D is going to move up in the second half, up sequentially from where we were in the second quarter. And was the second quarter may be not up much from the first and not up much year-to-year, so it's really the R&D profile has something to do with the numbers of the full year?","Frank T. Connor","Well, we've never talked about quarterly kind of R&D because it does fluctuate, Cai, depending on kind of different things that are going on with different programs. But it will -- and we always expected it to be a bit back-end loaded relative to the first half of the year.","Operator","Your next question is from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So I guess firstly, just on Bell commercial, you've been fairly positive on that for sort of 6 or 9 months, and it certainly seems to be coming through in your numbers. Could you talk a little bit about your expectations for volume delivery growth in Bell commercial over the next sort of 12 months? And also, what's happening on the pricing side there, given that you've had this inflection on volume?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, I think on the volume side of Bell, the year is playing out very much as we expected and guided, so we are going to see for the total year, significant growth in terms of Bell deliveries. And I think you're seeing that here in the second quarter as we had pretty strong deliveries on the commercial side. I expect that will continue through the balance of the year. I think we'll see particularly strong mix increase on the 429s and our 407s. As I said, I think both products are doing very well in the marketplace, and pricing has been good. The market -- the demand is strong around the world and so as you would expect, there's been some pricing power as well.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then just sort of yet another question on Cessna, unfortunately, but if -- I just wondered how you're thinking about the sort of business jet, taken from landing data to the sort of the traffic data, and how that affects your outlook for the second half? Because I guess the U.S., you had good growth for sort of 3 years, and that's largely expired. The U.S. traffic seems to -- in Europe, sorry, traffic seems to be down a little bit. So how does that -- when you're thinking about, I guess, second half or the next 12 months, the core assumption around traffic growth versus market share gains that you can get from price, how do you think about those 2 drivers for Cessna volumes?","Scott C. Donnelly","We don't look at that a whole lot in terms of volume driver. I mean we certainly look at average deal utilizations, and there's some tie-in, in terms of looking at the service business and there are people using their aircraft or not using their aircraft, and that's been pretty steady in the last year or so. It went down a lot, obviously, from the '07, '08 kind of numbers. But the number that we see right now, in terms of the ADUs for the quarter are very consistent with what we saw last year. So people are using their aircraft, and as a result they're coming into the service centers, and they're \u2013 having maintenance work done and upgrade work done. So I think it's -- that, that piece of utilization is something we look at more around what is it driving in the service business as opposed to new aircraft sales. On new aircraft sales side, we tend to look more at the metrics around what's available in the used market and what percentage of the fleet that's out there is available for sale. And those numbers continue to go the right direction. We were down -- we believe our fleet now is down somewhere just above 12%. And in particular, if you look at the models that are still in production models and what's available for sale in the market of those model types, for most of our models that's now down in the mid-single digits.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then finally just on the industrial business, very good core growth, sort of 11% much better than a lot of other industrial companies this quarter. What's the update there on the sort of the investment program there, and how you're thinking about the cost base? I mean, are you investing sort of substantially to make sure that type of growth continues, or is it sort of largely a one-off court, and do you think the growth will normalize from here?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, I mean, a lot of the growth is driven. I mean if you look at our Golf and Turk markets, those were pretty hard hit. Those have started to rebound a little bit, so I think we saw good performance in the E-Z-GO business, across not just Golf, but also the commercial and consumer markets. We had a reasonably strong quarter with Jacobsen. You see more people going back and having to replace mowing equipment. The industrial tools business did well. I mean we had some FX challenges there, but volumes and profitability continue to be recovering in the industrial tool world. And Caltex, we've kind of hung in there. As we said, we've seen some softness in Europe, which is our, probably our biggest market for that business, but that was offset by a continued strength in the North American market. And I would say probably growth is not as strong as it has been in Asia, but it's still growing in Asia in terms of the automotive market.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Scott, I think you're probably going into or in the 2013 strat planning sessions and looking at Cessna and coupling that with your commentary about the second half's economic geopolitical uncertainty. Are you still looking for higher production at Cessna into 2013 that you'd kind of preliminary pass along to the supply chain come September?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, I mean, you're right. We have -- we are in that process. In fact, we've just completed doing that with all the businesses, so we are developing a view, I would say, at this point in time. But I would say we're not at the point where I would start to talk about issuing 2013 guidance on the businesses.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess the near-term activity, if you decouple it to that second half kind of event risk situation, I mean, would that still make you comfortable that you're in what you've talked about before of kind of consistent recovery, maybe it's slower than previous cycles, but still a recovery nonetheless?","Scott C. Donnelly","Yes, absolutely. I would say the macro level, I wouldn't change the tone of our view that we will expect sort of a steady slow recovery in the market. The issue, of course, is that can have some peaks and valleys along the way, and so we always have to keep an eye out for that. But no, there's certainly -- in terms of talking to customers and looking at the activity that's going on in the market, looking at demand and where it is, we don't have any reason to feel differently than this, like the midsized jet market, will continue and make a slow steady recovery. And obviously, part of what we factor in is with a lot of the new products that we're putting out in the marketplace, we would expect -- certainly expect to see some share growth over that period as well. So I don't think anything versus what we've told you in the past is different in terms of sort of macro mid- to long-term view of the business.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then a clarification, I guess, on delinquencies. I know it wasn't a big pickup sequentially, but I think it's the first one that was seen in the last couple of years, if not longer. And I think you said it was aircraft customers. So I'm curious when is the trend going to start going the wrong way? And is that indicative of either higher-risk customers coming into the portfolio or customers who've been in there a while starting to show weakness?","Scott C. Donnelly","No, I mean, you're right. The 60-day delinquency trend was driven by a couple of sizable aircraft accounts. I mean I never liked to see a data point that goes the wrong direction, but I mean it did go the wrong direction, but I don't think that's going to be a trend. I mean these are customers that we know, we understand, there's a couple of specific issues that are going on, but I don't think they're -- I don't find it personally alarming at this point. I think it's something that we'll be able to get under control and get the delinquency heading back in the right direction.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And these aren't necessarily customers, or are these customers who entered the picture in the last 24 months or customers who have been in there longer?","Scott C. Donnelly","No, no, no. For the most part, these are guys that have been on the book for quite some time.","Operator","And our next question is from Steve Levenson with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Stephen E. Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I think all the good questions have been asked. I just wondered if you had any commentary on the developments around Hawker Beechcraft, the price discussion and if you think the door is absolutely closed to any sort of participation by Textron?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, the HB process is certainly not closed to anyone at this stage of the game, right? I mean they basically have entered into a negotiation process with a, what is effectively a stocky horse in the normal bankruptcy process. So I don't think it's certainly technically not closed to anyone. On the other hand, I'd say the number that's out there is a number that's a pretty high number, so we obviously, as everyone will kind of watch it as it goes through in a pretty public process and just going to see how it plays out.","Stephen E. Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I guess you might like to get that valuation for Cessna.","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, I -- we think we should.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ron Epstein with BofA.","Elizabeth Grenfell - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It's Elizabeth in for Ron this morning. Just a follow-up on the last question. What implications do you think there could be for Cessna from the recent deal to sell Hawker to the Chinese with your Chinese partnership?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, I mean again, this is a process that I think is still fairly early on. We'll see how things work out. If in fact the Chinese do buy Hawker, then it means Hawker's still in the market. So we've been competing with these guys for a very long time, and we'll continue to do that. Frankly, I think if you look at the investments that we're making and things like the Latitude and the Longitude, the things we're doing with our service network, for the reasons that we've been very successful versus Hawker Beechcraft in the last couple of years are the reasons that we would continue to be very successful against those products and that capability in the marketplace regardless of who happens to be the equity behind it, so...","Elizabeth Grenfell - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So what about your deal to build a new airplane with the Chinese?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well yes, I mean, we're still continuing our discussions with AVIC. I think the Chinese market is going to be a big market. And there's going to be a lot of competition in China. Obviously, the things that we've been trying to do with AVIC is to give us capability in the country that we think will be attractive to customers to help make us competitive in China, but I don't think by any means do we think we'll ever be the only guy to oversell in China. I mean everybody sells in China today, and I think everybody will sell in China tomorrow. We continue our discussions with AVIC to see if that's not something that gives us a competitive advantage in that marketplace. And so from that perspective, I don't see that as a change.","Operator","And we have a follow-up question from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro","Yes, just a couple of -- it's probably more nitty things. But was there any LIFO benefit at Cessna in this quarter like you had in last year's second quarter?","Scott C. Donnelly","No.","George Shapiro","Okay. And that's a -- there was a slight sequential decline in the margin at Bell even though revenues were higher, and maybe it's too small to worry about going from 14.6 to 14.4. Any reason for it, because commercial was better?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, I mean commercial, obviously the commercial mix is usually somewhat dilutive in our margin. We did have -- when I talk commercial, I'm talking about OE, right? So when you see more unit volumes, things like 429s and 407s in terms of the original equipment sale, those tend to have some dilution. But you're right, we get into 0.001 site, I wish I was that good, George.","George Shapiro","Yes, that's what I figured.","George Shapiro","All of our businesses, as we've seen, have a fair amount of quarterly volatility to them. There's lots of ins and outs.","Operator","And we do have another follow-up from Carter Copeland with Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just one quick one, back to the Hawker Beechcraft process. Obviously, the defense piece of that portfolio, the trainer businesses is still out there. I wondered if you might comment on whether that's something you'd still be interested in or any comment would be welcome.","Scott C. Donnelly","Carter, I think that we have the same general view. These are assets in which we have an interest but again, it would have to be at a value that we thought was appropriate. In general, I would say this whole situation with HB, we've always expressed an interest. I think some of the assets of the company are interesting and would be a good fit in our company, and that we could do the right thing for their existing customers and our customers. It would all work. But at the same time, whether it's the overall HB situation or the defense piece, these are things that I think, given the investments we're making, given the position where Cessna is today, I feel great about what our team is doing. So we don't have to do something here. If it's the right value and it will be accretive for our business, then absolutely we're interested. But if it's not something that's going to be a good financial deal and it's not going to be a good investment for our shareholders, then we'll pass on these things.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Is it your perception that, that piece is going to have a sufficient number of interested parties?","Scott C. Donnelly","It's a good question, I don't know. I mean you can imagine a couple of people that would be interested in it, but I think we'll have to wait to see how that plays out.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs for a follow-up.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just had one follow-up on systems. You've obviously put up a number of nice wins there that start to flow through beyond 2012. And right now, we're seeing the business show negative growth. And beyond the 2012 period, you probably still have a number of headwinds. I know you don't want to talk specifics beyond 2012 yet, so I wondered if you could just say, with everything you want and everything you know about the legacy business, do you think systems is up or down in 2013?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well again, Noah, I think it's -- it would be premature to get into 2013 guidance at this stage of the game. The only thing I'd really talk to is around 2012, and we are behind a little bit where we would like to be on the revenue side of things for '12. But I think with some of the wins we've had and some of the dynamics of the business right now that we still think we'll probably get back to about flattish for the year.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And can you comment on just directionally, positive or negative next year or too early to do that?","Scott C. Donnelly","I think it's too early to do that. I mean a lot of these programs we've talked about on Ship-to-Shore is a relatively small impact to this year. It's a little bit bigger impact to next year but again, primarily driven around research and development. TAPV, there are -- is a fabulous program win, but that really is production volumes that are -- later on, I mean we're already kind of where we need to be in terms of maintaining productions as we go through next year. So the TCDL win obviously is something that will help a little bit next year. So I think -- I don't think you're going to see a big swing one way or the other in 2013.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just one last question here on systems, and I apologize if you've already answered this question, but I didn't quite hear the details. The outlook for the rest of the year to get back to roughly flat, can you just give us a little bit of detail, Scott, on what needs to happen in the back half of this year? What programs specifically do you think are going to see an acceleration in the revenue outlook for the back half of the year?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, we had a couple of programs that drove some of the -- caused us to be under where we are today, primarily driven around some FMS transactions where it was a matter of getting through the finitization of contracts and getting things signed, which I believe have happened now. So I think we will be able to firm up more in the back half of the year. I guess I'd rather not go into a specific contract-by-contract basis. There's a lot of contracts going on, right? I mean we have talked about some of the larger and more strategic wins. But when you look at things that are going on, options that are being exercised on armored security vehicle business, upgrades that are going on in the UAV business, some FMS sales in our precision munitions business, these are all sort of full business, if you will. But those things, many of those things have been just difficult to get through the whole process and get the finitized contracts done. So the things that we knew we were going to have, there was no question about, was the program going to happen or be funded or not, it was just a matter of getting under contract, getting finitized and getting everything lined up so that we can get about with doing the production and test and sell them. The slowdown, that was what caused the first half to be a little softer, but I think we'll recover that in the back half.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then to your question -- your comment on pricing, it says in some of the price increases, is that fairly broad based at this point or is that kind of model specific?","Scott C. Donnelly","It was pretty broad based. The price increases were on a couple of specific models. But incrementally, on a quarter-over-quarter basis, we saw some pricing improvements in virtually all models. And I think there's only one model I can think of where the pricing was sort of flattish or -- versus before. But on a quarter-over-quarter, virtually all the models were off a little bit in price.","Douglas R.

And at this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Vice President, Investor Relations, Eric Salander. Please go ahead, sir.","Eric Salander","Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to mention, we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release.","On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO, and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our Web site.","Textron's revenues in the quarter were $3.2 billion, down $500 million from last year's second quarter. While net income was $0.93 per share, up from $0.87 per share last year. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions totaled $102 million compared to $399 million in last year's second quarter.","With that, I will turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Donnelly","Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everybody. Q2 was a solid quarter for Textron as we continue our focus on operational improvements across the company. Segment profit margin was up 120 basis points as we continue to see strong execution across our businesses, driven by higher margins at Aviation and Industrial. At Bell revenues were down in the quarter, largely due to lower military volume as we transition to lower production quantities on our military programs.","On the commercial side, we delivered 53 helicopters, down from 57 last year. Despite the lower commercial deliveries in the quarter, we expect to see a ramp in deliveries in the second half of the year, supported by continued strong order activity and increased production rates. In the quarter, Japan's National Police Agency placed the first order for the Bell 412epx, the newest upgrade of the 412 series. This aircraft has been co-developed between Bell and Subaru Corporation for the new utility helicopter program under Japan's Ministry of Defense and we expect this program to support the 412 program well into the future.","Within Future Vertical Lift, we continue with the flight testing and demonstration activities of our Valor V-280. We have now demonstrated Army level one handling qualities successfully proving the aircraft's maneuverability in pitch, roll and yaw. This represents the highest performance standards for agility, which is critical to the Army mission.","We're also encouraged by the Army's recent actions regarding the potential acceleration of the future long-range assault aircraft program. These actions include an industry days schedule at the end of this month that should allow potential contractors to gain more insight into the Army's acquisition approach, propose alternate procurement path through other transaction authority mechanism to be awarded in February. And identification of an engineering manufacturing development program or a middle tier acquisition award date estimated to be occurred 19 months following the OTA award.","Also within FVL, Bell was among five defense contractors down selected by the US Army to progress through the next phase of the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft program. We're pleased the Army recognized our competitive offering, which will utilize advanced rotor technology and fly-by-wire flight control capabilities validated in our Bell 525 program to create an innovative aircraft that is well suited for the far mission.","At systems, revenues were down, largely due to lower volume at TRU Simulation Training and Unmanned Systems. During the second quarter, our TRU Training business formed a new company with FlightSafety International, called FlightSafety Textron Aviation Training. Newly formed company, which is 30% owned by Textron provides training services through Textron Aviation's broad product line of general aviation aircraft.","We expect the combination of the strengths and resources of these businesses will further enhance the training and services available to our customers, while increasing efficiency and ensuring the extension of our high-quality training programs, new Textron Aviation aircraft. Also in the quarter Textron Airborne Solutions announces its ATAC Subsidiary, received a one-year, $56 million contract modification to provide high subsonic and supersonic aircraft services to the US Navy, extending our current contract through 2020. Within unmanned systems, our fee for service product line captured over $90 million of new wins in the quarter for the Aerosonde program.","Moving to Industrial, revenues were lower, primarily reflecting the impact of the disposition of the Tools and Test product line in last year's third quarter. In Specialized Vehicles, we saw continued favorable performance resulting from the cost reduction and manufacturing realignment actions that we initiated in the fourth quarter of last year.","Also in the quarter, we continue our on-boarding Bass Pro and Cabela stores, as well as independent Tracker Marine dealers and we're seeing momentum build in this new retail channel. Our ground support business received multiyear contraction from both American and United Airlines for our equipment across our TUG, Safeaero and Douglas brands to service their operations worldwide.","Moving to Textron Aviation, revenue was down, largely due to lower volume on our commercial turboprop and defense product lines. In the quarter, we delivered 46 jets, down from 48 last year and 34 commercial turboprops down from 47 last year's second quarter.","Beginning in late May, we experienced lower order activity across our product lines, largely attributable to the uncertainties around tariffs and concerns about economic growth, which cause disruptions in both our domestic and foreign markets. Since then, we believe these uncertainties have largely diminished as we've seen the Mexico tariff issue resolve, stronger economic indicators and a fed bias towards further interest rate cuts, which have improved customer outlook. Our view going into the third quarter remains positive, and we expect deliveries and order to ramp throughout the second half of the year, driving revenue growth in Aviation.","Moving to longitude, we continue to make good progress on the certification efforts, while this has been a much larger test than originally anticipated, the documentation flow and review with FAA continues and we expect type certification deliveries of the aircraft in the third quarter.","Continuing with Hemisphere, we determine that the engine has not yet demonstrated the performance required for the aircraft design and we have put the program on hold. Any decision to revisit the program in the future would depend on the state of the market, proven engine performance and a competitive landscape at that time. Our engineering focus remains on the certification of Longitude, in addition to the SkyCourier and Denali programs where we expect to complete first flights later this year.","In summary, we continue to feel good about execution across our businesses and we're well positioned for second half revenue growth from increased deliveries at Aviation driven by the Longitude entry into service, as well as higher commercial deliveries at Bell. We expect these developments to drive strong earnings and cash generation throughout the balance of the year.","With that, I will turn the call over to Frank.","Frank Connor","Thank you, Scott. Good morning, everyone. Segment profit in the quarter was $339 million, down $7 million from the second quarter of 2018. With segment profit margin of 10.5%, up 120 basis points from a year ago.","Let's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation. Revenues at Textron Aviation of $1.1 billion were down $153 million from last year's second quarter, primarily due to lower commercial turboprop and defense volume and mix. Textron Aviation delivered 46 jets, down from 48 last year and 34 commercial turboprops down from 47 last year.","Segment profit was $105 million in the second quarter, up $1 million from a year ago, as favorable performance was offset by the lower volume and mix. Textron Aviation backlog at the end of the second quarter was $1.9 billion. Revenues at Bell of $771 million were down 7% from last year, primarily on lower military volume. Bell delivered 53 commercial helicopters in the quarter, down from 57 last year. Segment profit of $103 million was down $14 million, primarily due to lower military volume. Bell backlog at the end of the second quarter was $6 billion. Revenues at Textron Systems were $308 million, down from $380 million last year, primarily reflecting lower volume at TRU Simulation and Training and Unmanned Systems.","Segment profit was up $9 million from last year's second quarter, primarily due an $11 million impact from performance, reflecting an $18 million gain related to the formation of our new training business with Flightsafety International. Moving forward, we will continue to record our portion of the operating profit from the new training business.","Textron Systems backlog at the end of the second quarter was $1.4 billion. Industrial revenues of $1 billion decreased $213 million, largely related to the impact from the disposition of our Tools and Test product line and lower volume. Segment profit was down $4 million from the second quarter of 2018, largely due to the impact from the product line disposition and lower volume, partially offset by favorable performance, primarily related to the Specialized Vehicles product line.","Finance segment revenues were down $1 million and profit was up $1 million from last year's second quarter. Moving below segment profit, corporate expenses were $24 million and interest expense was $36 million. We also repurchased 3.1 million shares at an overall cost of $159 million. Through the first six months of the year we've repurchased 7 million shares, returning $361 million in cash to shareholders.","To wrap up with guidance, we are raising our expected full-year earnings per share from continuing operations to a range of $3.65 to $3.85 per share, up $0.10 from our prior outlook . We are reiterating our outlook for cash flow from continuing operations of the manufacturing group before pension contributions of $700 million to $800 million.","That concludes our prepared remarks. So, Kevin, we can open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions] First question is from the line of David Strauss. Please go ahead. Barclays.","David Strauss","Good morning. I guess, first clarification, can you just tell us how much the gain was on the systems side for the training JV?","Frank Connor","It was $18 million, Dave.","David Strauss","And then, Scott, could you maybe talk about the potential for your 737 MAX Stimulator business. How many you've built there? What's your ability to ramp that up, given the potential training needs on the back of what's going on with MAX?","Scott Donnelly","So Dave, I can't give you a whole lot of detail on it. I mean, obviously, we've been delivering MAX since Boeing and several 737 MAX customers. I think a lot of that will depend on how all those plays out in terms of the recommendations or requirements that FAA and they also put on airlines around the need for SIM training. It looks at this point to us like it's probably going to be a requirement that allows them to get back and flying in the transition course and then would mandate actual MaxSim training later on. So we've certainly had quite a number of inquiries from customers who are interested in going ahead and getting MaxSims on order.","We started to do some long lead ordering already for to support those deliveries next year, but I couldn't give you a firmed up number yet. I think we're still working on that and working with Boeing to understand their strategy on a go forward basis as well. But we really have to kind of wait and, I think, see where the FAA also end up in terms of what their training mandates are.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Carter Copeland, Melius Research. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland","Scott, I wondered if you could just kind of expand a little bit on the rationale that's been made here with the company you set up with FlightSafety and just what that should tell us about the -- what applications are for your -- what you've been trying to create organically there? How much does this change the growth expectation that you have for those efforts? And are you trying to expand that much more rapidly and trading some of the profit as a result to try to get more scale there? Just kind of give us some detail on the rationale and then what you're trying to accomplish with that?","Scott Donnelly","Sure, Carter. So, as you know, we decided to get into that training business several years ago, we felt that was a very important part of sort of the service aftermarket element of our business and we weren't really participating in that. We had a lot of feedback from customers that they would be interested in us participate in that space. And so, as you know, we made a couple of fairly small acquisitions. Obviously, over the last few years, we've invested a fair bit in both IRAD and R&D, as well as CapEx to start to build out that training capability. The business is going very well, great customer feedback. I think the training materials and the techniques that we were deploying were working. The challenge was that, the time frame of how long that would take to build out the number of training centers and number of locations, it was a fairly daunting task and was going to take quite some period of time to do that.","We happen to engage in discussions with Flightsafety, whom we had relationship for many years, obviously, in the training side. And so, look, we ought to link together, let's take the technology and a lot of the Tools and the capability that we developed organically and put these businesses together in a joint venture, and basically what that's allowing us to do is, take what we think were the advantages of that business and the positive feedback we are getting from customers and expand it much more rapidly.","So this now has the ability to much more quickly accelerate the returns for us, and I think for the customers it sort of taking the best of whole worlds. The combination of what we would invest in organically and the significant footprint that Flightsafety has around the world, so that we could touch more customers in a time frame.","It was much shorter than doing this just going training center by training center in terms of us putting more and more capital out there and Flightsafety already have the capital out there. So, as we said, the gain is a function of having invested in that business and having put those assets in the joint venture. You got to look at sort of reevaluating those assets and, obviously, we created a very valuable business. And so that's a good thing.","I think more importantly, what we will see going forward is the earnings as a result of our share of that joint venture, which is going to grow much faster than we had, we stayed just on a pure organic path. And you'll see those earnings come through systems as we go forward.","Carter Copeland","Just in general terms, do you expect the growth to be 50% more or 2X or what -- just any color around how you can help what your expectation is or how much you've accelerated that as a result?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I don't -- we don't break out the numbers and that level of detail, Carter. But I'd say, it's significantly faster in terms of the rate of return. What we would have had if we had played this out on a purely organic basis. Let's say, the difference to having build up that capital infrastructure versus leveraging what Flightsafety already had on the ground, that becomes more of a technology play than a CapEx play.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu, Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Scott, just a big picture question, organically your sales were down 10% in the quarter. You've been focused on new products to gain share by fleet so in relatively tough end markets. How do you kind of think about the levers from here, just given your decision on the Hemisphere as well?","Scott Donnelly","Sure, Sheila. I think the for us in the quarter really in the first half of the year, the big impacts that will change how the second half plays out here is one around Bell commercial. And we talked last year when you were seeing strong demand on the commercial side, we indicated that we need to turn up our production rates to meet that demand. That takes a little bit longer for the -- from the time you make that decision till the time you have aircraft that are coming off the line.","So when we increase the production rates on aircraft like the 407 and the 429s. We didn't have those aircraft available coming off the line until right about now. So I think we'll see a significant impact in increases on the third and the fourth quarter. The demand is there, the orders are there, it's been a matter of getting the production up and delivering at a higher rate and that's where we are now. So you'll see the benefits of that here in the third and fourth quarter. They are already supported by orders that we have, we just needed to meet the demand in terms of the production side.","On the Aviation side, obviously, Longitude getting into service. That was a huge part of our growth story on Aviation for the year, and we expect that clearly will be the second half impact here. We continue, frankly, to see good demand on the historical aircraft. Latitudes continue to sell very strongly, we -- again demand a Longitude side is very good, I think across the whole portfolio.","Clearly, we had a very strong first quarter. For second quarter, we felt pretty good, things did get a little bit shaken up there right toward the end. And -- but they're mostly customers who would say, look, I want to wait for the markets to settle out, and I'm going to defer this in the second half. So I think our view at the business jet market is still very healthy. And so I think between that and the Longitude coming into service, we will see strong growth in the second half.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Thank you. And then, Frank, one for you on working capital. It's been a steep usage in the first half, I think primarily due to inventory. How do you think about that reversing and any potential risks in it?","Frank Connor","Yeah. Sheila, as Scott said with that growth in the second half, we expect to kind of, obviously, sell off and liquidate that inventory that the bulk of that build is at Aviation. It's kind of certainly impacted by the Longitude moving into the second half of the year, but it's also kind of Bell Commercial and other volume that Scott indicated. We are looking to have come through in the second half of the year and feel good about where we're positioned to do that.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Peter Arment, Baird. Please go ahead.","Peter Arment","Scott, could you just give us a little more color on how things are going in terms of within the Industrial segment, particularly, I guess, specialized vehicles. Format seem to be a little better than I think a lot of us were expecting. What's -- how is the Bass Pro kind of rollout going? Just maybe some color there.","Scott Donnelly","No, there's a couple of things there, Peter. First of all, obviously, from an operational performance standpoint, the business is doing much better. Historical businesses where we've had a very strong position and good performance for a long time in golf and ground support equipment and areas like that. Our sales performance is back where it should be, guys are doing very well, the markets are healthy, and again, the teams operational execution is quite strong in the off-road world, we're down in revenue, that's quite conscious, right?","We're working very, very hard to make sure that we do a much better job in terms of how we manage those retail channels. Snow is a good example, the position that we took this year as we said, guys, we're only going to pre-sell. When you look at the North American market, which is obviously the vast majority of the market in the snow world, we went out with our program. And so guys were only going to build what we've already sold. So we went around and have deposits from customers, this product line is basically sold out.","And so we'll be here through the whole third quarter manufacturing all those units and shipping them out, but unlike in previous years where we'll be putting a lot of inventory out into the field and dependent on how that sold through, and then getting into rebating if it's not selling through. We said, we're just not going to do that. So we're going to do only a presale and that was frankly a very successful program. We saw very strong demand across the product line, but were pre-sold.","So on the dirt side, obviously, that's a longer and sort of a little bit of a different selling season as you go through there. But again, we're being very, very cautious about how we manage that channel, how much inventory we allowed to be out into that channel, we did awful lot of hard work on looking at individual dealers and making sure that we have relationships where that relationship is a profitable relationship for both us and the dealer.","And as a result, we've dramatically reduced the number of deals that we had out there. Because when we went back and looked at some of them by the time you get through the rebating, it's not a profitable relationship. And so, we've taken the pains of terminating relationships with the vast majority of those folks. Specifically on the Tracker front, obviously, the Bass Pro, Cabela and their independent Marine dealers is terrific channel, extraordinarily well run, very, I would say, delivered around what it does in terms of inventory.","So in terms of how they manage is quite consistent with how we want to manage the business going forward. So we've been seeing a lot of activity and load-ins across both stores and independent dealers here over the last six months, that obviously will continue through the balance of the year. We like the trajectory, the momentum is building. So I think when you look year-over-year, Peter, we're much happier with where that business is, both in terms of its -- how it operates every day, how it thinks about managing some of those channels. Some of the issues we had last year would be late with some of the new products.","Obviously, that's -- those products did get the market and I think we have a great product lineup. We just have to be a very measured about how we manage the channels and how much inventory we allow to be out there to reduce risk and make sure that we have a good profitable business.","Peter Arment","Appreciate that. And just a quick one on. Scott, did you see any change in business jet pricing, just given the softness in end market a little bit that you saw in May or price is still holding?","Scott Donnelly","No, Peter, we're still seeing pricing holding. You know, there's always a crazy deal or two and we choose not to participate in those, right? So I think we make a great product, it's fairly priced, got a great service network behind it and there is no reason for us to chase a crazy price deal here and there. So we're maintaining that discipline. And as we've said all along, we will trade volume rather than damaging the price in the industry.","So I think that's -- I think the pricing is in a place where it should be, right? And we're going to hold the line and like you'll see here in the quarter, we had price net of inflation up a little bit, which is healthy for the business and that's what we need to continue to do.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from the line of George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.","George Shapiro","Scott, the implied orders in the quarter were pretty weak. And obviously, the book-to-bill was less than one. Given that you see things picking back up in third quarter here, is it natural to expect the book-to-bill over one in the third quarter recovering from the second quarter?","Scott Donnelly","Well, George, I would hope that that's the case. I mean, clearly, we had a very strong first quarter on the book-to-bill front. We're still have our backlog numbers net through the first half, above where it was coming into the year. So I think we're not overly concerned by this. As I said, things did slow down in June, given some of the gyrations in the market and talks around tariffs and things like that. But I think most of the discussions that we've had with customers, particularly in the U.S. were, some things would pushed into the second half and those dialogs continue with customers. So I think we're still in a pretty good -- in a pretty good place with that respect.","We were light on the turboprops, particularly in the international market. And as you know, George, that's a little bit lumpy. We've seen this before where it kind of goes in fits and starts. So that's a little bit harder market to predict. It generally affects more the turboprops than it does the jet side of the business, but we'll see how it plays out. But certainly my expectations would be that, we would continue to see good order flow through the balance of the year.","George Shapiro","And Frank, one for you, just Aviation aftermarket, how does that compare to last year?","Frank Connor","It was fine, it was down just a touch, but continues to kind of be solid for us.","George Shapiro","And the reason it's down a touch as opposed to up a little bit, any color on that?","Frank Connor","No, nothing significant kind of we've seen some variation in volume in the shops from time to time where we are looking at solid or a strong second half performance there. And kind of continue to be feel good about how we're executing it.","Operator","And next we have Robert Stallard, Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Robert Stallard","Scott, on the BizJet side of things, a couple of your competitors have launched some new products so far this year. And I was wondering if you could comment on whether this could impact your market share, going forward?","Scott Donnelly","Really nobody, Robert, right in our warehouse. I mean if you look at the -- I mean, earlier in the year, obviously announced Praetor. I think that's largely those product lines from that particular competitor have been up against the Latitude and, obviously, on Longitude. I think our products are outstanding performers and we continue to see strong demand on the Latitude front. And look, I think Longitude is in a very good position.","I wouldn't expect to see a lot more activity to get through the certification. I mean, there is plenty of customers that are in the process and many of whom I think are just waiting for cert to be done. So, I think from a performance standpoint, we continue to get fabulous feedback from everybody that demo, flies that aircraft. So I think it's a competitive marketplace, I think it's always been one and it will continue to be a competitive marketplace, but I think we're -- we stack up quite well with that. So every transaction has got competitive nature to it, but I think we're winning our fair share and feel pretty good about where we stand.","Robert Stallard","And then maybe one for Frank. You only changed your guidance as being up EPS by $0.10. I was wondering if you could comment on whether you see at the halfway point of the year any changes to the divisional split for the full year?","Frank Connor","No, it's largely intact. I'd say that, obviously, we've seen good performance out of Bell so far this year. So kind of reflected in that $0.10 is kind of continuing solid performance on the Bell, that probably kind of give some a little bit of upside to our original margin guidance there. And then, systems has done a nice job as well in kind of executing through the first half. So, kind of -- those are the two places where we're seeing some better performance that are contributing to the $0.10.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Cai von Rumohr, Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr","Yes. Thanks so much. So, yes, you mentioned Bell doing particularly well, how much of the strong profit in the second quarter reflected favorable EACs on Z22 multiyear two and kind of as we go into next year, are we still looking at 10 to 12 or can it be better?","Scott Donnelly","Well, Cai, I'd say that we always -- I mean, every quarter we have our EAC process and there is always some performance in there. It's certainly less than it was last year. So from a comparable place and then we kind of talked about this. Right? I mean, we've kind of been winding down the multiyear two revenues and ramping up the multiyear three revenues and that is certainly at a lower margin. And again, a lot of the performance and sort of reserves that you keep around multiyear two have largely played through.","So on a year-over-year basis, the EACs or the gain associated that are down, but there is still there and I would expect that'll always be there. I mean, we always try to continue to drive productivity and performance improvement and we recognize that we each time we go through an EAC. There is always some puts and takes. But I think the team executes quite well. But anyway, I would say, along the lines of how they're performing, there continue to be strong performance. So even though the EAC numbers might be lower gains in the quarter, we're reflecting it solid operating profit across whole business and I think we'll continue to see that.","Next year I would say, look, we've had sort of that 10 to 12 guide out there for some time on Bell. They certainly have been overdriving that here as we worked our way through multiyear two. I wouldn't change my perspective, that's a business that's well run, and we will continue to sit in that 10% to 12% range. There's a fair bit of R&D, as you know, going on, 525 has been a big part of that, V-280 has been a very large part of that. What we will be transitioning into these cape set one and cape set three OTA programs and those cost share associated with those. Our R&D spending needs to stay at a pretty high level to support what we think are some really significant opportunities for the future of Bell. So I think that 10 to 12 range is still how you all think about it.","Cai von Rumohr","Thank you very much. And then, Frank, so you're -- maybe give us some numbers on where the net price increase at Aviation was. It narrowed a bit in the first quarter. So where was it in the second? And also, given that you have yet to certify the Longitude, is your full year delivery target fully intact or does it -- should we be looking at a slightly smaller number this year?","Frank Connor","Yeah. So on the price side, Cai, our gross price was $13 million for the quarter and net price was $3 million. So a continued good performance on that front. And, no, I mean, we continue to be positioned to deliver on Longitude once we achieved certification and kind of we feel that we're in the right place to meet the commitments that we have for that. And we, obviously, haven't adjusted the Aviation number kind of in anyway.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Seth Seifman, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Seth Seifman","Thanks very much, and good morning. Just a follow-up there on Aviation, I guess the projection you've given for the segment is for about $550 million of earnings for the year. It implies a pretty big second half and I think given the Longitude deliveries, that kind of -- we can understand why the second half would be bigger and second half is seasonally usually bigger anyway, but even bigger this time. And so, can you walk us through, I mean, do you expect a significant increase in the earnings for Aviation in the third quarter, or does it kind of all come in the fourth quarter with the Longitude. And to the extent that there was any temporary softness in demand around some of those macro issues that you mentioned during the quarter. I mean, have you already seen that start to come back in terms of orders or indications of interest in the first couple of weeks of the third quarter here?","Scott Donnelly","Well. Seth, I would say that our progression as you know, I mean, this is usually a business that has a back-end load, a lot of that is driven by tax, folks wanted to get their aircraft deliveries done by the end of the year. I don't see any change in that. I think the progression that we normally see, we would expect to see. Arguably, it's going to be a little more accentuated than that, just because we have the Longitude coming in to service. So, yes, there will be more of a pickup in the back half associated with that. In terms of just the normal order flow, again, I think, things appear to be normal.","We actually did see customers that had said all are going to wait and see what happens after everything kind of got a little shaken up in the late-May, into June timeframe and to take delivery in the second quarter. But more of them were -- look, I just want to sort of put this aside and think about this as a second half activity. So again, from -- it's hard to our sales teams, those dialogs are ongoing. And so I would expect that we will see most of that come back and turn into third, fourth quarter deals. And in fact, this summer around aircraft that are deliveries that would be out in the next year.","Seth Seifman","Right. And then on the Longitude, given -- I think, it's probably just a handful of the initial units that are either marginally profitable or not profitable. And so, on that basis is it possible for Longitude to contribute to earnings in Q3 or is the Q3 earnings that we're going to see basically all from non-Longitude platform?","Scott Donnelly","Well, as you know, typically the initial deliveries are going to be at a lower margin. There will be some contribution, but certainly from a margin rate, there is no question in the third quarter they would be dilutive. So, now that being said, I think the performance, you've seen very strong performance of the business here in the first half. So our relative profitability on light revenue is stronger than has been. So it's offsetting against what is very strong performance. So it's still going to be respectable margins, but it will be -- if you just looked at Longitude on a stand-alone basis, it would certainly be dilutive.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Pete Skibitski of Alembic Global. Please go ahead.","Peter Skibitski","Scott, can you update us on ship to shore in terms of that initial LRP contract that I think you're expecting when that -- is the one that comes through here in the second half. Is systems going to kind of return to growth on that basis or maybe the UAV headwinds still too tough right now. Can you just update us there?","Scott Donnelly","So, Pete, I definitely think that -- Well, first of all, ship to shore is moving along well, the first craft is in builders trials, that was a huge milestone. So we're about halfway through that process, we're expecting delivery of the first aircraft here this quarter. The rest of the initial developmental units are moving along well behind that. We do continue to get long lead funding for that next production, lot of aircraft is actually three fiscal years that are in there.","We are in negotiation of that process. I would expect here in the third quarter or four quarter, the latest, obviously, we would get that under contract. So -- but the amount of revenue that we'll see this year is largely associated with those long lead materials. We do have some of the initial assembly or initial welding activity going on the first craft, but really you will see the impact of that as it starts to ramp up and generate revenue, where it will be a 2020 story. So, clearly from our perspective, Systems here is sort of bottoming in 2019 and you'll see the growth in 2020, in large part driven by that transition of ship to shore from development program to the production program.","Peter Skibitski","Can I just ask one follow-up, Scott? I haven't asked you in a while about this Marine Corps MUX program. They're doing a lot of interesting things, I think, with the acquisition strategy. Are you guys kind of comfortable on that program right now, it's an opportunity for you or some of the things that they're doing are they kind of making it tougher to bid on. Just your thoughts?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I think -- look, I think the Marine Corps is doing a lot of work right now. And then you've see these small levels of activity in prices, where they are just for best soliciting ideas, which I think is a very healthy thing to do. Obviously, we have done a lot of work on the concept of the MUX and how we would approach that program. The Marine Corps, obviously, is well aware of everything that we've -- that we've done there. We have participated in some of these other smaller projects where they're sort of going to industry and say, hey, give us your ideas around different Mission Systems and different concepts of operations. So I think they are sort of in a fact finding mode.","Obviously, we have put a lot of information in front of them over the last couple of years. And at this point, I think most of the work that we feel like we need to do in advance of those thing, we've largely done that. And I think here in the next couple of years you will see that thing transition from sort of the solicitation of ideas to help them formulate their final specifications, if you will, around that program and then it will turn into -- hopefully into a funded development program. Obviously, we would participate in that. I think we have a great solution to what they're looking for. But it will ramp over the next couple of years, I think.","Operator","And next we have the line of Rajeev Lalwani of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Rajeev Lalwani","First, just a question on Hemisphere. Can you talk more about the decision to put that on hold? How much of it was engine versus simply what you're seeing in the overall market and the signals you're getting there?","Scott Donnelly","It was purely the engine, as we've talked about for the last year or so, we think that the niche -- the area that we intended to fit with that aircraft and obviously had that shared feeling with NetJets as our launch customer was an area that would be a great product and a great price point, performance point to go into the marketplace. But the challenge was, there was really only one engine in development that was suitable to meet that performance point. And as I said in the prepared comments, that engine hasn't yet demonstrated the performance required for the aircraft.","So if at some point in the future that engine or whatever is demonstrated that can meet it, we would certainly revisit it. It's just -- I think, just too much time has gone by here and we can't sort of hold this thing in a -- I mean, we can't expect our customers to kind of wait an uncertainty any longer. So there is still potential for it out there, we have to evaluate and understand what's competitive dynamic, what's going on in the marketplace, what's going on with customers to determine at that later time whether that product would make sense or not"," We'd be certainly happy to evaluate and look at that, but in the meantime, clearly we need to take our engineering resource and focus on those things that are going to drive our growth in the mid to near term here, which is not just getting Longitude done, but getting SkyCourier and Denali into the Q. And as you know, we're always kind of looking at other concepts and opportunities within our portfolio that need refreshes, updates and things like that, which is what we normally do. So we're simply just going to take all that engineering resource that would have gone into the Hemisphere program and deploy that into our current portfolio of programs.","Rajeev Lalwani","On the Bell side, obviously, are pretty well positioned on the long-range and have the reconnaissance program. How important are those for the future of Bell. I mean, assuming that you're not successful there, should we start thinking about an overall restructuring of the military side of the business there, do you feel like there is enough other things going on to sort of sustain what you're seeing today or add to it?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I think if you look at the military side of Bell. We have good visibility on H1 production out in the '20, '22 timeframe. There's a number of FMS opportunities that are out there that we're pursuing. As you know, those always take time to get those to closure. V-22 were already running at that lower rate associated with multiyear three. Again there is some FMS opportunity or other things that they could increase that over time. And I think there are certainly some possibilities there.","And of course, this has become a very large installed base. So there is a ton of service business associated with this. There's upgrades and enhancement programs which are typical of any large defense platform, which we expect we will continue to see in the future. So I think Bell on the military side, just around V-22 and H1 can sustain and be a nice healthy business. But clearly from a growth standpoint, the opportunities are out there around far around far those V-280, of course, the MUX program which we just talked about, and some other opportunities around tiltrotor is what's going to drive the growth in the future. I think we're very well positioned on several of those programs.","Will we win them all? Probably not. But these are, these are very large programs. And so winning one or two of those is what would drive significant growth for Bell on top of the ongoing sustaining of the V-22 and H1 programs.","Operator","And next question is from the line of Jon Raviv of Citi. Please go ahead.","Jon Raviv","Good morning. Can you just level set us a bit more on systems margin going forward post the Flightsafety deal, but then also with the ship to shore connect ramping up. I understand that sales bottoms in for '19, but how about the margin rates. And I guess overall, how you think about earnings dollars growth going forward here with those two big moving pieces?","Scott Donnelly","Yes, we've showed you. I think the Systems business should be targeting around 10% margin, we have returned that last year. We're on track to be in that neighborhood this year, obviously, there has been a bit of a drag on -- associated with the fixed-price development on ship to shore, but again, that transitions into a production program. This is a business that we should expect to see a 10% margin business.","Jon Raviv","Okay, thanks. And then just going back to Aviation and it got it seems like something really kind of scared customers in May, June, even though the market has been through some other gyrations, especially for 2018, but it's kind of through that period. You typically sounded quite positive. So what do you think was different about the nature of this May-June move. And then look, I mean, that's a beat a dead horse, but really what gives you confidence that this is going to come back. I mean the Fed's cutting rates because the economy is slowing, that's probably not a good thing for customers.","Scott Donnelly","Well, look, I think people -- when you look at the combination of you -- Again, we had some market gyrations, but to your point, this happens periodically. Right? I mean, but you have this concern over Mexico tariffs. I mean that -- I think, we had a couple of customers that just flat out. They do a lot of business in Mexico and this is -- was a big problem for them. So that created some of that uncertainty. Look, a lot of people were talking down to.","The economy is really going to slow down dramatically. And I think the numbers that actually came out would indicate that's not the case. I mean, unemployment numbers are still quite good. The GDP numbers were actually better than most economists were forecasting. So, is the market on fire? No. But is it healthy and steady? I think that's more of a case of where we are. So customers that are interested in upgrading and buy new aircraft, they didn't go -- say, hey, I'm done. They were -- let me see what happens when things settle down a little bit. So -- and at the timing of it.","When we get one of these perturbations in the first month of the quarter that gives you time for customers to kind of understand where they are and get comfortable and move forward. When they happened in the last month of the quarter, it's a little more challenging because they come back to the table, but it's now past the end of the quarter. So I think -- but if that had not happened, we probably would have over driven a few jets, just given the number of things that were in the pipeline, but I think at least our view right now is, those were larger activities that deferred into the third quarter.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Robert Spingarn, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Spingarn","Just a couple of things. On the industrial business, you're guiding, I think pro forma for the divestiture about flat this year and that seem to track in the first half. But I'm wondering about some of the moving pieces in there. For example, how does the channel fill work with the Tracker product against streamlining your other distributors? And how do you think about automotive in the second half given some of the macro weakness that we're expecting, so that on Kautex. Can you -- essentially can H2 be flat with H1 is what I'm asking.","Scott Donnelly","So, I think if you look at -- Let me talk to the automotive side first. Clearly volumes around most of the world are down, but frankly the comparisons on Q3, Q4 are going to be easier than Q1 and Q2, because you really saw that slowdown hit in the latter part of last year. So I think our business is performing well. I mean, we're happy with performance and operations and margins and how the guys are doing. But there is no doubt, it is on a lower volume basis but more or less consistent with where we thought it would be.","And as I said, the Q3, Q4 comps are certainly easier than what we saw in Q1 and Q2, just given the global automotive slowdown. So, I think we're comfortable with where we are. Again, the team is executing quite well and delivering based on where that end market is. So we continue to be feel good about new programs and new nominations which obviously are growth and opportunities in the future as well.","On the off-road side, I'll tell you the Tracker, the way that the -- the inventory and stocking model works in Bass Pro and Cabela and their dealers is a very disciplined process. It's a very healthy process and we feel very good about how that's going, and the way the team there manages that. It's a great partnership. We're pleased with how it's going and very comfortable with just how they do business and how they manage that business.","I talk a little bit about the other piece of the channel around snow. We're just -- guys, we have some very, very good deals out there, particularly a lot of our dealers who have a long history with that brand in the snow side. As I said we're being extraordinarily disciplined with how we do that and how we manage that and we'll do that on the dirt side as well, because it is largely those same dealers of guys that are historical snowmobile dealers that are carrying that Arctic Cat brand of dirt. And by the way, they are very complementary channels.","The strength of that channel under that Arctic Cat brand tends to be in the northern parts of the US and Canada where the snowmobile country exists. And in most of the rest of the country happens to be where the Bass Pro, Cabela's and their independent Marine dealers are very strong. So it gives us in total, I think a very strong distribution network.","Robert Spingarn","Do you find that whether is a bigger factor for dirt as it is for snow. And then one last thing I wanted to ask you is similar and how -- in commercial helicopter, similar to my first question about H2. How do you get optimistic or as optimistic for a bounce back when the rig counts have been fairly soft, especially in the second quarter?","Scott Donnelly","Well, so on the helicopter front, keep in mind that our share in those deepwater rigs, we really don't address that market today. That's part of what the 525 is about for the future, but where our market is and where we've frankly seen strength and very strong workflow here in the last, almost going on a couple of years now is really around the near in stop in oil and gas and frankly a lot of emergency medical services, executive VIP, customs and border patrol. I mean it's a much broader market. Police -- really -- what really drives the 407 and 429 markets is not the oil and gas market.","So there is a real contrast right now between the big machines that are large oriented serving that offshore oil and gas market, it's just not a market we've had a very big position or the market that's quite strong is, again, around more of that the light twins, the single, so it's volume around 505, 407, 429 and 412, which is not that deep water offshore oil and gas market.","Robert Spingarn","And then just a whether question on dirt versus snow?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I'd say it's a lot less dependent, snow is very dependent on the snow season. Again, this is part of why we want to sort of insulate ourselves from that by saying, guys, we're in a pre-sell. So those snowmobiles are going to be built and that will be shipped and they're paid for and that will all happen before there's -- we even get into the snow season. So by design, we were trying to insulate ourselves from that one way or the other.","Of course, we look very hard at what's out there in the inventory, the inventory levels of our products frankly ended up at a very low level last year. Well below where we originally targeted and that was because it did seem a relatively in most parts a good snow -- strong snow season. And so our dealers did retail through a lot of product. So I think it puts us in a very healthy position.","We have a fairly low level of inventory out there and we've already pre-sold all of our 2020 models that are going out. Dirt is more difficult. I mean, essentially more difficult. I mean it's not as weather-dependent, right? You've got a spring season, a fall season, it's not -- it really doesn't -- isn't driven by particular weather cycle on the dirt side.","Operator","Next we have Noah Poponak, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Noah Poponak","Scott, did you actually specifically have live -- in the process kind of ready to rock business jet customers then specifically cited the Mexico tariff situation as a reason to hold off. So as opposed to just -- you were talking broad macro and giving an example.","Scott Donnelly","No, absolutely no. I mean there were couple of specific transactions with customers that do a lot of business in Mexico and their business is dependent on that. And they got pretty rattled. Now, will they come back? I would expect so. I think that whole issue -- I mean, if you look part of it, Noah, that came out of nowhere, right? I mean, this was a -- more of a diplomatic issue then a tariff -- they thought that the new free trade agreements, had all the dust settled on all that sort of stuff.","And so this kind of came as quite a surprise, but of course, now it's also going away. So I think hopeful of those things will come back, but yeah, I think there were very specific transaction that literally stopped because of that. And in a bigger way it contributed just to a level of uncertainty economically and people don't spend big capex items when there is uncertainty.","Noah Poponak","It's interesting. Not to diminish the -- how meaningful that specific thing is, but it's just a pretty specific thing. And so I guess, just in trying to -- we all keep I think trying to ascertain where we are on the spectrum of weak market to OK market, but still kind of touching go and skittish to strong market and I had interpreted some of your commentary year-to-date to suggest we had -- we are really moving toward stronger market. And I guess how concerned are you that you just we'll never be able to get a fully firmed up tight market until we just have -- until we are just out of the cycle and we're in a new cycle as long as everyone's, because there's always going to be some headline not dissimilar to that, right?","Scott Donnelly","No, there is always. And I can't predict them all or either, right? I mean, but look we've been playing this sort of over 10 years now. And so, yes, things get curveball get thrown in there of one flavor or the other, whether it's markets or international tensions or currency. I mean, look, this is the nature of the world that we live in. But some things are very specific localized problem some are more broad based.","But as I said, I think, you look at where the market was through 2018 and the beginning of '19 still feel very good. I think we still feel like we have a very good list of customers. I do think that the cycle that -- if you want to talk about that way, there was a overhang of a lot of the used aircraft and all these sorts of things is largely behind us and so that gives us a little more stability I think.","And then just a general better feeling on the new side where you don't have that big overhang on the used side, which clearly is the case right now. Most used aircraft that are out there are quite older used aircraft. I mean those transact typically at a slower rate. Every indication on the used aircraft market which obviously we're a big participant in that market is that, if you've got newer aircraft that kind of people to do trade in and do buy aircraft, it's still very liquid and there is good demand. You come out there with a good used aircraft, they transact.","So it's healthy -- it is healthy. The underlying market is as healthy as has been in a very long time. Does that make it immune to something sort of percolating it like we saw here? No, absolutely not. But I still think in general, we feel good about where it is, the dynamics of, again, used of pricing of new products coming into the market that I think will help drive a lot of our growth.","Again, we -- as you know we've taken an approach that says, if the markets are just sort of flattish we need to drive growth by bringing things like a Latitude into the market, by bringing the Longitude into the market, by bringing the Denali and SkyCourier into the market. Those are the things -- that are the investments that we make to try to drive growth in the business even if we have a flattish overall market.","Noah Poponak","Yeah, OK. That's really helpful. I appreciate that. On the Aviation margin, do we need to be aware of a substantial variance between the third quarter and the fourth quarter margin, just as you bring the longitude in the third quarter?","Scott Donnelly","Look, I think you're going to -- you would expect to see a somewhat lower margin in Q3 because of that dilution of the initial Longitude orders going out there. And then you would expect to see stronger Q4 margin. I mean -- but as you all know, we always -- that's sort of -- just the volume and the dynamic of our business is always kind of plays out a little bit like that anyway between Q3 and Q4. Q3 tends to be a lower margin and Q4 largely driven by volume, but there will be probably a little bit of differentiation here based upon that -- the dilution of Longitude.","But again, I think the underlying performance of the business, how they're executing, the productivity, the efficiencies that has been driving a pretty significant improvement on a year-over-year basis. I mean, you run like couple of hundred basis points or so better and that will be tough to do in Q3, given the Longitude dilution. But I think we'll -- you'll see continued strong performance from that business.","Noah Poponak","And then last one on the cash flow. The year needs to be meaningfully more back-end loaded than the normal historical seasonality to get to the guidance. I'm assuming that's primarily or entirely Longitude, anything else?","Scott Donnelly","Well, the biggest for Longitude is probably the -- is certainly the single biggest driver. We build these aircraft. The demand is there. Customers are there. We just got to get the certification done. So we've got plenty of aircraft set up and ready to go. I talked a little bit about Bell. Obviously, we've been ramping that production right up here. So, that's all sitting in working capital right now and you'll see considerably higher volumes here in Q3, Q4 on the commercial side of Bell.","And then, I mean, that are smaller numbers but as you look at, for instance, the snow stuff. I mean we've got all that stuff going in working capital right now. We will produce all that stuff and sell that through mostly here in the third quarter. The dirt side, we're always going to have a little bit of some higher inventory carrying there, because we need to be able to run the factory and do nothing but snowmobile third quarter. So we build up enough inventory to make sure that we can satisfy the demand in that channel as well.","But again, most of that -- the significant dollars are associated with Longitude's and the Bell ramp, things like the snowmobile going out. I mean, I think, that's why we still feel quite comfortable with our initial guidance range, albeit sure that it is more back-end loaded than we would like.","Operator","And next we have the line of Ronald Epstein, Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Kristine Liwag","Scott, Safeaero just put out a press release that there is no financial impact for both of you from the contract termination on the Hemisphere. Since the issue seems to be largely from engine performance, I was wondering why there isn't more recourse for you from Safeaero. How is your contract different from your competitor that got a few hundred million dollars in penalties from them?","Scott Donnelly","Well, because we don't have a few hundred million dollars of penalty associated with it. There was -- we do on a much smaller scale do R&D sharing with some of our key suppliers and largely we have had, again, a very small relatively speaking, number that's in there that's been supporting some of the R&D, it is a shared program. So we've had R&D in it, they have R&D in it. My understanding is, they're going to look to continue to work the engine. If they can get that engine to its specifications, it would be a great engine. So I can appreciate that they would continue to make some investment as well. But we don't deal in these massive programs to offset these things. And frankly because -- there is not -- I mean it's size of the market, there is not a volume that anybody would ever investor or put up that kind of a upfront-end loaded payment or obligation.","Kristine Liwag","And when you think about that size aircraft in the market. I mean, the hemisphere was opposed to entering service sometime next year when you first initially rolled it out. Can you describe what's going on in that market environment today. And is there demand for replacement of Hemisphere type aircraft?","Scott Donnelly","Well, the decision point was to be to launch it this year. So they are entry the service would have been out probably five years, anyway, before that we go into the market, but it was intended to be an aircraft that go into fleets like NetJets and obviously other retail customers, that had a requirement to do that longer range.","Again, I mean, the theory of where we were in that business was, most of the large-cabin manufacturers are going to ultra long-haul and even longer range aircraft and there is still was a demand in a right place at the right price for the right performance capability for an aircraft that was more in that 4,500 nautical mile range. And there really hadn't been a clean sheet new airplane in that space in a long time. And that was what we thought the opportunity was, because the challenge there, you need to have the right engine airplane combination. And so that was always predicated on having that engine there.","And as I said, there has been a lot of hard work. There has been a lot of progress frankly that Safeaero team has made it just was not yet able to demonstrate. And we just had a timeline that says guys we need to step back here and commit resources in other places for now and the engine, I guess there then we can revisit that.","Kristine Liwag","Thank you for the color.","Eric Salander","Okay. Operator, that does it for this call. Thank you everyone and you can reach me if you have any follow-up questions. And we'll see you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference. We do thank you for joining. You may now disconnect. Have a good day."],"20859":["Textron, Inc (NYSE:TXT) Q1 2014 Earnings Conference Call May  1, 2014  8:00 AM ET","Executives","","Doug Wilburne - VP, IR","Scott Donnelly - Chairman & CEO","Frank Connor - CFO","","Analysts","","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Jason Gursky - Citi","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Joe Nadol - JPMorgan","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company","Ron Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Justin Bergner - Gabelli & Company","","","Operator","Welcome to the Textron First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Doug Wilburne. Please go ahead.","Doug Wilburne","Thanks Greg. Good morning everyone. Before we begin I would like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today\u2019s press release.","On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.","On March 14, we completed our acquisition of Beechcraft combining it with Cessna to create a new segment called Textron Aviation. Therefore our first quarter results include the impact of the acquisition including 16 days of operating results. On this basis Textron\u2019s revenues in the quarter were 2.8 billion of approximately flat with the first quarter of 2013. Income from continuing operations was $0.31 per share compared to $0.40 in the first quarter of \u201913.","As shown on slide 4 of the earnings presentation the net impact of the Beechcraft acquisition during the first quarter was a reduction to EPS of $0.05 per share. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was a $111 million use of cash compared to $425 million use of cash in last year\u2019s first quarter.","First quarter pension contributions were 17 million and with that I will turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Donnelly","","Thanks Doug. Good morning everybody. Revenues in the quarter were up at our new Textron Aviation segment and across all of our industrial businesses. Overall manufacturing revenues were approximately flat as lower volumes of Textron Systems and Bell offset the higher revenues at aviation and industrial.","At Bell we delivered eight V-22s and five H-1s compared to nine V-22s and six H-1s in last year\u2019s first quarter. On the commercial side we delivered 34 aircraft down from 48 a year ago reflecting timing of deliveries. Order demand was stronger than a year ago so we still expect commercial deliveries will be up in 2014. We had a very good show again this year\u2019s HELI-EXPO in early March highlighted by the unveiling of our new Bell 505 Jet Ranger X. We received nearly 200 customer commitments during the show for the 505 reflecting stronger customer interest in this entry level helicopter.","At HAI, we also featured our new 525 Relentless which we displayed in the search and rescue configuration. We received our first 525 letter of intent at the show for delivery of 10 units from Abu Dhabi Aviation.","They plan to deploy these units in support of a variety of missions including offshore oil and gas, emergency medical services, VIP transport and search and rescue. Bot the 525 and 505 were on track for first flight by the end of this year with expected entry into service in 2016. During the quarter we also expanded the capability of our 429 product as we received Canadian and Brazilian certification of a retractable wheeled landing gear version of the aircraft which provide significant operational flexibility for our customers. We also participated in the Singapore airshow where we displayed our 407GX and 429 commercial offerings and on the military side we had an H-1Z and a V-22. We also had a number of positive developments in the Asia-Pacific region as we established a new sales office in Japan and announced the sale of eight 412s for the Philippine Department of Nation Defense and booked eight helicopter orders in China with options for seven more.","Finally we were named number one in helicopter services support for the 20th consecutive year at ProPilot magazine. Aftermarket support is a key competitive differentiator in the vertical of market and we will continue to invest and work to expand our support capabilities around the world. Moving next to Textron Systems revenues were down as expected but we had a good program performance for segment margins of 10.7%. We continue to make progress on the Shadow TCDL upgrade development program and we\u2019re on track to deliver production units beginning in the third quarter.","We\u2019re also seeing continued performance improvements in our Aerosonde fee-for-service platform reflecting the successful deployment of Lycoming manufactured engines into the installed fleet for which we now have achieved over 10,000 hours of operation.","Earlier this month our new aircraft Simulation and Training business participated in the World Aviation Training Conference where we launched our new name and brand through simulation training. This reflects our mission to ride [ph] realistic pilot environments for true to life ensuring pilots are fully experienced, competent and confident when they leave our simulators.","Shifting to Industrial, we saw a good growth of Caltex reflecting strength in Asian and European auto markets. We also continue to win new platforms at Caltex which bodes well for continued long term growth. E-Z-GO also continued to grow as top line based on new products. We have been rolling out across our golf, consumer, commercial and aftermarket product lines. At Greenlee, growth is driven by continued market share expansion and our acquisitions of Sherman & Reilly and HD Electric last year.","We\u2019re currently pursuing new electric utility transmission sales opportunities with the 12 city roadshow to demonstrate a new product line up, highlighting how our products can support our customers health, safety and productivity. Also in the acquisition front we added in important new product line at Jacobsen during the quarter with purchase of Dixie Chopper, a U.S. manufacturer of zero-turn radius mowers. Expands our product offering to better serve the commercial and municipal market sectors.","Moving to Textron Aviation, with the acquisition of Beechcraft we delivered our first eight King Air\u2019s during the last two weeks of the quarter. We also delivered 35 new jets up from 32 a year ago. We were pleased that even at these relatively low volumes we were able to generate a $22 million year-over-year improvement in segment profit in the quarter. On the new product front our Latitude prototype took first flight on February the 18th and followed on February the 25th, the demonstration of its maximum flight envelope. This included reaching a maximum speed of 440 knots or mach 0.8 and going on a direct climb to a maximum altitude of 45,000 feet with a maximum gross take off to 29,000 pounds. ","We continue to make progress towards the 2015 entry into service for the Latitude. We also announced the new CJ3 plus which includes a state of the art fully integrated Garmin 3000 avionics suite, a redesign cabin and cockpit and new pressurization diagnostic systems. We also introduced CJ2 plus Alpine Edition, our Garmin 3000 cockpit upgrade option for existing CJ2 plus owners.","Finally Cessna achieved a noble milestone during the quarter as our installed fleet of 6600 citations reached over 30 million total flight hours of service. With the Beechcraft acquisition we now have a global customer base, operating over 9000 business jets as well as over 9000 turboprops and over 180,000 piston engine aircraft.","With respect to Beechcraft we\u2019re estimating Beechcraft will add about 1.5 billion in revenue to the aviation segment this year. This reflects an expectation for higher aftermarket revenue, lower military sales and slightly fewer King Air\u2019s this year as we believe 2015\u2019s volume is benefited from catch-up deliveries related to the uncertainties leading up to the Beechcraft bankruptcy. Therefore our 2014 revenue guidance for Textron Aviation is now 4.8 billion.","In terms of synergies, we began implementing restructuring activities last week and now estimate we will spend about 35 million in 2014 and reach an annualized cost synergy run-rate of about 80 million by the end of this year. On this basis and including the impact of purchase price accounting right up to amortization, we estimate the acquisition will add about 45 million net to Textron Aviation segment profit this year. Therefore segment margin guidance for the year remains at 2.5% and 3.5%.","To give you a sense of the earnings power the segment going forward after adjusting for purchase price accounting items and giving benefit to full year synergies and fully annualized results. 2014 Textron Aviation margins would be about 200 basis points higher than the midpoint of our current guidance range.","While our restructuring process will not conclude by the end of the year we believe we will be able to offset any 2015 cost with additional savings and remain comfortable with our previous statement that we expect the Beechcraft acquisition will be accretive by $0.25 to $0.30 per share on a fully annualized basis.","To wrap up we believe we\u2019re off to a good start on the year; we\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing in terms of demand in the majority of our markets. We continue to make progress with operational productivity, our strategy in investing new products and distribution is paying off and we\u2019re seeing good results from our M&A investments.","With that I will turn the call over to Frank.","Frank Connor","","Thank you Scott. Good morning everyone. Segment profit in the quarter was 219 million down 16 million from the first quarter of 2013 on approximately flat revenues. Let\u2019s look at how each of the segments contributed starting with Textron Aviation. At Textron Aviation, revenues were up 77 million from this period last year reflecting a 101 million of acquired Beechcraft revenue, higher jet, Caravan and aftermarket volume partially offset by a reduction in preowned sales and CitationAir revenues.","The segment had a profit of 14 million compared to a loss of 8 million a year ago. This reflected favorable pricing and higher jet and Caravan volumes. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at 1.5 billion up 503 million from the end of 2013. This includes a $534 million contribution from Beechcraft. Moving to Bell, revenues were down 76 million on lower commercial unit sales and decreased B-22 and H-1 deliveries partially offset by higher V-22 product support.","Segment profit decreased 33 million from the first quarter in 2013 primarily reflecting the overall volume and unfavorable commercial aircraft mix as we delivered only two 412s in the quarter. At Textron Systems revenues were down 66 million reflecting lower UAS and TMLS volumes offset by higher weapons and sensor volume. Segment profit increased 1 million despite lower volumes reflecting favorable performance across most product lines.","Industrial revenues increased 70 million reflecting higher automotive volume and the impact of acquisitions. Segment profit increased 9 million due to the higher volumes. Moving to finance revenues in segment profit were down 13 million and 15 million respectively reflecting the impact of gains on the disposition of finance receivables during 2013.","Non-accrual accounts ended the quarter at 98 million down 7 million from the end of 2013 while 60 day delinquencies were a 125 million up 45 million in the quarter.","Lastly moving to corporate items, corporate expenses were 43 million and we believe we\u2019re still on track for a full year amount of about a 150 million. Interest expense was 35 million down from 37 million a year ago reflecting the retirement of our convertible debt in May of last year partially offset by 7 million in interest cost related to the Beechcraft acquisition financing.","Our tax rate was 30.4% reflecting a number of discreet non-U.S. benefits in the quarter. We\u2019re still estimating a full year tax rate of about 31.5%. During the quarter we repurchased 4.3 million shares through an accelerated repurchase program. This should result in a four year average share count of about 283 million shares. Looking then to our full year outlook as shown on slide 5, we estimate that Beechcraft will reduce 2014 EPS by about $0.08 per share.","On this basis the company now expects 2014 earnings per share from continuing operations will be in a range of a $1.92 to $2.12 per share. Cash flow from continuing operations of the manufacturing group before pension contributions is still expected to be in a range of 600 million to 700 million. This reflects an approximate cash neutral net operating impact from the Beechcraft acquisition. That concludes our prepared remarks. So Greg we can open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of John Godyn from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","Scott, I was hoping now that we've had some time to digest Beech that you could talk a little bit more about revenue synergy opportunities. You had some very good commentary on the cost synergy side, it sounds like on a run rate basis the outlook there is that it could exceed some of the prior comments. I'm just curious what the outlook looks like or how it might have evolved on revenue synergies now that you've had some more time?","Scott Donnelly","With respect to revenue synergies, it's not something that I want to really put hard number around. We try to base all of our synergy and math around the things we know we can control which is really on the cost side of the equation. I'd also say from a timing perspective here. We've been working pretty hard over the last few months on the cost side of things -- the team has been working together so that we were able to kind of come out of the gate right away executing on the cost synergies.","Obviously we couldn\u2019t get sales teams together prior to the official closing so those teams are now working. We've got kickoff events and the folks that are in the particular regions that have been selling King Air\u2019s or meeting with the teams that have been selling Citation jets. So we are certainly starting to operate to make sure that we can take advantage of what revenue opportunities or maybe, but it's not something that I would put a number.","Obviously we feel good about the fact that we now have a huge install base of Hawker jets and these are customers that are very, very important to us. We\u2019re going to reach out to them to work with them on the service front which also will hopefully over time increase our conversion rate or I guess retain those Hawker customers and as they move to a new jet we obviously want to see them move into the Citation jet family and we will do everything to make sure they have a very service experience to help promote that on a go forward basis.","But it's not something that we're going to come out with any form of real guidance around a specific number on the revenue synergy side.","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","Outside of a specific number, I mean is it fair to say that directionally now that you\u2019ve had more time looking at Beech and the sales forces are communicating that you feel directionally better about revenue synergy potential as we think about it long term?","Scott Donnelly","I think John we always felt that this was an important part of the acquisition and something that would be a great add in terms of adding those additional sales resources and building those relationships and we have only being in to this now for a few weeks. The teams have been getting together, I would say there is a great deal of energy around it, you know each of the sessions -- had around the world where we get these teams together, people are very enthusiastic, very bullish on working together to get out there and just increase our coverage and build more customer relationship. So it was without a doubt an important part of the transaction and I would say so far as the teams we have gotten together we feel very good about it.","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","And then I was just hoping that you could elaborate on the general biz jet commentary and specifically what you're seeing with some of the legacy aircraft types. A lot of the data that the analyst community tracks has generally being a looking a bit better. Some people have gotten a bit excited. I'm just curious what your perspective is as you read the tea leaves? Thanks.","Scott Donnelly","So key metrics continue to move in the right direction in terms of used available for sale. You certainly hear some firming around the pricing in the use market which is encouraging. For sure the number of aircraft and we watch this every quarter in terms of Citation fleet and what's available for sale, drop-down another 40 aircraft or so as the install base continues to grow. So I would say in terms of trends of some of those key metrics they are still going in the right direction.","We feel good about the fact that pricing has firmed in the use market. We feel good about the fact that pricing is incrementally better in the new market as well. So if I had to kind of give overall color on a year-over-year basis as we sat here a year ago we were kind of saying we are little concerned about what we are seeing in the market and we were taking production back and sort of trying to firm pricing and we sit here a year later and while the overall numbers are not a lot higher in terms of unit deliveries we certainly feel better about what's going on in the market and feel a lot more confident about where we're heading here as we into the second, third quarter than we did a year ago.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.","Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton","Scott, I wanted to ask about pricing. You mentioned -- in the release you have got some pricing on the new models, new model Citations. Just wondering if you've got any pricing on the balance of the Citation portfolio because I know you guys have tried to be a little bit more disciplined on pricing.","Scott Donnelly","Yes we did Pete and in fact when you see the pricing numbers here they will come out, our pricing was up on a year-over-year basis and that really is a reflection of the legacy models. The M2s and the Sovereigns which were give bit of a volume here in the first quarter aren't going to be in that price number because they are new models. So, the price was certainly up on the existing CJ and XLS families and that number is out there. The M2s and the Sovereigns obviously -- they are new -- will not show up in our pricing number but certainly pricing has been better than we've seen in the past.","Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton","That\u2019s great and then I\u2019m interested in kind of your new expectations for a peak margins at aviation. I mean it's tough to kind of figure out what kind of the go ahead margin rate at Beechcraft would be given it's kind of up and down history and Hawker has wound down but you\u2019ve got $80 million in cost savings you\u2019re looking at. So can you give us some color around you know what peak margin can possibly be for the big aviation segment?","Frank Connor","Pete, I have to be honest I haven't tried to do that math yet. We have been sort of focused here on making sure we can communicate to you guys exceptions in terms of what it means here at\u201914 and particularly how to model going into \u201915, in terms of you know peak margins as you know we have always talked about trying to get through a couple 100s basis points better than in the past. That\u2019s obviously a little bit muddied up here because we\u2019re going to have a mix of stuff that we don\u2019t actually really know what the margins were back in those peak days because there was so much noise in all of the financials as Beech went through, the Hawker issue. It is a very complicated model, Pete, so I can\u2019t even really go back and tell you very well an actual real percent to know what to base that peak off of. I know that\u2019s kind of a muddy answer but the math is -- historical numbers always had all kinds of special charges and impacts of things. It's just it's not an easy comparable.","Scott Donnelly","I think the way to think about it is in Scott\u2019s earlier comments about the 200 basis points adjustment for kind of a normalized full year run-way of the segment and then you are making your own assumptions on what you think volumes are going to do and what the pricing environment is and I think you can come up with a view of where your margins are going to go.","Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton","Okay. Last question should we'd be worried that 412 was down year-over-year and 429 as well?","Scott Donnelly","I think Pete, that\u2019s just timing. We had an awful lot of 412s that went out in the fourth quarter just based on customer demand and where they were, so we were very light in the first quarter particularly with respect to 412s which is an important part of the mix commercial business but I don't think that portends anything for the year. It was just a light number deliveries based on customer demand and delivery dates for the first quarter.","Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton","You still think 4.5 billion for Bell for the full year in revenue?","Scott Donnelly","That\u2019s correct. Yes, sir.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada","Just a follow-up, I think you reiterated your Bell revenue guidance there. I was wondering if you could comment on Textron Systems, whether you\u2019re still comfortable with your full-year revenue guidance for that division?","Scott Donnelly","We\u2019re trying to stay away from quarterly guidance here but we did try to tell people the real drivers of the revenue growth on a year-over-year basis is driven in large part by the TCDL program which is really going to be a third and fourth quarter program just because that\u2019s when we\u2019re going to be completed the final testing and it should be signed off in terms of starting customer delivery. So we expected the first and frankly expect the second quarter to be pretty light in terms of the revenue line because you won't see those deliveries until the third and fourth quarter.","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada","And then secondly on the aviation division, I was wondering if you can give us an idea what the sort of lead time is on a new jet at that moment? Whether that started to move out a little bit?","Scott Donnelly","It depends on which model. So it has -- got a little bit on some of the models and if you\u2019re interested Robert we will push up as far forward in the list as we could.","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada","No I was focused more on the ones where you have been operating a bit on a spot basis and whether that\u2019s stretched down a little bit?","Scott Donnelly","It's a still spot basis on some of the lighter jets Robert, but as you get into some of the new models like the Sovereigns you\u2019re starting to build -- again not a huge backlog but these aircraft for instance are -- I don\u2019t think we can get to one of those Sovereigns in the second quarter. So we\u2019re kind of at a point where that production line is pretty well matching what the demand is sort of quarter ahead.","Operator","We will go to the line of Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","I just wondered in terms of the Beechcraft business, the lumpiness of sort of the margin profile there during the year. I don't know if there's anything particularly important in terms of seasonality that you wanted to call out but obviously the margin number to the extent that it counts for you had in Q1 but very, very high versus the kind of 7% underlying margin guide for the year.","Scott Donnelly","Well I think Julian if you look at the numbers it looks like a very high number because it really just reflects those last two weeks of a quarter and you had a lot of King Air deliveries which is fairly standard I think in this business. You tend to have a fair number of deliveries right near at the end of the quarter. So the margin rate in that two week period looks particularly high but that\u2019s because you had eight deliveries in a two week period of time over a relative short cost base. So I think that\u2019s just a function of the fact that you\u2019re just looking at a snapshot of the last two weeks of the quarter. In terms of sort of a normal annualized looking at the business from what we have seen if its historical numbers it doesn\u2019t look terribly different than the jet business. Deliveries tend to be stronger in the fourth quarter than they are in the second quarter let\u2019s say, but again it doesn\u2019t look to us to be have historically being very different than what we see in the jet business.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Thanks and then on the Bell, I guess you are still sticking with that 12%, 12.5% margin guide for the year as a whole. I just wondered if there's anything in Q1, any spillover in terms of the ERP type stuff that hurt the margins were it really was primarily around the commercial mix and that should come back?","Scott Donnelly","Well I mean there is both things in there Julian, so for sure as we talked about last year as we went through sort of the challenges on the new ERP system and the labor disruptions. We were running at a higher cost basis than we normally would and a fair bit of that did get inventoried just because it goes and then leaves off over a period of time. So when we gave you the guidance around the margins we did expect that as that inventory went through and burned off over the course of the year that we expect that we would see about a 100 basis point drag on our margin rates through the course of the year and in fact if we look at those things that were -- those additional costs as they flow through in the first quarter it was about 100 basis point drag.","And so I think you will see roughly a percent of margin degradation in this year\u2019s performance that was a result of those higher cost that we incurred last year but again that was factored into the guidance that we gave you in that 12%, 12.5% number.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Thanks and lastly very quickly R&D to sales. You had indicated alongside the Q4 earnings that should be a tailwind to margins this year, year-over-year, is that still the case?","Scott Donnelly","I think it's a very slight tailwind and I think it remains that way as we bring Beech and the R&D as a percent of sales is kind of about what it is for the overall Textron Company. So no real change in terms of the overall R&D as a percent of sales and it's a very slight tailwind. It's a little bit wider in Cessna because of the lower numbers of aircraft and certification. It's a bit higher at Bell as we have 525 and 505 and V-280 [ph] all going full tilt.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason Gursky - Citi","Scott, I wanted to ask a question around the sales force and the aviation segment you've gone through pretty big transformation in there over the last year or 18 months. Was wondering if you could provide an update to us on the benefits, what you've got this far out of that transformation as you move more to a direct sales force? And whether these guys have been to populate some sort of pipeline in this tracking system and what that pipeline looks like on a year-over-year basis.","Scott Donnelly","So I think there is no question we have been continue to grow our sales force both domestically and internationally as we have talked about before adding a lot more of our resources as opposed to be dependent on third parties to do that, so we continue to make progress I think in doing that clearly the acquisition of Beech helps, we have added a lot more sales resource through that deal and we have retained that sales force by the way. So I mean there is still a team out there as it was with the Beech very focused on the turboprop marketplace and so as I said earlier we\u2019re having a lot of sort of get to know each other sessions around the world, so that the teams have been out there selling jets and the team is selling turboprops and know each other and can try to find opportunities to work together going forward. But we have largely retained all those folks. So it's increased the net size of our sales force which I think is good.","I think we have a very good system actually that we use for keeping track of customer contacts and customer opportunities and sort of where people are in the cycle and I would say that\u2019s the system we sort of use and look at it. It's the system we looked at a year ago to say, hey guys we\u2019re not feeling that great about where things are in terms of demand and that\u2019s also the same system we\u2019re looking at today and saying there is a more robust set of customer opportunities out there which makes us feel better about where we\u2019re heading in the second, third quarter. So the system is quite good. The sales teams around the world keep it statused and Scott and that team have a sort of once a week review with all the sales folks around the world on that data basis and kind of get an update on where it is and how things are progressing.","Jason Gursky - Citi","Scott, do you feel like you've been able to close more deals as a result of this direct sales force than you would have had you've been using an indirect sales force? As you look back, the year 18 months on without a doubt the right move you\u2019ve made?","Scott Donnelly","Absolutely. Our indirect, our sales representatives or authorized representatives around the world is like anything, Jason. I think we have had some that have been outstanding and they do a terrific job and we still have a bunch of those and we keep the guys who are doing a great job for us. The thing that was that led us to start to do more of our direct sales around the world is that I think we had too many that were great for us when things were good but when times weren\u2019t good they had other things to go do and obviously when we put a direct person in, good times and bad doesn\u2019t really matter. The person is out there selling every day. They are not going to wait around for the overall market to become positive to go sell. They try to sell all the time and I think that we\u2019re seeing the benefits of that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","A couple of questions. First Scott can you update us on where the Citation 10 stands, are we going to see deliveries this quarter? I'm not sure I\u2019ve seen whether it's been certified yet?","Scott Donnelly","I think our past week was the last week of flight testing and so at this point it's now just into the paper work process and I guess the bottom line George is yes I would expect that the certification will happen this quarter and that you will see initial deliveries of 10s in Q2.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","Okay, and then Frank, just to update if I look back at Beech you projected EBITDA of 215 in the December call. Now it looks like it is gone up a little bit. We are talking 235 maybe, is that due to the 80 million of synergies you are talking now versus 65 before or if I'm wrong if you can clarify what that -- the comparison?","Frank Connor","Yes George I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m following your EBITDA comparative but I would say 2013 came in from a historical basis, pretty much on top of what we had expected and the numbers that we\u2019re talking about now are pretty much on top of what we had indicated at the time that we announced the acquisition probably achieving the run-rate synergy saving faster than what we indicated at that point in time. But generally consistent with where we were at the time we made the announcement.","","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","Okay. And then one last one you had mentioned maybe a 100 basis point impact from the continued labor from the follow-up of the labor issues you had at Bell. Is that more heavily loaded to the first quarter here where the margins were down a lot more or is that just a 100 basis points in the combination of the weaker mix?","Frank Connor","That falls across the year. Really as we sell product and it just rolls through cost of sales at a pretty consistent 100 basis points across each quarter.","Scott Donnelly","Yes so the 100 basis points is pretty consistent, at least the way we forecasted or see it right now, George, the big comparative from \u201913 to \u201914 beyond that is largely driven by mix of principally commercial and largely 412 helicopters in Q1 of \u201913 versus Q1 of \u201914.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies","My first question was about, I know you discussed pricing, it seems like there was a bit of a pricing benefit for the full-year just given there is a loss legacy aircraft, can you give us an idea maybe the gross margin differential between some of the newer products like the M2 versus the Mustang?","Scott Donnelly","We wouldn\u2019t give those number specifically in numerical Sheila but for sure we\u2019re going to have two dynamics I think through the course of the year. One is that we\u2019re seeing stronger pricing on those legacy aircraft be it Mustang\u2019s, CJ2s, CJ3, CJ4, XLS product lines. I would say on a gross margin basis, you know the things they are not going to be reflected in pricing are going to be the M2s and the Sovereigns and the gross margins on both of those products is good.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies","Okay. And the first quarter out of the gate, seems like you've been successful with new product launches of their gains and momentum. I know it's a little bit early but looking back historically it seems like new products results in several quarters of market share gains. You have few competitors coming out with new launches in late \u201814 and \u201815. I guess does the sales force have any strategic views on this or how you're thinking about that?","Frank Connor","Well I think if you look at the market historically it does, the new products do drive some market and share. We\u2019re certainly seeing that with the M2 and the Sovereign and I would say we see that certainly playing out through the year and I would say right now the business and the sales force I think is very enthusiastic about where the Latitude is. You know that really will be what drives our growth I think in the 2015 timeframe. So as we have kind of said we see the market sort of flattish with respect to demand for the legacy product, so we didn\u2019t make a lot of growth assumption there, most of the growth driven by the introduction of new product. So I came to Sovereign and TEN for the 2014 window and then you add on top of that going into 2015 the Latitude Program which we feel very good about. The flight testing has grown fabulously. We think we\u2019re very much on track for that to having a meaningful impact for us in 2015","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies","Okay, got it and then just a last one for me. We saw some indications from Congress about the V-22s for carrier usage; can you maybe talk about the potential to expand the V-22 within the U.S. government?","Scott Donnelly","We think there is a couple of opportunities that are pretty significantly in the V-22 for it's future. The replacement of the so called carrier onboard delivery vehicle, we think it's a great opportunity. That\u2019s one where there has been a fair bit of work, already conducted by the Marine Corps and the Navy looking at the utility of the V-22 to execute that mission. The issue I think in the long run will really be how they decide to specific that requirement Sheila. So if the mission is just purely to go from a land based airport to a big carrier deck, that\u2019s a fairly narrow mission and there is other ways including refurbishing existing equipment probably to get there. The benefit of the V-22 is you can completely fulfill that mission but you can also go from any land site or any sea site, to any ship because of the vertical takeoff and landing capability of the V-22. ","So I think it's still too early in terms of where that program is, there is not a hard requirement, you know that\u2019s been written, there is a lot of study and analysis going on within the Navy. So I think that program obviously is still a number of years out but we feel good about how we\u2019re positioned because frankly that aircraft can do things and fulfill the mission in a way that there is -- that no other platform can do it and because it's a production unit and you don\u2019t have a huge development program. We also think it's a much lower risk approach than doing something like an overhaul of older aircraft. So obviously from our perspective we get a lot better value, you get a better mission and you get a lot lower risk but we\u2019re few years from knowing the answer of that question, I think.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan from Nomura. Please go ahead.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura","Scott I think you mentioned the Sovereign you were booked one quarter out. Can you just give a little color on how that's tracking versus your expectation and your initial plan for the year?","Scott Donnelly","I mean it's basically meeting our plan Shannon. We expected once we got this thing certified and the aircraft was out there and plenty of demo assets for customers to fly it that would drive pretty strong demand and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re seeing. So I don\u2019t want to say, hey it's the market is going crazy and you got a line up years in advance or anything like that but the aircraft is doing really well. It's flying very well, the performance has been great. Customers love the new interior, the added range, the more sophisticated capable cockpit. So far it's playing out as we expected. ","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura","Okay. And then just maybe on this ASR you guys did. I guess that's a one-off in the first quarter. I mean any changes, philosophy there and it doesn\u2019t look like it really is much of an impact I guess it offsets dilution?","Scott Donnelly","As we said Shannon, clearly we\u2019re committed to making sure that we do as a minimum enough stock buyback to offset the dilutive effects of all the employee programs and that\u2019s really what that was. We just did it in the first quarter to kind of make sure we got the full year benefit of doing that in terms of other buyback opportunities we would continue to look at that on sort of an opportunistic basis. But we will remain committed on a go forward basis, that is the minimum. We will always take out enough to offset dilution.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","","Just wanted to get my arms around a little bit more Cessna mix for the year and you kind of touched on it a little bit in your comments on the TEN and Sovereign. So if I just look at Q1, right, 130, your deliveries are kind of - M1, M2, Citation 10 start to come in but should we actually expect this quarter to be the high watermark for Sovereign? You are kind of caught up on a little spike and unit volumes really don't rise sequentially from here on Sovereign?","Scott Donnelly"," They probably won't Jeff; part of this is an artifact of the fact that we certified the airplane so late by the time we got through everything in the fourth quarter. So there were a few Sovereign deliveries that we would have preferred to have made last year and that late certification which couldn\u2019t get through the whole delivery process on a couple of them. So, it's a bit high in the first quarter but we should have reasonable volumes through the balance for the year as well.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Does that apply for M2 also that you had a Q4, Q1 catch up and it levels off or does that work its way higher sequentially over the course of year?","Scott Donnelly","I think the M2s are fairly stable through the balance of the year.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","And then I was just wondering on pricing, from what I can tell it looks like orders were flattish to down slightly book-to-bill's 0.9 or 1 depending on how you round some things. So do you think the better pricing is negatively impacting order intake or am I'm missing something there?","Scott Donnelly","No I don\u2019t think so Jeff. I think a lot of it is just timing related, as I said if you look at the amount of activity in the marketplace, the number of customers, sort of just where they are in the order cycle. It's better than where we were before. So as we look -- I mean obviously if it wasn\u2019t a signed order book with a deposit we don\u2019t put it into the backlog but there were a number of deals that were in negotiation and kind of working their way towards contract which has now been closing here as we entered into the beginning of the second quarter.","So from an order book standpoint in terms of meeting our plan, we think the trend is positive.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","And just a quick housekeeping one for Frank. So just looking at in Q1 the $40 million of PT&A step up that\u2019s separate and apart from the $60 million of restructuring and acquisition cost, is that correct?","Frank Connor","That\u2019s right and yes we will continue to see that step up will flow through segment profitability and impact the segment for the year and then we also have additional restructuring charges that we will breakout separately, it will be a separate impact.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. ","Joe Nadol - JPMorgan","Scott, just back to Bell and the 412 and the deliveries, I heard you say it was just all timing. Could you speak a little bit though to, and maybe any detail behind that, were there fleet customers that they are transitioning? Is it literally just the dates that the customers want their aircraft and maybe just bigger picture about the demand for that specific model and what's in backlog and what you are seeing?","Scott Donnelly","Sure. I mean it really was just timing Joe. We haven't seen a change in the demand of 412. As you know a lot of times 412s do tend to be fleet orders and we had some fairly strong deliveries just again on timing in the first quarter last year of one of our larger fleet customers that had just scheduled a number of deliveries in Q1. So, as we look through the balance of the year again 412s do tend to come in fleet as opposed to sort of onesie twosies but I think in terms of customer demand fleet orders, customer activities, that\u2019s why we still feel pretty good about the total year 412s.","Joe Nadol - JPMorgan","And you expect to be, you did 36 last year, you still expect to be higher than that for that model this year?","Scott Donnelly","Sorry Joe, I would have to go and look at my sheets on the exact number of 412s and we don\u2019t usually publish that number but I don\u2019t think it's appreciably different one way or the other. It really is, but our quarter is."," ","Joe Nadol - JPMorgan","And then on, maybe I missed it, but on Beech, what are the cost saves that are actually baked into your guidance now for this year? Not annualized, but actually in the plan here?","Scott Donnelly","We haven't given that Joe, and obviously -- I mean first of all we only have nine months. We\u2019re in the process of incurring at this point most of the cost associated with those restructuring activities. So we\u2019re not going to break that as a separate number but we included all that in terms of the numbers we have given you, in terms of restructuring as well as the overall net margin number and so I don\u2019t think we will break that out number separately other than to tell you it's receipt is about an 80 million run-rate for next year.","Joe Nadol - JPMorgan","I'm just trying to think about the compare going into next year compared to this year how much, I mean we get -- the step-up I assume doesn't recur, you get a full year benefit obviously of EBIT. But then how much incrementally do we get from the cost saves in \u201815 versus \u201814 if we don't know what's in \u201814, it is hard to make that comparison.","Frank Connor","That\u2019s part of the overall 200 basis point normalization Joe. So it's part of that.","Joe Nadol - JPMorgan","Okay. Could you actually just run through that again, I heard that number, Frank, but I didn't quite get it in your prepared remarks, the 200 basis points?","Scott Donnelly","So if you look at a full year sales impact of Beech and if you look at the impacts that we expect to flow through from the purchase price impacts which are relatively modest going into \u201915 but impact \u201915 by about $65 million and then you look at the expected saving is coming off of that 80 million run-rate that we talked about. You would get on a same volume as 2014, a 200 basis pick up in Textron Aviation margins.","Frank Connor","I think gives you all the elements of the number and the reason we\u2019re not trying to obfuscate anything, the reason we are doing it that way is it's hard to identify and will be hard to identify as we move forward here kind of all of the cost savings and where things come from and everything else and we\u2019re really looking as a consolidated segment operations and just trying to focus on kind of what our cost structure will look like in \u201915 and therefore core profitability levels.","Joe Nadol - JPMorgan","Fair enough. And just one more. You've talked Scott quite a bit about demand for some of the individual Cessna models and pricing. I just wanted to touch on something that emerged a little bit last quarter which is the competitive environment in really in the midsize area in particular. Is this something that's getting a little better? You've talked quite a bit in the past about how tough it is out there and I know you don't want to declare victory at all, but is everyone seeing things getting a little better and maybe taking a little more price across the board?","Scott Donnelly","I think that\u2019s happening Joe. As I said on our legacy product where we compare price on a year-over-year basis, prices are up across the line. So but again it's still a very competitive market. I mean every deal is a fight but I think as we go through that process obviously as demand is firming and a lot of is backed off in terms of how much capacity or what production run-rates are going that\u2019s had the desired effect exactly as we anticipated it would. So we\u2019re starting to see that price firming, having some price firming in the used market, giving people that are out there looking to sell a little bit better collateral value as well as frankly just a stronger market so they can transact and get the liquidity. I mean all those things I think are factoring into just a strengthening in the overall market and therefore you will expect a little bit of strengthening on the pricing side.","So it's not overwhelming obviously. We would like to see it stronger but it's certainly improved over where we have been and that reflects in some of the improved pricing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company","Scott, you had good deliveries of the Sovereign and the M2. Obviously some backlog spillover from the fourth quarter. Should we expect the seasonal pattern here, because of those strong deliveries in the first quarter, that you are really flat to up in the second, flat to up in the third as you burn off that initial backlog, and then a big fourth quarter, is that, as you think about the quarterly pattern, is that the way to think about it?","Scott Donnelly","I think that\u2019s mostly correct Cai. I mean that\u2019s been sort of the nature of the business, obviously, last year we had very challenging second, third quarters and then a much bigger fourth quarter. We would like to see a flatter profile just in terms of -- it\u2019s a little easier to run the business and little bit more productive to run the business a little bit flatter. But as we look through the course of the year right now we would expect it to be sort of up slightly as we move our way through the quarters incrementally.","Frank Connor","We expect deliveries of the TEN to come in here in the second quarter as Scott indicated which will impact things.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company","Right. But I assume it is later in the quarter if you still have the paperwork to go or are you just all set so you could do you three of them in the quarter.","Scott Donnelly","Yes and I think we will do several TENs, we have customers that are kind of standing by and ready and wanting these aircraft. The certification -- as we talked about before slid from where we wanted to do it. We would originally like to have done at the end of last year and we just couldn\u2019t get through that in terms of prioritizing getting the Sovereign through the process, flight testing has taken longer than we expected and we have customers that are waiting for their aircraft. So once the paperwork is done we will certainly get a few deliveries here in the quarter.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company","So you delivered eight King Airs in the quarter. Can you give the split between the 350, 250s and the 90s, and maybe give us some -- a little more color on where you expect those three models to be for the year?","Scott Donnelly","I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve the exact number here in front of me, it was weighted towards 350s, Cai. And I think the full year will be weighted more towards 350s.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company","Okay. Good. And then a last one, so if we back out Beech, you did a 1.8% margin in the first quarter at Cessna and I think your guide is 2.5% to 3% excluding Beech, and seasonally things get better. You are talking about pricing improving. Is that a realistic number? Does that have upside or is there something else happening in terms of the funding of R&D that would make that the real number and not really a bit conservative, which is the way it looks?","Scott Donnelly","I think it's a realistic number, Cai. As always we have said we will have a little bit better incremental volume as we go through the year not dramatically but I think we will also with the TENs coming in, we have a mix that\u2019s more oriented towards a combinations of TENs and Sovereigns which is good mix for the business.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company","Right, but I guess my point is, if volume is going up and you have a 25% plus incremental margin, and mix is going your way, one would think you would get a little bit more than what is it, 70 to 130 bps off the first quarter given the seasonality you've got.","Scott Donnelly","Again as we look at this right now Cai, we don\u2019t see significant increases in terms of quarter-over-quarter. It will be up slightly but not dramatically.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Ron Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a couple of questions to follow-up on the Cessna line of questioning. Scott, can you give us some sort of feel for how demand is for the Latitude? I know it was received well but is there any maybe color you can put around that or numbers or something?","Scott Donnelly","Well we haven't been giving order books specifically by model. We have a number of orders already in the book for Latitude for sure. But I think as we have talked about it before at this stage of the game we really need to have aircraft that are flying and fully outfitted and able to do demos and things of that nature, and really start to build out that order book into 2015. We have the initial aircraft that\u2019s up and flying. We have a couple of more that are in process including one of the aircraft which will be fully outfitted with the real interior design and that will be the aircraft which will be going to shows and starting to perform customer demos and I think we won't see a lot of order activity until that aircraft is out there because at this stage of the cycle I think before somebody lays a deposit on a $16 million, $17 million [ph] airplane. They want to see the real airplane, and sit in the airplane and take a flight in the airplane. So we understand that and we have the first couple of aircraft, obviously we\u2019re more dedicated to flight test programs. We\u2019re in the process of building out the first one that will be a customer demo aircraft. ","Ron Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, and then maybe shifting gears a little bit. How is it, is there an early read yet on how the move into flight simulation has gone with the integrated product, last time I was up in Rhode Island we were talking about how Textron wants to offer an integrated package to the customers with flight simulation. And how is that going?","Scott Donnelly","I would say right now we\u2019re very happy with how it's going. Our order rate on the simulator side of the business is doing very well. There is a ton of opportunities out there in both the commercial air transport market as well as a number of different business jets and helicopter programs. We already have our first development underway to support our own products that being the Bell-525 simulator. So the team down in Florida is already started to work with the Bell team in the design and development of the 525 sim and so I would say, obviously we\u2019re only a few months into this thing but I feel very good about where we\u2019re. The thing is performing as we expected and the order rate seem to be pretty good.","Ron Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great and then maybe one last one, back to defense. My favorite product, the Scorpion. Last time we spoke you had mentioned that maybe by the end-of-the-year a customer would emerge. How do you feel about that still and how is that program going.","Scott Donnelly","So the program is going extremely well. The aircraft is flying terrifically. It's already over last week exceeded it's flight envelope, so we have seen speeds in excess of what we\u2019re advertising and still had more throttle push for the thing. So the aircraft is flying very, very well. The guys are super happy with it and it's where we expected it to be. We have a lot of marketing, sales activity underway right now. We have conversations going on with a number of different customers. We have had customers that have actually come into Wichita to see the aircraft, so I feel pretty good about where we\u2019re. But there is a big ways to go to get from that to where somebody signs the dotted line and actually places an order for the aircraft. So by the end of this year I still think that\u2019s a possibility. We\u2019re working hard to try to make that happen but I would say there is still a lot of work to make it happen.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Justin Bergner from Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.","Justin Bergner - Gabelli & Company","Two questions. First question is in regards to Cessna after market, I realize that's something that you report in more detail annually than quarterly, but how is it tracking as we finish the first quarter and enter the second quarter?","Scott Donnelly","It continues to track positively. I say it's probably up mid-single digit kind of numbers.","Justin Bergner - Gabelli & Company","Nothing out of the ordinary there?","Scott Donnelly","No, you know for that business Justin, if it just kind of continues to march along at that rate that\u2019s very healthy. I mean it's really driven by aircraft utilization and people coming in for service activity and what not. So that\u2019s one where you kind of expect to see nice steady growth, that\u2019s what we have been seeing and expect to continue see on the Cessna side and frankly we expect and just kind of factor that in as well in terms of Hawker and King Air size of business.","Justin Bergner - Gabelli & Company","And my second question is just a little bit more general. You've been in your role now for around four years and you're really taking a big step forward and consolidating the private aviation market with this Beechcraft acquisition. What is the company going to look like in three years from now and what would make you disappointed three years from now if something doesn't transpire as you expect it to?","Scott Donnelly","I think Justin, if you look at what\u2019s really going to drive the business over the next few years particularly within the aerospace aviation side of this, be that the aviation segment or Bell, is -- I mean obviously you\u2019re doing something like the Beech acquisition is a big deal but I think over the next few years what\u2019s really going to drive our success in large part has to do with driving these new product program. So we have the Latitude hitting in \u201915, we got lot of other activity at Cessna, we will talk about it in the future in terms of new products and when you look over it at Bell you got the 525, the 505. I mean these are big programs that I think are resulting in products that are going to drive a lot of demand and share for our businesses in the market. So those investments we\u2019re making which are pretty significant right now. You know really are the things that are going to drive our performance improvements over the next few years. ","Justin Bergner - Gabelli & Company","And it's interesting to hear you talk about new product. With respect to Beechcraft, I mean clearly that is an investment that is as large as many of the combined new product investments you are making. What would be the upside scenario in Beechcraft and is it as likely now as it was when you announced the deal?","Scott Donnelly","We certainly feel just as good about it as when we announced it. The market, we think is still performing well for the King Air product line. It's a great product; it's always been very well received. Customers like it and it's a workhorse in that industry. Obviously it's going to require sustained levels of new product investment and R&D and upgrades and just like the jet business does, so there are things that are announced out there that will be upgrades to that product line as it moves forward but I think what we thought we were acquiring in terms of that product is exactly what we got. There have been no surprises whatsoever. I think the brand is still in very good shape, it's a strong brand in the marketplace, good demand for the product and it's a great product. It's exactly what we expected.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","Yes, just a follow-up Frank, to the question earlier. So in the fourth quarter you had $0.20 of operating benefit and $0.35 of restructuring for $0.15 dilution and now we got $0.08, so if you just -- what's changed in that?","Frank Connor","The restructuring number is smaller than the cost that we had thought at the time that we did it. So I think if that\u2019s the big delta George is the restructuring charges has come down a bit.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","Okay. And the operating number is about the same because it closed the same time you thought it would close?","Frank Connor","Yes, I mean the operating number -- those were annualized numbers versus partial year numbers and so that has an impact. As we indicated at the time we were going to have purchase price gross margin impact. We have refined that number, that's now expected to be about $65 million for the year and so I think it's largely a function of the partial year versus the animalization and then the -- a little bit of a change on that restructuring number."," ","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","And then just a follow-up Scott for you on the margin. Is your comment that the margin won't go up a lot necessarily in subsequent quarters because the first quarter was somewhat high because of the high level of Sovereign deliveries which won't repeat?","Scott Donnelly","I think the margin rates will be incrementally better George, because we will have obviously the Sovereign, although Sovereign is probably a little stronger in the first quarter than the balance of the year because of the roll over for Q4 but then we also have the TENs based on now getting the certification done. So the volumes will be up slightly through the balance of the year and I think the margin mix will be favorable. So we will see some incrementally better margins.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","I was trying to follow-up to Cai's point arguing that I agree with his comment that incrementally you would think the margins; your guidance for the year would be low. So I was just trying to argue that maybe the first quarter was a little bit higher because of the Sovereigns, otherwise I still think -- I agree the margin is probably -- your guidance is probably low for the year.","Scott Donnelly","There is no question, we had a lot Sovereigns in the quarter, we probably won't have quite that number of Sovereigns on a go forward basis. We will have the TEN, so I think we\u2019re just having a friendly debate about how much better should they be.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","Okay.","Doug Wilburne","All right George, thanks a lot. And ladies and gentlemen that concludes our call. Thank you for joining us and we will see you next quarter.","Operator","(Operator Instructions). That does conclude your conference for today.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions].","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Eric Salander. Please go ahead.","Eric Salander","Thanks, Brad, and good morning everyone.","Before we begin, I would like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various Risk Factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release.","On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer.","Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.","Textron's revenues in the quarter were $3.2 billion, down $284 million from last year's third quarter. During this year's third quarter, we recorded an after-tax gain of $410 million related to the sale of the tools and test product line for $1.65 per share. Excluding this item, adjusted income from continuing operations was $0.61 per share, down $0.04 from last year's third quarter.","Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions totaled $259 million compared to $281 million in last year's third quarter.","With that, I will turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Donnelly","Thanks, Eric, and good morning everybody.","Revenue was down in the quarter primarily driven by the tools and test acquisition with an industrial and lower TAPV volumes with systems as that program continues to runoff. Segment profit was down in the quarter largely due to lower profit in Industrial which more than offset higher profit at Bell and Aviation.","At Industrial, segment profit was breakeven primarily due to unfavorable operating performance in specialized vehicles. Specialized vehicles has undergone significant change over the past two years, as we have expanded the product portfolio. While we've seen increasing revenue in the segment, we haven't seen the planned level of growth or do the operating levers necessary to support the expected returns.","We've made progress on new product introductions and continue to be encouraged by the favorable trends in the power sports market but we need to work on our go-to-market strategy and focus on cost performance. We are focused on driving improvements in this business and believe that we have valuable power of our portfolio moving forward.","Moving to Bell, profits were up in the quarter, and operating margin expanded on slightly lower revenues. On the commercial side, we delivered 43 helicopters up from 39 in last year's third quarter. In the quarter, we further expanded the global operating footprint of 505 Jet Ranger X with a delivery into Kenya marking the first 505 in Africa.","Also in the quarter, the 525 program completed half weather and high altitude testing in Yuma, Arizona, as the aircraft continues to meet or exceed all design specifications as it progresses towards its planned certification in 2019.","On the military side, Bell is awarded a $510 million contract for 29 AH-1 helicopters in support of the Marine Corps H-1 upgrade program. We also feature the UH1 at NATO days in Ostrava and Czech Air Force Base -- is the largest security show in Europe as we continue to market this multi aerial aircraft to our international military customers.","Moving into military products, the V-280 recently exceeded 250 knots as the team continues to successfully expand the aircraft's flight envelope and validate key performance parameters.","Also during the quarter, Bell unveiled a full scale markup of the V-247 unmanned aerial system at Fort Myer in Arlington, Virginia for a review by DoD leadership as well as representatives from the Marine Corps, Navy, and Army, to give them a better understanding of the proposed capabilities of this Group 5 UAS.","At systems, revenues were down on lower TAPV deliveries of Textron Marine & Land Systems as we near the end of that program. At Marine & Land Systems we were awarded a $100 million contract for procurement of long lead material to support the U.S. Navy Ship-to-Shore Connector program.","Marine & Land Systems also completed pre-delivery inspection and trials of its common unmanned surface vehicle and is now in the development testing phase.","Earlier this week, we also announced our intent to form a joint venture between Textron and Flight Safety International to serve our Textron Aviation customers. This combination of capabilities will enable us to provide best-in-class pilot and maintenance training programs to our customers around the world through a more extensive network of training centers.","Moving to Textron Aviation, I would like to address the change in leadership that I announced last Friday, with the deployment of Ron Draper as CEO of the Aviation segment succeeding Scott Ernest who has moved to Textron's Specialized Vehicles as their new CEO. This move is consistent with our strategy of developing leaders within our businesses. Ron was Textron Aviation's Senior Vice President of Integrated Supply Chain and as such led all aspects of manufacturing operations of Textron Aviation since 2012. Ron has a great depth of knowledge about the Aviation business and has led several Textron Aviation's most impactful strategic initiatives to-date including the successful integration of our Cessna Beechcraft operations, expansion of our quality management systems, and global sourcing strategies. I'm confident in his abilities to lead Textron Aviation through its next phases of product development and growth.","Now looking at the quarter, profits were up for Textron Aviation and operating margin increased on slightly lower revenues. We delivered 41 Jets last year and 43 commercial turboprops down from 57 last year. In the quarter, we saw continued strength in order flow with the backlog finishing up over $200 million from the end of last quarter.","On the new product front, we would be on functional and reliability testing on the citation longitude with the FAA putting the aircraft on track for certification and first deliveries in the fourth quarter. We remain committed to investing in the industry-leading aircraft across our product lines and are looking forward to building on the success of the latitude with the Longitude's class-leading performance, operating efficiency, and an outstanding quite cabin.","At NBAA this week we announced expanded relationship between Textron Aviation and NetJets, reaching an agreement for an option to purchase up to 175 Longitudes with anticipated deliveries beginning in the second half of 2019. In addition to the Longitude agreement, we also announced that we reached an agreement with NetJets as the launch customer for the upcoming Cessna Citation Hemisphere with an option to purchase up to 150 aircraft.","We are excited to partner with NetJets in design of this new aircraft. We believe the Hemisphere will be truly revolutionary aircraft and represent the first new clean sheet design in the $30 million to $40 million large-cabin jet segment in more than 20 years.","With that, I will turn the call over to Frank.","Frank Connor","Thank you, Scott, and good morning everyone.","Segment profit in the quarter was $245 million, down $50 million from the third quarter of 2017, on a $284 million decrease in revenue.","Let's review how each of the segments contributed starting with Industrial. Industrial revenues decreased $112 million largely related to the disposition of our tools and test product line. Segment profit was down $48 million from the third quarter of 2017 largely due to unfavorable price and performance and the impact from the tools and test disposition.","Moving to Bell, revenues were down $42 million primarily on commercial mix, partially offset by higher military revenues. Segment profit increased $7 million from the third quarter in 2017 largely the result of favorable performance on military programs, partially offset by commercial mix. Backlog in the segment was $5.7 billion at the end of the quarter.","At Textron Systems, revenues were down $106 million on lower TAPV deliveries at Textron Marine and Land Systems and lower volumes in the simulation training and other product line. Segment profit was down $11 million primarily reflecting the lower net volume. Backlog in the segment was $1.1 billion.","At Textron Aviation, revenues were down $21 million from this period last year due to lower volume and mix largely reflecting lower turboprop volume partially offset by favorable pricing. Segment profit was $99 million, up $6 million from a year ago due to favorable price and performance partially offset by the impact of lower volume and mix. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1.8 billion.","Finance segment revenues were down $3 million and profit was down $4 million from last year's third quarter.","Moving below segment profit, corporate expenses were $29 million compared to $30 million last year.","Interest expense was $32 million compared to $37 million a year ago. In the quarter, we booked an after-tax gain of $410 million related to the disposition of tools and test.","We also repurchased 7 million shares returning $468 million in cash to shareholders in the quarter. Year-to-date we've repurchased 21.6 million shares returning $1.4 billion in cash to shareholders about $800 million of which reflects the use of proceeds from the sale of tools and test. We now expect the full-year tax rate to be 17%.","To wrap up with guidance, we are narrowing our expected full-year adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations to a range of $3.20 to $3.30 per share as compared to our prior outlook of $3.15 to $3.35. We are also reaffirming expected cash flow from continuing operations of the manufacturing group before pension contributions to a range of $750 million to $850 million.","That concludes our prepared remarks. So Brad we can open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions].","And our first question today comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.","George Shapiro","Yes, good morning. Scott, in Aviation, the backlog increase was that mainly longitude or was all across the board?","Scott Donnelly","It was across the board, George. I mean we've continued to see the strength we talked about last quarter. I'd say our activity in virtually every class of aircraft remains strong and we feel pretty good about the diversity of that backlog.","George Shapiro","And the weakness in the King Air shipments is that something that's just a one quarter phenomenon because you had been expecting up deliveries this year versus last year?","Scott Donnelly","Yes and we still expect that George. I think all you're seeing in the third quarter here frankly still pretty strong deliveries on both King Air and Caravan. But as you recall last year Q1 and Q2 were very soft and so when orders did come through and the market started to pick up in the third quarter, we had quite a few aircraft that were available based on the production rates. So they were basically aircraft available from the Q1, Q2 production, so we could deliver a lot in the third quarter. This year obviously has been much more linear, reflecting a stronger market and we're absolutely on track for the volumes that we expected for the full-year on material cub market.","George Shapiro","And what was the pricing benefit to Aviation in the quarter?","Scott Donnelly","That number in the Q05 look like 9 --","Frank Connor","Sorry, gross price was 25 and net price was 14.","Scott Donnelly","14, so.","George Shapiro","Okay. And then just one quick one, on Industrial was there restructuring in that number or kind of what's the plan going forward, I mean you didn't lower the guide that much for the year, so clearly the fourth quarter has got to look better?","Scott Donnelly","Well for sure, so, what George, I think what you're seeing in Industrial in the quarter is primarily as we said driven by the specialized vehicle business and particularly it's around some consumer markets and it's a recognition that we still have more work to do in terms of strengthening that channel and so we recognized a fair bit of that cost here in the quarter, clearly we expect that team to perform better in the fourth quarter. So and I'm sure that they will.","We also had just on the auto side, I mean markets third quarter is always the weakest of the year just because we have all the summer shutdowns, so clearly we expect that business also to perform stronger in the fourth quarter.","And with respect to overall guidance, George, I think what you are seeing is where we still feel and are very comfortable with the strength that we are seeing in the Aviation market and that's going to deliver above the original guide. I think the same is true with Bell with commercial market and execution that team continues to be very strong. And Systems frankly is I think going to deliver on a good year and exceed their guide. So the strength of those three segments will largely overcome the weakness that we saw this quarter in the Industrial side and which is why we're able to just narrow the guide.","George Shapiro","Okay, thanks. I will let somebody else to ask some questions.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Jon Raviv with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jon Raviv","Hey good morning. On Aviation, just wanted to get a sense Scott of just what you are seeing in terms of that order trend and your confidence or visibility to potentially rising production rates at some point? And then related to that as you raise production rates as you go through this process, would you kind of consider normalized Aviation margin look pretty good in the quarter despite just the turbo being down year-over-year. I know you could explain.","Scott Donnelly","Jon, I think that we expect the trend on the margin to continue. Obviously we're feeling very good about where we're positioned here in Q4 with strong order rates that have occurred through the course of the year. I think our teams I mean obviously we have NBAA going this week, spent a fair bit of time with our sales teams, the level of activity continues to be robust and as we usually do we will tweak production rates as we move through the course of the year. So certainly our expectations we're not certainly not ready to guide for 2019 yet, but we will clearly expect to see volumes continue to increase which will tweak production up.","I think in particular, one announcement that we made at the show was the agreement around the Longitudes. Now with that announcement is out there clearly the NetJets team is going to start ramping up with us working on the sales and marketing effort to the fractional community and we expect that team will deliver on Longitude much as we've seen it deliver on latitude in terms of driving volume in the business. So for sure, our expectations on Longitude in terms of its production rate and volume is going to be increased as a result of that announcement.","Jon Raviv","So we've been -- we're just watching out for as with the case of latitude where because it's NetJets and because it's a competitive space there just could be some incremental margin softness as that particular aircraft ramps up?","Scott Donnelly","Jon, the deal that we've struck with NetJets is a fair deal for both sides. I mean obviously NetJets understood that we couldn't do the kind of pricing that we did on the latitude deal but that was not something that worked for us. And I think we've ended in a place where the pricing agreement that's fair little size. So I guess the short answer is clearly just discounted to NetJets as they manage and have to handle all the go-to-market and the sales and operating the aircraft but it's a much more balanced deal and it's a deal that will be good for us, so it's going to be good for them. So, no, I wouldn't expect to see the sort of dilution that we saw in the latitude side.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Seth Seifman with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Seth Seifman","Thanks very much and good morning. Scott, I wonder if you could talk about the news we've seen recently about future vertical and the Army approach to that and the desire to kind of move money from legacy programs towards new programs and kind of how your thinking has evolved around what opportunities might be there for Textron and for Bell in the 2020 budget?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I mean it's a good question, Seth. Obviously the Army and what they've been saying publicly, we\u2019re very encouraged. I mean clearly we are the guys that have been making pretty significant investments in what we would like to think will be the next-generation of Aviation for the Army. So the fact that they're -- they're not been polygamist about, so right they're saying, we are not expecting some huge increases in budget and we recognize that we need to move money from just continuing to do what we always done and move into the monetization programs. Obviously, we're very encouraged by that.","We think the V-280 is in a great place with respect to the KEPZ 3 program and look that's a program we have been working with the Army for years to develop the prototype aircraft and it's doing fabulously in terms of flight test program. There is also discussion around the KEPZ 1 obviously we will compete on that program as well. I think we have some very good ideas that can meet that requirement.","So and of course there is beyond those really big programs, there is a number of other things that we are engaged in working with the Army whether it's next-generation weapons, Armor vehicles, I mean there is a lot of opportunity as the Army kind of makes the shift into the monetization programs that I think will be beneficial to us over the years.","What I quote an exact number of what we expect to see in 2020's budget or how they are going to move that money; I mean I think that's all still to be determined. But it's certainly seems like a very appropriate way to try to fund their monetization programs and we are excited about the opportunities that could create.","Seth Seifman","Okay. And then maybe as a follow-up, just in the vehicle business, if you could talk a little bit more about what came so sort of throughout this year relative to initial expectations, why is I guess it seems like pricing is very tough, why is pricing so tough, do you still expect that business to do, I was thinking maybe $1.75 billion of sales or so this year and how long do you think it will take to get back to or to get towards maybe high single-digit level of profitability there?","Scott Donnelly","Well, look, I think that I don't think this is a problem if overall pricing in the market so much as our team has been going through sort of a painful learning experience about how that channel is managed and how discounting is handled and how that plays out through the course of the year.","So it for sure manifest itself in more discounting that we would like to continue to work that channel. I think the team will get better with that and it's things we're learning and I think the team is going to make progress on it as we've talked about before. I think we were on the snow side; I'm a lot more bullish, I think we had some great product introductions last year that got the channel pretty excited. We have a ton of new stuff going in this year. So again when you look at pre-season sales activity and order activity, it's up, recognize that on the dirt side, we missed a better part of last year because some of the product that was sort of in the pipeline wasn't really ready to go and we didn't want to release tools ready. So we are kind of maybe a year behind in terms of the new products feeding into that channel but those things we are introducing now. So I think we will start to see some momentum and a little more excitement in channel as we go forward.","But the bottom-line answer is I think the revenue number you\u2019re talking about is probably consistent with where we will end up this year but we need to see more growth particularly through that channel.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Rajeev Lalwani","Scott, on the system side can you just talk a little bit about the growth that you saw there obviously TAPV weighed on you this quarter, but I would like to just get a good sense of what the underlying revenues or can likely get some growth going forward?","Scott Donnelly","From a revenue standpoint, Rajeev, I think we're more or less where we expected to be, I mean we're seeing the ramp-down on the TAPV program which we fully expected. I would say we have expected to see a little more coming through on the Ship-to-Shore Connector program. I think that's just a timing issue as we looked at the appropriation bills, I mean they are funding for the volume of Ship-to-Shore Connector as we expected is happening. We just have not reached a definitized contract at this point.","As I said in the prepared remarks and I think was out in the press is the Navy continues and gave us another $100 million towards the long lead material to keep that program going at the rate that we expected to be. But it's been coming a little bit later in the year than we originate into our plans. But as we look through the balance of this year and certainly as we start thinking about 2019, we expect to see that program ramping and that should be contrary to the development side of the program, it should be a normal margin business.","Rajeev Lalwani","And just switching gears a little bit on the commercial side at Bell, could you just talk about how deliveries were looking overall maybe putting aside V-505 and just whether or not you are seeing the strength that you have been alluding to previously?","Scott Donnelly","Yes, absolutely, Rajeev. We feel very good about the order activity at Bell, obviously the 505 dominates the numbers of unit delivery and that continues to be a very, very successful program for us. We were -- I mean we always have a mix from quarter-to-quarter obviously on the type of air vehicles in terms of mix of 412, 429, 407, 505, if you will. We certainly expect Q4 to be stronger on both the 412s and the 429 side; those are both relatively late in the quarter but that's just timing of deliveries and customer need days. So I think from our perspective, the commercial market continues to be strong, order activity is good, and well we are actually in a position where we will be tweaking up the production rates on a number of those models to meet the demand we see going forward.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland","Just a couple of quick clarifications, so I'm just piecing this together Scott from your comments, it sounds like the specialized vehicle weakness was isolated to Arctic Cat and I'm just wondering the management change is all related to that as well I would assume, so if you just clarify that would be great? And then secondly Frank just wondered if you could give us some color on the favorable versus unfavorable adjustments at Bell since that seem to be a benefit in the quarter?","Scott Donnelly","So Carter, I would say on TSV, the most fundamental challenge in the business is around particularly the dirt side, the consumer side of that business and that's the area that where we need the most work but when you have some like that going on in the business, it creates enough chaos but it drive down the operating performance in total.","Most of that I think we have a very good team in place, they've done a great job in the past and I think they'll recover and the performance and profitability of most of those sort of sub-segments if you will, will do just fine. The area that is going to require the most work and most focus here going forward is around sort of that acquired piece of the business.","Frank Connor","So in terms of performance, Carter, the Bell continued to perform well as they have in other quarters, we saw continuing improvement in our cost position. We saw kind of risk retirement in military programs frankly; we saw the same thing at Systems and in our defense business and Aviation. So overall kind of program net adjustments were $63 million in the quarter but that was kind of spread. The larger part of that was at Bell, but it was spread across our other businesses as well.","Carter Copeland","Okay, great. Thanks and one last one, Scott the pricing benefit you mentioned and quantified in Aviation was that across the board or isolated and any additional color you can give us there?","Scott Donnelly","It was across the board. We have been trying to classify us in every one of the models and we continue to realize it.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Robert Stallard","Scott, on the vehicle issues here, how long do you think it's going to take to sort this out and do you think there is going to be some additional restructuring charges required?","Scott Donnelly","Well, Robert I think that we are probably a year behind the schedule that we would like to have right. I mean obviously we went into this expecting to be able to generate accretion in year one obviously that's not going to happen as we kind of realize these costs in the quarter. But we still feel with the products coming out, the strength, and again we're kind of seeing this as momentum builds on the snow side we are kind of two launches into the second season. We sort of lost of years in the dirt side I think we're going to see that, so it's probably a one year delay again.","Robert Stallard","Okay. And then secondly on the aerospace side on both the Bell and the Business Jet, I heard you comment on how the aftermarket did in the quarter and what's the growth rate you achieved?","Scott Donnelly","Well the aftermarket I think when you see the numbers, the Cessna was -- or Aviation rather was kind of flattish or was up a little bit on a year-over-year basis. I think part of that is we've been looking a lot at the data, the average daily utilization. The flying rates are all continuing to grow modestly but I mean they are improving. So frankly we would have expected to see a little more growth in that side.","On the other hand, as we look out back at Q3 last year was particularly strong. So I think a little bit of just comp on year-to-year. But anyway, but we didn't -- it was modest very little growth, but again still very healthy franchise in a great part of the business and I would expect we'll get back to seeing growth going forward.","Robert Stallard","And on the helicopters?","Scott Donnelly","Helicopters it was the same, it was up modestly.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr","Yes, thanks so much. So Scott the longitude with the NetJets order, I assume given your saying that they're going to start delivering in the second half of next year, I assume you have a firm order is that true and if so does it come in the third quarter or the fourth?","Scott Donnelly","So we do not, Cai. So there is nothing in the backlog associated with the NetJet launch through deal. We didn't sign the agreement really until the fourth quarter. So and as you know the way we manage these programs, the same as we have been doing with latitude. As NetJet puts firm order with we have a specific tail and deposit that's when we move that into backlog. That usually is within sort of that one-year time window, we didn't do it because we kind of again didn't sign the agreement until into the fourth quarter. And the NetJet guys are very excited about this thing and they're about to unleash their very capable sales team to go start driving sales at Longitude into the fractional market and as soon as they start to see that clearly we will be firming up orders here I would expect in the fourth quarter but nothing in the backlog at this time.","Cai von Rumohr","Okay. And you have been kind of on again, off again on the hemisphere given the Silver Crest issue. At what point will you feel comfortable enough with the Silver Crest to say we're definitely going ahead or you are still unsure?","Scott Donnelly","I think that what's going to happen Cai is by mid-year, next year we should see an engine on a test band will validate where they are. Our guys have been working very closely with them we had a team over with the Saffron guys just a couple of weeks ago and I think that they've been very open, they've been working very closely explaining where was -- why was the issue that occurred on the compressor, how did that get through all the analytical models, we understand that very well, they understand that very well. I think that the issue is very, very well understood. They believe the design solution and the model they've come up with addresses that which is terrific. We feel confident that there's a good understanding of the root cause. And so I would say we're very bullish, I think we're very confident in there solution.","That being said, we do want to see it on the test end. So I think you're looking at a mid-year next year when we would say okay, this is a firm grower or not. Obviously we will continue to invest at some level here between here and there as will the NetJet folks, one of the benefits of them being a launch customer is that they are making pilots and crew and maintenance folks available as we finalize the detail specifications of the aircraft to make sure this time it's going to be home run in that space. So we will both be working between now and then to be ready to pull the trigger.","Cai von Rumohr","Terrific. Last one the V-280 when do you expect to get to the point where the Army will start to fund some of your development?","Scott Donnelly","I'm ready tomorrow.","Cai von Rumohr","I know you are ready. But is Army ready?","Scott Donnelly","Well look Cai, I mean as we talked about earlier, I think the Army has coming out of AUSA and all over their they talked about a shift from the current programs to modernization is very encouraging. I would hope that there will be some level of activity that will start next year but I don't want to prognosticate on this thing. But I mean clearly what the Army is saying is very encouraging, we continue to work with them obviously on a regular basis and I'm hopeful that we will start to see some level activity towards that next year.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Please go ahead.","Pete Skibitski","Good morning guys. I guess one more on Textron Aviation, Scott. I was wondering if you could talk about kind of your perception of the health of the Textron Aviation customer, you have seen a lot of good indicators out there and I'm kind of wondering a bit, if there really still feels like you are hitting that cycle or is there still a lot of caution in the marketplace because if you look at some of the secondhand numbers it seems like things are kind of drying up there in that market. So it would seem to indicate this cycle is really strong but the numbers obviously are coming through delivery wise quite yet. So I just want you to characterize it maybe more?","Scott Donnelly","Well, I'd say Pete, no first of all statistically your fact actually you are right, I mean the secondary market for anything that's kind of under 10 years old is pretty thin, when people do aircraft it moves quite quickly and as seen in some of the surveys the pricing is healthier and so I think the secondary market is certainly a help.","There's very little out there that we would even compete with somebody thinking about a new aircraft more importantly for someone who wants to trade in their aircraft, they have a easy source of liquidity to sell their old aircraft to be able to put that towards a new aircraft.","In terms of the health of our customers, we had an opportunity obviously here recently to spend a lot of time with a lot of these folks and I think that the dialogue from them is reflective of what you see in a lot of survey information. These are people that feel good about their businesses right now. They have been hiring people, they are much more comfortable with making CapEx decisions, yes, we're building new plant, expanding capacity buying new jets.","So clearly the Tax Cuts and some of the reform regulatory pull back has made the business community in the U.S. is feeling better than they thought in a long time and that confidence is give us confidence to hire people and to spend CapEx.","Peter Skibitski","Okay. I appreciate the color and maybe one just quick follow-on on Industrial, there's lot to talk about global automotive these days and I'm just wondering how the cloud text guys are kind of seeing the cycle right now and if they're feeling any impact from tariff related issues globally?","Scott Donnelly","We don't see a lot of tariff related; I mean there is some pressure obviously on raw material pricing, where largely we have contracts that's across the company mitigating most of that. Remember we do most of our production in countries for those plants because you have to be closed by anyway.","On the other hand like there's a great deal of uncertainty around the tariffs and around the Brexit's of the world which we are seeing some impacts of that, there is just caution right now in the global auto OEMs. And that's coupled with I think just an overall softening a bit of the global auto OEM manufacturing. And I say Q3 is always the most susceptible because most of the guys do shutdowns during the summer months anyway and so one of the ways they -- easy for them to regulate output is to extend some of these shutdowns and again that's something that generally manifest itself in Q3 and we certainly saw that at Caltech. So it's not a huge reduction in volume but there had been some modest declines.","Peter Skibitski","Okay. So your expectations are basically nothing heroic out of Caltech but nothing terrible either?","Scott Donnelly","No I think that Q3 is always the most difficult and I think we'll certainly see a better Q4 which is cyclically normal in that business but I do think that is still in the context of global auto OEM about volume is going to be down somewhat.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Is that Industrial finally getting some airtimes not for good unfortunately, just one last one on it, how do we think about specialized vehicles recovery, I think you mentioned to Rob's question it was the dirt product introduction that seems to be the issue and how long will the product introduction take and how do we think about that profitability or recovery, is it a year's time, is it a few quarters?","Scott Donnelly","Well, Sheila I think that it's probably the year's time, I mean we do have some, some good things coming out here in the model year 2019 which are heading to dealers now. I think in general how we manage that channel is something that frankly we just haven't done as well as we should have. And our sales tools and how easy we make it for perspective customers to figure our product have access to the dealers, have a natural way to help customers move to our product is just something we didn't do well.","So some of that is some things were problematic that I think can be fixed very quickly but I mean I think this is a year process to get this thing to where we want it. Now I don't certainly don't expect to see another quarter like we just saw, most of the rest of this business is definitely performing better. And what gets disappointing obviously Industrial has been quietly growing and generating good margins for us for some time, people don't talk about it a lot but it's been a good segment. It's unfortunate that we've gone through this issue and obviously I think we have the team behind it to go get it on a better path.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Thank you. And then just one more as it regards to Systems how do think about the profitability profile of the business, is it around 8% and then you announced the joint venture with Flight Safety, maybe how it came about and how it expands your capability in the future?","Scott Donnelly","So the margin rates as we kind of talk about, we knew it would be stronger in the front half of the year than the back half. But overall I know clearly we expect to beat the full-year guidance that we provided for Systems. I think the execution on the programs has been very good and obviously there is lot of opportunity out there the guys are chasing but the performance in 2018 has been net very strong and we feel good about that.","In terms of the Flight Safety deal, I think Flight Safety has been a large training provider for our Textron Aviation products for a long time. We decided we wanted to get into that market because we saw it as a very attractive area and one which was good for us to maintain relations with our customers into the aftermarket, that's been going well particularly our Tampa facility has grown dramatically, we've been doing all the training on the new types of aircraft. So we are quite happy with the business, it's growing, it's kind of what we expected to be but it does take a fair bit of time as you look at how many training centers do you have to have in order to continue to grow that business.","Flight Safety approached us. Said well guys you're -- we know you are getting into this business, going to be better, if we were together in this thing and we could instantly I mean they have been hearing and getting a lot of good feedback on what we've doing with customers and how we run our training programs. They obviously have a much, much larger footprint to provide that training and so I think the combination of the two makes a lot of sense for our customers.","And so it's a good deal for us, it's a good deal for them and I think will -- this will rapidly accelerate our participation in that market. So it's a deal that we sort of explore the concept and came up with the place where both companies feel likely to win and I think it will be very good for our business.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.","Peter Arment","Yes. Good morning, Scott, Frank. Scott just focusing on Systems with top-line, this is the last quarter from a revenue standpoint and I guess 10 quarters or so and I guess was expected with the runoff of TAPV, is this a good level I mean going forward, I mean just trying to understand from a modeling perspective I know Ship-to-Shore was the timing issue but maybe little help there and then also just unrelated if you could just talk about how you still see the competitive landscape for Longitude great news at NBAA but you also heard some announcements from some competitors? Thanks.","Scott Donnelly","Sure. So I think on Systems, it was an unusually low quarter and again I think the runoff of TAPV which we fully expected, we did expect we would see a little more ramp-up on the Ship-to-Shore side, we will start to see that as we get into Q4. So certainly our expectations would be -- we will see little stronger revenue in Q4 than we did in Q3.","With respect to the competitive dynamic, what we have been competing with the 450 and the 500, we will continue to compete with the 450 and the 500 even if they call them the 500 and the 600. They are largely the same aircraft, it's been some clever marketing right the engine guys celebrating being selected and the Avionics guys celebrating being selected they are all the same guys. So I mean it's I think what they have done is they have extended the wing a little bit with wing wood -- a better wing wood and they have put more gas in it.","But our guys feel very comfortable and we've been winning head-to-head in that market against those products obviously the Longitude now coming to certification, I think we feel very good about where we are with respect to those products and obviously [indiscernible] selected by NetJets now to be their super mid product of their marketing in the fractional side and we expect we'll see very much the same phenomenon we saw in Latitude, it helps to validate the aircraft and get good volume driven in the market which obviously is a huge benefit to us on the fractional market but also has a knock on benefit I think on the retail side. So we always had a competitor, let me show we always have competitors but I think we feel very well about where those two products are positioned.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.","David Strauss","Thanks, good morning. I just wanted to ask about so going back to Industrial again how surprised were you by the result relatively to whatever your internal expectations were for the core I'm seeing specifically to the million dollars in EBIT when did you find out the fact term would seem to point to you that given the management change you kind of find out late in the game, just wanted to get some sense of how much of a surprise this was to you guys at corporate?","Scott Donnelly","Well, look I think it was a clearly it was a surprise or I mean it as we look at the load in of product which was really starting to ramp right at the end of Q2 into the beginning of Q3 there was clearly an expectation that as that product rolled out there that we would start to see stronger retail sell through, and we didn't. And so as we kind of worked our way we did in the quarter the guys were not seeing the level of retail sell through that we expected to see and that's when we had to take the actions that we talk around recognizing it's going to be some we've got to continue to work on this channel. But we've had some dealers that have been fabulous that are selling through a lot of retailers they're doing a great job, the product that gets into the field has been spectacular.","We've got great feedback from customers, the performance side we don't have a product problem I mean we have still gaps which again as I said we're working on it as we go forward but I think the progress on what the product is and how the product is performing we're very pleased with. But we're still not seeing as much retail as we would like to see and again we're having to make adjustments in the channel and how we manage the channel and that's the recognition of some of those costs that we're going to bear to work through that.","So it really is something where we expected to see a much stronger Q3 and as we got towards end of the quarter and weren't seeing that that's when we decided we needed to act accordingly.","David Strauss","Okay. And then just trying to help us frame in terms of how we should model Industrial going forward given this result on Q3, so kind of how I'm thinking about is Caltech is within the number that we're seeing, Caltech is still a high-single-digit margin business which implies that vehicle side is significant loss making business, is it right to think about that Caltech kind of holds that level of profitability going forward and the vehicle business gets to breakeven in the fourth quarter and then profitable next year or is it breakeven next year just to try and help us model the business given the volatility?","Scott Donnelly","Well, look I mean I don't know how much modeling I want to do but certainly your characterization of Caltech as the high-single-digit margin business is what we typically see and certainly what we expect. For the balance of the year I clearly expect the vehicle business to be better than breakeven, a lot of these costs that we are managing in terms of the channel are things that that we're accounting for as we go into the quarter, so I think we will certainly see a healthier Q4. We will see a stronger performance on CapEx which is its normal cyclical basis and we will see improvements as a result of some of the actions we're taking at TSV.","David Strauss","Okay. And then last one from me on the tax rate Frank I think you said 17 just is that, that's adjusted I assume and is that a fourth quarter tax rate or a full-year tax and if it\u2019s full-year, can you just tell us what you expect for the fourth quarter?","Frank Connor","Well, I think you could derive the fourth quarter, so it's 17% for the full-year and that's the as adjusted -- kind of that\u2019s on an as adjusted basis, so kind of just the math of that would suggest around a 22% rate for the fourth quarter.","David Strauss","Hi and I appreciate the clarification, thanks.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Sam Pearlstein","Scott or Frank, is there any way to just look at the Industrial Biz segment and tell us is there any sort of quantification of one-time costs, was there an impairment or when to do the next impairment test, just trying to think about what's one-time to this quarter that's now part of ongoing?","Scott Donnelly","Sam, I wouldn't characterize it as one-time, right this is not some special charge but when we look at what we reserve and accrue around anticipated discounting programs and things like that, I mean we had to make adjustments to that given the nature of where we are and where the inventory is. So there's some probably that it's more in the quarter than we would expect but it's not something like an impairment of goodwill or an intangible or something in that nature.","Sam Pearlstein","Okay. And then the CapEx looks like it was reduced about $50 million, is that all the divestiture or have you done anything else in terms of CapEx?","Scott Donnelly","It's about half and half, Sam. So about half of that was associated with not having the second half tools and tests but about another half of that is just CapEx that is tooling and things that we are able to -- that we just don't need to do this year. So it's a split.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Kristine Liwag","Hi, good morning guys, it\u2019s Kristine Liwag calling in for Ron. Scott you mentioned how you wouldn't expect a firm that just order for the Longitude to be as dilutive as a Latitude order and after visiting Wichita a few years -- a few weeks ago it's clear that you've invested a lot in automation for the latitude line and there's even more automation in the Longitude lines, so how much of this better Longitude margin expectation is from better expected operational efficiency versus actual better pricing terms and essentially how much of this production efficiency for the Latitude could flow to your bottom-line?","Scott Donnelly","So I guess I would when we talk about the operation side, I think that on both Latitude and clearly what we're seeing so far on Longitude, we feel very good about our cost position, I think the investment the guys have made around automation, around tooling and making sure that we are able to be very productive and cost effective that had the production of both the Latitude and the Longitude are on track.","I mean we've always felt good about where those are from a production cost standpoint and Longitude obviously is in its early days but the fixturing and the lot of the things that you saw when you were in Wichita are playing out as we expect it. So I think we will be very -- we will be on our cost targets in terms of what we set for the business.","The biggest difference on this issue the dilution around the Latitude deal versus our expectations on the Longitude deal is largely around the fact that we locked in on a Latitude price that was just too low, I don't know how to say it, we should never have gone that low on it and I know the NetJets guys understand that. I mean when we sat down and went through the negotiation process around Longitude is it\u2019s a fair deal, it's a deal that will be a good margin deal for us and it\u2019s a deal they'll be able to do quite well as well. So it was definitely a fair agreement.","Kristine Liwag","Great. And following up on the Longitude, as you go down the learning curve on a program and you get more orders from non-NetJets customers at presumably better pricing, how should we think about incremental operating margins for the program going forward?","Scott Donnelly","We clearly expect that Longitude is going to have 20-plus-percent leverage as it comes into production and starts to sell, so I think we expect it to be typical, let's say as the rest of our jet programs.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Noah Poponak","Frank, sorry to ask another tax rate question but just since it's kind of moved around a lot and people have had different versions of digesting the Bill, what's your latest thinking on the kind of medium-term sustainable beyond 2018 rate?","Frank Connor","Yes, it's kind of low 20s or so type number.","Noah Poponak","Got it. Scott, just going back to kind of like kind of the overall health of the Business jet market and used versus new, just to spend two days at NBAA everyone was some version of incrementally positive but sort of those we spoke to it as your business or other new jet manufacturers were much more in the slightly more positive camp versus when you talk to the brokerage community are those in the secondary market it was particularly bullish. And I guess I was, I know you have sort of already been asked this already but I'm sort of wondering where the tipping point is in the translation of used to new and is there something, is there something that's made the used market more attractive than it used to be, a lot of the brokers are talking about the full depreciation in year one now being applicable use making it more attractive and that the OEMs didn\u2019t like it. I don't know if that is true or not, on the other hand if you're watching out all that inventory eventually you're just going to run out of things to buy an used market and it would help new, so I was just wondering if you could maybe put a little more color around that item specifically and just what's the tipping point when it tips over into your business?","Frank Connor","I think our guys are pretty bullish about where we are. I don't know that I would, there's no reason for there to be a line of demarcation about the second-hand market is good but that's not good for OEMs. I mean the better the second hand market is the better it is for the OEM, right, they provide source of liquidity, I think the brokers are they are very bullish right now because they are pretty much, there is still little out there that the time from the time somebody says hey I'm going to sell my older jet, so I can buy a new jet, the time on market for that transaction to happen is so short, if you\u2019re broker you love that, right, I mean.","How much time you are having to invest in that asset before you sell it and get your commission is I mean -- they have every reason in the world to be bullish. But that bullishness is not a negative for us by any stretch of imagination, it's providing liquidity for that guys who is going to buy the new jet, it's going to upgrade to new jet. So I think that is okay I mean there was a period for [indiscernible] you went back after the sort of the 2009, 2010, 2011 where you had so many virtually new airplanes out there that that was a problem for OEMs obviously because it was buy new airplane in used market versus newer airplane in the new market. So I think those days are way behind us, I mean there's just not new stuff out there, right I mean it's -- there's not a situation here we're competing quite to the contrary, this is very healthy for us to have that level of activity and such low inventory and quick turns on sales in the second hand market, it's absolutely good for us.","Noah Poponak","You guys had cited in the past that the excess used inventory and the pressure of that less from a volume perspective but more from a value perspective the pressure that had on residual values created a trade-in issue for someone who wanted to buy new airplane, is it a matter of if you get a few more quarters of bigger positive residual value improvements or price increases in the secondary market that then that could in more strongly move into your market because now the trade-in value is back, is that something you're watching out for?","Frank Connor","Well, look I mean obviously any improvements in the residual value of the aircraft is beneficial to us right because I mean that's a better value for that customer but I think a lot of this because we went through such a long down cycle, these residual values drop but then largely flattened or going into a more normal depreciation schedule than the dramatic reductions that we saw in that sort of 2009, 2010, 2011 timeframe when you saw DREP numbers just dropping dramatically even in the absence of transactions frankly. There was just a sort of a drive price down into an illiquid market, it was terribly unhealthy period of time. So I think we're beyond that. But obviously as residual come off incrementally that's beneficial because that's better value for the someone who is looking to make that trade industry.","Noah Poponak","Last one on it, could you maybe give us a lead time update maybe just using CJ 34 kind like cabin bread. and butter, what kind of -- how long to get in an airplane today versus what it was earlier in the year?","Frank Connor","I would have a hard time getting one for, but I\u2019m willing to take a look if you are serious about it.","Noah Poponak","I mean is it more than a year to get a CJ 3 or CJ 4 at this point?","Frank Connor","No, no, no, no.","Noah Poponak","You meant hard time in 2018?","Frank Connor","Yes.","Noah Poponak","Okay. What about the first half of 2019?","Frank Connor","Would go, I mean","Scott Donnelly","No delivery of it.","Frank Connor","Did too much into it, look as I think.","Noah Poponak","Okay. I thought you guys had sort of consistently provided that number?","Frank Connor","No, I don\u2019t think we focused on that. So look I think this market if you are looking at that model that are year out there or three or six months, I think that is a healthy place for this thing to be. Someone is looking at do want to trade and they can\u2019t get an aircraft for a year, I don\u2019t think that's healthy, I think we try to match this thing to where you'd like to be and more ideal and I mean I\u2019m making up a number three to six months, right. Most people don't want to wait a year for something right but.","Noah Poponak","So you are in production next year then?","Frank Connor","We are probably going to raise a couple of models, sure.","Noah Poponak","Okay. All right, that's, that's really helpful color. Thanks so much.","Scott Donnelly","Okay, Brad, that concludes our prepared remarks for today.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, today's conference will be available for replay after 10 A.M. today through January 22 of 2019.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Doug Wilburne. Please go ahead.","Douglas R. Wilburne","Thank you, Tani, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in our earnings release.","On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.","Moving now to second quarter results, starting with Slide #3. Revenues in the quarter were $2.8 billion, down 6% from a year ago. Our income from continuing operations was $0.40 per share, which compares to $0.58 in the second quarter of 2012.","Moving to cash flow. Second quarter manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was a $362 million use of cash, and second quarter pension contributions were $17 million.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott C. Donnelly","Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everybody. We saw solid revenue growth at Textron Systems in our Industrial businesses, as well as strong commercial orders of Bell. On the business jet front, demand continued to be soft. As we announced in April, we took cost, production and pricing actions appropriate for this market environment. Specifically, we re-lowered our light jet production line rates, reduced associated direct headcount, downsized our indirect workforce and reduced our jet discount allowance. As we expected, reduced discounting to entice customers into the market did result in lower sales volume, as we delivered 20 jets compared to 49 a year ago. However, we achieved positive new jet pricing on both a sequential and year-over-year basis, which was our intent. We still believe the overall market demand will eventually recover as global economic -- the global economies continues to expand.","With respect to the rollout of our new M2, Sovereign and Ten product lines, we're making good progress with certification testing. The aircraft are performing extremely well, although minor delays in avionics software certification has slightly delayed initial delivery dates. We would now expect M2 and Sovereign to begin shipping in the fourth quarter this year, with the new Citation Ten early next year. This will reduce total expected 2013 shipments resulting in a new full year Cessna revenue outlook of just over $3 billion.","Looking longer term with new products, we're making good progress on our Latitude and Longitude platforms planned for service entry in 2015 and '17. In fact, the first Latitude fuselage and nose sections were mated last week, and we're on track for flight test early next year. Market receptivity for this new model has been a very good, as we conducted a 19-city tour with our mock-up during the quarter.","Finally, on Cessna, we're making excellent progress in implementing our Chinese strategy to build and market Cessna Aircraft through in-country joint ventures. We completed the equipment and tooling installation for our new Chinese Caravan facility and expect deliveries to begin before year-end. We're also installing equipment and tooling at our newly constructed business jet facility and expect deliveries of XLS to begin next year.","Moving to our finance segments. Slowness in the business jet market resulted in only a few new loan originations during the quarter. However, our segment profit benefited from good credit performance and a number of small-ask [ph] transactions in our non-captive business.","In our Industrial businesses, we saw good growth in each of our businesses, reflecting strong auto markets in North America and new product introductions and expansions of our global distribution channels. We also had good execution with an overall incremental margin conversion of 39%. We'll continue to invest in new products in our Industrial businesses, as we believe that's the best way to win in the market and create high-value growth. For example, during the quarter, we did introduce our redesigned TXT golf car, updating the model's curb appeal and proven performance, while delivering new features, as well as increased durability and simpler maintenance.","During the quarter, we also closed on the acquisition of Sherman & Reilly, a manufacturer of aerial and underground electrical power distribution and transmission products, which significantly expanded Greenlee's electrical utility product line.","Moving to Systems. Revenues were up, reflecting growth in our unmanned air systems and precision munition product lines. We continue to see operational stability in our fee-for-service unmanned air vehicle systems contract. But as previously discussed, this eventually -- is essentially a breakeven program at this time for us. Our other major UAS contract is the Shadow Tactical Data Common Link retrofit program. This program is still in the development phase, and it now appears the completion of the development program will not occur in time to allow shipments of the production units that were planned for this year. As a result, Systems' 2013 revenues will probably be about $200 million lower than we previously expected.","On the precision munitions front, we continue to ship product for the Saudi program under an undefinitized contract and expect a boost to Systems backlog in the third quarter as we recently came to agreement on final pricing. At TMLS, we're making good progress on our Canadian TAPV program, as we deliver our preproduction vehicles for initial performance testing. Across Textron Systems, we have a substantial amount of global sales activity underway for our products and continue to believe this business can maintain a flat to slightly growing top line over the next several years.","Finishing with Bell, we delivered 9 V-22s and 6 H-1s in the quarter, flat with delivery in last year's second quarter. We signed a second V-22 multiyear contract to deliver 99 units beginning in late 2014, with options for 23 additional aircraft, with 1 already exercised. We're also in active discussions with several potential FMS customers. This should lead to additional V-22 volume in the second multiyear timeframe.","Last month, our Bell V-280 tiltrotor platform was selected to participate in the U.S. Army's Joint Multirole Technology Demonstrator program. We believe the V-280 offers the Army the highest level of performance at test [ph], as well as the best overall value in terms of capability, procurement costs and operating costs.","On the commercial side, we delivered 44 helicopters in the quarter versus 47 units in last year's second quarter. While deliveries were down, this was a result of commercial delivery timing and not a reflection of demand, as commercial order flow remained strong in the quarter.","On the last earnings call, we indicated a transition to a new ERP system had negatively impacted our productivity in aftermarket shipments. We have improved operations, such that we are now shipping spare parts at levels higher than before we implemented the new ERP system, while we have further work to do implementing these systems and we'll be focused on improving operating productivity and output to reduce spare parts backlog and return to internal production schedules.","On the new product front, we made a strategically important announcement at the Paris Air Show when we unveiled our new short light single, which essentially replaces our Legacy 206 JetRanger. With our recently upgraded 407 and 412 models, our new 429 and the planned 525, the new SLS will fill out our product line at the lower end. With over 4,400 JetRangers currently in service, there's meaningful existing upgrade market to support this demand. We're expediting development to bring this product to market as quickly as possible with the expected first flight late next year.","To wrap up, we expect slightly lower full year results at Cessna and Systems and slightly higher results at Finance and Industrial. We're maintaining our guidance for 2013's guidance of $1.90 to $2.10 per share. We're also maintaining our projected 2013 cash flow from continuing operations of the manufacturing group before pension of about $400 million.","In summary, we remain focused on improving our operational execution and cost productivity, and we remain committed to continue our investments in new products and sales capability to grow the business over the long term.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank.","Frank T. Connor","Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Segment profit in the quarter was $213 million, down $97 million from the second quarter of 2012, on a $880 million decrease in revenues.","Let's look at how each of the segments contributed, starting with Cessna. Second quarter revenues at Cessna were down $203 million on a year-over-year basis, reflecting lower jet deliveries. The segment had a loss of $50 million, primarily due to lower volumes, along with the impact of $28 million in pretax severance costs. We would expect that expense savings would offset most of the $28 million by the end of the year.","At Bell, revenues were down $31 million, primarily due to lower commercial helicopter volume. Segment profit decreased $17 million, reflecting the lower volume and an unfavorable mix in our commercial business.","At Textron Systems, revenues were up $33 million, primarily due to higher volumes in our UAS and weapons and sensor product lines. Segment profit decreased $6 million, reflecting a larger mix of lower-margin service contracts.","Industrial revenues increased $45 million, reflecting higher volumes across most of the businesses and an increase from acquisitions. Segment profit increased $18 million, primarily due to improved performance and the higher volumes.","Moving to Finance. Revenue decreased $24 million from last year's second quarter, reflecting lower Finance receivables. The segment had a profit of $15 million. Credit performance continued to improve during the quarter, with non-accruals of $124 million and 60-day delinquencies of $65 million.","Moving to corporate items, starting with cash flow. Looking at our cash flow reconciliation, which is at the bottom of the manufacturing group cash flow schedule, which is attached to our earnings release, we've had a year-to-date use of cash from operating activities before pension contributions of $787 million. As reflected on our June 29 balance sheet, also attached to our press release, you can see that a significant portion of this cash use was driven by an increase in working capital. This was driven primarily by operations at Bell and Cessna. At Bell, this was the result of inventory builds for higher second half military and commercial deliveries and the productivity issues that Scott discussed earlier.","At Cessna, the cash use reflected ramp-up of production for new M2, Sovereign and Citation Ten and lower-than-expected deliveries in the first half of the year. We expect these working capital increases to reverse during the second half of the year, as we deliver the higher volumes at Bell and as we certify our new models and deliver higher volumes at Cessna.","Moving back to the P&L. Corporate expenses were $20 million, flat with the year ago. Interest expense was $30 million, down $5 million from last year's second quarter, primarily due to the benefits from the payoff of our convertible notes on May 1. Our diluted average share count during the quarter was 283.8 million shares, which was 11.7 million shares lower than last year's second quarter, primarily reflecting the share repurchases in last year's fourth quarter and the convertible notes settlement.","Finally, our EPS guidance now reflects an annual effective tax rate of 28%, down from our previous guidance of 29%. This reflects lower domestic income at Cessna and Systems, which is subject to higher U.S.-based tax rates.","That concludes our prepared remarks. So operator, we can open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Scott or Frank, just to make sure I've got the production flow at Cessna about correct here. If I slide the Ten out and the Sovereign out, as you just indicated, versus my prior model, I show second half total deliveries down kind of 5% to 10% and full year '13 down something like 20% to 25% versus '12. Does that sound about right?","Scott C. Donnelly","It's probably about the right order of magnitude.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, good. And then can you just go back to the avionics delays that you mentioned are driving that? And maybe give us a little more detail on exactly what's going on there?","Scott C. Donnelly","Sure, Noah. Look, we have, in both the M2, which is a Garmin 3000 cockpit, and the Ten and the Sovereign, which essentially have the same Garmin 5000 cockpit. We're trying to have one basic certified software build that really underlies all 3 of those platforms. The flight testing and the performance of the avionics equipment and whatnot, for the most part, has been quite good. The aircraft are performing extremely well, making great progress in all their flight testing. But our supplier has struggled going through this first -- our 25 cert and just getting everything all lined up and getting us a build of the software that will pass through all the final certification testings. We think we're there, frankly. I mean, it hasn't really impeded the flight test program. The aircraft have been continuing to run. We do have the initial builds of -- or the initial versions of the latest build that are in our own integration laboratories on the ground and look very good. The guys are very bullish that we think it has the things that it needs to have in it for the final cert, and so it's a matter of just taking those now and getting them into the actual aircraft. And then, frankly, going through the formal process and getting each of the aircraft through. And the only reason the Ten is pushing into next year is just the timelines to get the M2 through the certification process, get the Sovereign through it. It's probably going to push the Ten into beginning of next year. So it's relatively mild, modest in terms of its schedule impact, Noah. We're originally hoping to get the first couple of sales of M2s and Sovereigns late in the third quarter, and then we had always planned the Tens in the fourth quarter. And I just think with some of the, as I say, relatively minor delays in getting this final software build, it's pushed them out a couple of months, but that's enough to push it, all the deliveries of the M2s and the Sovereigns into Q4 and just realistically speaking as we focus on getting those through the process, so it'll push the Tens into the first of next year.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Scott or Frank, just on the cash flow, heard what you said on the inventory build at both Bell and Cessna. I was wondering if you could give a little more detail on, I guess, what surprised you in the quarter? Or if it did at all, are you back on track? I know you haven't caught up at Bell for the ERP implementation, but are you back on track with where you originally would've thought you would've been? And then on Cessna, how are you going to make back the inventory build by the end of the year if some of these deliveries are getting pushed into 2014?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, I think Cessna is more or less to be expected. I mean, we know we're ramping up M2s. We're ramping up Sovereigns. We expected, as you know, to take down the light jet production volume, but obviously, we are finishing out the aircraft that were in the queue. So we certainly expected to see a significant inventory build at Cessna. We still believe that we will get the M2 and the Sovereign deliveries that we had in the plan for the year. It's just they'll all be fourth quarter instead of over the end of the third and into the fourth quarter. So the only ones that are really moving out in total are the Tens moving into next year. So for sure, there is some pressure there. On the other hand, we think there are opportunities, and we're certainly taking fewer trade-ins. So as we continue to work down our balance of used aircraft inventory, which we did again in the quarter, we think that helps to make up for some of that cash shortfall in terms of having the Citation Tens delayed into the first quarter of next year. So the Cessna situation, I think, is pretty well understood. There's not a lot of surprises there, and we'll work our way through that. At Bell, I would say, certainly to our plan, we're behind where we would like to be in terms of cash. As I said, in terms of how we're doing in this ERP system, particularly with respect to a lot of our parts shipments, be it into the spares or into our final assembly factories, the improvement in that area is kind of back to plan. But it did not catch up where we were behind in the first quarter. And so that's the work we still have to do. So we're -- the system is running. I mean, we can demonstrate that we can now ship the parts at levels at or above where we were before we put the system in. But we haven't yet achieved the level where we were able to burn down that backlog. But we certainly have expectations that'll happen through the course of the year. And that also results in getting things around progress billings and things like that, where you don't have as much in progress that has been accomplished, and therefore, you're behind on some government billings. But again, as we get that system recovering and get it stable and work our way through the rest of the year, we think we will recover that.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So it's fair to say that we should see improvement certainly in Q3, particularly at Bell? And then a lot of the improvement at Cessna comes in Q4 because that's when all the new deliveries take place?","Scott C. Donnelly","Yes, that's exactly right.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then over in Industrial, margins were quite good, the highest in, I think, a very, very long time. You attributed it to performance and to volume. How should we be thinking about the upside opportunity to what you've been putting up in the past is sort of the 8% level as we go forward? Or are we going to revert back to that level?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, as you know, our Industrial businesses are each cyclical in their own nature. So I think I wouldn't expect to see 9%, almost 10% margins in the last 2 quarters. But I certainly would expect to see margin expansion over what the margins have typically been in the third and the fourth quarter. So I think performance will stay strong. The strategy we have around there, both in terms of productivity and driving more sales and new products is working, and I think it'll continue to work. So certainly, there is the seasonality, but I would expect to continue to see margin expansion in the Industrial businesses.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just one more, Scott, could you comment on demand, in particular for midsized aircraft? Have you filled those initial Sovereign slots for the new version of the aircraft and maybe just address XLS demand?","Scott C. Donnelly","So Sovereign demand, I mean, we are starting, obviously, to take orders for the new Sovereign. We just got the first production aircraft off the line only a few weeks ago. And that thing has been on a very, very steady and busy tour of flying around and doing demo flights. So we really didn't have the sales tool in place until here just very recently, but the aircraft is out there, flying a lot of customers. And I'd say we have a pretty strong list of customers that are interested in the new Sovereign. It's always been a very popular aircraft. People that have them, love them. And it's a very nice refresh to the aircraft. So as I said, we have started to take orders and put them into the backlog, but we've only really been out there able to show people the aircraft and demo fly it here in the last few weeks. So it's, I would say, it's building some pretty reasonable momentum in terms of the customer prospect list. XLS demand has been pretty steady through the quarter and no real change. In terms of the light jet market, as I said, there's -- the market is still very soft. And if you're not out there doing pretty aggressive discounting and trying to go to customers that are not ready to move yet, you're not going to see a whole lot of volume. That's exactly what we expected to see in the marketplace. So there's obviously some activity, but it's still pretty soft.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Godwin [ph] with Morgan Stanley.","Unknown Analyst","In the release, you described the Cessna production cuts as the right actions. I was just hoping you could elaborate on that a little bit. Of course, demand continues to be soft. So I was just curious, would continued softness in biz jet trends from here cause you to revisit production even further and potentially reduce it again? Or by right actions, do you mean that the data that you see and the conversations that you're having suggest that you've really hit the right level given where demand is?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, I mean, obviously this a very fluid situation, so I don't think we'll ever say, \"Hey, we're done one way or the other.\" So in the case of the lights, we scaled back what we thought our target for the year would be around sales of those aircraft. And I would say, at least looking into what we are anticipating for the third and fourth quarter, we think we're in the right place. On the other hand, if you look at M2s, the market demand for that new product has stayed fairly strong, and we've actually gone in and tried to figure out how to add some additional slots into next year, because we're in a situation right now where we see some transactions happening and the M2 would be the right aircraft for the customer, but it's -- we don't have available slots for them. So we've had some adjustments, obviously, that we took down this year around some of the light models, comfortable with where we are right now. That doesn't mean we would change it up or down based on what we see demand changing in the marketplace. But I think what we took those down to, our view right now is that's probably the right number in terms of our current production role. And then, of course, we have the M2 where we're going to go try to find a way to insert some more available slots into 2014 because we think the demand is there.","Unknown Analyst","Okay, that's very helpful. And I was hoping you'd talk a bit about what the sales force is telling you the customer response was to the production rates. Of course, you had some good comments on incremental pricing. Is that just sort of simple supply-demand rebalancing? Or is there any kind of new or renewed sense of urgency to transact that wasn't in the customer conversations before the cuts? Just any clarity or background there would be helpful.","Scott C. Donnelly","Sure. I know I would categorize it as a supply-demand balancing. So the transactions that I felt that we were doing that we wanted to get away from doing, we're trying to go in and do some additional discounting to get a customer who's ultimately going to upgrade their aircraft and trying to pull them forward to get them to upgrade now. And so as we took that sort of aggressive discount out and didn't go try to pursue and try to get somebody to come into the market that didn't feel they were ready to come into the market, obviously, those transactions have gone away. So -- and -- customers are fine with that. When you have customers that say, \"Hey, I'm okay where I am probably for another year or 2,\" then that's fine. They'll keep flying their current aircraft for another period of time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a quick question on the Cessna margin in the quarter. If you exclude the severance costs that you called out last quarter, you're still decently negative. I wondered if there were any other cost action items there? Or maybe you could comment on any impact from used aircraft in the quarter? Any color there would be helpful.","Scott C. Donnelly","Sure. So obviously, the vast majority of it was associated with the severance costs, which is the $27 million that we have in there. There were about $8 million of used aircraft residual write-downs. But other than that, it was just a very, very light delivery quarter. And so there's just not a lot of cost absorption on 20 jets.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And just as a clarification, when you say pricing improvement from the actions you took, is that sequential improvement versus last quarter or year-over-year?","Scott C. Donnelly","Sequential and year-over-year actually.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And one final one. In Systems, you mentioned the definitization of the Saudi contract. Does that result in any material margin impact versus what you had under the undefinitized contract before?","Scott C. Donnelly","No, it doesn't. We were -- where we ended up was roughly the pricing that we expected in terms of how we've been booking the deal. So I think the only real consequential outcome you'll see of that becoming a definitized contract is it'll all go into backlog as opposed to just what was under the undefinitized contract.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Scott, I'd like to follow up on your comment earlier that you mentioned about continued softness in light demand, of apparently, a pickup in demand for the mid-cam [ph]. Do think there are some of the sort of structural change here in terms of the business jet market that is preferring these larger jets?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, Robert, I think we just continue to have a view of the market that says the light market, the light to small mid-market is really a small to midsize business person, and they're more economically sensitive than large corporations and other corporate operators of aircraft that tend to have larger aircraft. So I think the confidence in the economy around that small to midsized business community has been a little more subdued. And so when you look at a large corporate operator, they get so many years in, they're going to roll that aircraft. I mean, they're very worried about reliability and availability and aircraft on ground, these sorts of things, and I think they're more inclined to accept a more difficult residual value environment and go ahead and roll the aircraft anyway. When you look at a light operator that historically, yes, they like to roll it at 5 years or 7 years, I think with residual values where they are right now, they're inclined to say they'll stick with it for another year or 2. So that's our general sense. A lot of people we see coming in right now are coming in. They're coming from the places they usually come from in terms of light jets, right? They're coming out of a turboprop or a light single and something like that. But you don't see as much activity of the people who are current CJ operators that are doing their upgrade. Eventually they will come, but I think a lot of it just has to do with where the residual values are. And the used aircraft market, certainly from a volume standpoint, the number of aircraft has been dropping and dropping, but it's still a fairly significant number. And I think the biggest challenge is that we haven't really seen, for sure, have not seen a price recovery in terms of used aircraft values. And I think those are the things that need to happen before you're going to see -- or a significant strengthening in the economy, where people feel better about what's going on, before you're going to see a lot of activity in the light market.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And the second question, I was wondering if you could comment on the demand environment in terms of geographical regions. If you're seeing any differences versus maybe what you said 3 months ago in U.S., Europe or Asia?","Scott C. Donnelly","No, it's still very much U.S.-centric. There's a little bit of activity in Europe, very light activity, frankly, in Latin America, some in Asia, not very strong on the lights. A lot of demand in Asia on the Caravan. We're seeing a fairly strong demand for our turboprop business over there. But in terms of the jet market, it's very North American-centric.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Let me just ask, I guess, a couple of Bell questions, just for something different. On the SLS, Scott, I mean, some of your competitors sell helicopters in that range, 100 to 200 helicopters a year. Is that the kind of opportunity that you're thinking for that model?","Scott C. Donnelly","It is. I mean, I think our principal competitor in this market right now, Peter, really is the guys that have moved in into the Robinson R66s. That's really the space that we're targeting. It's kind of that price point. I think we have -- it'll be a little different performance for us, but it's in roughly in that price point. And it's probably a 200-, 300-helicopter-a-year market.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Got it. Great. And then any progress on the 429 weight approvals from the FAA?","Scott C. Donnelly","Not from the FAA. We continue to get more countries that are approving it based on the Canadian certification. So we see the market continue to grow internationally for it as it's approved. I think the situation with the FAA, Peter, is that, as you may have read, there's really an activity going on right now within the FAA to look at this whole issue of, is 7,000 pounds the right number to delineate between the current certification standards, whether it's a 27 or 29. And this has happened in the past, by the way, right, where as technology changes and what's available in the market changes and technologies change from particular, is it appropriate to have a specific weight that delineates the difference? If so, is it the right weight? And so really what's happening right now is there is a broader review of this issue going on in the FAA, and I suspect that where we'll end up will really be reflective of where the FAA wants to go in the future in terms of how they're going to delineate between Part 27 and 29 service.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Okay, okay. And then just broadly, on the Bell commercial helicopter, I guess, cycle, you mentioned timing during your, I think, your opening remarks. You don't sense that the commercial helicopter cycle is slowing at all? You just think you had a timing issue in the quarter? And overall, the commercial helicopter up-cycle is sort of still intact. Is that kind of your view?","Scott C. Donnelly","It is. There's no change to our view. The quarter actually was quite strong in terms of order rate, so a lot of order activity. We were light a few helicopters versus a year ago, but that really just has to do with customer delivery timing. And there's no change in our view of what's going on in the market nor our expectations in terms of our deliveries for 2013.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So, Scott, you mentioned improvement in pricing at Cessna sequentially and year-over-year. And yet, if one looks at the used market, it looks like those prices continue to kind of soften. So do you feel you've kind of hit equilibrium here where basically the prices really have held and can get better from here? Or are you concerned that the weakness in the used market is going to catch up with you, and so you're going to have continuing pricing pressures in your business?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, Cai, I think that part of what's going on with the new aircraft pricing was also driving the residual value on the used aircraft. So it's actually a little bit the other way. And I guess, one thing I want to be clear about. I don't want to mislead anybody, all right. We got better pricing in the quarter with both sequentially and year-over-year, but we're hardly taking aircraft back to list pricing. These are still attractive prices for customers versus historical levels, okay? So there is still discounting going on. It's not like this has snapped back to all of a sudden, people are going to be selling at list price. So I do think that pricing will continue to reflect sort of the tone of what's going on in the market. It was just our view that coming out, particularly out of the first quarter, and I looked at what was going on from a pricing standpoint, was getting to the point where it didn't make any sense do these deals, okay? So I mean, we need to go back to a level of price that is still a fair, an attractive deal for our customers, but one which is also a reasonable deal for our company to be able to continue to invest in new products and, et cetera. So that correction, I think, was very important. And I'm glad that we made it, and I think it's appropriate that we make it. But these products are still very attractive in terms of how they're priced at this point, even going back modestly above where they were in 2012. So used aircraft pricing, Cai, absolutely, I think is still going to be a challenge. But I think that there -- it's more of an impact to the ability for somebody to trade in and what their residual value is, as opposed to how it should necessarily pressure new aircraft pricing.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Was there any change as you went through the quarter in terms of the tone of demand in any respect?","Scott C. Donnelly","Not really.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then you'd mentioned the avionics delay, and obviously, you already were planning most of the delivery of Sovereigns and M2s in the fourth quarter. But obviously, I assume some of those have slipped into next year. Approximately how many of those new plane deliveries that you'd expected this year slipped into next year?","Scott C. Donnelly","As I said, I really still expect that we will get the M2 and Sovereign deliveries that we were expecting. They'll just be in the fourth quarter instead of getting some done in the beginning -- or the end of the third quarter. The only aircraft that I really view as moving into the next year as a result of these delays are the Tens.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Frank, just a quick question for you. The corporate line in the income statement seems to bounce around from quarter to quarter. I was wondering if you could give us an update on the second half and your view, all else being equal at this point, stock price and all the other inputs that go there, what we should expect on the corporate line for the second half of the year?","Frank T. Connor","Yes, I mean, the corporate line kind of, generally, if you look at kind of how we guided it, runs about kind of $35 million to $38 million on average. And it bounces around, as you say, because of that kind of share price activity and what that does in terms of just the stock-based compensation expense. And so if you kind of think $38-ish million type area per quarter, that's a normalized type of level for that expense.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And that's what's baked into your guidance then for the full year, this $38 million both in the third and fourth quarters each?","Frank T. Connor","Yes, that type area, $37 million and $38 million.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then, Scott, just a quick question on Cessna and the margins there. Can you just give us a little bit of color around your expectations on incremental margins, assuming we get some year-on-year growth going again there? What we ought to expect from incremental margins on a go-forward basis? So I think you've talked about a range in the past, and I was wondering if you could give us an update there.","Scott C. Donnelly","Yes, we generally expect to see 20%, 25% incremental margin on volume growth at Cessnas.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And these most recent actions don't change that at all, the headcount reductions?","Scott C. Donnelly","No, because it's largely trying to size based on what we anticipate volumes to be. I mean, those are the actions that we have to take if we're going to adjust the business accordingly in terms of what the revenues are going to look like.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes. Okay, great. And then last one, Scott, could you -- in the past, you've given us a little bit of your expectations around the biz jet market in China. I was wondering, generally speaking, you talked a little bit about your production actions, but can you talk a little bit about the market itself and the development of the biz jet market in China and where we are today?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, we still have expectations that we're going to see growth in the Chinese market in terms of -- and remember, I'm talking about our products, which are primarily aircraft that would be flown within China, not in and out of China, so it's a domestic aircraft. It is still, today, not an easy market from that standpoint, because it's not easy to fly internal just in terms of the air space management. But we have every indication and certainly see activities going on that would lead us to believe that, that's going to continue to liberalize. So there's a lot more liberalization of lower altitude airspace that's happening. We see this in selling Caravans. We see it in selling helicopters. A lot of this air space is going to become more open. But it's certainly our expectation that they'll start to open up and make it easier to fly within the country at the higher altitudes, which is really obviously the land of the jets. So our focus here right now is making sure we have a good sales team in place and start to do the market development activities, so that as we continue to sell into that market, we make sure that we're present and see every opportunity. And obviously, the XLS manufacturing in Zhouhai, which we expect to kick in and start deliveries next year, is specifically targeted at those opportunities.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, I had a question on the Bell margins. In the first half, they were down around 100 bps. Year-on-year, you had a sort of 40%, 45% decremental. If you're thinking about the second half, I mean, is there anything in terms of the phasing or the weighting of R&D for things like the 525, the V-280, that maybe changed that dynamic? Or R&D is fairly well, smooth through the year?","Frank T. Connor","Fairly smooth, Julian. I mean, we're still on track for our original guidance between 13% and 14%.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then in Cessna, if we're thinking about, I understand the push outs and so on. I mean, excluding that, it sounds as if volume and pricing are tracking pretty much in line with where you would've thought back in April and May. I just wanted to check if that's the case? And more specifically, what's going on with Cessna aftermarket? I think that was up about 9% in Q1. Just what sort of trend did you have just now?","Scott C. Donnelly","It's up again in this quarter in both parts and services. So guys are still flying the aircraft, utilizing the aircraft. And we're seeing, I'd say, reasonable growth on the service side of the business. And in terms of the volume of jet production, as I said, I think the numbers we're looking at right now in terms of the performance this quarter and our expectations here through the second half of the year, we feel like our plans in terms of production that we laid in are probably about where they need to be. So I'd say it's, at this point, we still have the same expectations that we had when we talked to you after the first quarter call.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And then lastly, just if you could -- obviously, rates are moving around and so on, just a reminder on what the anticipated pension effect on earnings is for '13?","Frank T. Connor","It's -- oh, for '13.","Scott C. Donnelly","'13, it was...","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, if you're willing to talk about '14, that would be great, but I just -- any view on either.","Scott C. Donnelly","I thought it was 1 30...","Frank T. Connor","Well, no, for '14, the pension expense was $225-ish million area, which was a meaningful headwind to our 2012 level.","Scott C. Donnelly","[indiscernible] expense budget [ph].","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And the expectation for the effect in '13?","Frank T. Connor","That -- I'm sorry, so on '13, we had about $55 million of pension headwind, and total pension expense was about kind of $225 million. And in '14, we should no -- we would expect, it depends on rates and lots of things between now and then, but we would expect that we will no longer see a headwind. We should see a bit of a tailwind. And obviously, that'll depend on kind of discount rates and returns for the rest of the year and lots of other factors. But we, as we sit here today, we would not expect to continue to see a pension headwind as we move into '14.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Just cleaning up a few things. Used aircraft, that charge of $8 million or write-down of $8 million, is that on aircraft that are now no longer in-house? And can you give us some color on the size and dollars and\/or units of your used aircraft inventory?","Scott C. Donnelly","Those -- that $8 million is a charge against our current inventory based on the residual values. We obviously had some sales of aircraft in the quarter, Jeff. And I don't think there was an appreciable gain or loss on sale of those guys. So they're marked to roughly the right spot. I think there was a very modest gain this quarter. But we don't talk about the specific numbers of aircraft on the used side. We did sell -- we didn't sell quite as many as we did year-over-year, but actually dollar volume of the sales was actually a bit higher than it was year-over-year.","Frank T. Connor","And net inventory went down slightly, Jeff.","Scott C. Donnelly","Right. Net inventory -- yes.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Net inventory is down?","Scott C. Donnelly","Right.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","And then just kind of back to Cessna, so effectively, what you're telling us, right, is M2 was sold to your plan now through 2014. I mean, obviously, I don't know precisely what your plan is, but I'm hoping we can kind get kind of bigger than a breadbox type of thought process here. If I think about M2, obviously, clearly is going to hurt M1. I think you would agree with that. I don't know if you do. But if I think about M1 plus M2, are we looking at unit volumes equivalent, or maybe even better than kind of the 40-ish a year that we were seeing in 2011 and 2012?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, I think it's a fair way to look at it, Jeff. I mean, it's sort of an equivalent number. Mustang deliveries have been at a relatively low rate just because, again, we see a relatively small number of people coming into that market. But certainly, when you look at the total for the entry jet market, there's now 2 ways to participate in that with us, right? Either the Mustang or the M2. And so, yes, you got to think about kind of annualized roughly the same number of aircraft with a, I think, at least in the early years, a significant mix shift towards the M2.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","And then kind of along the same lines, your confidence on clearing the WIP inventory in Cessna, obviously comes around moving the Sovs and the Tens that you're building. Can you give us some color on how you're sold on those relative to your production plan on whatever horizon you're comfortable talking about it, whether it's through Q4 or into 2014?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, I guess, just from color standpoint, I mean, the Tens are pretty sold. That's been out there for a while. We've been able to market and sell that aircraft. On the Sovereign, we still have a number of aircraft to go sell. But as I said earlier, we really have only had the first demonstrator aircraft to take out and start doing demos and flight tours here over the past month. So as I said, we have started to take orders. We have started to close deals, but we still have more aircraft to sell here for the 2013 plan. But we think we have a pretty reasonable level of interest in the customer community and a lot of people that are talking to us, a lot of people are doing demo flights. But that process is still fairly early.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Right. And then finally for me, just Bell commercial, can you give us kind of just the rough percentage delta. What you think full year volumes look like versus 2012?","Scott C. Donnelly","I think we guided we would be up significantly, and I think that's how it's playing out.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay. So notwithstanding the little hiccup in Q2, the back half looks very strong?","Scott C. Donnelly","Yes, I mean, the Q2 is just -- we line up with customer delivery dates. So unfortunately in Q2, there were a number of aircraft, particularly larger aircraft, that are heavily, more heavily weighted towards the third and fourth quarter.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","And I'm sorry, just finally, one more. So just thinking about all this, actually the incrementals in Cessna with the charge and the used aircraft and everything aren't awful, actually. For as much as production is down, I would say, it's kind of admirable, although it's a tough market for you. But should we think of Cessna, I mean, Cessna should be breakeven or better in Q3? Is that a reasonable expectation?","Scott C. Donnelly","Again, Jeff, it's so sensitive to the volumes of aircraft and without having any of the M2s or Sovereigns in Q3, I think that's going to make that a challenge. I mean, obviously, that's what we're trying to do. I think, look, the bottom line here is that the team out there, I think, is doing a heck of job in a pretty tough environment. They have driven a lot of cost productivity, and I think that's part of what you're seeing. I mean, we're not just saying, \"Well, it's a bad market, so everything's going to a disaster.\" We can't possibly be happy about anything that has a red number associated with it. But the guys are simultaneously trying to drive as much productivity and go through the challenges of reducing and eliminating an awful lot of jobs to respond to what's going on in the market. At the same time, they're trying to invest a ton of money in developing a bunch of new products that will help us both this year or next year and into the future. So it's a tough balancing act. But I think those guys are doing a heck of a job, trying to do everything they can to manage costs and make sure that we do as well as we can in a tough market. And obviously, I think, position us so that when this thing does play itself through on this cycle, things will come out very well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro","Just a follow up on a couple of numbers, Scott. You kind of said aftermarket sales of Cessna were up. Were they up in the 5% to 10% area like they were in the last quarter?","Frank T. Connor","They were up 16%, but keep in mind that we had some M&A over the past year in the service center. So on an organic basis, it was high-single digit.","George Shapiro","And the used plane sales that were in the quarter?","Scott C. Donnelly","I'm sorry, George, what about the used aircraft in the quarter?","George Shapiro","Okay. Could you just give us what the sales volume was?","Scott C. Donnelly","I don't think we've given the specific numbers, George. As I said, we were down a couple in terms of units, but on a year-over-year basis, we were actually up in terms of the sales volume. So they were more expensive, larger aircraft.","George Shapiro","Okay. And then, Scott, the CJ4 was particularly weak this quarter. I mean, you kind of been running double digits, and it dropped to 4. Is there any reason for it? Or is it just succumbing to the light weakness? And then would you expect that to rebound some in the third quarter?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, I think, George, it probably is a reflection a bit of this notion that people that already have CJs aren't going to do an upgrade at this time. And we see a lot of people that are going to the CJ4s that might be current CJ2 or 3 operators right now. So I think that's probably a little bit a good example of it. If you don't see a whole of upgrade activity going on, you're probably not going to see as many more people move into the 4s.","George Shapiro","So what -- in third quarter deliveries, I mean, what's able to drive it significantly higher or maybe it's only a little bit higher than the 20 that we saw in the second quarter?","Scott C. Donnelly","I'd have to say, George, it's probably just sort of the normal cyclicality of people buying aircraft. [indiscernible] we look at what's going on in the customer community and the number of deals, the number of prospects on every aircraft type. So it's -- we're not particularly guiding a specific number of aircraft in the third quarter. But I would -- looking at it right now, we'd certainly expect it to be higher than the 20 that we saw in the second quarter.","George Shapiro","Okay. And then just a more general one, Scott, you had mentioned after the first quarter, you weren't going to cut price, and we clearly saw that in lower orders this quarter, although better quality orders. The fact that you didn't succumb to that temptation at the end of the quarter, does that change people's minds sufficiently, that we go into the third and the fourth quarter here, that they recognize that they're going to have to pay a better price if they want an airplane? I mean, can you talk about that mentality that's out there?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, George, it's a very good question and it's part of the theory, the case that we have, but we don't know the answer to that yet, right? I mean, without a doubt, some calls happened at the quarter saying, \"Hey, are you ready to make a deeper discount to get a deal done?\" And the answer to that question is, no. And so for sure, there's some deals that probably could have happened this quarter that didn't because we're not prepared to go with those price levels. As I said earlier with Cai, you guys, we're not going to go back to list pricing, all right? I mean, but these are still attractive prices and we're certainly hopeful that those customers who want to upgrade, have a reason they want to upgrade to a new aircraft, will consider coming in and paying a reasonable price. But we're not going to go do that kind of aggressive discounting at the last moment to try to get a deal across the goal line. So whether that's actually happens in practice versus just theory remains to be seen. But certainly, there were some people that were looking for bigger discounts to try to make a deal happen. And again, that goes back to price levels that don't make sense for us. So I think, I hope we're at the point now where the number that we can put on the table for that customer is a very fair and reasonable number. And it's a number that they'll be comfortable with, and ultimately, will trade in or buy the aircraft.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So just, I guess, the first one is sort of the high-level assessment EBIT margin guidance for the year. Is the full year anticipated to be still better than breakeven now?","Scott C. Donnelly","That's certainly our objective. Again, it's going to be very volume-sensitive. But certainly our plan would be to get it above the breakeven line on the year.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then Bell aftermarket in the first quarter had the ERP issues and was down. What was it like in the second quarter? And can you give us some perspective on the military aftermarket, in particular?","Scott C. Donnelly","If you look at the total aftermarket, we were on what our original plan was for the quarter, okay. So the system, we have figured out how to operate with the new system. In some cases, with the system, around the system, sort of going through the usual things you go through on one of these big system implementations. But anyway, the operation is certainly back and while it's -- we have our share of challenges, we're able to deliver what we need to deliver. The only unfortunate part is, we did not eat into the miss that we had in the first quarter.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So what was the aftermarket sales in the quarter in terms of directionally up, down, how much?","Scott C. Donnelly","On a year-over-year basis, it was...","Frank T. Connor","It was up low-single digits.","Scott C. Donnelly","Yes, it was up, but up modestly on a year-over-year basis.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then last one, just confirming. So on the R&D expectation for the full year, I think, it was expected to be somewhere in the kind of $500 million, low $500 million range. That hasn't moved as a result of kind of the development timelines? Is that still the right place holder?","Scott C. Donnelly","Yes, these issues on certification really don't have much of an impact on the R&D front at this stage of the game. Most of the R&D's invested. It's simply a timing on going through the final certification. If you look at Cessna, a lot of the R&D now has moved into the Latitude program. And as Doug said earlier, the Bell, Bell's on track and relatively level load in terms of its R&D investments, kind of driven by the 525 and now the SLS and V-280.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And only one other one, another manufacturer had similar issues with delays in avionics caused the avionics suppliers to forward advances to the manufacturer. Is that something you're pursuing as a result of the delay in certification?","Scott C. Donnelly","No, it's not. Look, I think our supplier has been very genuine in their efforts to get this thing done. I think that there were some deals made with other customers because, frankly, they said, \"Look, we've got more on our plate than we can handle. And we're going to go focus on getting this deal done for Cessna,\" because we were kind of first in the queue. And so I think we are the guy, I believe, that's getting the top priority and getting the energy put into it. And look, in the grand scheme of things, I don't like having a certification date slip out, but this is a relatively mild, modest slip. And I do believe these guys are dedicating the resource and everything they can to keep it on track. So, no, at this point, we're not in a position to try to go look for any kind of damages. I think they're in good faith doing everything they can to get us going.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America.","Kristine T. Liwag - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Kristine Liwag calling in for Ron this morning. I guess my question comes from about Systems margins. So margins were down about 200 basis points this quarter even though revenue was up 8.5%. I just wondering if you can walk through maybe the factors that drove the margin contraction in this quarter?","Scott C. Donnelly","Well, I think the most significant element is that these fee-for-service contracts were basically booking at 0 profit, right? So we had taken a charge last year and basically did a total program or task order estimate to complete that took it from a loss contract and basically booked forward on a breakeven basis. And so obviously, there is dilution to our overall margin rates associated with that. So I think, if you looked at the margins in our other businesses, they're standing where we would expect them to be in the double-digit, above double-digit kind of margin rates, but we're seeing dilution from our UAS business principally.","Frank T. Connor","Yes, the other place we saw a little bit of margin impact there from a volume-mix standpoint is in our armored security vehicle, where we're doing more reset volume relative to production volume than we had in some previous quarters. And so we saw some additional ASV volume that was reset volume with lower mix rather than production.","Kristine T. Liwag - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And last week, I heard from Defense Secretary Hagel that sequestration could cut investment [ph] account by 15% to 20% in fiscal year '14, so starting October 1. This cut is larger than what we've heard before. So are you seeing any sort of customer behavior changes? Or do you see further downside risk to your defense outlook for the rest of the year, particularly in the second half?","Scott C. Donnelly","I'm sorry, for the rest of this year?","Kristine T. Liwag - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes. Because right -- fiscal year '14 would start on October 1.","Frank T. Connor","Yes. No, I don't think we would expect that. And for us, like it's principally driven by the fact that we have a multiyear deal around V-22s. So we know what those unit volumes look like. Our other big deals with Cessna or at Bell, rather, are around H-1 and the unit volumes on the production side of that have been stable. Obviously, our Armored Security Vehicle businesses, our precision munition businesses are virtually all international businesses at this point, so they really have no exposure. The area that we're probably the most sensitive, with respect to sequestration issues, is around our unmanned air vehicle business and some of our intelligence software and geospatial analysis intel businesses, which are funded more on a year-to-year basis. And so when they change budgeting, those things can be affected year-to-year. And we've seen some pressure in those businesses, but not something that I would say is material. And we certainly don't have any reason to believe there'd be any material change to this calendar year with respect to the sequestration, further sequestration discussions.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Steve Levenson with Stifel.","Stephen E. Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Can you give us an update on the timetable for the 525, please?","Scott C. Donnelly","Sure. 525 is progressing very nicely. We'll be flying that aircraft next year, which was our original plan in 2014. We're obviously in work with the FAA around certification dates. We have not announced a certification date yet for that aircraft. But I think we -- it's still our expectation that we'll be flying it next year. And we'll likely certify -- we haven't given a hard date to customers yet, but probably sometime out in 2015.","Stephen E. Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And last, what stage are you on partnering on the V-280? Or is it a little premature for that still?","Scott C. Donnelly","We have a number of partners that are part of the V-280 program. And to be honest, I don't know how much we've publicly announced. So I got to be careful here that I don't announce something we haven't announced. But we have several partners. It's a very -- it's not a structure like we had with Boeing on the V-22, right, where it's a Bell-Boeing function. But we have a number of very strong partners that will have portions of the V-280 product. And those discussions are, frankly, pretty mature at this point, but we just haven't publicly announced them yet.","Douglas R. Wilburne","All right, thank you, ladies and -- go ahead.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, and later, there will be an opportunity for question. And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Doug Wilburne.","Douglas R. Wilburne - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Justin, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release. On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO, and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.","Textron's revenues in the quarter were $3.2 billion, down $258 million from last year second quarter. Income from continuing operations was $0.60 per share, up from $0.51 in the second quarter of 2014. Textron Aviation operating results included a $6 million reduction to segment profit from fair value step-up adjustments to acquire Beechcraft inventories sold during the quarter. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions of $14 million was $106 million, compared to $270 million in last year's second quarter.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everybody. Revenues were up at Systems and Industrial, but down at Bell and Textron Aviation, which led to an overall 7.3% decrease in manufacturing revenues in the quarter. Manufacturing segment profit was approximately flat year-over-year, reflecting good margin results at Aviation Bell and Industrial despite the decline in revenue.","At Bell, the decline in revenues was primarily due to lower volume in our V-22 program, where we delivered six V-22s, down from 10 aircraft a year ago. We also delivered six H-1 aircraft, down from eight units from last year's second quarter, but still expect to deliver about 25 units for the full year.","On the commercial side, we delivered 39 aircraft, down from 46 a year ago. During the quarter, consistent with our previous announcement, we reduced our commercial production levels and took cost action. This should allow us to perform within our full-year segment margin guidance range despite a lower production rate and lower expected delivery volumes. Commercial helicopter markets remain challenging primarily in the medium segment, but Bell's win rate continues to improve, so we still expect that commercial deliveries will be up modestly for the year.","On the new product front, the 525 Relentless made its first flight on July 1, marking an important milestone and bringing this helicopter to market. Customer anticipation of this new platform remained strong as we received LOIs for an additional 30 525s during the quarter. There've also been a number of recent positive foreign military developments at Bell. In July, we received our first FMS order for V-22 (3:15) contract with Japan to deliver the first five of 17 expected total units. These five units represent options exercised under the existing U.S. multi-year contract and will be incremental to our V-22 delivery schedule in 2018. We expect a follow-on order for the remaining 12 units, which will be part of a future contract with the U.S. government.","Earlier this month, Bell was selected by Japan to team with Fuji Heavy Industries for Japan's UHX program to replace its aging fleet of Hueys. The program calls for delivery of 150 transport aircraft based on the militarized version of our 412EPI model with scheduled deliveries of over 20 years beginning in 2021. This agreement is a very positive development for supporting our 412 platform well into the future. We believe the growth outlook for the years remains strong, driven by our expanded global sales efforts, continuing commercial product upgrades, new products on the way and foreign military sales opportunities.","Moving to Systems. As expected, margins were down in the quarter, primarily driven by a change in product mix. At TMLS, we continue to make good progress on our Canadian TAPV program with final testing scheduled to begin next month, so we're still on track for initial deliveries in the fourth quarter.","At Unmanned Systems, our fee-for-service platforms are performing well and we've been awarded additional customer task orders based on this positive performance. At TRU Simulation + Training, we received certification and have begun customer pilot training in our new Tampa facility. Looking forward to Systems, we expect an improvement in segment revenues and margins during the second half of the year, reflecting a pickup in product delivery.","Moving to Industrial. We achieved a 3.7% increase in revenues after a 7.7% negative impact from foreign exchange, primarily reflecting increased volumes at Kautex, Specialized Vehicles and Jacobsen. However, industrial profit was down, reflecting a decrease in our Tools & Test business which experienced some market softness and delivery timing issues.","While foreign exchange had a particularly large impact on revenues at Kautex in the quarter, we had strong volumes in North America, Europe and Asia, reflecting continued growth in auto markets. At Tools & Test, we recently expanded our international tool business through a purchase of our partner's interest in our Endura-Greenlee joint venture, a professional tool company based in China producing over 3,000 products.","At Specialized Vehicles, we're seeing very strong market performance of our new airport Ground Support Equipment business, which was created through the acquisitions of TUG Technologies and Douglas Equipment businesses. On the new product front at Jacobsen, we began initial deliveries of our new Truckster HD (sic) [XD] (5:53) heavy-duty utility vehicle during the quarter.","Wrapping up with Textron Aviation, we delivered 36 jets and 30 King Airs compared to 36 jets and 34 King Airs last year. Margins of the Aviation segment improved significantly despite lower volumes, reflecting a lower fair value step-up adjustments and the benefit of cost efficiencies derived from last year's Beechcraft acquisition.","Our strategy of investing in new products continues to pay off as we received FAA certification of the Latitude in June and should begin deliveries next month. The Latitude enters service with a range of 2,850 nautical miles, up from its previously advertised range of 2,700 nautical miles, as well as best-in-class operating costs, which are up to 20% lower than competing aircraft.","We also firmed up NetJets' initial Latitude delivery schedule and will begin those deliveries in the first half of next year. Our upgraded (06:47-06:49) continues to do well and we received certifications from Brazil ANAC [Ag\u00eancia Nacional de Avia\u00e7\u00e3o Civil] which should open up new international opportunities for this model.","In May at EBACE [European Business Aviation Convention & Exhibition], we announced that our King Air turboprops will be equipped with the Rockwell Collins Pro Line Fusionavionics system and upgraded cabin features and have subsequently received FAA certification for the King Air 250. We also announced at EBACE that Wheels Up would be exercising an option to purchase an additional 35 350i King Airs under our existing contract.","At last week's Oshkosh AirVenture [EAA AirVenture Oshkosh] show, we announced our plan to develop a new single-engine turboprop. This plane has a clean sheet design with a target range of more than 1,500 nautical miles, a speed of greater than 280 knots and best-in-class operating costs. We're aiming at a segment of the market that we currently do not serve, so this product will nicely complement our existing aviation product lineup.","Moving to the Scorpion program, we had an active quarter demonstrating the aircraft's unique capabilities. For example, instructors and student pilots from the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School conducted evaluation flights of the Scorpion during a four-day event in May, where the airplane demonstrated its cost effectiveness, availability and reliability.","Internationally, the Scorp team made trips to South America for demo flights and then flew to Europe to participate in the Paris and RIAT [Royal International Air Tattoo] Air Shows. Between air shows, the Scorpion also flew demonstrations for multiple European militaries, including the UK Royal Navy and Air Force.","To sum up the quarter, good margin results at Textron Aviation, Bell and Industrial contribute to solid overall financial performance despite a decrease in overall revenues. We are confirming our full year guidance for both earnings and cash flow as we expect top line growth in each of our segments during the second half will drive strong earnings and cash flow.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank.","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Segment profit in the quarter was $306 million, up $2 million from the second quarter of 2014 on a $250 million (08:41) decrease in revenues.","Let's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation. Revenues were down $59 million from this period last year, primarily reflecting a change in the mix of jets delivered in the quarter. Aviation had a profit of $88 million compared to $28 million a year ago. This was driven by improved performance, reflecting a $27 million lower fair value step-up adjustment and the benefit of the integrated cost structure of Beechcraft and Cessna. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1.4 billion, $145 million higher than at the end of the first quarter.","Moving to Bell. Revenues were down $269 million, primarily reflecting lower aircraft deliveries and last year's $41 million impact from the settlement of the SDD phase of the ARH program. Segment profit decreased $40 million from the second quarter of 2014, primarily reflecting the lower deliveries and a $16 million favorable impact in 2014 related to the ARH program, partially offset by favorable performance.","With respect to our cost actions, we incurred approximately $40 million in severance costs during the quarter. The net impact on segment profit in the quarter was insignificant due to cost savings from head count reductions and the impact of including the allowable portion of these costs in our indirect cost rates for U.S. government contracts. Looking forward to the rest of the year, savings from the actions will help offset the P&L impact of lower production and deliveries, enabling us to maintain our original Bell margin guidance of 11% to 12%.","At Textron Systems, revenues were up $40 million, primarily due to higher Unmanned Systems and Marine & Land volumes, partially offset by lower Weapons & Sensor volumes. Segment profit was down $13 million, reflecting an unfavorable product mix during quarter.","Industrial revenues increased $33 million due to higher overall volumes, partially offset by a $69 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Segment profit decreased $8 million reflecting lower performance, partially offset by the impact of the higher volumes.","Finance segment revenues decreased $3 million and profit increased $3 million.","Moving below the segment profit line, last year's second quarter financials included an acquisition and restructuring line reflecting $20 million in costs related to the Beechcraft acquisition. Corporate expenses were $33 million and our tax rate was 29.9%. Interest expense was $32 million, down $4 million from the last year.","During the second quarter of 2015, we repurchased approximately 1.9 million of our shares at an overall cost of about $87 million.","To wrap up with guidance, we are confirming expected full year EPS from continuing operations of $2.30 to $2.50 per share and cash flow from continuing operation of the manufacturing group before pension contributions of $550 million to $650 million.","That concludes our prepared remarks. So, operator, we can open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I just wondered if you'd kick off with the texture that you're seeing in the business jet market as it relates to demands. Obviously, a pretty good step-up in backlog here in the quarter, if it's tied to the finalization of the NetJets schedule or if you can just give a broader color picture of the jet backdrop.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, certainly, a part of it is NetJets' miles. As we firmed up those schedules and delivery dates, we do move things into (12:25-12:26). But I would say in general, the North America market seems fairly strong. If you look around the world, I'd say Russia and China in the jet side are pretty weak, although from my perspective those have been largely big iron markets so that hasn't had a huge impact on. Unfortunately, things are still obviously very challenging in Latin America and Europe, both with respect to how those economies are doing as well as the very strong dollar. And so, that's certainly keeping some pressure in those areas, which are historically good markets for the light mid-size business jet.","So, it's a bit mixed around the world. I'd say that North America is really what's keeping us fairly strong with relative softness in Latin America and Europe.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, the aftermarket side, given that utilization seems reasonably tepid, is aftermarket slowing, is it stable modestly (13:24)?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's been a little tepid. I mean I think we had a pretty strong first quarter, certainly a weaker second quarter. But I would still expect on a full year basis, we're going to be in that kind of mid, low-single digit overall growth in terms of the aftermarket in the Aviation business.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thanks.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Sam J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning, Sam.","Sam J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Frank, when you had gone through it, you talked about still comfortable at 11% to 12% for the Bell margins. Just looking at the 7.6% margin here in Aviation the second quarter, are you still comfortable now? Does it now look like the high end or above the 6.5% to 7.5%? I guess if not, I'm just trying to think about what would be the negative if we look at the second half.","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's going to be volume-dependent. But as we said earlier in the year, I think if we see kind of the volumes that we've indicated we should be at the upper end of that margin (14:28) and have some opportunity there because we are seeing good productivity right across Textron Aviation.","Sam J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then certainly, a month or so ago Sikorsky talked a lot about the oil and gas market's impact on the aftermarket in Bell. Are you seeing anything from that front, where it's noticeable in the Bell aftermarket?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, for sure. I mean, the aftermarket, particularly in the oil and gas area, is certainly softer. Utilization rates are probably down somewhat (15:04) in that area. But I would say we have a fairly diverse installed base of aircraft operating in an awful lot of different industries. And so, I think net, all things together, we would still expect for us a fairly flat year in total aftermarket for the helicopter business.","Sam J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard of Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks so much. Good morning.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Scott, on the BizJet metrics, another thing you've talked about in the past is pricing in the used market and also the inventory there. And I was wondering, I know it's very short term, but how that's developed over the last three months.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the inventory metrics certainly continue to be favorable. We're down to both on a percent basis and an absolute number of aircraft out there that are available for sale at levels, really, that go back into the mid-2000s kind of number. So, I think the metrics in terms of what's available out there is pretty favorable.","Pricing has certainly stabilized. I mean you still on a year-over-year basis see depreciation obviously of any given model year, but the rate is kind of in historical norms, I guess, I'd say at this point. And we're actually seeing again some uptick on pricing on a model-by-model basis, particularly as that inventory gets fairly tight. So, I think the used market is becoming certainly less of a competitor than what we've seen over the last few years. So, that's, generally speaking, a pretty favorable trend that continues.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And the second question, maybe bigger picture, there seems to be pickup in M&A across the sector we see with Sikorsky. Also, in automotive and some defense, IT assets for sale. I was wondering if this has had any impact on your view of the world and your desire to do deals going forward.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Not really. Obviously, we keep an eye on all the segments we play in. And as assets come and go, we keep an eye on those things. But no, I don't think it's \u2013 we certainly haven't seen anything that would alter our strategy or how we think about things. We look at things that are in our spaces. We continue to be out there looking at things that we think are nice bolt-ons that will help strengthen our businesses. And, yeah, I think now we're in a period where an awful lot of assets are still pretty highly valued, and we're not going to overpay for anything but we do continue to keep our eye out.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, that's great. Thanks so much.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr of Cowen & Company.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes, thank you very much. So, Scott, getting back to the Aviation book-to-bill of 1.2 times, if we take out the NetJets orders what would it have been and could you give us some color by products, both between Cessna and Beech and specifically the Latitude?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, Cai, we're not going to start giving any kind of breakout on a model-by-model in terms of the backlog.","As I said, in terms of color I will say that obviously we did book some of the NetJets deals because they've now been firmed up and have delivery dates. I would say, Latitude, we continue to be very pleased with sort of the market receptivity. There's a lot of activity going on. There's a pretty extensive list of customers that have been looking at the aircraft, taking demo flights in the aircraft, and we expect that that will convert into ongoing backlog as we go forward. So, we feel great about the aircraft. It gets great feedback from customers and I think the model will do very well.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. And then, switching to Bell, that was an extraordinarily large severance charge of $40 million. Frank, how much of that $40 million was absorbed as an allowable expense in the quarter?","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Cai, again, we're not going to get into the details of kind of how that all flows through. Again, a meaningful portion of it kind of does flow through our rates just given the mix of our business at Bell and the nature of those costs. And kind of, again, as we said, when you look at the cost that were absorbed in the quarter relative to the savings generated and other impacts, kind of it did not have a meaningful impact. Obviously, on a go-forward basis, we will then kind of need to \u2013 those costs will flow through our cost structure but obviously we'll benefit from the savings associated with the cost reduction activities as well.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","But you did almost...","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It all gets very complicated in terms of how that all rolls through.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski of Drexel Hamilton.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Good morning, guys.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Scott, how should we think about the lack of an authorization at the Ex-Im Bank potentially impacting you in the second half of the year or in 2016? Is there any impact there at all?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","None.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","None at all? Okay.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, no.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","And then, I just want to ask \u2013 okay.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, I'm sorry, Pete. We don't have any Ex-Im facilities or (20:22) Ex-Im financing at this stage, so.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Okay. And then, just to confirm some of the things I think has been out there in the press, 525, we shouldn't factor in first deliveries until 2017, is that fair?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's correct, yeah.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Good morning. Inventories were up $200 million in the quarter and $500 million year-to-date. Is that reflecting a buildup for deliveries of Latitudes, a higher production rate in the second half of the year, or what actually is contributing to it?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, there's two big impacts there, George. Certainly, one is the Latitude buildup. So, those deliveries will start next month and through the balance of the year. But obviously, we've had a lot of work in progress and stuff progressing here into finished goods in the Latitude program.","And then the other, of course, is at Bell. So, we have slowed down the production rates, but, clearly, in the latter part of last year, coming into this year, just given the cycle time of production, a lot of those helicopters have already been built. So we had significant inventory build at Bell, which also should bleed off through the balance of the year.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay. And then my other question, if you could talk, Scott, increase in the backlog, if you could break, was it all jets, props or did military have a part? If you kind of just at least give some color as to where the increase came from.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, we're not going to break down independently, George. Look, we don't want to tell you -when we have a big military deal, obviously we announce that and we'll talk about that. There weren't any big announcements in the quarter, obviously, but we're going to \u2013 so we'll provide that level of color when there's a big military deal or something of that nature, but there were no such activities in this particular quarter.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay, thanks very much.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky of Citi.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Scott and Frank, I was just wondering if you could comment on the back half of the year with regard to your guidance and where the opportunities and risk might lie in your ability to hit your guidance rates.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, sure, Jason. Obviously, we have a lot that's going to happen here in the second half of the year. Aviation sort of has its normal cycle, which tends to be stronger in the back half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter, than it is in the first half of the year. We clearly think we're in a position to execute on that. Obviously, that requires the market to still be supporting ongoing orders. But we think we have a pretty good line of sight to the amount of activity that's going on. But as Frank alluded to earlier, still a lot of aircraft to sell, but feeling pretty good about where we are.","Similarly, at Bell, obviously the military side is well understood but there still are a certain level of order activity that has to happen to support our view of the second half at Bell.","Systems is primarily just executing on the programs that we have. Again, a clear line of sight in terms of what those deliveries need to be. Our Canadian TAPV program, obviously, is very important to us. So, I think the testing program has gone very well so far but we have to enter into the formal customer test here in the next month or so and successfully complete that so we can begin the initial deliveries on that program. But if we successfully work our way through the testing, then we should be able to meet those milestones.","So, I think, again, there's still a fair bit of selling to be done in both the fixed wing aviation and the helicopter business to make it happen, but we think we'll be able to get there.","In terms of upside, as again Frank alluded earlier, the Aviation business is executing extraordinarily well in both new product programs as well as manufacturing production efficiencies. And I think if we can deliver on the volumes that are in the plan, that's probably where we can have some upside to our guidance.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","That's great. And then, going back to Cai's question on book-to-bill at Aviation, would it have been above one without the NetJets order? And can you just, on the NetJets, just describe to us over what period of time those orders will be fulfilled? Thanks.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Predominantly, we firmed up what's going to happen in 2016 and some in the early part of 2017. So as we said, we're going to put those into backlog as we get, obviously, deposits as well as firm commitment dates. And, look, I'm sorry guys, but we're not going to provide any breakout or breakdown on a model-by-model in the backlog in any of the business. I mean, just not something that's normally done.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, thanks.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Noah.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Scott, are there any legacy Cessna jets, so not the Latitude, that are now sold out more than six months down the road?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I don't think we want to get into our \u2013 again, model-by-model sales forecasting, so I don't think we'll provide any guidance.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Or perhaps could you just touch on whether or not lead times on average in a legacy aircraft have extended or if it's roughly the same as where it was the last time you updated us?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's roughly where it's been, Noah. There hasn't been any dramatic change on the legacy aircraft front. How far out we are, it does vary model-by-model as we've said in the past. But I wouldn't get into specifics on a model-by-model basis for sure.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And then, just going back to the Aviation segment margin, I guess I'm wondering why you or how you won't end the year much higher than the current range. You're basically in the range in the first half. You're typically much better in the second than the first half. It looks like you had almost a 30% sequential incremental margin there if I strip out the inventory step-up. Perhaps, you could maybe touch on the driver of that performance.","Then, if I just kind of use 20% in the third and fourth quarter, I can get almost a full 200 basis points ahead of the mid-point of the guidance range there. So, is there a missing new component in the back half?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I don't think there's a big missing piece here, Myles (sic) [Noah] (27:28), in terms of your analysis. I think that if we can drive the volume in the second half of the year, that we'll see stronger margins. And that's why I commented earlier with one of the other questions, I think that we can exceed our guidance range on the Aviation side. But again, that is predicated on seeing the continued strength in the market, particularly North America, that we've seen, to help drive that volume. We're always going to have a little bit of a mix here with the military side versus the commercial side, and military deliveries we're continuing to perform under our JPAT contracts, so those will result in lower incremental margins. I mean, that's relatively lower margin mixes as we go forward compared to the incrementals on the commercial side. But again, I think the bigger issue here will be can we drive the volume in the second half of the year.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thanks very much.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, thank you. Just a question on capital allocation. You bought back some stock in Q2, hadn't bought back any in Q1. So, when we're thinking about a placeholder for this year, obviously absent any major M&A moves, should we assume a sort of $300 million to $400 million level like you spent last year as a good sort of placeholder?","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, again, our capital allocation has not changed. So, as we've said, we're going to buy back stock at least to offset the dilution associated with our share purchase programs. And I've indicated, we will pay down a little bit of bank debt associated with the Beechcraft acquisition this year. But kind of a number in that range, assuming that kind of there are not other applications of capital, is not an unreasonable range.","Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you. And then, my second question around the Bell commercial helicopter sort of delivery outlook. Was there any kind of change in tempo as you went through Q2 in terms of customer appetite for deliveries? And should we expect that delivery schedule in the second half to be fairly even or is it very kind of Q4 loaded on the commercial Bell? Thank you.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's probably going to be more Q4 loaded as it sort of typically is, Julian. I think the appetite, like a lot of our customers, particularly both oil and gas directly as well as a lot of the petrodollar-based economies, seem to be kind of getting their head around a stabilized lower dollar per barrel of oil. So, I think we're going through a normal cycle here. Things shut off pretty hard over the last 18 months, I would expect to sort of see some recovery as we go forward but it's going to be modest and at least there's a fair bit of customer activity discussions going on but it's going to be awhile probably for those things to come to fruition. But in terms of our particular guidance, we always end up with a higher mix, particularly in the 412s that are in the fourth quarter of the year versus the third quarter.","Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of David Strauss of UBS","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. Scott, on the Latitude and thinking about their ramp up there, obviously on the M2 you had a pretty aggressive ramp up, CJ4 a pretty aggressive ramp up. Are we looking at a similar kind of ramp up on the Latitude at those two aircraft?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, we are. I think from a production standpoint, it ramps fairly quickly. Obviously, we'll have our initial deliveries here in the third quarter, but again it will be heavier into the fourth quarter as that production ramp goes. But the production facilities, capabilities, tooling, everything is in place to meet what we believe is the expected demand, and I think we're going to be in pretty good shape on it. Our cost is where we expect it to be, so its margin rates should be consistent with what we see in our mid-size jet market today.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","And the NetJets' order, is that still 25 firm or have they exercised any of their options?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, I'm sorry, David, I don't recall the exact numbers. I thought the firm was a bigger number than that. But anyway, this is all the delivery commitments that we've moved into backlog obviously are under that initial firm order contract.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And a last one, Frank, the inventory step-up related to Beech, is that all now behind us?","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, there's a couple million dollars left but it's essentially done.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies.","Sheila K. Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Sheila K. Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Thanks for taking my question. Just you provided some very helpful color in terms of geographic color in business jets. Can you maybe provide an update on what you're seeing, buying behavior patterns from different end market customers?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, Sheila, I'd have to say that most of the -- I mean, if you look at our product mix, and when you think about M2s up through really the XLS space, we still continue to see the strength of that market around small, midsize businesses, a lot of family-owned stuff, a lot of owner operators, individuals of that sort. I'd say that particularly as we look at the Latitude, Latitude, when we look at that list of prospective customers, clearly, as they go into the fractional market, that's a pretty diverse group of everything from high-net individuals to corporates, but the Latitude whole aircraft sales are very heavily biased towards corporate buyers. So these are corporate flight departments. The attractiveness of that aircraft, the cabin size, the range and performance, while there's some high-net-worth and some smaller businesses, it is dominated by more corporate interest.","Sheila K. Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then just one more on Bell. In terms of the restructuring, do you have an update on what the cost savings is for this year and maybe what it looks like for next year?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'm not sure we would really break out specific numbers, Sheila. Obviously, the costs were virtually all incurred here in the second quarter. As Frank said, the nature of program accounting and the way that impacts the rates and flows through production, we kind of expect it to net out to not much of an impact here this year. What it means in terms of next year, obviously, we have savings associated with those actions. But, by design, that was intended to offset the fact that we expect to have lower production volumes as we go into next year.","So, from a margin rate perspective, we're not obviously going to guide to that yet. I mean, that's something we'll have to talk about for 2016. It will largely be dependent on what we think will happen in terms of volume at Bell for 2016 as to whether that's a tailwind or not.","Sheila K. Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Got it. Thanks.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein of Bank of America.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Hey, good morning, guys.","Unknown Speaker","Good morning. (35:33)","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I'm trying to not beat a dead horse here, but maybe get at it at a different angle. You guys said in the North American market it's good activity, it feels good. Can you give any more color around that, like, what that means, how much tire kicking is going on, how tire kicking is converting into orders, that kind of thing? Is there any way you can give us a better feel for, like, what good means?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think it is good if we can take more orders than we sell. Right? So, I mean, I think the backlog changes is something that I think is good for us regardless of where the end market is, but I think most of the color that we're trying to provide here is I think we look at the world right now as kind of an 80% North American market and a 20% international market. And that really is driven by the fact that the dollar is very strong. Latin American economies are very challenged. Europe is probably kind of going sideways. But the strong U.S. dollar makes big ticket capital items pretty expensive.","So, I mean, that's just kind of the way I would kind of look around the world. We feel pretty good about what's going on in North America. There's deals that are converting from opportunities into hard orders and sales are happening. So, we still need that to continue through the balance of the year to get to where we want to be. But when we look at the conversion of that activity into actual order book and we look at the kind of the level of activity that's going on in terms of prospect lists, we feel pretty good about it","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. And then maybe just one quick follow-on. You mentioned that you had a good productive quarter with Scorpion. You brought it to South America. How much closer are we to actually nailing down a deal on the Scorpion?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Oh, we have a number that are in the works. So, one of the challenges -- just a normal part of a process on any kind of a military customer deal is you also have to get to the final aircraft configuration. And so, while we've been thrilled with the performance of the aircraft and all the work that we've done, we have a couple of things that we're doing to the aircraft. We'll have a conforming version of the aircraft that's appropriate to go into certification testing in the first half of next year, and that's really the aircraft that customers will look at to make that final buying decision.","So there's a number of interests. There's a lot of demo flights coming on. There's places we've taken the aircraft. There's customers that have come to Wichita to fly the aircraft, to look at the aircraft. So there's a bunch of activity out there, but we need to get this thing to its final production configuration and get into cert tests, which is in the first half of next year.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. So, not to put you on the spot, but it will. Do you think we could see one before the end of the year, or is that a long shot?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, I don't think before the end of the year.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Okay. So maybe next year. All right, that's cool. Thank you so much.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research.","Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Jeff. Good morning.","Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hey. Just a couple of quick ones. Scott, just thinking about the Latitude launch, obviously, the mission and price and range and everything on the Sovereign, XLS are different, et cetera, but do you see some cannibalization around the edge as you launch that? And how would you characterize it? Do you think of Latitude being 80% incremental to your volume or some other number? And I guess, regardless of whether or not you think there's any cannibalization as it launches, is the launch mix negative to you once you kind of get the initial units out the door?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Jeff, so I think 80\/20 might be the right number. I mean, we always have customers that are looking at more than one model and trying to decide how to match their mission, be it range, payload, et cetera, and how they decide which of our products. I would say that there's a pretty significant price difference between an XLS+ and a Latitude. So, I wouldn't say there's zero in there, but when people are looking at those two aircraft, it is a pretty significant price difference, it's a big range difference, it's a big cabin difference. So, I think those two are very different aircraft.","I think we do have some customers that will look at a Latitude and a Sovereign. And in that case, they kind of have to make the decision based on a Sovereign has some additional range and some additional seating capacity, and that's really what then drives that decision between a Sovereign versus a Latitude. From our perspective, from a production, manufacturing operation, it really is kind of a wash. So, we're able to kind of work with the customer and say which aircraft best fits what you need, and they pick the aircraft that makes sense, that there's no reason for us to have a reason to bias it one way or the other.","Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great. Thanks. And then just back on M&A, somebody asked earlier, but it does certainly sound or look like you were deep in the hunt on Sikorsky. Should we think of that as just being obviously an iconic asset that may be for sale once every 70 years and, of course, you're going to have to look at something that? Or are you actually more actively looking at things and cultivating as opposed to maybe just waiting for things to kind of come across the transom?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I guess, I won't comment \u2013 I can't, shouldn't probably comment too much on the Sikorsky deal. There's certainly been plenty of media coverage on that. And the media is the media. So, I think what we would say is we always keep an eye out for assets that are in our spaces. We are always looking and sort of thinking about things that would make sense for us or would not make sense for us, and that's the path we'll stay on.","Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman of JPMorgan.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much and good morning. I just wanted to ask about the exposure to China at Kautex, and if you see any slowing there or are concerned about any slowing?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We really haven't. Obviously, Kautex has a number of plants in China in the automotive segment. So if there was any kind of material change in auto demand, that would have an impact on us. But again, Kautex is a big auto business. We've got plants all over the world, and it's not unusual for us to go through cycles where one region is doing better than the other. So, certainly, there's some exposure there to the Chinese automotive market, but it's not something I would be losing a whole lot of sleep over, I guess, at this point.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. And then just to follow up, I guess, looking at Industrial, it seems like you're very much on track to meet the guidance for the year. As you look to the second half, what are kind of the key trends in each of the three areas that gets you there?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think in the Industrial segment, again, we generally saw pretty broad growth in all of the businesses. The only business that was a little soft for us was the Tools & Test business. That had to do with a couple industries that were a little soft in the quarter. We have expected some deals that we thought would close that didn't close, some of which I actually now closed as we moved into the third quarter. So I would say those are mostly just timing related.","We have obviously seen some softness in the energy market, so we had an awful lot of strength over the last couple of years in the Marcellus, in the Balkans, (43:39) and places like that which have clearly slowed down. So, while there's some macro impact, we believe we'd still see ongoing softness. There were some other areas that I would say were more timing related and we would expect to still be clearly on track to hit our guidance around the Industrial segment.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","The next question comes from Johnny Wright of Nomura.","Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just on Systems, I know you've talked much about the margins there. Maybe can you just flesh out the mix impact you saw in 2Q and how you see that rolling over the second half of the year?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I guess, two of the main things is that, clearly, the vehicle deliveries are very back-end-loaded because of the process of going through all of our testing and completing that program and starting deliveries on our TAPV program, which will be a Q4 event. Otherwise, we've had no deliveries on that program as we wait to get through the test program. So that's been an overall drag.","The other is that we have had an awful lot of investment here in the first half of the year around our Simulation business. We've opened a brand-new training center. We've done a lot of simulator design development production work for our own use, including things like the V-280 to demonstrate the performance and capability of that product for sort of for use in customer sales and marketing efforts. And we need that business to swing to a more profitable phase here in the back half of the year.","So that's been dragging somewhat on our Systems segment margins as well. But the bottom line is, we have a lot more product delivery here in the back half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter than we've had in the first half, which is what we expected, frankly.","Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Sure. And then you brought up the V-280. Does Lockheed's acquisition of Sikorsky have any impact on that program given they're going to be on both sides of the competition now? And how do you think about that conflict?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it certainly doesn't have an immediate impact. We've had Lockheed as one of our teammates on that program. They're doing all the cockpit and mission systems for the aircraft. They've done a great job for us in terms of performing on that design development activity, and we expect that it will stay that way to support heading towards first flight here in 2017. The program's going great, so there's no reason, from our perspective, to see any change in that program on FVL at this time.","Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","All right, guys, thank you.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Justin Bergner of Gabelli & Company.","Justin Laurence Bergner - Gabelli & Company","Good morning, everyone.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning.","Justin Laurence Bergner - Gabelli & Company","My first question relates to the pace of corporate expenses. They were down nicely in the first half of the year, $75 million versus $81 million. Could you maybe talk about some of the puts and takes there and how we should think about corporate expenses on a quarterly or annual run rate basis going forward?","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, there is always some volatility in the corporate expense line around both timing of spend and just then the accounting for incentive-based compensation that is impacted by the share price. So, we do get quarterly volatility. Obviously, we're watching our overall controllable expenses very carefully, but there's no change in our expectations around full-year corporate expense coming in around the $170 million, $175 million level.","Justin Laurence Bergner - Gabelli & Company","Okay, thank you. One more, if I may. With respect to Lockheed Martin's pending acquisition of Sikorsky, it might be helpful if you were able to comment a bit about some of the opportunities and risks associated with having Sikorsky owned by a new company, being Lockheed Martin, versus United Technologies.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't think it changes our perspective of Sikorsky, whether their parent company is UTX or their parent company is Lockheed Martin. The dynamic in terms of competition in the marketplace for us is largely unchanged.","Justin Laurence Bergner - Gabelli & Company","Okay. And the Future Vertical Lift program dynamics, will that get sort of sorted out in due time?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think so. Look, as I said earlier, Lockheed has been a great teammate for us on the V-280 program. We're all very focused on getting that aircraft to first flight and executing our commitments with our customer around that program. And then the dynamics of where that program goes from there is very much to be determined. And really not so much having to do with where the Sikorsky ownership is or where Lockheed is, but where does the customer go from there. Still, that program will have to go through this initial demonstrator phase, and then the program will morph, as all programs do, in terms of how it goes into the next steps.","So I don't think, at this point, that's driven one way or the other by where Sikorsky or Lockheed are, but where does the customer want to go. But at least what's critical to us is that where we are today and how we execute and complete the tech demonstrator phase program and, importantly, getting into first flight in 2017 is unchanged by who that particular division is owned by and where Sikorsky is.","Justin Laurence Bergner - Gabelli & Company","Great. Thank you for taking my questions.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Steve Levenson of Stifel.","Stephen E. Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. On the V-22s for Japan, can you tell us please, since that's an option exercise, does the pricing change at all? Or is it the same as the ones within the multiyear agreement now?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The program when the multiyear 2 contract was negotiated, the provisions for options were laid into that contract. So everything in terms of how it's priced was already all negotiated up-front with the customer.","Stephen E. Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And on the single-engine turboprop, can you give us an idea how big you think the market is and will it change the research and development spending expectations?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, from an R&D perspective, it's baked into our long-range plan in terms of the Aviation business in total. In terms of the size of that market segment, I'm sorry, I don't have all those charts in front of me at the moment, but, I mean, you're really talking about the market today which is largely dominated by the TBM and PC-12 product lines.","Stephen E. Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, thanks very much.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","And we have another question from the line of George Shapiro of Shapiro Research.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Yes. In the Systems margin, Frank, I mean, that was the weakest margin in about three years. So were there any charges in there or was it really just all the performance mix?","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, it's really \u2013 as Scott had indicated earlier, George, it was really all kind of performance mix, a low volume core and some pretty significant spend at TRU, where, as we said, there's been a lot of focus on both standing up the training operations as well as other internal investment essentially that kind of doesn't get revenue recognition. So as we produce simulators for ourselves as we support the V-280 program from TRU and things like that, kind of we incur cost and effort but don't see revenue and profit flow from that.","So that's why we had the impact that we had. Again, kind of in terms of full year, things are back-end-loaded. We do expect a recovery in margins to be kind of in line with the guidance that we've given for the full year on Systems.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay. And one other on it. Pre-owned, how did that compare year-over-year and sequentially in the quarter?","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It had an insignificant impact on a year-over-year basis, George.","Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Very close to zero.","George D.
